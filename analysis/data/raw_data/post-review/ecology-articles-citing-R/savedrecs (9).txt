Wolbachia infection can bias estimates of intralocus sexual conflict	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Drosophila simulans; intralocus sexual conflict; sexual antagonism; Wolbachia	CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; GENETIC CORRELATION; LIFE-SPAN; DECORATED CRICKET; RAPID EVOLUTION; FRUIT-FLY; DROSOPHILA; SELECTION; FITNESS	Males and females share most of their genome and develop many of the same traits. However, each sex frequently has different optimal values for these shared traits, creating intralocus sexual conflict. This conflict has been observed in wild and laboratory populations of insects and affects important evolutionary processes such as sexual selection, the maintenance of genetic variation, and possibly even speciation. Given the broad impacts of intralocus conflict, accurately detecting and measuring it is important. A common way to detect intralocus sexual conflict is to calculate the intersexual genetic correlation for fitness, with negative values suggesting conflict. Here, we highlight a potential confounder of this measure-cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by the intracellular parasite Wolbachia. Infection with Wolbachia can generate negative intersexual genetic correlations for fitness in insects, suggestive of intralocus sexual conflict. This is because cytoplasmic incompatibility reduces the fitness of uninfected females mated to infected males, while uninfected males will not suffer reductions in fitness if they mate with infected females and may even be fitter than infected males. This can lead to strong negative intersexual genetic correlations for fitness, mimicking intralocus conflict. We illustrate this issue using simulations and then present Drosophila simulans data that show how reproductive incompatibilities caused by Wolbachia infection can generate signals of intralocus sexual conflict. Given that Wolbachia infection in insect populations is pervasive, but populations usually contain both infected and uninfected individuals providing scope for cytoplasmic incompatibility, this is an important consideration for sexual conflict research but one which, to date, has been largely underappreciated.

The early-life environment and individual plasticity in life-history traits	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						burying beetles; developmental plasticity; early-life effects; environment matching; informational model; life-history trade-offs; phoretic mites; silver spoon; somatic model	PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; INVESTMENT; SIZE; REPRODUCTION; COLEOPTERA; EVOLUTION; GENETICS; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY; MODELS	We tested whether the early-life environment can influence the extent of individual plasticity in a life-history trait. We asked: can the early-life environment explain why, in response to the same adult environmental cue, some individuals invest more than others in current reproduction? Moreover, can it additionally explain why investment in current reproduction trades off against survival in some individuals, but is positively correlated with survival in others? We addressed these questions using the burying beetle, which breeds on small carcasses and sometimes carries phoretic mites. These mites breed alongside the beetle, on the same resource, and are a key component of the beetle's early-life environment. We exposed female beetles to mites twice during their lives: during their development as larvae and again as adults during their first reproductive event. We measured investment in current reproduction by quantifying average larval mass and recorded the female's life span after breeding to quantify survival. We found no effect of either developing or breeding alongside mites on female reproductive investment, nor on her life span, nor did developing alongside mites influence her size. In post hoc analyses, where we considered the effect of mite number (rather than their mere presence/absence) during the female's adult breeding event, we found that females invested more in current reproduction when exposed to greater mite densities during reproduction, but only if they had been exposed to mites during development as well. Otherwise, they invested less in larvae at greater mite densities. Furthermore, females that had developed with mites exhibited a trade-off between investment in current reproduction and future survival, whereas these traits were positively correlated in females that had developed without mites. The early-life environment thus generates individual variation in life-history plasticity. We discuss whether this is because mites influence the resources available to developing young or serve as important environmental cues.

Bayesian approaches in particular offer tremendous flexibility for SCR modeling. Increasingly, SCR data are being collected over very large spatial extents making analysis computational intensive, sometimes prohibitively so. To mitigate the computational burden of large-scale SCR models, we developed an improved formulation of the Bayesian SCR model that uses local evaluation of the individual state-space (LESS). Based on prior knowledge about a species' home range size, we created square evaluation windows that restrict the spatial domain in which an individual's detection probability (detector window) and activity center location (AC window) are estimated. We used simulations and empirical data analyses to assess the performance and bias of SCR with LESS. LESS produced unbiased estimates of SCR parameters when the AC window width was >= 5 sigma (sigma: the scale parameter of the half-normal detection function), and when the detector window extended beyond the edge of the AC window by 2 sigma. Importantly, LESS considerably decreased the computation time needed for fitting SCR models. In our simulations, LESS increased the computation speed of SCR models up to 57-fold. We demonstrate the power of this new approach by mapping the density of an elusive large carnivore-the wolverine (Gulo gulo)-with an unprecedented resolution and across the species' entire range in Norway (> 200,000 km(2)). Our approach helps overcome a major computational obstacle to population and landscape-level SCR analyses. The LESS implementation in a Bayesian framework makes the customization and fitting of SCR accessible for practitioners working at scales that are relevant for conservation and management.

Standing geographic variation in eclosion time and the genomics of host race formation in Rhagoletis pomonella fruit flies	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						clinal variation; eclosion time; ecological speciation; host races; standing variation	APPLE MAGGOT FLY; PHOTOPERIODIC DIAPAUSE INDUCTION; FIRE-BELLIED TOADS; LOCAL ADAPTATION; HYBRID ZONES; DIFFERENTIAL INTROGRESSION; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; LATITUDINAL CLINE	Taxa harboring high levels of standing variation may be more likely to adapt to rapid environmental shifts and experience ecological speciation. Here, we characterize geographic and host-related differentiation for 10,241 single nucleotide polymorphisms in Rhagoletis pomonella fruit flies to infer whether standing genetic variation in adult eclosion time in the ancestral hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)-infesting host race, as opposed to new mutations, contributed substantially to its recent shift to earlier fruiting apple (Malus domestica). Allele frequency differences associated with early vs. late eclosion time within each host race were significantly related to geographic genetic variation and host race differentiation across four sites, arrayed from north to south along a 430-km transect, where the host races co-occur in sympatry in the Midwest United States. Host fruiting phenology is clinal, with both apple and hawthorn trees fruiting earlier in the North and later in the South. Thus, we expected alleles associated with earlier eclosion to be at higher frequencies in northern populations. This pattern was observed in the hawthorn race across all four populations; however, allele frequency patterns in the apple race were more complex. Despite the generally earlier eclosion timing of apple flies and corresponding apple fruiting phenology, alleles on chromosomes 2 and 3 associated with earlier emergence were paradoxically at lower frequency in the apple than hawthorn host race across all four sympatric sites. However, loci on chromosome 1 did show higher frequencies of early eclosion-associated alleles in the apple than hawthorn host race at the two southern sites, potentially accounting for their earlier eclosion phenotype. Thus, although extensive clinal genetic variation in the ancestral hawthorn race exists and contributed to the host shift to apple, further study is needed to resolve details of how this standing variation was selected to generate earlier eclosing apple fly populations in the North.

Here, we used acoustic telemetry to investigate the spatial behavior of anadromous brown trout (sea trout, Salmo trutta) in relation to a small marine reserve (similar to 1.5 km(2)) located inside a fjord on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. On average, sea trout spent 42.3 % (+/- 5.0% SE) of their time in the fjord within the reserve, a proportion similar to the area of the reserve relative to that of the fjord. On average, sea trout tagged inside the reserve received the most protection, although the level of protection decreased marginally with increasing home range size. Furthermore, individuals tagged outside the reserve received more protection with increasing home range size, potentially opposing selection toward smaller home range sizes inflicted on fish residing within reserves, or through selective fishing methods like angling. Monthly sea trout home ranges in the marine environment were on average smaller than the reserve, with a mean of 0.430 (+/- 0.0265 SE) km(2). Hence, the reserve is large enough to protect the full home range of some individuals residing in the reserve. Synthesis and applications: In general, the reserve protects sea trout to a varying degree depending on their individual behavior. These findings highlight evolutionary implications of spatial protection and can guide managers in the design of marine reserves and networks that preserve variation in target species' home range size and movement behavior.

The landscape representation in landscape genetics (LG) is traditionally modeled as resistance surfaces (RS), where novel optimization approaches are needed for assigning resistance values that adequately avoid subjectivity. Also, desert ecosystems and mammals are scarcely represented in LG studies. We addressed these issues by evaluating, at a microgeographic scale, the effect of landscape features on functional connectivity of the desert-dwelling Dipodomys merriami. We characterized genetic diversity and structure with microsatellites loci, estimated home ranges and movement of individuals using telemetry-one of the first with rodents, generated a set of individual and composite environmental surfaces based on hypotheses of variables influencing movement, and assessed how these variables relate to individual-based gene flow. Genetic diversity and structure results evidenced a family-induced pattern driven by first-order-related individuals, notably determining landscape genetic inferences. The vegetation cover and soil resistance optimized surface (NDVI) were the best-supported model and a significant predictor of individual genetic distance, followed by humidity and NDVI+humidity. Based on an accurate definition of thematic resolution, we also showed that vegetation is better represented as continuously (vs. categorically) distributed. Hence, with a nonsubjective optimization framework for RS and telemetry, we were able to describe that vegetation cover, soil texture, and climatic variables influence D. merriami's functional connectivity at a microgeographic scale, patterns we could further explain based on the home range, habitat use, and activity observed between sexes. We describe the relationship between environmental features and some aspects of D. merriami's behavior and physiology.

This conflict may lead to a variety of sex-specific adaptations and also affect mate choice in both sexes. We conducted an experiment with the bush-cricket Pholidoptera griseoaptera (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae), a species in which females receive direct nutritional benefits during mating. Mated individuals could be assigned due to the genotype of male spermatodoses, which are stored in the female's spermatheca. After 3 weeks of possible copulations in established mating groups which were random replications with four females and males we did not find consistent assortative mating preference regarding to body size of mates. However, our results showed that the frequency of within-pair copulations (192 analyzed mating events in 128 possible pairwise combinations) was positively associated with the body size of both mated individuals with significant interaction between sexes (having one mate very large, association between body size and the number of copulations has weaken). Larger individuals also showed a higher degree of polygamy. This suggests that body size of this nuptial gift-giving insect species is an important sexual trait according to which both sexes choose their optimal mating partner.

Our objective was to investigate connectivity among black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) populations in tandem with a demographic study (Biological Conservation, 2016, 203, 108-118) to elucidate if central Texas populations act as a source-sink system. We genotyped 343 individuals at 12 microsatellite loci to elucidate the movement ecology of the black-capped vireo in central Texas surrounding Fort Hood; the largest and most stable breeding population of black-capped vireos inhabit Fort Hood. To gain insight into gene flow among populations, we analyzed genetic differentiation, migration rates, number of migrants, and parentage. We found statistically significant, but low levels of genetic differentiation among several populations, suggesting some limited restriction to gene flow. Across approaches to estimate migration, we found consistent evidence for asymmetrical movement from Fort Hood to the other central Texas sites consistent with source-sink dynamics. Our results are complementary to black-capped vireo demographic studies done in tandem showing that portions of Fort Hood are acting as a source population to smaller central Texas populations.

Tropical birds live in more benign environments with lower extrinsic mortality and higher juvenile and adult survival than temperate birds. Therefore, telomere biology may play a more important role in tropical compared to temperate birds. We measured mean telomere length of male stonechats (Saxicola spp.) at four age classes from tropical African and temperate European breeding regions. Tropical and temperate stonechats had similarly long telomeres as nestlings. However, while in tropical stonechats pre-breeding first-years had longer telomeres than nestlings, in temperate stonechats pre-breeding first-years had shorter telomeres than nestlings. During their first breeding season, telomere length was again similar between tropical and temperate stonechats. These patterns may indicate differential survival of high-quality juveniles in tropical environments. Alternatively, more favorable environmental conditions, that is, extended parental care, may enable tropical juveniles to minimize telomere shortening. As suggested by previous studies, our results imply that variation in life history and life span may be reflected in different patterns of telomere shortening rather than telomere length. Our data provide first evidence that distinct selective pressures in tropical and temperate environments may be reflected in diverging patterns of telomere loss in birds.

However, to date, no studies have investigated the variations in the diversity of traits (FD) linked with the role of these fishes in the ecosystem. FD is usually considered more sensitive than species richness in detecting early changes in response to disturbances, and therefore could serve as an indicator of ecological resilience to environmental changes. Here, we aim to characterize FD in the Taiwanese reef fish fauna and to document its regional variations. Six traits were used to categorize the 1,484 reef fish species occurring in four environmentally contrasted regions around Taiwan. The number of unique trait combinations (FEs), their richness (FRic), their redundancy (FR), their over-redundancy (FOR), and their vulnerability (FV) were compared among these regions. Overall, 416 FEs were identified. Their number decreased from south to north in step with regional species richness but FRic remained similar among regions. FR and FOR were higher to the south. At the local scale, variations in FEs and FRic are in concordance with the worldwide pattern of FD. High-latitude, impoverished fish assemblages, offer a range of trait combinations similar to diversified tropical assemblages. Increasing diversity in the latter mainly contributes to raising FR and supports already over-redundant entities. High vulnerability makes many combinations highly sensitive to species loss, and was higher at intermediate latitudes when using a fine resolution in trait categories. It suggests that the loss of FEs may first be characterized by an increase in their vulnerability, a pattern that could have been overlooked in previous global scale analyses. Overall, this study provides new insights into reef fish trait biogeography with potential ramifications for ecosystem functioning.

Reliable estimates of survival probabilities are key to population viability assessments, and patterns of variation in survival can help inferring the causal factors behind detected changes in population size. We investigated whether variation in age- and sex-specific survival probabilities could help explain the increasing trend in population size detected in a small, discrete population of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus off the east coast of Scotland. To estimate annual survival probabilities, we applied capture-recapture models to photoidentification data collected from 1989 to 2015. We used robust design models accounting for temporary emigration to estimate juvenile and adult survival, multistate models to estimate sex-specific survival, and age models to estimate calf survival. We found strong support for an increase in juvenile/adult annual survival from 93.1% to 96.0% over the study period, most likely caused by a change in juvenile survival. Examination of sex-specific variation showed weaker support for this trend being a result of increasing female survival, which was overall higher than for males and animals of unknown sex. Calf survival was lower in the first than second year; a bias in estimating third-year survival will likely exist in similar studies. There was some support first-born calf survival being lower than for calves born subsequently. Coastal marine mammal populations are subject to the impacts of environmental change, increasing anthropogenic disturbance and the effects of management measures. Survival estimates are essential to improve our understanding of population dynamics and help predict how future pressures may impact populations, but obtaining robust information on the life history of long-lived species is challenging. Our study illustrates how knowledge of survival can be increased by applying a robust analytical framework to photoidentification data.

Recent experiments show that some forest insectivorous birds can use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to locate herbivore-infested trees, but it is unclear how birds combine or prioritize visual and olfactory information when making foraging decisions. Here, we investigated attraction of ground-foraging birds to HIPVs and visible prey in short vegetation on farmland in a series of foraging choice experiments. Birds showed an initial preference for HIPVs when visual information was the same for all choice options (i.e., one experimental setup had all options with visible prey, another setup with hidden prey). However, if the alternatives within an experimental setup included visible prey (without HIPV) in competition with HIPV-only, then birds preferred the visual option over HIPVs. Our results show that olfactory cues can play an important role in birds' foraging choices when visual information contains little variation; however, visual cues are preferred when variation is present. This suggests certain aspects of bird foraging decisions in agricultural habitats are mediated by olfactory interaction mechanisms between birds and plants. We also found that birds from variety of dietary food guilds were attracted to HIPVs; hence, the ability of birds to use plant cues is probably more general than previously thought, and may influence the biological pest control potential of birds on farmland.

We tested whether synchrony between two critical phenological events, budburst of host species and larval emergence from diapause of eastern spruce budworm, increased at warmer temperatures in the boreal forest in northeastern Canada. Budburst was up to 4.6 +/- 0.7 days earlier in balsam fir and up to 2.8 +/- 0.8 days earlier in black spruce per degree increase in temperature, in naturally occurring microclimates. Larval emergence from diapause did not exhibit a similar response. Instead, larvae emerged once average ambient temperatures reached 10 degrees C, regardless of differences in microclimate. Phenological synchrony increased with warmer microclimates, tightening the relationship between spruce budworm and its host species. Synchrony increased by up to 4.5 +/- 0.7 days for balsam fir and up to 2.8 +/- 0.8 days for black spruce per degree increase in temperature. Under a warmer climate, defoliation could potentially begin earlier in the season, in which case, damage on the primary host, balsam fir may increase. Black spruce, which escapes severe herbivory because of a 2-week delay in budburst, would become more suitable as a resource for the spruce budworm. The northern boreal forest could become more vulnerable to outbreaks in the future.

Pollinator-mediated interactions between cultivated papaya and co-flowering plant species	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						crop pollination; facilitation; pollination; pollinator-mediated interactions; post-pollination events	HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN RECEIPT; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BEE POLLINATORS; OILSEED RAPE; FOREST EDGE; DISTANCE; VISITATION; PROXIMITY; GRADIENTS; QUANTITY	Many modern crop varieties rely on animal pollination to set fruit and seeds. Intensive crop plantations usually do not provide suitable habitats for pollinators so crop yield may depend on the surrounding vegetation to maintain pollination services. However, little is known about the effect of pollinator-mediated interactions among co-flowering plants on crop yield or the underlying mechanisms. Plant reproductive success is complex, involving several pre- and post-pollination events; however, the current literature has mainly focused on pre-pollination events in natural plant communities. We assessed pollinator sharing and the contribution to pollinator diet in a community of wild and cultivated plants that co-flower with a focal papaya plantation. In addition, we assessed heterospecific pollen transfer to the stigmatic loads of papaya and its effect on fruit and seed production. We found that papaya shared at least one pollinator species with the majority of the co-flowering plants. Despite this, heterospecific pollen transfer in cultivated papaya was low in open-pollinated flowers. Hand-pollination experiments suggest that heterospecific pollen transfer has no negative effect on fruit production or weight, but does reduce seed production. These results suggest that co-flowering plants offer valuable floral resources to pollinators that are shared with cultivated papaya with little or no cost in terms of heterospecific pollen transfer. Although HP reduced seed production, a reduced number of seeds per se are not negative, given that from an agronomic perspective the number of seeds does not affect the monetary value of the papaya fruit.

These changes include conversion of native grasslands for row-crop agriculture as well as degradation of remaining rangeland due to fragmentation and changing disturbance regimes. Understanding how these and other factors influence wildlife use of rangelands is important for conservation and management of wildlife populations. We investigated bat habitat associations in a working rangeland in southeastern North Dakota. We used Petterson d500x acoustic detectors to systematically sample bat activity across the study area on a 1-km point grid. We identified calls using Sonobat autoclassification software. We detected five species using this working rangeland, which included Lasionycteris noctivagans (2,722 detections), Lasiurus cinereus (2,055 detections), Eptesicus fuscus (749 detections), Lasiurus borealis (62 detections), and Myotis lucifugus (1 detection). We developed generalized linear mixed-effects models for the four most frequently detected species based on their ecology. The activity of three bat species increased with higher tree cover. While the scale of selection varied between the four species, all three investigated scales were explanatory for at least one bat species. The broad importance of trees to bats in rangelands may put their conservation needs at odds with those of obligate grassland species. Focusing rangeland bat conservation on areas that were treed prior to European settlement, such as riparian forests, can provide important areas for bat conservation while minimizing negative impacts on grassland species.

In farmed landscapes, mass-flowering crops can provide an important forage resource for bumblebees, with increased visitation from bumblebees into mass-flowering crops having an additional benefit to growers who require pollination services. This study explores the mutualistic relationship between Bombus terrestris L. (buff-tailed bumblebee), a common species in European farmland, and the mass-flowering crop courgette (Cucurbita pepo L.) to see how effective B. terrestris is at pollinating courgette and in return how courgette may affect B. terrestris colony dynamics. By combining empirical data on nectar and pollen availability with model simulations using the novel bumblebee model Bumble-BEEHAVE, we were able to quantify and simulate for the first time, the importance of courgette as a mass-flowering forage resource for bumblebees. Courgette provides vast quantities of nectar to ensure a high visitation rate, which combined with abundant pollen grains, enables B. terrestris to have a high pollination potential. While B. terrestris showed a strong fidelity to courgette flowers for nectar, courgette pollen was not found in any pollen loads from returning foragers. Nonetheless, model simulations showed that early season courgette (nectar) increased the number of hibernating queens, colonies, and adult workers in the modeled landscapes. Synthesis and applications. Courgette has the potential to improve bumblebee population dynamics; however, the lack of evidence of the bees collecting courgette pollen in this study suggests that bees can only benefit from this transient nectar source if alternative floral resources, particularly pollen, are also available to fulfill bees' nutritional requirements in space and time. Therefore, providing additional forage resources could simultaneously improve pollination services and bumblebee populations.

Behavioral classification of low-frequency acceleration and temperature data from a free-ranging small mammal	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						accelerometer; behavioral classification; decision tree; methods; nest; random forest; red squirrel	DYNAMIC BODY ACCELERATION; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; RED SQUIRRELS; TIME BUDGET; ACCELEROMETERS; ENERGETICS; ANIMALS	The miniaturization and affordability of new technology is driving a biologging revolution in wildlife ecology with use of animal-borne data logging devices. Among many new biologging technologies, accelerometers are emerging as key tools for continuously recording animal behavior. Yet a critical, but under-acknowledged consideration in biologging is the trade-off between sampling rate and sampling duration, created by battery- (or memory-) related sampling constraints. This is especially acute among small animals, causing most researchers to sample at high rates for very limited durations. Here, we show that high accuracy in behavioral classification is achievable when pairing low-frequency acceleration recordings with temperature. We conducted 84 hr of direct behavioral observations on 67 free-ranging red squirrels (200-300 g) that were fitted with accelerometers (2 g) recording tri-axial acceleration and temperature at 1 Hz. We then used a random forest algorithm and a manually created decision tree, with variable sampling window lengths, to associate observed behavior with logger recorded acceleration and temperature. Finally, we assessed the accuracy of these different classifications using an additional 60 hr of behavioral observations, not used in the initial classification. The accuracy of the manually created decision tree classification using observational data varied from 70.6% to 91.6% depending on the complexity of the tree, with increasing accuracy as complexity decreased. Short duration behavior like running had lower accuracy than long-duration behavior like feeding. The random forest algorithm offered similarly high overall accuracy, but the manual decision tree afforded the flexibility to create a hierarchical tree, and to adjust sampling window length for behavioral states with varying durations. Low frequency biologging of acceleration and temperature allows accurate behavioral classification of small animals over multi-month sampling durations. Nevertheless, low sampling rates impose several important limitations, especially related to assessing the classification accuracy of short duration behavior.

Knowing the actual structure of food webs contributes greatly to our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The research of prey preferences of different predators requires knowledge not only of the prey consumed, but also of what is available. In this study, we applied DNA metabarcoding to analyze the diet of 4 bird species (willow tits Poecile montanus, Siberian tits Poecile cinctus, great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus) by using the feces of nestlings. The availability of their assumed prey (Lepidoptera) was determined from feces of larvae (frass) collected from the main foraging habitat, birch (Betula spp.) canopy. We identified 53 prey species from the nestling feces, of which 11 (21%) were also detected from the frass samples (eight lepidopterans). Approximately 80% of identified prey species in the nestling feces represented lepidopterans, which is in line with the earlier studies on the parids' diet. A subsequent laboratory experiment showed a threshold for fecal sample size and the barcoding success, suggesting that the smallest frass samples do not contain enough larval DNA to be detected by high-throughput sequencing. To summarize, we apply metabarcoding for the first time in a combined approach to identify available prey (through frass) and consumed prey (via nestling feces), expanding the scope and precision for future dietary studies on insectivorous birds.

Urban exploiters have physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations to live in cities. However, there is increasing evidence that urban exploiters themselves can suffer from urban conditions, especially during specific life-history stages. We looked for a link between the degree of urbanization and the level of developmental stress in an urban exploiter (the house sparrow, Passer domesticus), which has recently been declining in multiple European cities (e.g., London, UK). Specifically, we conducted a large-scale study and sampled juvenile sparrows in 11 urban and rural sites to evaluate their feather corticosterone (CORT) levels. We found that juvenile feather CORT levels were positively correlated with the degree of urbanization, supporting the idea that developing house sparrows may suffer from urban environmental conditions. However, we did not find any correlation between juvenile feather CORT levels and body size, mass, or body condition. This suggests either that the growth and condition of urban sparrows are not impacted by elevated developmental CORT levels, or that urban sparrows may compensate for developmental constraints once they have left the nest. Although feather CORT levels were not correlated with baseline CORT levels, we found that feather CORT levels were slightly and positively correlated with the CORT stress response in juveniles. This suggests that urban developmental conditions may potentially have long-lasting effects on stress physiology and stress sensitivity in this urban exploiter.

This burgeoning field enables the improvement of population monitoring and conservation efforts, particularly for small, elusive animals where data collection is difficult. Device attachment usually requires species-specific solutions to ensure that data loggers exert minimal influence on the animal's behavior and physiology, and ensure high reliability of data capture. External features or peculiar body shapes often make securing devices difficult for long-term monitoring, as in the case with small spiny mammals. Here, we present a method that enables high-resolution, long-term investigations of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) via GPS and acceleration loggers. We collected data from 17 wild hedgehogs with devices attached between 9 and 42 days. Our results showed that hedgehogs behaved naturally; as individuals curled, moved through dense vegetation, slipped under fences and built regular day nests without any indication of impediment. Our novel method makes it possible to not only attach high-precision devices for substantially longer than previous efforts, but enables detachment and reattachment of devices to the same individual. This makes it possible to quickly respond to unforeseen events and exchange devices, and overcomes the issue of short battery life common to many lightweight loggers.	[Barthel, Leon M.

To investigate the little-known migratory patterns of two grassland bird species, we deployed 180 light-level geolocators on Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and 29 Argos-GPS tags on Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA, and six US Department of Defense (DoD) installations distributed across the species' breeding ranges. We analyzed location data from 34 light-level geolocators and five Argos-GPS tags attached for 1 year to Grasshopper Sparrows and Eastern Meadowlarks, respectively. Grasshopper Sparrows were present on the breeding grounds from mid-April through early October, substantially longer than previously estimated, and migrated on average 2,500 km over 30 days. Grasshopper Sparrows exhibited strong migratory connectivity only at a continental scale. The North American Great Lakes region likely serves as a migratory divide for Midwest and East Coast Grasshopper Sparrows; Midwest populations (Kansas, Wisconsin, and North Dakota; n = 13) largely wintered in Texas or Mexico, whereas East Coast populations (Maryland and Massachusetts, n = 20) wintered in the northern Caribbean or Florida. Our data from Eastern Meadowlarks provided evidence for a diversity of stationary and short- and long-distance migration strategies. By providing the most extensive examination of the nonbreeding movement ecology for these two North American grassland bird species to date, we refine information gaps and provide key insight for their management and conservation.

Parent-offspring communication often involves conspicuous begging by the offspring which triggers a parental response, typically the transfer of food. So begging and parental provisioning reciprocally influence each other and are therefore expected to coevolve. There is indeed empirical evidence for covariation of offspring begging and parental provisioning at the phenotypic level. However, whether this reflects genetic correlations of mean levels of behaviors or a covariation of the slopes of offspring demand and parental supply functions (= behavioral plasticity) is not known. The latter has gone rather unnoticed-despite the obvious dynamics of parent-offspring communication. In this study, we measured parental provisioning and begging behavior at two different hunger levels using canaries (Serinus canaria) as a model species. This enabled us to simultaneously study the plastic responses of the parents and the offspring to changes in offspring need. We first tested whether parent and offspring behaviors covary phenotypically. Then, using a covariance partitioning approach, we estimated whether the covariance predominantly occurred at a between-nest level (i.e., indicating a fixed strategy) or at a within-nest level (i.e., reflecting a flexible strategy). We found positive phenotypic covariation of offspring begging and parental provisioning, confirming previous evidence. Yet, this phenotypic covariation was mainly driven by a covariance at the within-nest level. That is parental and offspring behaviors covary because of a plastic behavioral coadjustment, indicating that behavioral plasticity could be a main driver of parent-offspring coadaptation.

We satellite-tracked turtles captured after nesting at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), St. Croix, US Virgin Islands to determine habitat-use patterns of endangered adult female hawksbills (Eretmochelys imbricata). For 31 turtles captured between 2011 and 2014, switching state-space modeling and home range analyses showed that inter-nesting (IN) core-use areas (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates [KDEs]) were 9.6 to 77.7 km(2) in area, occupied for 21 to 85 days, and in shallow water (21 of 26 centroids > - 10 m). The IN zones overlapped with areas both within the protected borders of BIRNM, and outside BIRNM (32% of turtle-tracking days outside during IN). Turtles migrated to their foraging grounds between July and October with path lengths ranging from 52 to 3524 km; foraging areas included 14 countries. Core-use foraging areas (50% KDEs) where turtles took up residence were 6.3 to 95.4 km(2), occupied for 22 to 490 days, with mean centroid depth - 66 m. Our results show previously unknown habitatuse patterns and highlight concentrated areas of use both within and adjacent to a US protected area during the breeding season. Further, our results clearly demonstrate the need for international conservation to protect hawksbills, as migrating turtles crossed between two and eight different jurisdictions. Our results provide critical spatial and temporal information for managers charged with designing strategies to minimize human impact to and maximize survival for this globally imperiled species.

Fencing Africa's protected areas: Costs, benefits, and management issues	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article							FENCES; LIONS; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; LIVESTOCK; WILDLIFE; PERFORMANCE; ELEPHANTS; ABUNDANCE; PARK	The fencing of protected areas (PAs) is highly controversial, and much remains unknown about the associated financial, ecological, and social impacts. We surveyed experts on 63 fenced and 121 unfenced PM across 23 African countries to assess the advantages and drawbacks of fencing. Where fences exist, they are largely supported and widely viewed as effective at demarcating PA boundaries and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. However, most fences were insufficiently funded, which limited their ability to contain conflict-prone species like elephants and lions. Fences were also frequently vandalised and caused numerous conflicts with local communities. We documented for the first time the distribution of and support for fencing in PAs across Africa. While fencing is largely limited to Southern Africa and East Africa, support for fencing is greatest in West Africa and is associated with high human and livestock densities, and high threats from bushmeat harvesting, livestock encroachment, and logging.

Effect of protection status on mammal richness and abundance in Afromontane forests of the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biodiversity hotspot; Hunting pressure; Protected area; Tropical forest	EASTERN ARC MOUNTAINS; DUIKER CEPHALOPHUS-SPADIX; BUSHMEAT TRADE; MWANIHANA FOREST; SEED DISPERSAL; MONTANE FOREST; CONSERVATION; WILDLIFE; IMPACTS; HABITAT	The effectiveness of Protected Areas (PAs) in reducing hunting pressure on mammal populations in tropical forests has rarely been examined at a community-wide level. In African forests, commercial and subsistence hunting are widespread, but assessments of mammal abundance and distribution patterns are often lacking. We investigated patterns of occupancy and abundance for 27 species of medium- to large-bodied mammals (> 2 kg) within Tanzania's Udzungwa Mountains Afromontane forests, a global biodiversity hotspot. We sampled 22 forest sites within 10 forests under varying degrees of protection, elevation, distance to extractive communities, and levels of law enforcement. We sampled 251.7 km of recce line transects during dry seasons (July-November) between September 2007 and July 2010. We found a strong positive effect of protection status on species richness and on encounter rates of the most commonly encountered species. Consistent with the levels of resources and enforcement within each PA category, there was a significant progression in species richness and abundance from Forest Reserves through Nature Reserves to sites within Udzungwa Mountains National Park. Protective status closely reflected levels of disturbance. Snaring activity, and distance to ranger posts were identified as significant predictors of overall species richness and encounter rates for mammal species, including endemics. The species-area relationship for our study species was found to be largely overridden by levels of protection. Our findings demonstrate PA effectiveness in Afromontane forests and reinforce concerns over hunting pressures particularly the threat posed by snares.

Monitoring and evaluating the social and psychological dimensions that contribute to privately protected area program effectiveness	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Conservation covenants; Conservation easements; Conservation psychology; Land trusts; Management capacity; Private land conservation	LAND CONSERVATION; LANDOWNER SATISFACTION; RESERVE PROGRAM; MOTIVATIONS; MANAGEMENT; INSTRUMENTS; PARTICIPATION; DETERMINANTS; STEWARDSHIP; PERCEPTIONS	Privately protected areas (PPAs) make important contributions towards global conservation goals. As with any protected area, PPAs must be monitored for effectiveness at protecting and managing biodiversity. However, the key drivers of maintaining and improving the effectiveness of PPAs are often social, particularly for conservation covenants and easements that are owned and managed by private landholders. In Australia, we surveyed 527 covenant landholders across three states (New South Wales, Tasmania, and Victoria), to provide a benchmark for monitoring and evaluation activities. We found that landholders are mainly motivated to participate in order to protect their land in perpetuity, but come to expect financial and technical assistance as a benefit of the program. While 71.1% (n = 344) reported achieving their land management goals, 44.7% (n = 242) of landholders struggle with covenant management because of age, and financial and time constraints. Covenant landholders are generally satisfied with the program (92%). A subset (8%) of landholders feels disaffected with their participation, relating to their perceived inability to personally manage the biodiversity on their land, and the lack of interaction they have with representatives of covenanting organizations. Where compliance monitoring and semi-annual technical assistance is limited, some landholders are concerned that the efficacy of the covenant is reduced. To increase effectiveness we suggest that PPA programs regularly monitor landholder satisfaction and management needs, schedule conservation actions based on landholder capacity, and utilize landholder networks to spread information and foster communities of stewardship. Additionally, given the older demographics of landholders, programs should engage in PPA successional planning.

The effect of invasion by I. glandulifera on species richness, diversity and the composition of resident vegetation was studied in the northern foothills of the Tatra Mountains in southern Poland. Two approaches were used: comparing diversity measures of the invaded and uninvaded plots and analysing changes in species richness and diversity in plots grouped according to increasing cover percentage of I. glandulifera. Invaded plots harboured 0.27 fewer species per 4m(2) and had significantly reduced values of the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices and Pielou's measure of evenness. Analysis of changes in diversity measures with the increase in I. glandulifera cover revealed that an increase in I. glandulifera cover was from the onset related to a decrease in the diversity of the invaded plant communities, but after exceeding a 80% cover, this species dramatically reduced the diversity of the invaded vegetation. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated a significant shift in the composition of invaded plots in relation to uninvaded plots, which resulted from the proportional increase in the more shade tolerant and nutrients demanding species. Our results suggest that in species-rich vegetation, such as fresh meadows and related communities, I. glandulifera may suppress weak competitors and, thus, negatively impact plant diversity.

Differences in growth and performance between male and female plants may be accentuated under stress, potentially leading to sex-ratio biases and affecting population growth. Environmental stress involves multiple factors that often occur simultaneously. Among different stress combinations that occur in field conditions, competition and herbivory and their interaction are key biotic factors that can affect plant growth and performance. Here, we conducted a glasshouse experiment in Cardiff, UK, using the cultivated spinach, Spinacia oleracea, as a model system to study sexual dimorphism in intra- and inter-specific competitive ability and in response to herbivory by a generalist herbivore Helix aspersa. We found stronger inter- than intra-specific competition: growth (above-ground biomass) and chlorophyll content of male and female plants was reduced when growing with Brassica oleracea, but not when growing with conspecifics. In the absence of herbivory, females growing with same-sex neighbour had greater root biomass than males; whilst herbivory reduced root biomass significantly only in females competing with same sex neighbours. Plant damage caused by herbivores was similar when growing with male or female conspecifics but greater when growing with B. oleracea. Finally, plant damage caused by herbivores did not differ between male and female plants; however, males increased their allocation to roots and reduced their chlorophyll content after damage. Our results showed that sexual dimorphism occurs in S. oleracea, despite being a worldwide crop, selectively bred for its edible leaves. In particular, our results suggest stronger same-sex competition for females and greater tolerance to herbivory in males than in females of S. oleracea..

Do novel interactions with local fauna have reproductive consequences for exotic plants? A case study with thistles, ants, aphids, and pollinators	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Facilitation; Invasion process; Reproduction; Seed germination	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; FLORAL VISITATION; CARDUUS-NUTANS; ARGENTINE ANT; WEAVER ANTS; MUTUALISM; ESTABLISHMENT; PROTECTION; RESOURCES; DISPERSAL	Exotic plants are involved in different interactions with the fauna of the invaded sites, which can facilitate or limit their successful establishment and spread. Here, we evaluated the impact of native aphid-tending ants on the reproductive consequences of the invasive thistle Carduus thoermeri in NW Patagonia, which is frequently infested by aphids. We estimated the number and proportion of viable seeds, seed weight, germination proportion, and mean germination time of thistles in the presence and absence of aphids and ants, and with or without pollinator access. Aphid-infested thistles had 57% less viable seeds and 29% lower seed weight than non-infested thistles. Although ants and aphids had no effect on germination proportion, the mean germination time was ca. 15% faster in seeds from aphid-infested thistles. Our results suggest that the potential indirect effects of aphid-tending ants on thistles (negative effects via pollinator deterrence and positive effects via driving away non-aphid herbivores) are less important than the direct negative effects of aphids. Interestingly, although harboring aphids and ants has negative reproductive consequences for C. thoermeri plants, it could also generate a competitive advantage by giving rise to small and fast germinated seeds. This study illustrates the complexity of novel interactions among exotic plants and native ants, reinforcing the need for more studies to fully understand the potential impact of ant-plant interactions mediated by Hemiptera on the invasion success of plants.

Presence of Both Active and Inactive Colonies of Prairie Dogs Contributes to Higher Vegetation Heterogeneity at the Landscape Scale	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE; PLANTS; SITES; TOWNS	Black-tailed prairie dogs are herbivorous rodents known to have large effects on grassland landscapes in North America. They have considerable impacts on prairie plant communities as the result of repeated clipping of vegetation that can reduce preferred forage species and may indirectly result in increased abundance of disturbance-tolerant species. We investigated plant communities within three different habitat types: Active- and inactive prairie dog colonies, and adjacent suitable, but unoccupied, control areas in the Northern Great Plains of Montana, U.SA. Plant species richness did not vary markedly between the three habitat types. However, plant composition measured as cover of plant life forms (forbs, shrubs, and graminoids), which was further divided into native status (native or introduced), and plant species indicators (plant species associated with a specific habitat) did vary distinctly between the three habitat types. Differences in plant composition between the habitat types suggests black-tailed prairie dog activities result in greater diversity of plant microhabitats at a landscape scale, and prairie dogs are an important component of the overall ecosystem in the Northern Great Plains of North America.

The tuna purse seine operations in the region extend from 70 to 150 degrees W to 20 degrees S-30 degrees N. Significant differences on the captures per sets between fishing modes and species were found. Results showed that the most common species taken are M. thurstoni, M. mobular and M. birostris in School sets (sets on unassociated tuna schools). The temporal distributions showed high variability of the catches by species and years. The spatial distribution showed several areas of importance depending of the type of fishing, such as the coast of Peru, Galagapos or the Costa Rica Dome, and possible relationships with some oceanographic processes of the eastern Pacific Ocean (i.e. coastal and seasonal upwelling systems). The frequency of the captures per set showed that, although the greatest numbers caught in a set were very low (around 53.7% of sets with one capture), in some areas and periods there were captures of aggregates of hundreds of individuals of some of these species, such as Galapagos Islands during December, Costa Rica Dome during August, or Baja California during June. These events are of biological interest, and may offer good opportunities for conservation. This project has been developed with the aim of identifying the most important areas for these bycatch species and thus, improving the knowledge on them to reduce their mortality.

Ontogenetic shifts in microhabitat use and coral selectivity in three coral reef fishes	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Ontogenetic shifts; Coral selectivity; Microhabitat use; Coral reef fishes	HABITAT USE; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; ISHIGAKI ISLAND; HOME-RANGE; SPECIALIZATION; COMMUNITIES; SIZE; ASSOCIATIONS; COMPETITION	It is being increasingly recognized that small coral reef fishes are highly specialised on branching coral substrata and are threatened by reef degradation. In the past, it has been assumed that medium-sized mobile coral reef fishes may be less at risk. This assumes medium-sized mobile fishes are not as equally associated with and susceptible to the loss of live coral, especially early in their ontogeny. Here we use observations of habitat use and compositional analysis to show that three mobile medium-sized fishes, Siganus vulpinus (Siganidae), Zebrasoma scopas (Acanthuridae) and Heniochus varius (Chaetodontidae), are associated with live coral substrata early in ontogeny and less so as adults on coral reefs in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Small size classes of S. vulpinus and Z. scopas showed a preference toward using branching and bushy live coral, as well as structurally intact dead coral, suggesting an underlying importance of reef structural complexity during early life stages. H. varius was associated with foliose and plate coral through all size classes, but selectivity declined as sub-adults and adults. In general, all species became more generalist in their use of reef substrata at larger sizes, but S. vulpinus and Z. scopas tended to avoid open and less structurally complex reef habitats, such as, sand, soft corals and sponges, while H. varius avoided dead coral substrata. Our results confirm that juvenile stages may be a critical bottleneck that exposes medium-sized reef fishes to the same risks small reef fish species experience due to declining coral cover.

Otolith microchemistry reveals partial migration and life history variation in a facultatively anadromous, iteroparous salmonid, bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Partial migration; Partial anadromy; Salmonids; Char; Bull trout; Otoliths; LA-ICP-MS	DOLLY-VARDEN; FRESH-WATER; PACIFIC SALMON; NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES; CHINOOK SALMON; SKAGIT RIVER; ARCTIC CHARR; HABITAT USE; MARINE; FISH	Migration of fishes between habitats influences population dynamics and ecological interactions. Some partially migratory populations include both migratory and non-migratory individuals, adding complexity to these dynamics. For partially migratory fishes with diadromous life histories, freshwater and marine habitats can differ greatly in availability of prey and physical conditions conducive to growth, predation risk, and exposure to fisheries and to contaminants. Therefore, understanding patterns of migratory behavior can inform population biology and conservation. Using otolith microchemistry, we describe observations of partial anadromy in a threatened, iteroparous salmonid species, bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in the Skagit River basin of Washington State, USA. We found that 59% of the fish sampled (> 338mm fork length) in the river had not been to marine water, despite easy access. The other 41% had migrated to salt water, typically every year beginning at age 2 or 3. We also observed overwintering in marine waters by some individuals, and extended time in fresh water between otherwise annual migrations to marine waters in others. Additionally, there was no obligatory relationship between anadromy in mothers and their offspring. The facultative nature of migration in this species, and the lack of tight connection between maternal and offspring life history patterns are consistent with studies of other Salvelinus species but contrast with the more rigid controls on migration in semelparous salmonids.

We aimed here to identify variation in tree species composition throughout the Ngovayang Massif (southern Cameroon) and determine the relative contributions of environmental factors and spatial autocorrelation in shaping tree species composition. Vegetation surveys were conducted in fifteen 1-ha (100 m x 100 m) permanent plots established along a transect from lowland (200 m) to submontane forests (900 m) in which all trees with a diameter (dbh) >= 10 cm were inventoried. Data were investigated using ordination methods (Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis). At the local scale, the most important variable in determining tree species composition patterns was slope exposure, followed by distance from the ocean and altitude. Together, these environmental variables explained 28% of floristic variation among plots, and the spatial structure almost disappeared when the effects of these variables were removed. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that spatial variables (geographic coordinates of the plots) or geographic distance between plots explained only 1% of the total initial variance. Residual spatial variation not explained by the environmental variables probably reflects the history of vegetation and the effects of other climatic variables that were not included in this study. Floristic variation in the Ngovayang Massif is due to strong environmental heterogeneity. The sensitivity of floristic composition to environmental variables such as slope orientation and altitude suggests that tree species composition may shift with expected climate changes, such as changes in the movement of air masses, increase in mean annual temperatures or increasing severity of the dry season. Our study highlights the need for systematic on-the-ground measurements of climate variables in tropical montane areas in order to better understand the current climate regime and serve as a basis for modelling future changes.

A relatively more simple explanation, range size being connected to differing dispersal abilities, was recently presented for passerine birds. Unfortunately, respective datasets are not easily available for other taxonomic groups. We circumvented this problem by developing a simple dispersal index, incorporating niche information (body size, litter size, preferred habitats of adults and offspring, ecotype of adults) which can be collected straightforwardly for most animal taxa. We tested this dispersal index for species which are generally considered poor dispersers, amphibians. Our results from West Africa revealed a positive correlation between the dispersal index and range size (p < 0.001). Our index can easily be transferred to and tested with other taxa. Furthermore, our results suggest one possible way of integrating information on dispersal abilities in niche modelling (distribution modelling) processes which assess the impact of climate change on future species distributions.

Interpreting long-term trends in bushmeat harvest in southeast Cameroon	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bushmeat; Hunter offtake; Mean body mass indicator; Mammals; Tropical rainforests		Measuring hunting sustainability across West/Central African forests remains a challenge. Long-term assessment of trends is crucial. Via hunter-reported surveys we collected offtake data in three villages near the Dja Biosphere Reserve (southeast Cameroon). During four months (March June) in 2003, 2009 and 2016, we gathered information on hunters, prey species and number of carcasses brought to the three settlements. Because it was not possible to record hunter effort i.e. the time a hunter spent pursuing animals or setting traps, to calculate catch per unit effort (CPUE), we used catch per hunter per day (CPHD) to document hunter returns. We then used the changes in the mean body mass indicator (MBMI) throughout the study period to test for defaunation in the three villages. Differences in CPHD and MBMI by month and year, between villages and hunting method, were investigated using Tweedie regression models. For all species pooled, we found that the mean CPHD remained relatively constant between 2003 and 2016. There was an observed shift from traps to firearms during the study period. CPHD for each of the seven most hunted species did not vary significantly during the entire study period, and a similar change from traps to firearms was observed. MBMI also remained stable for all species pooled, but significantly declined in the remotest village. Starting MBMI values for this village were higher than for the other two settlements perhaps because wildlife here is less depleted. Although hunter effort data may be difficult to obtain over long time periods, CPHD and MBMI may be useful tools as a measure of impact of hunters on prey populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Extended Water-Level Drawdowns in Dammed Rivers Enhance Fish Habitat: Environmental Pool Management in the Upper Mississippi River	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water-level management; Dams; Adaptive management; Mississippi River; Environmental flows; Moist-soil plants	BACKWATER LAKE; LOW-FLOW; BIODIVERSITY; RESTORATION; HYDROPOWER; VEGETATION; HYDROLOGY; RESPONSES; FRAMEWORK	Environmental Pool Management (EPM) can improve ecosystem function in rivers by restoring aspects of the natural flow regime lost to dam construction. EPM recreates summer baseflow conditions and promotes the growth of terrestrial vegetation which is inundated in the fall, thereby improving habitat heterogeneity for many aquatic taxa. A three-year experiment was conducted wherein terrestrial floodplain areas were dewatered through EPM water-level reductions and the resulting terrestrial vegetation was (1) allowed to remain or (2) removed in paired plots in Mississippi River pool 25. Fish assemblage and abundance were quantified in paired plots after inundation. Abundances of many fish species were greater in vegetated plots, especially for species that utilize vegetation during portions of their life history. Fish assemblages varied more between plot types when the magnitude of EPM water-level drawdowns was greater, which produced greater vegetation growth. Young-of-year individuals, especially from small, early maturing species and/or species reliant on vegetation for refuge, feeding, or life history, utilized vegetated plots more than devegetated plots. Vegetation growth produced under EPM was heavily used by river fishes, including young-of-year individuals, which may ultimately positively influence recruitment. Increased habitat heterogeneity may mitigate some of the negative impacts of dam construction and water-level regulation on river fishes. Annual variability in vegetation responses that occurs under EPM enhances natural environmental variability which could ultimately contribute to increased fish diversity. Low-cost programs like EPM can be implemented as a part of adaptive management plans to help maintain biodiversity and ecosystem health in anthropogenically altered rivers.	[Coulter, A. A.; Burr, B.

A phenology model for tropical species that flower multiple times each year	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Barro Colorado Island; drought; proximate cue; rain flower; tropical forest	HYBANTHUS-PRUNIFOLIUS; DRY FOREST; PATTERNS; TREE; TRIGGER; SHRUB; RAIN	Phenology models developed for temperate and boreal plants predict a single, population-level first flowering date for each year. These models cannot accommodate species that flower multiple times each year in humid tropical forests nor flowering data with census-interval rather than daily temporal resolution. Here, we present a new model framework able to predict the timing of multiple annual flowering events from census data. We extend a recent model, which predicted tropical flowering probabilities as discrete events occurring on census dates, by integrating predicted flowering probabilities over all dates between censuses. We evaluate our model against 29 years of daily climate and weekly flowering records for Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae) and Handroanthus guayacan (Bignoniaceae) from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Previous experiments demonstrate that both species flower shortly after a heavy, dry-season rain interrupts an extended dry period. Our model captures this sequence of rainfall events. Best-fit model parameters are consistent with previous experimental results. This match suggests the new model framework will provide novel insights for other humid tropical forest species.

We monitored monthly litterfall and conducted meteorological measurements over 16years in a lowland mixed dipterocarp forest in Borneo. The total annual litterfall averaged 7.02Mgha(-1) year(-1) and leaf fall contributed 67.9% of total litterfall. Fourier analyses detected a significant annual cycle in monthly leaf fall, although spatial variation was relatively high, and 57.5% of litter traps showed annual cycles at the litter trap level. Rainfall, mean temperature and solar radiation also showed distinct 12-monthcycles. Leaf fall was positively correlated with the daily mean air temperature of the same month, and negatively correlated with rainfall in the previous month. Leaf fall gradually increased during the study period. Our results suggest that a seasonal pattern in community-level leaf fall is regulated by the annual cycle of meteorological factors, even in this aseasonal environment, which experiences no dry season. Further monitoring and analyses are required to clarify spatial variation and long-term patterns in litterfall and their mechanisms.

Disentangling grazing and light controls on algal communities in grassland and afforested streams	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						bottom-up; exotic pines; grassland; periphyton; top-down	BOTTOM-UP CONTROL; TOP-DOWN; CURRENT VELOCITY; PERIPHYTON INTERACTIONS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; PRIMARY PRODUCERS; VASCULAR PLANTS; NUTRIENTS; ECOSYSTEM; GRAZERS	Our aim was to analyze the combined effect of grazing and light on composition, structure, functional diversity (FD) and succession of algal communities in two headwater streams (grassland and pine afforested). We hypothesized that algal communities in the grassland stream are top-down controlled, as a result of higher grazing; meanwhile, in the afforested stream, algal communities are bottom-up shaped, mainly due to sunlight reduction. In in situ experiments, we used platforms to avoid grazing in both streams, and the substrates were extracted at 23, 45 and 73 days. Algal community composition was different between stream types. Seventy percent of structural and biomass variables responded to grazing. In the grassland stream, grazing reduced richness and ash-free dry mass (AFDM), especially after 45 days, while in the afforested stream, at the same time, grazed substrates showed higher richness and AFDM than ungrazed substrates. Net grazing effect was higher on algal biomass of grassland streams. Then, 30% of functional traits showed grazing effect. High profile algae predominated in the grassland stream, where ungrazed substrates showed higher proportions of species with pad mucilage and colonial life form. Algal communities in the afforested stream remained at an early stage of succession, with a predominance of small and low profile algae in both substrates, and FD and evenness indices were lower. Our results indicate that the relative strength of top-down versus bottom-up control is different among stream types and the primary regulatory factor of freshwater communities can be modified according to such forestry practice.

Unraveling the scales of effect of landscape structure on primate species richness and density of titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons)	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						landscape approach; multiscale assessment; population density; primate community; scale of effect	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; RAIN-FOREST; ATLANTIC FOREST; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; COVER; PATCH; SIZE; SUPPLEMENTATION	In the Anthropocene, many animal populations are increasingly confined to human-modified landscapes, in which different spatial variables describing landscape composition and configuration influence species persistence. Forest specialist species are particularly vulnerable to these landscape disturbances. Yet, landscape effects may be undetected if assessed at the wrong spatial scale. Thus, identifying the scale of effect, which is the optimal spatial scale for estimating ecological responses to each landscape variable, is needed to understand the impact of landscape structure modification on species. Here, we explored the scale of effect of two compositional (forest cover and anthropogenic cover) and two configurational landscape variables (forest patch density and forest edge density) on two ecological responses: primate species richness and group densities of titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons). We sampled 16 study sites in northeastern SAo Paulo State, Brazil. For each site, we measured each landscape variable within 10 different-sized landscapes ranging from 0.2 to 28.3 km(2) to identify the scale of effect of each landscape variable. The strength of all the primate-landscape relationships varied across spatial scales. Although both ecological responses were most strongly associated with forest cover at the largest scale, the scale of effect of the other landscape variables differed between the response variables. These results suggest that each response variable is shaped by landscape patterns and processes operating across different spatial scales. We highlight the importance of separately assessing the scale of effect of each landscape variable on each ecological response to better understand the impact of landscape structure on species persistence.

Compared to functional diversity, taxonomic diversity has received much more attention in research on altitudinal gradients, although functional diversity may provide more information on the ecological mechanisms shaping plant diversity. We assessed the importance of climatic and environmental heterogeneity as drivers of functional diversity in relation to altitude in the central Alborz Mountains, Iran. We sampled 132 vegetation plots along two altitudinal transects. Plant traits including life history, growth form, stem-leaf ratio, spinescence, hairiness, leaf consistency, dispersal type and plant height were recorded. Functional diversity was measured as functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, and their standardized effect sizes (SESs). In general, functional diversity decreased with altitude. The decrease in observed functional diversity was related to the decrease in taxonomic richness. SESs of functional diversity showed contrasting trends, depending on transect and index. At both transects, climatic stress best explained the variation in observed and expected functional diversity. Harsh climatic conditions at higher altitudes decreased the number of species and thus the functional trait space. Environmental heterogeneity played only a minor role for shaping functional diversity. We expect this effect to be due to the length of the sampled altitudinal transects. With increasing length, small-scale drivers become less effective. The two transects favoured different environmental drivers, meaning that transferability of single studies could be difficult.

Ecological aspects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities in different habitat types of a Brazilian mountainous area	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Glomeromycotina; rupestrian fields; soil ecology; symbiosis	PALMAR NATIONAL-PARK; SPECIES RICHNESS; PLANT; DIVERSITY; FOREST; GRADIENT; ALPINE; ALTITUDE; ROOTS; GENUS	Increasing elevation affects many abiotic factors, such as a temperature decrease and an increase in radiation, as well as multiple biotic characteristics such as richness and composition of plant communities, both of which contribute to the formation of different habitats in mountainous landscapes. Both biotic and abiotic factors also affect belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities, but there is scarce information available from tropical mountain ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine the diversity and distribution of AM fungi in different mountainous habitat types in the Chapada Diamantina mountain range in Bahia (NE Brazil). Soil samples were collected in five habitats types: high-altitude cerrado savannas (HAC), natural grasslands (GRA), gallery forests (GAF), in natural rocky rupestrian fields (shrublands; CAR) and in rocky, rupestrian field in the regeneration stage (CRR). A total of 49 AMF species were identified, of which Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae species were the most representative families. The AMF communities did not follow the shifts in plant communities. The composition of the AMF communities differed only between CAR and HAC and between CRR and GAF, while the other habitats had similar AMF communities. Our conclusion is that the AMF community assemblages in tropical mountains are related to the heterogeneity of habitats of these ecosystems. In our study, silt and coarse sand contents were the main factors related to the community composition of AMF in the different habitats.

The aim of this research was to examine the effect of the above ground parts of different seagrass and seaweed species on the deposition, retention, physical (dry bulk density and grain size), and chemical properties (organic carbon content and organic carbon density) of sediment. Six seagrass and seaweed communities with different above ground morphologies were studied between the dry (April 2015) and wet seasons (August 2015). The results suggested that the highest canopy complexity index was in the green alga, Halimeda macroloba Decaisne patches, which had the highest canopy score. High canopy complexity patches were likely to retain more sediment and store more organic carbon than lower canopy complexity patches and bare sand, respectively. The sediment retention and percent of organic carbon content were also affected by seasons. The wave action in the wet season affected the sediment through higher sediment deposition and movement, which caused increased sediment instability and led to changes in sediment properties. In addition, shoot density in the dry season was lower than that in the wet season, most likely due to damage from long exposure during low tide. Our results indicate that the canopy complexity of marine macrophytes and seasons influenced both sediment retention and properties of the sediment.

We analyzed the relationship between 10 leaf functional traits (LFTs) and 17 soil properties including soil nutrients, transformation flows and pH along a plant chronosequence spanning first 40 years of ESS in a tropical mountain cloud forest. To recognize the multivariate variation of soil properties, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The first axis of PCA was mainly associated with soil pH, P, Ca, Mg, K, C:N and N transformation flow, and this first axis was tightly associated with vegetation ages. The community weighted mean of the LFTs was also associated with vegetation ages. In particular, leaf P declined while leaf density, C, C:P and N:P increased with vegetation ages. Our analyses suggest associations between soil properties (the first axis of the PCA) and the LFTs (leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf density, leaf C, leaf C:P and leaf N:P) over the plant chronosequence. A fast acquisition strategy was observed in the younger sites and a resource conservation strategy in the older sites. Our results highlight the possible importance of changes in soil properties along secondary succession on plant functional traits in tropical cloud forest.

We assess what amphibian functional diversity implies for the community assembly of amphibians of Europe and whether the use of different Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) affects the results. We used presence/absence atlas with 50kmx50km grain size and three functional diversity indices (FRic, RaoQ and FDiv) which reflect functional richness and divergence to estimate functional diversity patterns calculated for three FTGs: Morphological, Habitat-related, Reproductive and the complete set of traits. To identify the two key processes (environmental filtering and limiting similarity) that may shape amphibian communities and how the relative importance of these processes could change using different FTGs, we used null models to test for non-random patterns of functional diversity accounting or not for the difference in regional species pool. We show that for the same grid cell, for one FTG we might observe lower than randomly expected functional diversity (i.e., trait convergence or environmental filtering as the dominant community assembly process) while for another FTG or for the complete set of traits, higher than randomly expected functional diversity (i.e., trait divergence or limiting similarity as the dominant community assembly process). This highlights the role of trait selection on the inference drawn regarding community assembly. Furthermore, the number of traits (complete set vs. FTGs) used to quantify functional diversity also affects the conclusions regarding community assembly.

Understanding factors that limit the survival of hatchery-spawned fishes after stocking is critical to future conservation efforts using captive populations. As the size at which juvenile piscivorous fishes shift to consuming other fish can influence their survival, the transition to piscivory by hatchery-spawned Ptychocheilus lucius Girard, 1856 (Colorado pikeminnow) was investigated after stocking the San Juan River in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, USA. The stable isotope N-15 was used to track ontogenetic changes in the trophic position of individuals stocked at age 0, with the expectation that they would become fully piscivorous by age 2. By sampling the isotopic signatures of Colorado pikeminnow across multiple years, the ability of river discharge and densities of fish prey to explain interannual variation in trophic position was also explored. Annual variation in river flow and the densities of fish prey had little predictive power in explaining variation in delta N-15 of age-1 or age-2 Colorado pikeminnow. After assessing the isotopic signatures of potential prey, a Bayesian isotopic mixing model suggested that invertebrates comprised nearly 25% of the diet of of both age-1 and age-2 individuals. The relationship between Colorado pikeminnow size and delta N-15 within stocked cohorts indicated that juveniles slowly transitioned to consuming fish prey as they grew, rather than abruptly switching, as indicated from a limited number of dietary studies using wild fish. Together, these results suggest that Colorado pikeminnow stocked into the San Juan River slowly transition to consuming fish prey. If this pattern leads to poor survival and recruitment, the effectiveness of this management action for conservation could be compromised.

Length-based assessment of larval lamprey population structure at differing spatial scales	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						biological reference points; ecological indicators; EU Habitats Directive; length-based indicators	PETROMYZON-MARINUS; REFERENCE POINTS; INDICATORS; STATOLITHS; STREAM; STOCKS; TROUT; L.	Perspectives on lamprey management contrast between pest control in the US Great Lakes and species conservation in the Pacific Northwest, New Zealand, and Europe. Five lamprey species are listed in the European Union (EU) Habitats Directive (HD) as requiring conservation measures. Assessments of HD 'conservation status' for these lampreys mainly target the larval (ammocoete) stage. Larval lamprey populations can be assessed by evaluating presence or absence, density and demographic structure in riverine samples. Demographic structure has typically been described from length-frequency data using qualitative approaches and the statistical assignment of age classes. Length-based indicators (LBIs) may provide a more rapid and flexible framework. The demographic structure of a fish population can be described by univariate length metrics: length range (L-RANGE) and 90(th) percentile of length (L-90). This study used a pooled data set from seven Irish catchments to estimate a reference point (RP) value for each metric corresponding to a healthy larval lamprey population. Two LBIs were then derived that can be estimated for an observed (OBS) population as LBIRANGE = L-RANGE_OBS/L-RANGE_RP and LBI90 = L-90_OBS/L-90_RP. Simulated lamprey population length structures, representing a range of status values, were used to develop a reference gradient (RG) to support population assessment using LBIs. The assessment framework was applied to each of the seven Irish catchments, and also to subcatchment and sampling-site scales within the Barrow system. The LBIs and RG suggested that most catchments had favourable conservation status overall, whereas smaller assessment scales revealed a spread of status values. The proposed framework allows the rapid assessment of demographic structure and comparison across systems. There is potential to track states across sampling sites, events, and legislative reporting cycles, and to interpret change in relation to the local environment. The general approach may be adaptable for other fish species monitored during juvenile stages.

Very little is known about the environmental factors associated with the assembly and spatial distribution of fish communities in these acid-water habitats, although such knowledge is of immense importance for conservation and management. Fish assemblages in 40 stream sites throughout the Nee Soon Swamp Forest, Singapore, were surveyed using push nets from October 2013 to November 2014. The Nee Soon Swamp Forest is the last substantial remnant of freshwater swamp forest habitat in Singapore, and today it is the only refuge for many of the native forest-specialist freshwater fish species. The overall diversity and richness of the fish community are positively correlated with depth, stream order, and canopy cover, and are negatively correlated with distance to a connected reservoir, mean velocity, and silt substrate. Observed patterns indicate that three main communities exist, each with distinct associated species and environmental parameters. One is a novel community of introduced species and non-forest specialist native species found only at the outskirts (downstream portion) of the swamp forest, close to a reservoir connection that drains the swamp, whereas the other two communities are found in the interior of the swamp forest and harbour mostly forest-specialist native species of restricted distribution and high conservation value. The community on the outskirts may be a potential route for introduced species to spread and establish populations deeper within the swamp forest. At present the native community within the swamp forest appears to be healthy, but constant monitoring is needed to ensure that the native community is not threatened by loss of habitat or introduced species.

Regional organizations that manage threats to the marine biodiversity of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico seek to delineate conservation priorities. This process can be usefully informed by extinction risk assessments conducted under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria: a widely used, objective method to communicate species-specific conservation needs. Prior to the recent Red List initiatives summarized in this study, the conservation status was known for just one-quarter of the 1360 Greater Caribbean marine bony shorefishes. During 10 Red List workshops, experts applied data on species' distributions, populations, habitats, and threats in order to assign an extinction risk category to nearly 1000 shorefishes that range in the Greater Caribbean. As conservation is mostly implemented at national and local levels, two more workshops assessed the Gulf of Mexico populations of 940 shorefishes using the regional Red List guidelines. About 5% of these shorefishes are globally or regionally threatened, including 6% of Greater Caribbean endemics and 26% of Gulf endemics. About 9% of the species are Data Deficient. Species-richness analyses show that the highest numbers of threatened species endemic to the Greater Caribbean are found in Belize, Panama, and the Cayman Islands. The most pervasive threats to the threatened and Near Threatened species are overexploitation, habitat degradation, and predation by the invasive lionfish. Half of the threatened species are experiencing multiple threats that are likely to amplify extinction risk. Recommended actions, in addition to conducting diversity surveys in lesser explored areas, include improving fishery management, reducing habitat degradation, and controlling lionfish populations.

Genetic connectivity and phylogeography of the night shark (Carcharhinus signatus) in the western Atlantic Ocean: Implications for conservation management	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						conservation evaluation; dispersal; fish; fisheries management; gene flow; genetic diversity	SEX-BIASED DISPERSAL; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; HISTORICAL DEMOGRAPHY; PAIRWISE RELATEDNESS; BLACKTIP SHARK; PELAGIC SHARKS; SILKY SHARK; R-PACKAGE; MITOCHONDRIAL; SOFTWARE	The night shark, Carcharhinus signatus, is a mesopelagic, semi-oceanic shark species found only in the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the most frequently caught sharks in pelagic longline fisheries and is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Despite their prevalence in commercial fisheries, the population genetic structure of the night shark has not been assessed. The present study investigated the genetic diversity, genetic connectivity, and phylogeography of the species throughout the western Atlantic Ocean, based on complete mitochondrial control region (mtCR) sequence data (n = 152) and genotypic data from nine nuclear microsatellites (n = 119). The mtCR sequence revealed 19 haplotypes, with overall haplotype and nucleotide diversities of 0.74 (+/- 0.027) and 0.0034 (+/- 0.0019), respectively, whereas the nuclear microsatellite observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.408 and 0.421, respectively. There was significant population structure (CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EFST = 0.429; P < 0.01) and isolation by distance (r = 0.65, P = 0.03) based on mtCR sequence data, but no genetic differentiation based on nuclear microsatellite analyses. The phylogenetic analyses support the existence of two matrilineal lineages, which diverged during the Pleistocene. Mitochondrial demographic analyses indicated a historical bottleneck effect followed by population expansion during the Pleistocene, whereas nuclear microsatellites did not detect a recent or a strong bottleneck. For conservation purposes, we advocate that the species should be considered to comprise at least two management units (MUs) in the western Atlantic Ocean. MU-specific catch quotas should be implemented throughout the range of the species given its low genetic diversity and vulnerability to overexploitation.

Selection for genetics-based architecture traits in a native cottonwood negatively affects invasive tamarisk in a restoration field trial	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						common garden; Populus fremontii; restoration; Tamarix spp.; tree architecture	WESTERN UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ASSISTED MIGRATION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; POPULUS; GROWTH; PHENOLOGY; IMPACT; PLANTS; RIVER	Climate change and competition from invasive species remain two important challenges in restoration. We examined the hypothesis that non-native tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) reestablishment after aboveground removal is affected by genetics-based architecture of native Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) used in restoration. As cottonwood architecture (height, canopy width, number of stems, and trunk diameter) is, in part, determined by genetics, we predicted that trees from different provenances would exhibit different architecture, and mean annual maximum temperature transfer distance from the provenances would interact with the architecture to affect tamarisk. In a common garden in Chevelon, AZ, U.S.A. (elevation 1,496 m), with cottonwoods from provenances spanning its elevation distribution, we measured the performance of both cottonwoods and tamarisk. Several key findings emerged. On average, cottonwoods from higher elevations were (1) two times taller and wider, covered approximately 3.5 times more basal area, and were less shrubby in appearance, by exhibiting four times fewer number of stems than cottonwoods from lower elevations; (2) had 50% fewer tamarisk growing underneath, which were two times shorter and covered 6.5 times less basal area than tamarisk growing underneath cottonwoods of smaller stature; and (3) the number of cottonwood stems did not affect tamarisk growth, possibly because the negative relationship between cottonwood stems and basal area. In combination, these findings argue that cottonwood architecture is affected by local conditions that interact with genetics-based architecture. These interactions can negatively affect the growth of reinvading tamarisk and enhance restoration success. Our study emphasizes the importance of incorporating genetic and environmental interactions of plants used in restoration.

This 6-year study tested the potential of different canopy manipulations to facilitate the establishment of a light-demanding canopy tree species, totara (Podocarpus totara), within a regenerating kanuka (Kunzea robusta) stand. Results highlighted the effectiveness of artificial gaps over other methods (ring-barking and edge-planting) in accelerating the growth of planted totara. Seedlings under gaps grew consistently taller and faster over time indicative of an improved understorey light environment. Ring-barking did not have a significant effect on totara growth because only a portion of the treated trees died, and after 6 years dead trees remained standing with intact branches resulting in insignificant increases in light transmission. At the forest edge sites, totara growth was highly variable. Although some seedlings grew as tall as in the gaps, others did not. Survival was also lower in the edge sites than in other treatments, which was likely due to enhanced herbivory from ungulates which impacted some plants at these sites. Gap creation is likely to be an important tool for restoring late-successional canopy species in regenerating stands both through providing ideal sites for the growth of light-demanding species such as totara and through natural establishment of other future canopy trees into the gaps.

Tree plantation has been commonly employed to foster the recovery of degraded areas. However, this technique is costly, and their outcomes are often uncertain. Therefore, we evaluated an alternative method for the restoration of degraded semiarid steppes that involved the construction of branch piles to attract frugivores as potential seed-dispersing birds, promoting seed rain, and fostering the formation of woody patches. We measured the success of branch piles in terms of the number of bird visits and seed input compared to naturally occurring shrub patches. Generally, frugivorous birds visited branch piles less frequently than shrub patches. Yet, branch piles accumulated seeds of patch-forming shrub species. Seed rain was higher under patches of the dominant shrub Rhamnus lycioides than under branch piles. In contrast, woody patches and branch piles did not differ in seed input of the less abundant Pistacia lentiscus shrub. Our study demonstrates that branch piles are used by frugivorous birds and accumulate seeds of patch-forming shrubs. Branch piles may be a suitable method to promote the expansion of bird-dispersed plant species and restore semiarid wooded steppes. However, their efficiency largely depends on pile persistence and economic cost.

Is prescribed fire a suitable management tool to reduce shrub encroachment in palm savannas?

Disruption of natural fire regimes is one of the main causes of shrub encroachment, and the use of prescribed fire is a common strategy used to restore these ecosystems. In this study, we provide information about how a palm tree savanna under a process of shrub encroachment responds to the reintroduction of fire. We describe the effects of a first fire event on vegetation composition and structure using an experimental approach. We examine a species-specific response to the fire. After one prescribed fire event applied to four study areas of 16 ha each, we analyzed the change in vegetation physiognomy and composition in burned and control plots for 1 year. Low-intensity prescribed fire decreased height and cover of most shrub species and increased herbaceous vegetation cover over time. We classified shrub and herbaceous species response to fire according to the time they became present and their phenological characteristics. Our results can help stakeholders to determine if prescribed fire is helpful at reducing shrub encroachment in short term in similar ecosystems, considering how plant community responds to the reintroduction of fire after decades of fire suppression.

Interannual variation in precipitation and other planting conditions impacts seedling establishment in sown plant communities	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						ecological restoration; precipitation; seed sowing; seedling establishment; tallgrass prairie; year effects	GRASSLAND RESTORATION; BIODIVERSITY; CONTINGENCY; INCREASES; FRAMEWORK; ECOLOGY; REPLICATION; TEMPERATURE; RECRUITMENT; DIVERSITY	Ecological restoration can reverse biodiversity loss worldwide, yet restoration goals and outcomes vary widely, which limits this potential. Divergent restoration outcomes may stem from variation in conditions at the outset of restoration, but empirical evidence is lacking and typically confounded with site differences. Additionally, precipitation is usually cited as the source of this variation, although a wide range of conditions can vary annually. We tested for effects of planting year on seedling establishment by installing identical restorations in three different years. Within those years, we manipulated rainfall with rain-out shelters to disentangle the effects of precipitation from other annually variable conditions. Additionally, we tested whether increasing seed mix richness buffers against adverse planting conditions. For the first growing season after planting, we followed emergence and survival of sown prairie species and nonsown weed species to determine how planting year conditions influence an establishing plant community, if at all. We found that seedling establishment differed across planting years and precipitation treatments, and that varying emergence patterns by species led to differences in the composition of the first-year community. We also found significant variation in sown species establishment across years when precipitation was held constant, illustrating the previously overlooked role of nonprecipitation drivers on planting year effects. Higher seed mix richness did not consistently improve establishment of sown species under different planting conditions. This research provides important experimental evidence for effects of interannual variation in planting conditions on first-year establishment. Future work will examine how these initial changes affect longer-term assembly dynamics.

Seed banks can potentially act as one source of regeneration for reforestation of old agricultural lands. Our study documents the composition and density of germinants in soil seed banks from four land uses types surrounding the Sinharaja forest in southwest Sri Lanka. These include: (1) kekilla fern lands; (2) pine plantations; and (3) tea. These were compared to the adjacent (4) mature rainforest. During the 6-month period of monitoring, we recorded 1,674 germinants (0.036 germinants/cm(3) soil), representing 46 species. Germinants of tree and shrub species were restricted to the pine and rainforest soils and all of them are considered pioneers. The soils of the rainforest had the lowest species richness, density, and diversity of germinants; tea lands comprised much higher richness, Shannon diversity, and density. However, almost all germinants in tea were grasses and herbs as compared with other land uses. A multivariate analysis of the germinants of soil seed banks revealed that the four land use types comprise very different compositions and abundances, some of which can be associated with differences in growth habit (trees, shrubs, vines, herbs, grasses). Our results suggest that pine plantations may facilitate some tree and shrub regeneration. However, the seed banks beneath tea and kekilla fern land do not comprise any woody plant species. This may explain why agricultural lands such as tea do not revert back to forest easily.	[Weerasinghe, Madhushi; Singhakumara, Balangoda M.

Little is known about woody seedling colonization in restored afrotropical forests. We evaluated effects of restoration methods (active vs. passive), sampling year, restoration age, and distance from old-growth forests on seedling colonization in restored afrotropical moist forests. Seedlings were measured in 2011 and 2014 in 71 clusters of 284 permanent sampling plots (12.6 m(2) each) in actively (initially 3-16 years old) and 21 clusters of 63 plots in passively restored forests (initially 16 years old) in Kibale National Park, western Uganda. Seedlings were also measured in nearby old-growth forests in three clusters of five plots in 2014. We determined species diversity, richness, abundance per plot, and species composition as measures of seedling colonization in restored and old-growth forests. We found that diversity, richness, and abundance of seedlings were significantly higher in passively than actively restored forests. Diversity and richness but not abundance significantly increased between sampling years and with restoration age. Distance from old-growth forests did not significantly affect diversity, richness, and abundance. Species composition of actively and passively restored forests was different from that of old-growth forests after 19 years since restoration started. Our results show that passive restoration should be the preferred method for recovering afrotropical forests, and highlight the effect of continued management on biodiversity of restored forests.

However, most studies usually evaluate structural and species composition parameters, with less emphasis on ecological processes and functioning. The main objective of this study is to use an integrated approach that considers structural and floristic parameters as well as ecological processes and functional traits to evaluate and identify the parameters that most differentiate forests undergoing restoration and their reference sites. Additionally, we tested if the recovery of ecosystem functionality happens at the same rate as the recovery of vegetation structure. We performed the study in three 10-year-old restoration and three adjacent reference areas located in the south of Brazil (subtropical forest). We sampled a total of 15 plots (100 m(2) in size) per treatment, per site and collected data of trees, natural regeneration, litter stock, decomposition, detritivory, and litter and soil C:N ratio. We also used a multifunctionality index to account for the broad functionality of the ecosystem. Results showed that forests undergoing restoration had lower values of vegetation structure and multifunctionality, indicating that restoration sites have not yet achieved values similar to the reference ecosystem. Values for species richness and functional diversity, however, were higher in restoration sites. Moreover, even though values were lower for multifunctionality, differences toward reference sites were less pronounced than we expected when compared to values of vegetation structure, showing that ecological processes may recover even before the full recovery of aboveground vegetation.

When there are no plant nurseries or seeds available on the market, the plant material has to be harvested in the wild, in a "donor ecosystem." A comprehensive assessment of donor ecosystem recovery is lacking, especially for Sphagnum-dominated donor peatlands, where all top vegetation is harvested mechanically with different practices. We aimed to evaluate (1) the regeneration of vegetation, especially of Sphagnum mosses, to determine which harvesting practices are best to enhance recovery and (2) the influence of the site hydrological conditions and meteorological variables of the first complete growing season postharvesting on peat moss regeneration. Twenty-five donor sites covering a 17-year chronosequence (harvested 1-17 years ago) were inventoried along with 15 associated natural reference sites located in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Alberta, Canada. All donor sites aged 10 years or more were dominated by Sphagnum mosses, though plant composition varied between donor and their associated reference sites because of the wetter conditions at harvested donor sites. Harvesting practices strongly influenced donor site recovery, showing that the skills of the practitioner are an essential ingredient. Harvesting practices minimizing donor site disturbances are recommended, such as the choice of the adequate donor site (localization, hydrologic conditions, vegetation), the use of less disruptive methods, and harvesting when the soil is deeply frozen. This study demonstrated that harvesting surface plant material for peatland restoration is not detrimental towards the recovery of near-natural peatland ecosystems.

Fences can support restoration in human-dominated ecosystems when rewilding with large predators	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						deer; fences; predation; restoration; rewilding; wolf	SAVING YELLOWSTONE ASPEN; LANDSCAPE-LEVEL TEST; TROPHIC CASCADES; LARGE CARNIVORES; ISLE ROYALE; WOLVES; WOLF; POPULATION; CONSERVATION; HERBIVORES	The use of fences in conservation can be controversial, as artificial barriers constrain natural behavior and ecological dynamics. However, in the case of large predators inhabiting protected areas within a hostile human-dominated landscape, predators may remain at low densities if they face high mortality upon leaving the reserve. In turn, this may compromise the potential for density-dependent effects such as top-down regulation of prey species abundance. We simulate the hypothetical reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) to reserves in their former range (Scottish Highlands), with the objectives of identifying parameters that allow a viable wolf population and the potential for direct top-down forcing of red deer (Cervus elaphus) densities. We examine the extent to which the number of dispersing wolves leaving the protected area influences whether these objectives are achieved. Our simulations confirm that source-sink population dynamics can result in a self-perpetuating wolf population, but one that never achieves densities needed for strong top-down forcing. When wolf density is weakly controlled by intraspecific competition, strong top-down forcing occurs when 20% of dispersing wolves or less leave the population. When 20-35% of dispersing wolves leave, the strength of top-down forcing is highly variable. The wolf population remained viable when 35-60% of dispersing wolves left, but then did not exert strong top-down forcing. Wolves were vulnerable to extinction at greater than 60% disperser loss. Despite their negative connotations, fences (including semi-permeable ones) could increase the potential for interspecific density-dependent processes in some cases, thereby facilitating trophic rewilding.

This study offers a novel restoration technique to revert abandonment of natural breeding sites by a secondary cavity avian bird, the European roller (Coracias garrulus), and other ecologically similar species. We found that, after a program of nest box supplementation with ensuing monitoring, rollers gradually abandon nesting in natural and seminatural cavities in favor of nest boxes because the latter are of higher quality. We examine whether reducing the entrance size of natural and seminatural cavities improves their suitability for rollers. A 6-year program reduced the diameter of the entrance of sandstone cavities and cavities in bridges. This led to a high occupancy (59%) of manipulated nest-sites. Manipulated sites were most frequently occupied by rollers and little owls (Athene noctua) (31 and 18% of sites, respectively). Manipulation did not affect clutch size or fledgling success. We suggest that nest-site diversity and nesting in natural cavities should be preserved to reduce nest box dependence. Our study illustrates the value of nest boxes when used alongside restoration of natural breeding sites and provides insights for the management of natural cavities.

Assessing the effects of forest-to-bog restoration in the hyporheic zone at known Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) spawning sites	MIRES AND PEAT			English	Article						dissolved oxygen; peatland; potassium; river; sediments	SURFACE-WATER CHEMISTRY; BLANKET PEAT; TEMPORAL VARIATION; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; FINE SEDIMENT; GROUNDWATER; PHOSPHORUS; QUALITY; PLANTATIONS; SPRUCE	In the UK, large areas of blanket bogs were afforested with non-native conifers between the 1960s and the 1980s. Following recognition of the detrimental effects of such practice on biodiversity and carbon stocks, large-scale restoration trials started in the late 1990s and are further supported by recent changes in policy. The removal of forestry from peatlands is likely to be a widespread land-use change in the coming decades and could affect adjacent freshwater systems. This study aimed to investigate whether forestry removal with drain blocking affected nearby spawning sites used by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We analysed the chemistry of hyporheic (beneath and just above the streambed) and surface water, and measured sediment deposition upstream of, within and downstream of a forestry block in the north of Scotland, during and after restoration management operations. We found no immediate effect of management except on potassium and zinc concentrations, which increased after restoration. The general lack of effect is attributed to catchment properties, including the small proportion of catchment (< 5 %) affected by management, and to dilution effects related to heavy precipitation during the intervention phase. We suggest that longer-term monitoring should be implemented as the sizes of areas undergoing restoration management increases.

Environmental DNA sampling as a surveillance tool for cane toad Rhinella marina introductions on offshore islands	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						eDNA; Containment; Detection probability; Islands; Sensitivity; Surveillance	OCCUPANCY	Containing the spread of established invasive species is critical for minimizing their ecological impact. Effective containment requires sensitive sampling methods capable of detecting new introductions when invaders are at low density. Here we explore whether environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling could be used as a surveillance tool to detect new incursions of aquatic invasive species on offshore islands. We develop an eDNA molecular assay for invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia, validate our assay on the mainland, and apply it to an offshore island (Moreton Island) that is a target of ongoing cane toad surveillance. Our eDNA assay correctly identified four mainland sites at which cane toads were observed, as well as a fifth site within 1km of known populations. Five additional sites outside the cane toad's current distribution tested negative for cane toad eDNA. Site occupancy detection models indicated that two water samples and three qPCR replicates were sufficient to achieve a cumulate detection probability>0.95. Applying our eDNA assay to samples from 19 sites on an offshore island over a 2-year period revealed the absence of cane toad eDNA, in line with our current understanding of cane toad distribution. Our results suggest that eDNA sampling could be strategically applied to meet the Australian Commonwealth's objective of maintaining cane toad-free offshore islands.	[Tingley, R.; Weeks, A.

The present study shows dot distribution maps (at 10-years intervals from its introduction in 1986 to the present) and discusses the dynamics of its invasion, altitudinal distribution and ecological preferences. During the 30years of its invasion, C. introflexus has spread widely throughout Poland and is currently known in 248 locations. A total of 93.1% of these are below 300m a.s.l., and the maximum altitude is 780m. With the passage of time since its first appearance this alien moss has occupied larger numbers of substrates and habitats. Currently C. introflexus is a component of 34 plant communities belonging to 18 habitat types. The most invaded habitats include young forest tree plantations and mature managed forest developed from old plantations (Pinus sylvestris woodland). This moss is frequently found in acidophilous semi-natural forests and inland dunes with Corynephorus and Agrostis grasslands, boggy woodland, dry heaths, and ruderal habitats. Although 30 cryptogam species were found in tufts of the alien moss, there is no characteristic species composition that constantly accompanies its presence.

The Enemy of my enemy' hypothesis (EEH) predicts that native plants are more negatively impacted by enemies (e.g. pathogens) that accumulate and spillover from the invader's rhizosphere than the invaders themselves, thereby facilitating the invasion. We tested EEH using Vincetoxicum rossicum, one of the most invasive plant species in Eastern North America, and a total of eight co-occuring native plant species. Specifically, we predicted that the native species would grow less in presence of soil biota associated with V. rossicum than that from uninvaded soils. Field soils were collected from four V. rossicum invaded and neighboring uninvaded areas for use in two experiments. In Experiment 1, V. rossicum and each of five native plant species were grown in a plant growth chamber for 3months, either in presence or absence of soil biota from the invaded and uninvaded soils. We found that only one species (Solidago canadensis) supported EEH. In contrast, the legume Desmodium canadense more than doubled its biomass in response to V. rossicum -associated soil biota. In Experiment 2, four native legume species, including D. canadense, were examined for EEH in the same manner as in Experiment 1. Only one species (Lespedeza hirta) supported EEH and, again, V. rossicum-associated soil biota was advantageous to D. canadense. In summary, we found inconsistent support for the EEH between V. rossicum and native co-occurring species in Eastern North America. We conclude that the accumulation of rhizosphere enemies in native plants may not be a major factor in the invasive success of V. rossicum.

Evidence for evolution of increased competitive ability for invasive Centaurea solstitialis, but not for naturalized C-calcitrapa	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Biogeography; Centaurea calcitrapa; Centaurea solstitialis; Competitive response; Competitive effect; Competition; Congeners; EICA; Evolution; Exotic; Invasion; Plants	INTERREGIONAL HYBRIDS; NO EVIDENCE; PLANTS; HERBIVORY; RANGE; ROOT; DISTURBANCE; SPECIALIST; NEIGHBORS; WEAPONS	Congeneric species with the same native and non-native ranges, but exhibiting different invasiveness, provide opportunities to assess the relative importance of factors contributing to successful invasions. For example, comparing the competitive ability of such congeners against other species from the native and non-native regions of invasive species can provide insight into the role of evolutionary experience with different competitors. We selected two congeneric Centaurea species with overlapping native and non-native ranges but with strikingly different invasive success, Centaurea solstitialis and C. calcitrapa, and conducted experiments with populations from each region using a suite of different native grass species from each region. When grown with Spanish grass species, competitive responses were 32% stronger for C. calcitrapa and 30% stronger for C. solstitialis, than when in competition with grasses native to California. Centaurea solstitialis from California had 66% higher competitive effects on grasses, all species considered together, than Spanish C. solstitialis; whereas the competitive effects of C. calcitrapa on grasses were not significantly different between C. calcitrapa ranges. Our results are consistent with the prediction that the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) might contribute to the devastating success of C. solstitialis in California, and that its absence might contribute to the modest naturalization of the non-invasive C. calcitrapa. Escape from the strong competitive effects and responses of grasses from Spain may also contribute to invasive success in California. Our results suggest that studies of EICA should be based on competitive tests, since biomass alone is not always a good predictor of competitive ability.

Common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, is an invasive annual species in Europe causing serious problems due to its highly allergenic pollen and as an agricultural weed. Recent studies have modelled the broad-scale distribution of the species and assessed future invasion risk, but for predicting the expected outcome of ragweed invasion we also need a mechanistic understanding of its local invasion success. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the invasibility of eight common non-arable habitat types and the role of soil disturbance in central Hungary, in the hot spot of ragweed invasion in Europe. Seed addition alone resulted in negligible amount of ragweed biomass, except for sites where disturbance was part of the present management. Soil disturbance alone resulted in ragweed at those few sites where ragweed seeds were present in the seed bank, related to farming in recent decades. When disturbance and seed addition were combined, ragweed emerged in all habitat types and reached high biomass in all habitat types except for closed forests. As our experiment showed that most habitat types have high invasibility when disturbed, we conclude that ragweed has a high potential for further spread, even in this heavily infested region. Management should focus on preventing seed dispersal and eradicating establishing populations where ragweed is still absent, while reducing soil disturbance may be needed to avoid ragweed emergence in infested sites. This latter may require a reconsideration of land-use practices in infested regions.

Citizen engagement in the management of non-native invasive pines: Does it make a difference?

We present in this paper the assessment of the effectiveness of a volunteer program for the control of invasive pines in a protected area (PA) in a coastal zone of southern Brazil. Volunteer work has been ongoing for 8years and the current state of invasion was compared with three simulation scenarios of species distribution that considered suitable habitats for pine invasion. Our results suggest that management actions have been effective. In the absence of any control efforts, pine trees would cover a high percentage of suitable habitats within the PA. Eliminating adult pine trees that function as seed sources and not allowing the next generation to reach maturity has been an efficient control strategy that has led to changes in the population structure of pines in the PA. Reaching neighboring private property owners is key for the future effective control of pines in the area, as all sources of pine seeds need to be eliminated. The approach used in our study may be applied to broader spatial scales to provide a baseline for management efforts needed to effectively control non-native invasive species.

A small-bodied cyprinid fish native to continental Europe and introduced in the 1970s to the U.K, the sunbleak Leuciscus delineatus, has been shown previously to establish closer social associations with native species of similar size than do native species amongst themselves. To assess the potential detrimental trophic consequences of native species associations with L. delineatus, a field-based experiment was undertaken in summer 2015 in six outdoor, artificial ponds containing three native cyprinid species (rudd Scardinius erthrophthalamus, gudgeon Gobio gobio, tench Tinca tinca). Three ponds were controls (no L. delineatus) and three were treatments (L. delineatus present). The results of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of fish tissue samples provided strong evidence that the isotopic niches of both native benthic fishes were reduced in the presence of L. delineatus, although there were no significant effects on the trophic position, body size or condition of two of the three native fish species. Introduced L. delineatus maintained a core isotopic niche that was distinct from the two native benthic fishes, with no overlap detected between native and non-native fishes when including 40% and 95% of the data. These results indicate that the response of the native fishes to the introduction of L. delineatus was niche constriction via trophic specialisation, with this response sufficient to maintain their growth rates and condition. This result is similar to studies on a range of small-bodied invasive fishes, suggesting the trophic impacts of these invaders are relatively consistent across species and systems.

Feral horses degrade alpine and sub-alpine ecosystems and damage habitat of a range of threatened species. Despite this, there is little published work to document the extent and severity of these impacts. This study investigated impacts of feral horses on treeless drainage lines at 186 sites across the Australian Alps. The study included sites in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria. We assessed nine variables related to soil and stream stability and vegetation cover, which in turn influence ecosystem function and habitat quality. We found significant differences among horse-occupied and horse-free sites for all soil and stream stability variables assessed. For all variables assessed, the average score (and hence, condition) was worse in horse-occupied areas. The sites in poorest condition were occupied by horses. Impacts from other mammalian herbivores species appeared to be minor. Management intervention is necessary if these impacts of feral horses are to be addressed.

This species is endemic primarily to the mountain regions of south-eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania, with a disjunct population at Barrington Tops. The Broad-toothed Rat's preferred habitat is being increasingly impacted by browsing and trampling associated with the expansion of feral horse populations. This study surveyed 180 sites supporting preferred habitat for this species to determine Broad-toothed Rat presence and relative abundance in relation to the level of feral horse impacts within the reserve. There was a significant negative relationship between feral horse impacts and both Broad-toothed Rat presence and abundance. No scats were identified at localities where feral horse impacts were severe, and at moderate horse impact sites, there was a proportion (34%) without scats found. Locations with low horse impacts had little impact on Broad-toothed Rat occurrence. As feral horse populations increase, Broad-toothed Rat populations may be further impacted. Such impacts will be due to the loss of vegetation cover from feral horse trampling and grazing, making animals more vulnerable to predation by predators or impacting on their ability to disperse to more suitable habitat. Habitat remnants and vegetation corridors along drainage lines require protection from feral horses to prevent localized extinctions of Broad-toothed Rat.

The direct impacts of feral herbivores on plant communities are well studied, but the direct and indirect effect they have on wildlife is not well understood. In Victoria (south-eastern Australia), a large feral Horse (Equus caballus) population coincides with highly sensitive and nationally endangered Alpine Sphagnum Bogs and Associated Fens communities, and several threatened animal species. We assessed the impact of feral horses on this ecological community and the Alpine Water Skink (Eulamprus kosciuskoi) and the Broad-toothed Rat (Mastacomys fuscus) at 20 sites with varying levels of horse disturbance. We used scat counts to determine an index of feral horse abundance and quantified impacts associated with their presence in the landscape. Active searches were used for Alpine Water Skink and scat and runway surveys for Broad-toothed Rat. We also measured the vegetation structure and the abundance of different vegetation types (life forms). Our results suggest that feral horses are associated with vegetation types and characteristics that negatively influence the presence or abundance of Alpine Water Skink and Broad-toothed Rat. Sites with high horse activity had more low-growing forbs, and the abundance of Alpine Water Skink was negatively related to this vegetation type. Grasses, sedges, rushes and shrubs were also less dense and lower in height in high horse activity sites, and Broad-toothed Rat was less likely to be present in areas with these habitat attributes. We recommend that feral horses are controlled to protect these threatened vertebrate species and their Sphagnum bog habitat.

Gametophyte niche differences among sympatric tree ferns	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						abiotic driver; alternate life-stage; community assembly; growth rate; niche-partitioning; establishment	ECOLOGY	Forest community assembly is usually framed in terms of sporophyte dynamics; however, the recruitment and maintenance of fern populations, frequently influential in forest composition and structure, are initially determined by gametophytes. Sporophytes of three Cyathea tree fern species show habitat partitioning along gradients of phosphorus and light; we asked whether gametophyte niche differences parallel this pattern. To compare niche characteristics among taxa we compared growth rates to a size threshold (>= 3 mm) of gametophytes under controlled conditions using a multi-factorial, multi-level (3 x 4) experiment, varying irradiance (5.4 +/- 4.4; 59.1 +/- 44.3; 107 +/- 74.1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and orthophosphate concentrations (5, 10, 20, 40 mg kg(-1)). Gametophytes of the pioneer species C. medullaris developed to the size threshold across a broad range of phosphate and irradiance treatments (more than 20% of gametophytes in >= 7 of the 12 treatments), peaking at 20 mg kg(-1) P and 60 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) irradiance. The growth rates of the forest understorey species C. dealbata and C. smithii also peaked at 60 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) but varied across treatments, suggesting niche differentiation along irradiance and orthophosphate gradients. Our analysis suggests that gametophyte development is strategically aligned to the ecological habits of sporophytes and that forest community assembly is likely strongly influenced by the independent gametophyte life-stage.

Vertical differentiation in tropical forest butterflies: a novel mechanism generating insect diversity?	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						genomic differentiation; vertical stratification; butterfly diversity; tropical forests	FRUIT-FEEDING BUTTERFLIES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY	Many tropical fruit-feeding nymphalid butterflies are associated with either the forest canopy or the understorey; however, the exceptions offer insights into the origins of tropical diversity. As it occurs in both habitats of tropical forests in Ecuador and Peru, Archaeoprepona demophon is one such exception. We compared patterns of occurrence of A. demophon in the canopy and understorey and population genomic variation for evidence of ecological and genetic differentiation between habitats. We found that butterfly occurrences in the canopywere largely uncorrelated with occurrences in the understorey at both localities, indicating independent demographic patterns in the two habitats. We also documented modest, significant genome-level differentiation at both localities. Genetic differentiation between habitat types (separated by approx. 20 min elevation) was comparable to levels of differentiation between sampling locations (approx. 1500 km). We conclude that canopy and understorey populations of A. demophon represent incipient independent evolutionary units. These findings support the hypothesis that divergence between canopy and understorey-associated populations might be a mechanism generating insect diversity in the tropics.

Rational choice of social group size in mosquitofish	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						rationality; decoy effect; decision-making; Gambusia affinis	MATE CHOICE; POECILIA-RETICULATA; FISH; DISCRIMINATION; PREDATION; SELECTION; BEHAVIOR; SHOALS	Choice of social group can affect the likelihood of survivorship and reproduction for social species. By joining larger social groups-shoals-small freshwater fish like the mosquitofish Gambusia affinis can reduce predation risk and forage more efficiently. We tested shoal choice in mosquitofish to determine whether such choices are economically rational, i.e. consistent and optimal. Although many studies of decision-making assume rational choice, irrational decision-making is common and occurs across contexts. We tested rationality of shoaling decisions by testing the constant ratio rule, which states that the relative preference for two options should not change in the presence of a third option. Female mosquitofish upheld this rule when tested for shoal preference based on group size. Our results contrast with other studies showing violations of the constant ratio rule in foraging and mate choice decision-making contexts. These results suggest that decisions that immediately influence survivorship or decision-making along a single dimension may favour rational decision-making.

Such interactions, however, may be affected by forest fragmentation as fungi are susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance. To examine how fragmentation affects fungus-induced seed and seedling mortality, we sowed seeds of six plant species in soils collected from 21 forest fragments. We compared seedling establishment in unmanipulated soils to soils treated with fungicides. Fungicides increased germination of Toona ciliata seeds and decreased mortality of Syzygium rubicundum and Olea dioica seedlings. The fungus-induced mortality of one of these species, S. rubicundum, decreased with decreasing fragment size, indicating that its interactions with pathogenic fungi may weaken as fragments become smaller. We provide evidence that a potential diversity-maintaining plant-fungus interaction weakens in small forest fragments and suggest that such disruptions may have important long-term consequences for plant diversity. However, we emphasize the need for further research across rainforest plant communities to better understand the future of diversity in fragmented rainforest landscapes.

Soil bioengineering stabilizes mountain slopes and limits impacts on ecosystems and is increasingly used worldwide, yet its effectiveness requires better assessment through post-intervention environmental monitoring. However such studies are only rarely performed even though they are essential to improve future intervention. This study reports soil and vegetation monitoring data of an area in the Italian Alps in which soil bioengineering work was carried out to restore an area hit by landslides. The monitoring involved an analysis of the floristic-vegetational and ecological features of the plant communities of the area of the soil bioengineering intervention (and in adjacent areas), as well as an analysis of the chemical-physical characteristics of the soils (texture, pH, organic matter, nitrogen content, roots depth) where these communities were established. The results of the monitoring, analyzed in the overall framework of the state of the art of the sector, have highlighted some lines of research and action that should be undertaken by technicians, researchers, and politicians to innovate and to make work aimed at the stabilization of landslides more effective. In particular, it would be extremely useful to study the biotechnical characteristics of herbaceous plants that are still unknown in soil bioengineering and to evaluate their possible effects on ecosystems in order to produce seed mixtures that, besides being useful for soil stabilization, can accelerate vegetation dynamics, therefore maximizing the success of such works.

To evaluate the effects of B. attramentaria on carbon flow in intertidal flat ecosystems, we estimated the annual respiration of B. attramentaria from field surveys and laboratory experiments. The densities of the snails, as determined at an intertidal flat of the Seto Inland Sea, western Japan, were 235-485 individuals m(-2). Temperature and snail size strongly affected their respiration rates, as determined by measuring their CO2 emission rates using an open-flow infrared gas analyzer method. The respiration rates were higher in the submerged condition than in the air-exposed condition. Based on the size structure of the natural population, laboratory experiment results, and environmental factors in the field (temperature and duration of the ebb/flood tide), we estimated the respiration in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, as 1.9, 2.4, and 4.0 g C m(-2). The total amount of carbon mineralized annually by the respiration of B. attramentaria exceeds 10% of that mineralized through sediment respiration. Based on these data and respiration/ingestion ratios in previous reports, we conclude that B. attramentaria has a significant impact on the carbon flows in intertidal flat ecosystems.

This study applied Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) to understand residents' anxieties about potential incidents caused by climate change in Amami islands, Japan. Through an interview with stakeholders, we selected five potential incidents for our BWS attributes: damage caused by typhoon and heavy rain (typhoon), damage caused by flood and a landslide (flood), damage from a drought (drought), damage from ciguatera fish poisoning (ciguatera), and incident caused by jellyfish (jellyfish). Changes in frequencies of the abovementioned incidents have already been observed in Japan. In 2016, we conducted a questionnaire survey of residents in Amami islands and received over 700 valid responses to BWS questions. Results showed that the average respondent was most anxious about the risk of typhoon, followed by flood, drought, ciguatera, and jellyfish. Furthermore, a comparative analysis did not find large variations among the islands in the residents' anxiety ranking concerning the incidents, but the degrees of their anxieties were different. The Amami-Oshima residents, for example, had relatively higher anxieties about flood, whereas the Okinoerabujima residents showed higher anxiety about drought. These findings support that their risk perceptions are determined by their experience and surrounding environments. Understanding the sensitivity of residents to climate change risk will encourage stakeholders to communicate and enhance climate change adaptation in local communities.

Here, we investigated the relationship between pollinator dependence and production stability of 40 crops in Japan and show that the global relationship does not apply at the local scale, i.e., most pollinator-dependent crops showed stable production and most pollinator-independent showed instable production possibly because of local policies and agricultural practices. Examining relationships at the local scale will help establish effective local management of pollination services and crop production.

In this study, biophysical and socio-economic data, farmers' community surveys and secondary data from remote sensing on soil characteristics and water demand were used to evaluate the predictors of drought in inland valley rice-based production systems and the factors affecting farmers' mitigation measures. The study intervened in three West African countries located in the Sudan-Sahel zone, viz. Burkina Faso, Mali and Nigeria. Significant drying trends occurred at latitudes below 11 degrees 30' whilst significant wetting trends were discerned at latitude above 11 degrees 30'. Droughts were more frequent and had their longest duration in the states of Niger and Kaduna located in Nigeria and in western Burkina Faso during the period 1995-2014. Among 21 candidate predictors, average annual standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and duration of groundwater availability were the most important predictors of drought occurrence in inland valleys rice based-production systems. Land ownership and gender affected the commitment of rice farmers to use any mitigation measure against drought. Drought studies in inland valleys should include climatic water balance and groundwater data. Securing property rights and focusing on women's association would improve farmers' resilience and advance drought mitigation measures.

The spatial distribution of humus forms depends on environmental factors such as topography, climate and vegetation. In montane and subalpine forests, environmental influences show a high spatial heterogeneity, which is reflected by a high spatial variability of humus forms. This study aims at examining spatial patterns of humus forms and their dependence on the spatial scale in a high mountain forest environment (Val di Sole/Val di Rabbi, Trentino, Italian Alps). On the basis of the distributions of environmental covariates across the study area, we described humus forms at the local scale (six sampling sites), slope scale (60 sampling sites) and landscape scale (30 additional sampling sites). The local variability of humus forms was analyzed with regard to the ground cover type. At the slope and landscape scale, spatial patterns of humus forms were modeled applying random forests and ordinary kriging of the model residuals. The results indicate that the occurrence of the humus form classes Mull, Mullmoder, Moder, Amphi and Eroded Moder generally depends on the topographical position. Local-scale patterns are mostly related to micro-topography (local accumulation and erosion sites) and ground cover, whereas slope-scale patterns are mainly connected with slope exposure and elevation. Patterns at the landscape scale show a rather irregular distribution, as spatial models at this scale do not account for local to slope-scale variations of humus forms. Moreover, models at the slope scale perform distinctly better than at the landscape scale. In conclusion, the results of this study highlight that landscape-scale predictions of humus forms should be accompanied by local- and slope-scale studies in order to enhance the general understanding of humus form patterns.

Two groups of respondents, professionals (working in urban green areas) and individuals (with no professional connection with trees) revealed their attitudes towards trees by assessing statements in a survey questionnaire. Similar general attitude from professionals and nonprofessionals towards the examined benefits and harms related to urban trees was observed. Tree benefits were perceived as much more important than the annoyance they might cause. However, 6% of nonprofessionals found only negative aspects in trees, proving to be arboriphobes. No arboriphobes and no Tree sceptics were among the professionals. Around 40% of the respondents in the two groups found the number of trees in the surrounding areas too low. The nuisance caused by trees was seen as more disturbing by younger and lower-educated professionals. Women tended to assess trees as more attractive and as having a stronger influence on socioeconomic contributions than men. Men dominated the Tree indifferent group. The attractiveness of trees and their impact on socioeconomic contributions were related to the place of residence and the level of education among the nonprofessionals. The level of education of the nonprofessionals was also connected to being clustered into one of the four abovementioned groups of respondents. A majority of medium and big city dwellers as well as a minority of villagers were in the Tree liking cluster.

There is a limited understating of the complex response of fungal diversity to different organic materials in clay loam soil. Here, we report the response of soil fungi toward the short-term application of manure (M), sugarcane straw (S), and sugarcane straw plus manure (MS), including no organic material control (CK) at two different time points (50 and 100 days after application). Illumina sequencing was used to examine the fungal communities. Our results reveal a significant shift among the soil fungal community structure associated with each organic material application. After both time points, amendments-especially M and MS-decreased the fungal richness and stimulated the copiotrophic fungal group (Ascomycota) compared to the control soil (CK) and S-amended soil. On the contrary, as compared to the M and MS-amended soils, the CK and S-amended soils at both time points increased the fungal richness and stimulated the oligotrophic fungal groups. Organic material use, especially M and MS, showed variable results regarding pathogenic fungi enhancing the abundance of Lophodermium and Cercophora and decreasing Fusarium. Concerning the abundance of plant-beneficial fungi, Mortierella was reduced, and Podospora was increased by M and MS input. FUNGuild showed that the amendment of organic materials efficiently declined the abundance of endophytes and plant pathogens, but also enhanced the animal pathogens in terms of abundance with respect to CK at two time points. This study could be useful to provide a novel understanding of the management of soil-borne pathogens by organic amendments for the sustainable production of short-term crops.

Phenology varies within and among populations, and can be influenced by conditions individuals experience both prior to departure and encounter en route. Assessing how intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., individual physical condition vs. environmental conditions) interact to influence variation in migratory phenologies across ecological scales is often limited due to logistical constraints associated with tracking large numbers of individuals from multiple populations simultaneously. We used two natural tags, DNA and otolith microstructure analysis, to estimate the relative influence of individual traits (life-history strategy, body size at departure and growth during migration), population-specific behaviours and interannual variability on the phenology of marine migrations in juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. We show that the timing and duration of juvenile sockeye salmon migrations were correlated with both life-history strategy and body size, while migration duration was also correlated with departure timing and growth rates during migration. Even after accounting for the effect of individual traits, several populations exhibited distinct migration phenologies. Finally, we observed substantial interannual and residual variation, suggesting stochastic environmental conditions moderate the influence of carry-over effects that develop prior to departure, as well as population-specific strategies. Migratory phenologies are shaped by complex interactions between drivers acting at multiple ecological and temporal scales. Given evidence that intraspecific diversity can stabilize ecological systems, conservation efforts should seek to maintain migratory variation among populations and preserve locally adapted phenotypes; however, variation within populations, which may buffer systems from environmental stochasticity, should also be regularly assessed and preserved.

Body size is a key trait central to many life-history traits and behaviours. Correlations with body size may constrain behavioural variation in response to environmental changes, especially when size itself is influenced by environmental conditions. Urbanization is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear. Using web building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we evaluated direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity. We additionally studied urbanization at two spatial scales to account for some environmental pressures varying across scales and to obtain first qualitative insights about the role of plasticity and genetic selection. Spiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. Web surface and mesh width decreased with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. The latter two responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability in cities. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes, and web traits appear independent from each other. Our results demonstrate that responses in size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximization in novel environments. The spatial scale at which traits respond suggests contributions of both genetic adaptation (for web investment) and plasticity (for mesh width). Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, A. diadematus abundances were similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level.

In terrestrial ecosystems, prey often shift between various vegetation types whose cover determine their vulnerability (i.e., likelihood of being killed when attacked). We conceptualized that in terrestrial ecosystems, DM could also occur and that the contribution of DM and shifts in vegetation cover use in reducing predation risk should depend upon the predator behaviour and the correlation between encounter risk and vulnerability across vegetation types. We further hypothesized that when the predator distribution is predictable, terrestrial prey could have evolved DM strategies taking them away from the predator when it is active or efficient. We investigated whether plains zebras Equus quagga perform DM in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe). There, zebras can forage in large patches of open grasslands located near waterholes where they can also easily detect predators. However, they are there at high risk of encountering their main predator, lions Panthera leo, especially at night. We found out that zebras employ a DM anti-predator strategy. Zebras forage near waterholes during the day but move away from them at sunset, when lions become active. We demonstrated that this DM, occurring over a few kilometres, dramatically reduces their night-time risk of encountering lions, which generally remain close to waterholes. Zebra changes in night-time selection for vegetation cover types reduced their risk of encountering lions much less. This may arise from a trade-off between encounter risk and vulnerability across vegetation types, with zebras favouring low vulnerability once DM has reduced encounter risk. In summary, here we (a) quantify, in a terrestrial system, the effect of a predator-induced DM on the likelihood of encountering a predator and (b) distinguish the effects of the DM on encounter risk from those related to day/night changes in selection for vegetation types. We discuss how prey partition their risk between encounter risk and habitat-driven vulnerability and why it is likely critical to understand the emergence of anti-predator behavioural strategies.

The crab spider-pitcher plant relationship is a nutritional mutualism that is dependent on prey-resource quality	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						facilitation; Henriksenia labuanica; Misumenops nepenthicola; Nepenthes gracilis; Nutritional mutualism; resource quality; substitutable resources; Thomisus nepenthiphilus	DIGESTIVE MUTUALISM; NEPENTHES; COMPETITION; ATTRACTION; PREDATION; FRAMEWORK; OUTCOMES; CAPTURE; STRESS; MODELS	Nutritional mutualisms are one of the three major categories of mutualisms and involve the provision of limiting nutrients (resources) to one species by another. It was recently shown in laboratory experiments that two species of pitcher-dwelling crab spiders (Thomisidae), Thomisus nepenthiphilus and Misumenops nepenthicola, increased capture rates of flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) for their host, Nepenthes gracilis. The spiders ambushed pitcher-visiting flesh flies and dropped their carcasses into pitchers after consuming them. The consumption of shared prey-resources by crab spiders and pitcher plants presents the possibility of parasitism between them. However, ecologically generalizable mechanisms that predict the context-dependent outcomes of such mutualisms are not known. The effectiveness framework (mutualism effectiveness = quality x quantity) is useful for examining the total effect of mutualisms, but its quality component can be difficult to define. We identify the crab spider-pitcher plant interaction as a type of resource conversion mutualism and propose that the quality component in such interactions is the amount of the underlying resource contained in each unit of resource processed. We then used the crab spider-pitcher plant interaction to test the hypothesis that resource conversion mutualisms are more beneficial to the nutrient recipient when operating through high-quality resources (i.e., large prey, in this interaction). We sampled the prey and inquilines of 107 N. gracilis upper pitches in situ and analysed the differences between pitchers that were inhabited or uninhabited by crab spiders, and the differences between nutritional contents of prey that were consumed by crab spiders or not. Pitchers inhabited by T. nepenthiphilus contained higher numbers of several prey taxa, many of which were flying insects. Consumption by T. nepenthiphilus reduced the nutrient contents in all prey examined. Overall, T. nepenthiphilus-assisted prey capture is likely to result in a net nutrient gain for N. gracilis that is proportional to the size of prey consumed by T. nepenthiphilus. Our results suggest that resource conversion mutualisms are more likely to operate through high-quality resources, since the nutrient-processing species necessarily reduces the quality of the resource it processes while increasing its availability to the nutrient recipient species.

While this pattern has been investigated for a wide range of organisms, ecosystems and geographical gradients, whether these changes vary more cryptically across different forest strata (from ground to canopy) remains elusive. Here, we investigated the influence of ground vs. arboreal assemblages to the general distance-decay relationship observed in forests. We seek to explain differences in distance-decay relationships between strata in the context of the vertical stratification of assemblage composition, richness and abundance. We surveyed for a climate-sensitive model organism, amphibians, across vertical rainforest strata in Madagascar. For each tree, we defined assemblages of ground-dwelling, understory, or canopy species. We calculated horizontal distance-decay in similarity across all trees, and across assemblages of species found in different forest strata (ground, understory and canopy). We demonstrate that within stratum comparisons exhibit a classic distance-decay relationship for canopy and understory communities but no distance-decay relationships for ground communities. We suggest that differences in horizontal turnover between strata may be due to local scale habitat and resource heterogeneity in the canopy, or the influence of arboreal traits on species dispersal and distribution. Synthesis. Biodiversity patterns in horizontal space were not consistent across vertical space, suggesting that canopy fauna may not play by the same set of "rules" as their conspecifics living below them on the ground. Our study provides compelling evidence that the above-ground amphibian assemblage of tropical rainforests is the primary driver of the classical distance-decay relationship.

Land-use change alters the mechanisms assembling rainforest mammal communities in Borneo	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						beta-diversity; community assembly; environmental filtering; land-use change; mammals; oil palm agriculture; selective logging; species co-occurrence	BETA-DIVERSITY; ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; USE INTENSITY; LANDSCAPE; IMPACTS; HOMOGENIZATION; HETEROGENEITY; COEXISTENCE	The assembly of species communities at local scales is thought to be driven by environmental filtering, species interactions and spatial processes such as dispersal limitation. Little is known about how the relative balance of these drivers of community assembly changes along environmental gradients, especially man-made environmental gradients associated with land-use change. Using concurrent camera- and live-trapping, we investigated the local-scale assembly of mammal communities along a gradient of land-use intensity (old-growth forest, logged forest and oil palm plantations) in Borneo. We hypothesised that increasing land-use intensity would lead to an increasing dominance of environmental control over spatial processes in community assembly. Additionally, we hypothesised that competitive interactions among species might reduce in concert with declines in alpha-diversity (previously documented) along the land-use gradient. To test our first hypothesis, we partitioned community variance into the fractions explained by environmental and spatial variables. To test our second hypothesis, we used probabilistic models of expected species co-occurrence patterns, in particular focussing on the prevalence of spatial avoidance between species. Spatial avoidance might indicate competition, but might also be due to divergent habitat preferences. We found patterns that are consistent with a shift in the fundamental mechanics governing local community assembly. In support of our first hypothesis, the importance of spatial processes (dispersal limitation and fine-scale patterns of home-ranging) appeared to decrease from low to high intensity land-uses, whilst environmental control increased in importance (in particular due to fine-scale habitat structure). Support for our second hypothesis was weak: whilst we found that the prevalence of spatial avoidance decreased along the land-use gradient, in particular between congeneric species pairs most likely to be in competition, few instances of spatial avoidance were detected in any land-use, and most were likely due to divergent habitat preferences. The widespread changes in land-use occurring in the tropics might be altering not just the biodiversity found in landscapes, but also the fundamental mechanics governing the local assembly of communities. A better understanding of these mechanics, for a range of taxa, could underpin more effective conservation and management of threatened tropical landscapes.

However, if newly restored or created sites are of low quality, they may act as sinks that draw individuals away from better quality sites to the detriment of metapopulation size. Following intensive conservation effort, the metapopulation of roseate tern (Sterna dougallii) in NW Europe is recovering from a large crash in numbers, but most former colonies remain unoccupied and hence are potential targets for restoration. To inform conservation efforts, we studied the dynamics of this metapopulation with a multistate integrated population model to assess each of the three main colonies for important demographic contributors to population growth rate, source/sink status and possible density dependence. All three study colonies are managed for roseate terns (and other tern species) in similar ways, but the demographic processes vary considerably between colonies. The largest colony is a source involved in almost all dispersal, and its growth is determined by survival rates and productivity. Productivity and juvenile apparent survival at the largest colony appear to be density-dependent. Although the mechanisms are unclear, this may provide an increasing impetus for emigration of recruits to other colonies in future. The smallest of the three colonies is a sink, relying on immigration for its growth. Simulation models suggest the metapopulation would be c. 10% larger in the absence of dispersal to the sink colony. This work indicates that, due to variable site quality, aims to enhance both distribution and size of metapopulations may be mutually exclusive. In this case, before future attempts to encourage recolonisation of former sites, assessments of site suitability should be undertaken, focusing on food availability and isolation from predators to maximise the likelihood of attaining levels of productivity and survival that avoid creation of a sink population to the detriment of the overall metapopulation size.

Occasional long distance dispersal increases spatial synchrony of population cycles	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						dispersal kernel; Euplotes; metapopulations; microcosms; protists; spatial synchrony; Tetrahymena	PHASE-LOCKING; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; TIME; EXTINCTION; COHERENT; SPACE; SCALE	Spatially separated populations of the same species often exhibit correlated fluctuations in abundance, a phenomenon known as spatial synchrony. Dispersal can generate spatial synchrony. In nature, most individuals disperse short distances with a minority dispersing long distances. The effect of occasional long distance dispersal on synchrony is untested, and theoretical predictions are contradictory. Occasional long distance dispersal might either increase both overall synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony, or reduce them. We conducted a protist microcosm experiment to test whether occasional long distance dispersal increases or decreases overall synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony. We assembled replicate 15-patch ring metapopulations of the protist predator Euplotes patella and its protist prey Tetrahymena pyriformis. All metapopulations experienced the same dispersal rate, but differed in dispersal distance. Some metapopulations experienced strictly short distance (nearest neighbour) dispersal, others experienced a mixture of short- and long distance dispersal. Occasional long distance dispersal increased overall spatial synchrony and the spatial scale of synchrony for both prey and predators, though the effects were not statistically significant for predators. As predicted by theory, dispersal generated spatial synchrony by entraining the phases of the predator-prey cycles in different patches, a phenomenon known as phase locking. Our results are consistent with theoretical models predicting that occasional long distance dispersal increases spatial synchrony. However, our results also illustrate that the spatial scale of synchrony need not match the spatial scale of the processes generating synchrony. Even strictly short distance dispersal maintained high spatial synchrony for many generations at spatial scales much longer than the dispersal distance, thanks to phase locking.

In particular, total sexual production is often unaffected by such events, whereas worker number responds with a prominent increase. To resolve these conflicting observations, we model-using an established approach-the expected change in worker and sexual numbers in response to an increased worker productivity induced by mass-flowering events at different times of the season. We find that the predicted response pattern is mainly shaped by the degree to which individual worker productivity is reduced by an increasing number of workers in the colony. Different environmental conditions and colony characteristics result in different levels of interference of workers, for example, during foraging or nest construction. Reduction in individual productivity is low, when worker interference is negligible ("weak limitation") and high when an increasing number of workers substantially decreases per-capita efficiency ("strong limitation"). For weak limitation, any mass-flowering event that ends before the production of sexuals starts has a strong multiplicative impact on both worker and sexual numbers. The magnitude of the effect is quite independent of the precise timing of such an event. After the onset of sexual production, mass-flowering has a weaker effect, as the added resource supply is only linearly transferred into production of additional sexuals. For colonies under strong limitation, the predicted impact of mass-flowering events is generally weaker, especially on the production of sexuals, and the timing of mass-flowering events becomes more influential: Production of sexuals profits more from late than from early mass-flowering events. Consequently, early mass-flowering events are predicted to have a prominent effect on worker numbers but a negligible one on the output of sexuals. The model presented provides a mechanistic explanation of why increased worker abundances do not necessarily translate into increased production of sexuals. The model is also applicable to other eusocial insects such as paper wasps whenever brief pulses of massive resource availability shortly elevate resource intake rates above the "normal" levels.

Variation in such nutrient feedbacks could affect plant fitness, but few studies have explored the eco-evolutionary dynamics of within-species nutrient feedbacks, and the role that soil communities may play in mediating plant evolutionary responses. We investigated whether a widespread Populus species regulates soil fertility, resulting in positive nutrient feedbacks that influence population divergence. Here, we combined field observations, a reciprocal transplant experiment, and soil community sequencing to test how nutrient feedbacks might facilitate plant adaptation to soil environments. We find that: (1) Plant populations exist along a soil fertility gradient in the field and display trait variation consistent with positive nutrient feedbacks, (2) populations assemble distinct soil prokaryotic communities that are structured by soil chemistry, (3) populations show inconsistent patterns of local adaptation to their soil communities, however (4) genetic variation in plant-soil interactions reinforces soil nutrient differences. Soil communities may mediate variation in plant adaptation across a soil fertility gradient such that plant-soil interactions reinforce positive nutrient feedbacks. Identifying the eco-evolutionary links between plant trait variation, soil nutrients and microbial communities demonstrates that plants modify and adapt to soil environments. These results support the hypothesis that eco-evolutionary feedbacks may result when plant-soil interactions (eco) affect ecosystem-level processes that sustain population-level feedbacks and selective gradients (evo).

But, due to their complexity, these effects are often considered separately and their relative strength, acting simultaneously, remains unknown. In a semi-natural field experiment using tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) and the specialised tansy-aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride Stroyan as a model system, we compared the effects of four distinct plant chemotypes (i.e., bottom-up), defined by the bouquet of their volatile terpenoids, on aphid population dynamics by manipulating the presence/absence of mutualistic ants and presence/absence of naturally occurring predators (i.e., top-down). Predators reduced aphid abundance and colony survival but did not reduce initial growth rate due to a time-lag until predators arrived on the plants. Ants directly benefited initial aphid growth rates and abundance, even in the absence of predators, but not the number of days an aphid colony persisted on the plant. Plant chemotype directly affected aphid growth rate and final abundances across the different plants and indirectly affected the abundances of tending ants and predators through effects on aphids. We found that tending ants were more abundant on one plant chemotype. Although ant abundance did not affect aphid population development, it became clear that ants had a preference towards aphids on certain chemotypes. However, a higher number of predators led to a lower number of aphids. The results confirm the importance of plant chemical variation, acting through multiple effects on many species in arthropod communities, and support results from field studies. In a natural population, with a diverse selection of host-plant variants, aphid populations and their interacting species can therefore be structured at the level of an individual plant. Specialist aphids on patchily distributed host plants can exhibit metacommunity dynamics at very local scales. Plant within-species variation within a local population is often ignored in metacommunity ecology, yet our work shows that this can have strong effects on insect-ant-natural enemy dynamics, and therefore, future research should incorporate this into current theory and experimental studies.

Oxidative stress, which results in accumulated cellular damages, is one of the mechanisms suggested to play a role. In this paper, we set out to test the "oxidative stress theory of ageing" and the "oxidative stress hypothesis of life histories" using a comprehensive phylogenetic comparison based on an unprecedented dataset of oxidative physiology in 88 free-living bird species. We show for the first time that bird species with longer lifespan have higher non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and suffer less oxidative damage to their lipids. We also found that bird species featuring a faster pace-of-life either have lower non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity or are exposed to higher levels of oxidative damage, while adult annual mortality does not relate to oxidative state. These results reinforce the role of oxidative stress in the evolution of lifespan and also corroborate the role of oxidative state in the evolution of life histories among free-living birds.

This study investigates the patterns of divergence and discusses the processes that form and maintain divergent lineages of the tsetse fly Glossina fuscipes fuscipes in Uganda. We sampled 251 flies from 18 sites spanning known genetic lineages and the four admixture zones between them. We apply population genomics, hybrid zone and approximate Bayesian computation to the analysis of three types of genetic markers: 55,267 double-digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD) SNPs to assess genome-wide admixture, 16 microsatellites to provide continuity with published data and accurate biogeographic modelling, and a 491-bp fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and II to infer maternal inheritance patterns. Admixture zones correspond with regions impacted by the reorganization of Uganda's river networks that occurred during the formation of the West African Rift system over the last several hundred thousand years. Because tsetse fly population distributions are defined by rivers, admixture zones likely represent both old and new regions of secondary contact. Our results indicate that older hybrid zones contain mostly parental types, while younger zones contain variable hybrid types resulting from multiple generations of interbreeding. These findings suggest that reproductive barriers are nearly complete in the older admixture zones, while nearly absent in the younger admixture zones. Findings are consistent with predictions of hybrid zone theory: Populations in zones of secondary contact transition rapidly from early to late stages of speciation or collapse all together.

Early-breeding females experience greater telomere loss	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						biological ageing; life history evolution; reproductive timing; telomeres	LONG-LIVED BIRD; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; POSTFLEDGING SURVIVAL; PHYSIOLOGICAL COSTS; SEASONAL-VARIATION; QUANTITATIVE PCR; GROUND-SQUIRREL; IMMUNE FUNCTION; HATCHING DATE	Annual reproductive success is often highest in individuals that initiate breeding early, yet relatively few individuals start breeding during this apparently optimal time. This suggests that individuals, particularly females who ultimately dictate when offspring are born, incur costs by initiating reproduction early in the season. We hypothesized that increases in the ageing rate of somatic cells may be one such cost. Telomeres, the repetitive DNA sequences on the ends of chromosomes, may be good proxies of biological wear and tear as they shorten with age and in response to stress. Using historical data from a long-term study population of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), we found that telomere loss between years was greater in earlier breeding females, regardless of chronological age. There was no relationship between telomere loss and the annual number of eggs laid or chicks that reached independence. However, telomere loss was greater when temperatures were cooler, and cooler temperatures generally occur early in the season. This suggests that environmental conditions could be the primary cause of accelerated telomere loss in early breeders.

Wood decomposition is more rapid on than off termite mounds in an African savanna	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						ecosystem engineers; ecosystem processes; heterogeneity; Macrotermes mounds; nutrient cycle; soil fauna; Uganda	LITTER DECOMPOSITION; NUTRIENT-POOR; RATES; HETEROGENEITY; MECHANISMS; RESISTANCE; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; TURNOVER; TRAITS	Decomposition is important for nutrient cycling and the dynamics of soil organic matter. The factors that influence local decomposition rates in savannas dominated by Macrotermes mounds remain uncertain. Here, we experimentally assessed the effects of macro-and micro-detritivores, active and inactive mounds, and vegetation cover on wood decomposition rates for eight common woody plant species in Lake Mburo National Park, in Uganda. Five pairs of Macrotermes mounds, one active and one inactive per pair, were selected. Each mound provided two sample locations, one, the most shaded (with canopy cover), and one, the most open (without canopy cover) edge of mound. In addition, for each mound pair, one additional sample location was located off-mound, in an open level area between the mounds. After one, three, and 12 months, protected (wrapped in 1-mm mesh fiber-glass excluding macrodetritivores) and unprotected wood samples from each location were retrieved, brushed clean, oven-dried, and weighed. After 12 months, mean percentage mass loss was four times higher for unprotected than protected wood samples across all species located on mound sites (when decomposition in shaded and open microhabitats was combined). Mean percentage mass loss across all species combined was 1.2 times higher on active than inactive mounds. Across all mounds, decomposition was on average 1.1 times more rapid in the shaded than open mound parts. These differences were more pronounced on inactive mounds (1.3 times more rapid in the shaded than open parts). Percentage mass loss was markedly lower off-mound (12.6 +/- 0.8%) than on active (25.9 +/- 1.5%) or inactive mounds (19.7 +/- 1.2%). Proportional mass loss for unprotected wood decreased with increasing wood density, but proportional mass loss of protected wood samples was not detectably influenced by wood density. Our study highlights the strong and locally contingent influence of termite mounds, termite activity, vegetation, and their interactions on wood decomposition rates within a savanna landscape. Furthermore, variation in per-species wood decomposition rates, including the negative correlation with wood density, depends on accessibility to macrodetritivores.

The trophic ecology of a desert river fish assemblage: influence of season and hydrologic variability	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						bluehead sucker; Colorado River; desert rivers; flannelmouth sucker; flood pulse; food web; humpback chub; Little Colorado River; seasonal diet; speckled dace	COLORADO RIVER; LIFE-HISTORY; FOOD-WEB; NONNATIVE FISHES; RESOURCE PULSES; GRAND-CANYON; DYNAMICS; DIET; DIVERSITY; STABILITY	Foodweb analyses can provide insight as to how species persist in naturally dynamic environments and how these communities may respond to anthropogenic alteration. In the remaining undammed rivers of the arid southwestern United States, it is thought that plasticity in feeding behavior allows native fishes to thrive in the context of natural fluctuations in temperature, sediment, and resource availability associated with extreme swings in season and hydrology. There have been few evaluations of this hypothesis, in part owing to the rarity of rivers that retain their natural environmental dynamics and complement of native species. We investigated the feeding ecology of the fish assemblage of one such river, the Little Colorado River, Arizona, focusing on four native species: bluehead sucker (Catostomus discobolus), flannel-mouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), and endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha). Over two years, we sampled fish diets in July, September, January, March, and June, encompassing turbid and clear-water conditions across seasons. We quantified food resource contributions to fish diets in fish-centered food webs, comparing diversity of trophic linkages and linkage-strength distribution across time. We used ordination analyses to investigate differences in diets among species and changes in diet composition across seasons and conducted seasonal comparisons of gut fullness. We observed a high diversity of dietary items (as absolute numbers and consumer-resource ratios) within a fish assemblage that was apparently resistant to extreme and recurrent environmental variability. Fish diet diversity was similar to 2x that of the nearby dammed Colorado River's tailwater, and over 50% of fish-resource linkages were weak (<1% of species' diet). Native fishes consumed a mix of terrestrial and aquatic resources. Notably, the water column-feeding humpback chub consumed the largest percentage of terrestrially derived food items and appeared to capitalize on food resources made available by a summer flash flood, consuming twice as much during this flood than during other seasons (based on gut fullness, corrected by estimates of food quality). Other fishes exhibited similar dietary variation. Such opportunist/generalist strategies, coupled with diverse food resources, may be important to the persistence of these and other native fishes in dynamic environments.

Plant-pollinator networks in grassland working landscapes reveal seasonal shifts in network structure and composition	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						grassland ecology; insect conservation; native bee; plant-pollinator interactions; working landscape	FRUIT-SET; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; SPECIES RICHNESS; FLORAL RESOURCES; BEE DECLINE; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; INCREASES	Declines in native bee populations can limit pollination services that support native plant communities and global food production. Mitigating the impacts on pollinators and ecosystems requires conservation actions that promote biodiversity and remain practical for producers. We investigated plantpollinator interaction networks in working grassland landscapes, managed for cattle production and biodiversity, to advance conservation of pollinators in grazed systems. We compared and plotted interactions at the network level. We then used a regression framework to evaluate the influence of floristic availability on pollinator abundance in our system. Overall, we detected seasonal shifts at the network level, with increased specialization between flowers and bees occurring at the end of the sampling season. Furthermore, the response to floristic resources differed between honey bees (Apis mellifera) and native bees. While honey bee abundance increased with exotic floral abundance, native bee abundance showed no relationship with floral abundance and instead was positively associated with floral richness in our system. These findings could be an indication of seasonal shifts in bee activity and interactions with plants or a response to the subset of available resources in grazed systems. These interpretations, along with the detected difference in resource use between honey bees and native bees, suggest foraging preferences differ between these two groups and could influence conservation and management strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates a need to consider how management practices could influence bee communities differentially across the growing season and suggests conservation actions should promote native floristic resources to benefit native bees.

Previous work has focused on observations of species' interactions at carcasses, and although fruitful, the inclusion of behavior beyond that at carcasses, such as movement patterns, could yield a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of foraging niche partitioning. Our goal was to assess how differences in physiological, morphological, and social characteristics between sympatric black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) manifest interspecific variation in movement patterns, foraging habitats, and carcass use to reduce direct competition. Both species are obligate scavengers that co-occur across much of the New World. Turkey vultures are solitary foragers with enhanced olfactory capabilities and wings optimized for energy-efficient low-altitude soaring. Black vultures are aggressive, heavier bodied, and forage socially. We assessed interspecific variation in carcass exploitation using experimental carcass trials encompassing a range of habitats, carcass sizes, and seasons, and used GPS telemetry to compare how soaring conditions influenced daily space use and diurnal patterns of movement activity for each species. Turkey vultures occurred more often at small (i.e., rabbit) carcasses, and those obscured by forest cover than black vultures, and were the first vultures recorded at 94% of carcasses visited by both species. Both species increased movement rates and daily ranges when soaring conditions were favorable; however, turkey vultures had higher travel rates regardless of soaring conditions. Our results suggest the olfactory sense of turkey vultures allows them to locate smaller and visually obscured carcasses more efficiently than black vultures, facilitated by wing morphology that allows them to forage over large areas efficiently. Socially foraging black vultures appear specialized at locating larger carcasses in open habitats, which does not require as much foraging flight as turkey vultures. Our study illustrates how inclusion of movement ecology into niche partitioning studies provides a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence in avian scavenger guilds. This approach may provide important information to guide conservation efforts, such as supplemental feeding, of imperiled vulture species.

We assessed the impact of repeated applications of fuel reduction treatments on abundance and diversity of ants within upland mixed-hardwood forests in the Southern Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina, USA. We established three replicate blocks (similar to 56 ha each) and split each block into four fuel reduction treatments, which included prescribed burning (B), mechanical felling (M), a combination of prescribed burning and mechanical felling (MB), and a control (C; i.e., no treatment). We implemented treatments multiple times (two mechanical thinnings and four prescribed burns) over the course of a 15-yr period. Due to tree mortality and resultant canopy gaps from high-severity burns, forest structure was dramatically altered in MB. Over a 3-yr period (2014-2016), we captured 54,219 ants comprised of 23 genera using pitfall and colored pan traps. Prenolepis imparis was the most common ant species collected, and it was significantly lower in abundance in MB than all other treatments. However, the non-native species Brachyponera chinensis was more abundant in MB than all other treatments. Thus, some fuel reduction treatments may have consequences for invasive ant colonization in forests. Most ant taxa did not differ in abundance among treatments, suggesting that some fuel reduction practices may affect some, but not all ant species. Our results indicate that some fuel reduction treatments can alter forest ant communities, thus contributing to changing forest ecosystem dynamics. Monitoring of ants and other bioindicators after repeated rounds of fuel reduction treatments could provide useful knowledge that can be used to help balance forest management and biological diversity.

Quantifying specialist avifaunal decline in grassland birds of the Northern Great Plains	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						conservation; grassland birds; grasslands; niche; specialism	POPULATION-SIZE; MODELS; COMMUNITY; EXPANSION; ABUNDANCE; IMPACTS; NICHE; OIL	Habitat specialists are declining worldwide, often paralleling rapid loss of habitat. Grassland habitats across North America are declining precipitously, due in part to intense conversion of grasslands to agriculture and rangelands, and specialist communities reliant upon this landscape are at particular risk of decline and collapse. We explored the relationship between grassland habitat specialism in birds and species population trends using several different grassland specialism indices (GSIs). Our data sources for these indices included (1) a regional bird dataset employing a spatially stratified sampling design (Integrated Monitoring of Bird Conservation Regions) of bird surveys in the Northern Great Plains of North America, and (2) geospatial data of species ranges (BirdLife Int'l) and grassland habitat (CEC North American Land Cover). We found a negative relationship between degree of habitat specialism and species population trends for all specialism metrics. We also found some evidence to support that specialism to grasslands on the wintering grounds partially explains population trends during the breeding season, giving added weight to the consideration of habitat conservation across the full annual cycle of a species to reverse or lessen population decline. Our work is the first to use quantitative methods to confirm the precarious state of grassland specialist songbirds in North America as well as demonstrate multiple methods for quantifying habitat specialism across different types of datasets.

Variation in spawning phenology within salmon populations influences landscape-level patterns of brown bear activity	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						brown bear; foraging duration; grizzly bear; phenological tracking; phenology; resource portfolio; resource waves; sockeye salmon	PLANT PHENOLOGY; SOCKEYE-SALMON; RESOURCE WAVES; PACIFIC SALMON; TEMPERATURE; MIGRATION; ECOLOGY; TIME; LIFE; HETEROGENEITY	Animal consumers track spatial variation in resource phenology (i.e., resource waves) to prolong their access to ephemeral foods. While recent work has revealed how animals move across landscapes to exploit phenological variation among discrete foraging patches, much less is known about how variation nested within patches influences the spatiotemporal pattern of foraging opportunities and the behavior of consumers. Local, within-patch, variation in phenology influences levels of resource ephemerality and could dictate how frequently consumers must move to continuously exploit a pulsed food source. Here, we explore how within-site (stream) phenological variation relates to the duration of salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) runs and its consequences for brown bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi) foraging behavior. We accurately quantified salmon run duration across a large number of spawning streams (21 site-year combinations). We found that salmon run duration varied threefold among spawning sites and that the source of prolonged runs was within-site variation in spawning phenology (i.e., the timing of arrival at spawning grounds). Although the estimated reproductive lifespan varied among sites, a simulation suggested that reproductive lifespan has little influence on salmon run duration. Salmon run duration strongly predicted the duration of site occupancy by bears, demonstrating that phenological variation within salmon populations compliments among-population variation to alleviate time constraints on salmon consumption. To explore whether within-population variation in salmon phenology was related to spatial variation in habitat conditions (as is the case with among-population phenological variation), we monitored water temperature, salmon availability, and bear activity across a longitudinal gradient in Connecticut Creek, the study stream with the most prolonged salmon run. Spawn timing varied spatially, occurring first in cold headwater reaches and later in warmer downstream reaches. Patterns of bear presence closely tracked this spawning sequence, suggesting they "surf salmon waves" not only across landscapes but also within spawning sites. However, a coarser analysis across multiple sites suggests phenological variation within salmon populations may not always be spatially structured. Our results demonstrate one way in which local variation in phenology can influence consumer foraging behavior, highlighting the need to understand the causes and consequences of phenological variation at multiple scales.

These wetland sites differed in size, but were nearly identical in general locality, structure, hydrology, vegetative composition, available resources, and biodiversity. Home ranges for male cottonmouths at the larger Cooper WMA (n = 16; 95% kernel density estimate (KDE) (X) over bar = 54.69 ha +/- 9.36; 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP) (X) over bar = 22.9 ha +/- 4.19) were significantly larger than those at the smaller Commerce WA (n = 10; 95% KDE (X) over bar = 19.88 ha +/- 4.71; 100% MCP (X) over bar = 8.98 ha +/- 2.27). The home ranges of males (n = 26; 95% KDE (X) over bar = 41.3 ha +/- 6.84; 100% MCP (X) over bar = 17.55 ha +/- 3.00) were also significantly larger than those of females (n = 7; 95% KDE (X) over bar = 7.04 ha +/- 1.81; 100% MCP (X) over bar = 3.08 ha +/- 0.82) at both sites. We found no relationship between body size and home range size at either study site. Average weekly distance traveled by males ((X) over bar = 110.07 m +/- 10.80) was significantly greater than that of females ((X) over bar = 45.04 m +/- 4.34), and male movement rates were bimodal in distribution with peaks of movement in the spring and fall. These peaks in movement rates coincided with the spring and fall migrations for mating, thermoregulation, parturition, and access to hibernacula and food resources. We found home ranges within these two-dimensional wetlands to be larger than those reported for linear or one-dimensional riparian sites. We discuss how wetland size and the size-dependent dispersion of potential resources within similar wetlands may influence movement patterns and home range sizes. Such information may serve to evaluate effective wetland size for the conservation and management of wetland species.

Growth and quality of Fagus sylvatica saplings depend on seed source, site, and browsing intensity	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						clipping experiment; European beech; Fagus sylvatica; genecology; herbivory; progeny test; provenance test; simulated browsing; tree regeneration; ungulate browsing	DOUGLAS-FIR; TREE REGENERATION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORWAY SPRUCE; SILVER FIR; BEECH; PROVENANCE; FORESTS; IMPACT	Local climate and ungulate browsing are two major factors that affect tree regeneration and genetic adaptation in Central European forests. Owing to climate change and increasing ungulate numbers, the abiotic and biotic environments of trees are changing remarkably, making it necessary to investigate the separate and joint effects of seed source (i.e., location of tree population origin) and ungulate herbivory. We used a common garden experiment to study the growth and morphology of Fagus sylvatica saplings from 77 Swiss seed sources. The experiment was set up at two sites and included a clipping treatment (i.e., terminal shoot clipped at two intensities) applied before budburst to simulate winter ungulate browsing. We studied F. sylvatica sapling growth and morphology before and two years after clipping. Measured growth traits included sapling height, stem diameter, and biomass. Morphological traits included multi-stemming, stem and crown form, stem quality, and reaction to clipping. Seed source, test site, and simulated leader browsing were all important in determining the growth and quality of F. sylvatica saplings. The effects of seed source on growth and quality indicate that F. sylvatica possesses a large pool of diverse genotypes across Switzerland and thus has the potential to adapt to local conditions through gene flow. Growth and morphology differed significantly between the two test sites, indicating that local environments should be considered carefully when a new plantation is established. The effect of the single simulated browsing event disappeared over time for the growth traits, owing to growth compensation. However, sapling quality decreased after clipping, suggesting that browsing may lead to persistent quality losses in production forests. Neither the growth nor the morphological reaction after clipping depended on the effect of population, meaning that resilience to browsing was independent of seed source. Consequently, interactions with ungulate browsing do not have to be taken into account when selecting F. sylvatica populations for particular climatic and site conditions.

This difference in colonization/extinction balance should manifest as larger continental range distributions and modulate the species-area relationship on true islands. We evaluated these predictions using data for 1216 species of butterflies and moths that differed with regard to inter-individual variation in color pattern. We show that species with more variable color patterns have larger continental range sizes in Europe compared with non-variable species. We also provide rare evidence that the slope of the species-area relationship on islands is steeper for species having non-variable color patterns, suggesting that to preserve 60% of non-variable species would require an area twice as large compared to what would be needed to preserve 60% of variable species. Our findings suggest that combining information on ecological characteristics with presence/absence data from small and medium sized islands can help identify traits that drive species range patterns at the continental scale, and that individual variation in color pattern can be used as a proxy for ecological generalization and the ability to cope with environmental change.

To support development of a red abalone fishery management plan, non-governmental organizations have initiated expanded data collection and developed fishery management strategies. The latter is the subject of this study, as we present a management strategy evaluation (MSE) of a multi-indicator decision tree. The decision tree relies on landings from each of 56 fishing sites and length frequency information collected during fishery-independent diver surveys at a subset of sites. The decision tree was designed to cope with existing data limitations and to ensure that localized meta-population dynamics were adequately considered in decision-making. It was also necessary to balance the potential for localized abundance changes with the practical issue of implementing fishery regulations at larger spatial scales. The MSE demonstrated that undesirably low stock sizes could be avoided while also continuing to maintain a viable fishery, even under environmental conditions that are detrimental to abalone populations. Under less-severe environmental conditions, stock size was maintained, on average, above the biomass associated with production of maximum sustainable yield. Our discussion centers on steps that were taken to refine the decision tree and to incorporate feedback from scientists and stakeholders and to facilitate transparent evaluation of management options.

Although a number of studies have addressed responses of plant phenology to warming and altered precipitation individually, their interactions can alter plant phenology differently than either does independently. To explore how the interactions between global change drivers alter alpine ecosystems, we conducted a factorial experiment manipulating warming (ambient and +2 degrees C) and altered precipitation (50% decrease, control, and 50% increase) simultaneously in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Over two years, we monitored plant phenological events, leafout day and first flowering day, for 11 common plant species that account for 74.4% of the total above biomass. Surprisingly, there was no interaction between warming and changes in precipitation on community plant phenology, but warming advanced leaf-out and first flowering day by 7.10 and 9.79 d, respectively. Unlike the community response, plant functional groups had a variety of direct and interactive responses to the experimental climate drivers. While the phenology of legumes was most influenced by temperature, temperature and precipitation interacted to alter the phenology of grasses and forbs. To explore how plant phenological sensitivity on the Tibetan Plateau is compared with other meadow ecosystems, we combined our dataset with a global plant phenology dataset. Interestingly, the phenological sensitivity of leaf-out day and first flowering day on the Tibetan Plateau is 7.3 and 37.8 times greater than global phenological sensitivity, respectively. This result highlights that a meta-analysis of global phenological sensitivity may significantly underestimate change in some regions-even regions as large as the Tibetan Plateau. Together, our results suggest that the Tibetan Plateau may experience rapid change as temperatures warm and that these changes will likely be more rapid than in other regions of the world. Further, our study highlights that if we are to make accurate predictions of how plant phenology may change with warming, we need to understand the specific environmental cues that drive phenological responses across different areas.

Climate will increasingly determine post-fire tree regeneration success in low-elevation forests, Northern Rockies, USA	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						burn severity; climate change; conifer regeneration; dry mixed-conifer forest; forest resilience; range shifts; Rocky Mountains; wildfire	PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS; CONIFER REGENERATION; SEVERITY WILDFIRE; FIRE REGIMES; TEMPERATURE; PATTERNS; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; ESTABLISHMENT; AVAILABILITY	Climate change is expected to cause widespread shifts in the distribution and abundance of plant species through direct impacts on mortality, regeneration, and survival. At landscape scales, climate impacts will be strongly mediated by disturbances, such as wildfire, which catalyze shifts in species distributions through widespread mortality and by shaping the post-disturbance environment. We examined the potential for regional shifts in low-elevation tree species in response to wildfire and climate warming in low-elevation, dry mixed-conifer forests of the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. We analyzed interactions among climate and wildfire on post-fire tree seedling regeneration 5-13 yr post-fire at 177 sites burned in 21 large wildfires during two years with widespread regional burning. We used generalized additive mixed models to quantify how the density of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine seedlings varied as a function of climate normals (30-yr mean temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration) and fire (tree survivorship, burn severity, and seed source availability). Mean summer temperature was the most important predictor of post-fire seedling densities for both ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. Seed availability was also important in determining Douglas-fir regeneration. As mean summer temperature continues to increase, however, seed availability will become less important for determining post-fire regeneration. Above a mean summer temperature of 17 degrees C, Douglas-fir regeneration is predicted to be minimal regardless of how close a seed source is to a site. The majority (82%) of our sampled sites are predicted to exceed a mean summer temperature of 17 degrees C by mid-century, suggesting significant declines in seedling densities and potential forest loss. Our results highlight mechanisms linking climate change to shifts in the distribution of two widely dominant tree species in western North America. Under a warming climate, we expect post-fire tree regeneration in these low-elevation forests to become increasingly unsuccessful. Such widespread regeneration failures would have important implications for ecosystem processes and forest resilience, particularly as wildfires increase in response to climate warming.

Investigations determining the impact of this invasion on population state variables and community dynamics of rodents have largely occurred at the community or species level, creating a knowledge gap as to whether rodents affiliated by a shared taxonomy or other grouping are differentially affected by cheatgrass invasion. We examined rodent abundance along a gradient of cheatgrass cover using various groupings of two nocturnal rodent taxa comprising the majority of the rodent community in the Great Basin Desert. In the summers of 2010-2013, rodents were sampled and vegetation was measured on the U. S. Army Dugway Proving Ground in the Great Basin Desert of Utah, USA. We separately examined estimates of rodent abundance for all combined species within the Cricetidae and Heteromyidae families, the most numerically dominant species, and uncommon species pooled in relation to cheatgrass invasion severity. We detected an expected negative linear relationship between invasion severity and abundance for all cricetid groupings, including the most numerically dominant species, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Unexpectedly, heteromyid abundance exhibited an initial positive relationship, reached a threshold, and then exhibited a negative relationship, a phenomenon driven by Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii), the most numerically dominant species. We speculate this non-linear finding was caused by a combination of trophic and nontrophic pathways. Our findings provide new insight as to the potential for differential effects of cheatgrass on rodents in arid portions of the western United States. We suggest that future investigations on cheatgrass, and plant invader effects in general, consider parsing animal communities of interest by various taxonomic and/or ecological groupings rather than focusing exclusively on individual species or entire communities.

By understanding how scatter hoarders make seed dispersal decisions, we can infer how different plant chemical defenses or seed set strategies may influence seed survival and, ultimately, plant recruitment. We used a wild population of Central American agoutis, Dasyprocta punctata, to experimentally test how seed chemistry and size influence seed fates in a tropical premontane wet forest in Costa Rica. We hypothesized that seeds perceived by agoutis to be very valuable (large, non-toxic seeds) would be taken far from sources and preferentially cached over less valuable (small, toxic) seeds. Using artificial seeds created from baked polymer clay and peanuts, we manipulated seed chemistry (0%, 2%, 15% tannic acid) and size (4, 14, 24 g) in fully factorial paired-choice field experiments. We tracked the fates of individually numbered thread-marked seeds in space and time. There was no difference in the handling, regardless of size, of non-toxic and toxic seeds by agoutis. Large (24 g) seeds were moved farthest and preferentially hoarded by agoutis, whereas small (4 g) seeds were mostly eaten in situ. By experimentally manipulating seed chemistry and size with a high degree of replication using artificial seeds in the field, we have determined how these plant functional traits affect agouti seed dispersal decisions, with implications for plant propagation and the evolution of seed size.

We explored the extent of reported R use in the field of ecology using the Web of Science and text mining. We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4% in 2008 to 58.0% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.

Effects of street lighting technologies on the success and quality of pollination in a nocturnally pollinated plant	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						artificial light at night; environmental change; flowers; Lepidoptera; light pollution; moths	ARTIFICIAL-LIGHT; SILENE-LATIFOLIA; LACANOBIA-OLERACEA; TOMATO MOTH; NIGHT; IMPACTS; CARYOPHYLLACEAE; LEPIDOPTERA; ATTRACTION; POLLUTION	Artificial light at night (ALAN) is an increasingly important driver of global change. Lighting directly affects plants, but few studies have investigated indirect effects mediated by interacting organisms. Nocturnal Lepidoptera are globally important pollinators, and pollen transport by moths is disrupted by lighting. Many street lighting systems are being replaced with novel, energy-efficient lighting, with unknown ecological consequences. Using the wildflower Silene latifolia, we compared pollination success and quality at experimentally lit and unlit plots, testing two major changes to street lighting technology: in lamp type, from high-pressure sodium lamps to light-emitting diodes, and in lighting regime, from full-night (FN) to part-night (PN) lighting. We predicted that lighting would reduce pollination. S. latifolia was pollinated both diurnally and nocturnally. Contrary to our predictions, flowers under FN lighting had higher pollination success than flowers under either PN lighting or unlit controls, which did not significantly differ from each other. Lamp type, lighting regime, and distance from the light all significantly affected aspects of pollination quality. These results confirm that street lighting could affect plant reproduction through indirect effects mediated by nocturnal insects, and further highlight the possibility for novel lighting technologies to mitigate the effects of ALAN on ecosystems.

Using otolith chronologies to understand long-term trends and extrinsic drivers of growth in fisheries	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change responses; ecological stressors; fisheries; fishery-induced evolution; growth history; mixed-effects modeling; otolith chronology; sclerochronology; snapper	CHRYSOPHRYS-AURATUS; FISH GROWTH; EL-NINO; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; AUSTRALIAN SNAPPER; INDUCED EVOLUTION; CLIMATE; POPULATIONS; VARIABILITY; RECRUITMENT	Identifying trends and drivers of fish growth in commercial species is important for ongoing sustainable management, but there is a critical shortage of long-term datasets in marine systems. Using otolith (ear bone) sclerochronology and mixed-effects modeling, we reconstructed nearly four decades (37 yr) of growth across four oceanographically diverse regions in an iconic fishery species, snapper (Chrysophrys auratus). Growth was then related to environmental factors (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, and Southern Oscillation Index) and population performance indicators (recruitment and commercial catch). Across the decades, growth rates declined in the two most productive fishery regions. Chlorophylla (a measure of primary productivity) was the best predictor of growth for all regions, but direction and magnitude of the relationships varied, indicating regional-specific differences in intra-specific competition. Sea surface temperature was positively correlated with fish growth, but negatively correlated after temperature reached optimum thermal maxima, which suggests individuals in warmer regions may be under thermal stress. Growth also decreased at the extremes of the Southern Oscillation Index, indicating fish growth is impeded in significant climatic events. Contrasting relationships between growth, catch, and recruitment indicated regional-specific density-dependent effects, with growth positively correlated with population size in one region but negatively correlated in another. Our results indicate that under future ocean warming and increased frequency of extreme climate events, fish growth and fisheries productivity are likely to be affected. Furthermore, the interactive effects of extrinsic factors also indicated that stressors on fisheries should be managed collectively. We show that otolith chronologies are an effective method to assess long-term trends and drivers of growth in fishery species. Such informed ecological predictions will help shape the sustainable management of fisheries under future changing climates.

CRUSTACEA; FINE-GRAINED SEDIMENT; SIGNAL CRAYFISH; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; INVASIVE CRAYFISH; STREAM; BIOTURBATION; ECOLOGY; RISK	Many taxa possess a range of strategies to reduce the risk of predation, including actively seeking suitable refuge habitats; however, the global spread of invasive species may disrupt these behavioral responses. In lotic ecosystems, interstitial spaces in the substrate are important refugia for small organisms. Some predators are ecosystem engineers that exhibit zoogeomorphic agency-the ability to modify the geomorphology of their environment. It is therefore possible that direct ecological effects of predators on prey may be realized through modifications to the prey's habitat, including the availability of refugia, by predators that are zoogeomorphic agents or via external stressors such as fine sediment loading. This study examined three research questions in a mesocosm study across a gradient of sediment-stress treatments: (1) What affects do predators (Pacifastacus leniusculus, invasive crayfish) and prey (Gammarus pulex, amphipods) have on the ingress of fine sediment into gravel substrates and therefore on available interstitial refugia? (2) Do prey taxa seek refuge from (invasive) predators in the form of vertical movement into subsurface sediments? and (3) How does fine sediment ingress influence predator-prey interactions and prey survival through predator avoidance behavior. Here, we provide direct evidence demonstrating that fine sediment ingress into gravel river beds can be facilitated by zoogeomorphic activity with P. leniusculus increasing the infiltration of fine sand particles (but not coarse sand) during foraging activities. Predator-prey interactions were found to be a primary factor mediating zoogeomorphic activity, with the isolation of crayfish from prey (G. pulex) leading to increased fine sand ingress. When present with signal crayfish, G. pulex displayed vertical avoidance behavior, entering subsurface substrates to evade predation by P. leniusculus. Coarse sand treatments resulted in higher predation rates of G. pulex, most likely due to clogging of interstitial pore spaces between gravels limiting the effectiveness of the prey's vertical avoidance behavior strategy. A new conceptual model that captures the interactions between predator, prey, zoogeomorphic processes and habitat availability is presented. This model highlights how predator-prey interactions can be strongly mediated by dynamic bi-directional interactions between organisms and the physical environment they inhabit as ecological and geomorphological processes are intrinsically linked.

Pyrogenic flowering of Aristida beyrichiana following 50 years of fire exclusion	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						ecological resilience; ecosystem restoration; fire regime; fire-stimulated flowering; Pinus palustris; plant traits; wiregrass	TIME-SINCE-FIRE; REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; RESOURCE DEPLETION; WIREGRASS; SEASON; PATTERNS; PLANTS; AGE	Fire-stimulated or pyrogenic flowering is one of many traits that enable plants in fire-prone ecosystems to persist or dominate following frequent fires. Obligate pyrogenic flowering has long been observed in wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana), a foundation bunchgrass in frequently burned longleaf pine ecosystems in the southeastern United States. Widespread fire exclusion in this ecosystem has contributed to well-documented declines in plant and animal biodiversity prompting the need for restoration efforts. We studied the effect of fire reintroduction on the flowering of wiregrass in northern Florida, USA. Prescribed fires were ignited in a 50-yr unburned site and an adjacent frequently burned site in the summer of 2017. Wiregrass was measured eight months after the burns in both stands. As expected, the frequently burned stand had higher density, basal area, and percent flowering of wiregrass tussocks. Logistic regression revealed that wiregrass initiated flowering at significantly larger sizes in the long-unburned stand. Despite these differences, wiregrass size distributions were similar in both stands, with the long-unburned stand lacking tussocks in the largest (100+ cm(2)) size class. We did not find differences in the number of flower culms per unit of mass between the two stands. Even though diminished in nearly every measure, the ability of wiregrass to flower after five decades of fire exclusion, and presumably no sexual reproduction, provides evidence of resilience of the dominant herb of these ecosystems.

These changes are partially credited with a recent increase in wildfire number and extent, as well as more extreme fire behavior. Fire and herbivory historically interacted, and research has shown that the interaction creates a unique mosaic of vegetation heterogeneity that each disturbance alone does not create. Because fire and grazing have largely been decoupled in modern times, the degree to which the interaction affects fuels and fire regimes has not yet been quantified. We evaluated effects of fire-only and pyric herbivory on rangeland fuels and fire behavior simulated using BehavePlus at four sites across the southern Great Plains. We predicted patches managed via pyric herbivory would maintain lower fuel loads, and less intense simulated fire behavior than fire alone. We found that time since fire was a significant predictor of fuel loads and simulated fire behavior characteristics at all sites. Fuel loads and simulated fire behavior characteristics (flame length and rate of spread) increased with increasing time since fire in all simulated weather scenarios. Pyric herbivory mediated fuel accumulation at all sites. Mean fuel loads in fire-only treatments exceeded 5000 kg/ha within 24 months, but pyric herbivory treatments remained below 5000 kg/ha for approximately 36 months. Simulated flame lengths in fire-only treatments were consistently higher (up to 3 9) than in pyric herbivory treatments. Similarly, fire spread rates were higher in fire-only than in pyric herbivory treatments in all simulated weather conditions. Although all sites had potential to burn in the most extreme weather conditions, pyric herbivory reduced fuel accumulations, flame lengths, and rates of spread across all weather patterns simulated. These reductions extended the amount of time standard wildland firefighting techniques remain effective. Therefore, incorporating pyric herbivory into fuel management practices, in areas of high herbaceous productivity, increases the effectiveness of fuel treatments.

In the boreal forest, there are relatively few urban developments in a matrix of wilderness and apparently suboptimal natural roosting habitat; thus, we hypothesized that isolated rural villages were islands of summer habitat for little brown bats that may be important for their conservation and recovery. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between little brown bat activity, foraging rates, and proximity to rural villages. We expected bat activity and foraging rates to increase with proximity to villages, as bats should optimally forage near their roosts to minimize flight costs. We used ultrasonic detectors to passively monitor bat activity near three rural villages in Yukon, Canada, and characterized bat habitat with forest measurements and remotely sensed data. Bat activity increased with proximity to village centers, but foraging activity did not, suggesting that human settlements in the boreal forest were important as roosting rather than foraging habitat. Bat activity was higher near water bodies and areas with relatively high densities of linear features (e. g., roads and transmission lines), perhaps because prey were most abundant near water features and along forest edges. The island phenomenon we observed (i. e., higher bat activity near villages) has also been documented in larger human settlements at lower latitudes, where urban areas provided better roosting habitat than surrounding agricultural matrices. Given that little brown bats were concentrated near rural villages, small human settlements should be a focus of conservation efforts in the boreal forest-particularly the identification and protection of buildings used as maternity colonies. Our study advances knowledge of little brown bat habitat requirements in the boreal forest and identifies habitats that may be important for their recovery.

River-valley morphology, basin size, and flow-event magnitude interact to produce wide variation in flooding dynamics	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						floodplain ecosystem; geomorphology; hydraulics; hydrology; inundation; morphology; physiography	RIPARIAN VEGETATION; HYDROLOGIC CLASSIFICATION; SOUTHEASTERN FLOODPLAIN; FOREST DEVELOPMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEDIMENT; GEOMORPHOLOGY; CONNECTIVITY; STREAMS; LANDSCAPES	Inundation dynamics are a key driver of ecosystem form and function in river-valley bottoms. Inundation itself is an outcome of multi-scalar interactions and can vary strongly within and among river reaches. As a result, establishing to what degree and how inundation dynamics vary spatially both within and among river reaches can be challenging. The objective of this study was to understand how river-valley morphology, basin size, and flow-event magnitude interact to affect inundation dynamics in river-valley bottoms. We used 2D hydraulic models to simulate inundation in four river reaches from Maryland's Piedmont physiographic province, and qualitatively and quantitatively summarized within-and amongreach patterns of inundation extent, duration, depth, shear stress, and wetting frequencies. On average, reaches from confined valley settings experienced less extensive flooding, shorter durations and shallower depths, stronger gradients of maximum shear stress, and relatively infrequent wetting compared to reaches from unconfined settings. These patterns were generally consistent across flow-event magnitudes. Patterns of within-reach flooding across event magnitudes revealed complex interactions between hydrology and surface topography. We concluded that valley morphology had a greater impact on flooding patterns than basin size: Inundation patterns were more consistent across reaches of similar morphology than similar basin size, but absolute values of inundation characteristics varied between large and small basins. Our results showed that the manifestation of out-of-bank flows in valley floors can vary widely depending on geomorphic context, even within a single physiographic province, which suggests that hydrologic and hydraulic conditions experienced on the valley floor may not be well represented by existing hydrologic metrics derived from discharge data alone. We thus support the notion that 2D hydraulic models can be useful hydrometric tools for cross-scale investigations of floodplain ecosystems.

Shifting global Larix distributions: Northern expansion and southern retraction as species respond to changing climate	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						climate change; coniferous; deciduous; forest; forest-limit; larch; meta-analysis; range shifts; realized niche; tree line	POSTFIRE TREE RECRUITMENT; RANGE SHIFTS; SUMMER TEMPERATURES; EUROPEAN LARCH; SIBERIAN LARCH; BOREAL FORESTS; LINE DYNAMICS; PICEA-MARIANA; FIRE REGIME; VEGETATION	Aim Recent and rapid warming is reorganizing terrestrial vegetation, creating novel species assemblages, and shifting range limits. Relative to the evergreen species that currently dominate much of the boreal forest landscape, Larix (larch) distributions may be particularly responsive to climatic change due to their deciduous habit, and quick growth and reproduction. Here, we amassed data from 83 studies to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. Location Northern hemisphere. Taxon Species of the genus Larix, deciduous gymnosperms. Methods With 181 observations of Larix range limit dynamics, we used five distribution parameters (tree line advance, stand infilling, tree line recession, stand thinning, no response) and their determinants (climate, land use change, natural disturbance) to describe and explain observed patterns of Larix range shifts under contemporary climate change. We ran a redundancy analysis on the matrix of five distribution parameters considered with other climatic and nonclimatic parameters as explanatory variables. We also characterized the climatic niche of Larix species (temperature and precipitation) and how the niche has changed during the 20th century. Results Of 173 sites studied over the full distribution of Larix, 63% experienced Larix population increases, 18% had population decreases, and no response was detected at 19% of sites. Latitudinal Larix tree lines in Siberia and North America appear to be infilling and shifting their distributions northward, whereas Larix recession and thinning was more common in southern regions, suggesting southern populations may be experiencing greater drought stress than their northern counterparts. Climatic niches of most Larix species shifted towards warmer and wetter conditions, with tree line advance/forest infilling in cool/dry climate space, and recession/thinning in warm/dry space. Main conclusions Northern expansion is underway or seems imminent for boreal Larix species, primarily L. laricina in North America. Retraction in southern regions and disappearance of some mountainous populations may be inevitable due to their narrow ecological niches. Species restricted to mountainous habitats may expand locally, though will likely not contribute to broad scale range expansion. These changes will depend on suitable climate, disturbance, and dispersal mechanisms.

Two speed invasion: assisted and intrinsic dispersal of common mynas over 150 years of colonization	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Acridotheres tristis; alien; effective dispersal; gene flow; invasion biology; population genomics; range expansion	POPULATION-GENETICS; ACRIDOTHERES-TRISTIS; URBAN; SOFTWARE; SPREAD; BIRDS; DIFFERENTIATION; MANAGEMENT; INFERENCE; PROGRAM	Aim Despite the common myna's widespread distribution, and the significant impact it has caused in parts of its non-native range, there have been no comprehensive genomic studies of its invasion of any region. We aimed to characterize the common myna invasion of the Australian continent to understand its population genetic landscape, introduction history, dispersal characteristics, and the interconnectedness between different source populations and invasive fronts. Location Common mynas from 26 geographical locations spanning the Australian continent were utilized in this study. Taxon Common myna (Acridotheres tristis). Methods We used a reduced genome representation method (DArTseq) to generate thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism markers in 462 common mynas. We then applied population genomic techniques to identify the common myna's population attributes such as gene flow, genetic diversity, and effective dispersal, all of which are critical for understanding geographical range expansion of pest species. Results We found significant genetic structuring across the common myna's Australian distribution, indicating limited levels of effective dispersal amongst the populations founded from historic introductions in the 19th century. The historic introduction points were found to be genetically distinct, such that in the region on the invasion front where admixture did occur, myna populations exhibited higher genetic diversity than in the source populations. Significant isolation by distance was evident amongst populations derived from the same founding population, with genetic diversity decreasing moving away from the point of colonization, and in general, higher levels of gene flow from source to front than vice versa. Main conclusions This study indicates that despite a 150-year colonization history of mynas in Australia, contemporary genetic structure still largely reflects human-mediated dispersal. However, expanding populations are now connecting and the consequent increased genetic diversity may improve evolutionary potential. These results suggest that more management focus should be directed towards the invasion fronts, rather than the large, historic source populations.

Range expansion of Lymantria dispar dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) along its north-western margin in North America despite low predicted climatic suitability	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						climatic envelope; climatic suitability; gypsy moth; range expansion; snow insulation; suboptimal temperatures; winter mortality	GYPSY-MOTH LEPIDOPTERA; OVIPOSITION SITE SELECTION; SUPRAOPTIMAL TEMPERATURES; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; WINTER TEMPERATURES; COLD-HARDINESS; EGGS; POPULATIONS; MORTALITY; ECOLOGY	Aim The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar (L.), (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) is an invasive defoliator that has been expanding its range in North America following its introduction in 1869. Here, we investigate recent range expansion into a region previously predicted to be climatically unsuitable. We examine whether winter severity is correlated with summer trap captures of male moths at the landscape scale, and quantify overwintering egg survivorship along a northern boundary of the invasion edge. Location Northern Minnesota, USA. Methods Several winter severity metrics were defined using daily temperature data from 17 weather stations across the study area. These metrics were used to explore associations with male gypsy moth monitoring data (2004-2014). Laboratory-reared egg masses were deployed to field locations each fall for 2 years in a 2 x 2 factorial design (north/south aspect x below/above snow line) to reflect microclimate variation. Rates of successful egg hatch were assessed the following springs. Results Reductions in summer male moth captures are associated with several metrics of winter severity, such as minimum temperatures. Most egg masses suffered >95% mortality each winter. However, hatching success reached up to 80% in egg masses that had overwintered below the snow line (e.g., <30 cm from the ground). Main Conclusions Our findings that cold winter temperatures are associated with reduced summer trap captures of European gypsy moth, likely due to increased overwintering mortality of exposed egg masses, are consistent with previous predictions of thermal range boundaries for this species. However, high survival in egg masses deposited close to the ground are consistent with thermal escape in subnivean environs (i.e., below snow cover), and suggest that further northward range expansion will be likely in areas that receive measurable annual snowfall.

However, few studies have explored this idea at a large geographical scale. In a multisite experiment, we unravelled the relationship between ecosystem function and functional completeness of species assemblages using dung beetles as a model group, focusing on dung removal and secondary seed dispersal. Location Seventeen grassland locations across the Western Palaearctic. Methods We used a randomized block design with different exclosure types to control the dung and seed removing activities of individual functional groups of the local dung beetle assemblage. We classified dung beetle species according to resource specialization and into functional groups based on dung processing behaviour (dwellers, tunnellers, rollers) and body size (small, large). Additionally, we assessed the role of other soil macro-invertebrates. By sampling the dung beetle community and measuring the remaining dung and seeds after the experiment, the impact of each functional group was estimated. Results Dung beetle assemblages differed along a north-south and east-west gradient. Dwellers dominated northernmost sites, whereas at lower latitudes we observed more tunnellers and rollers indicating a functional shift. Resource specialists were more abundant in southern and eastern areas. Overall, functional group diversity enhanced dung removal. More dung (+46.9%) and seeds (+32.1%) were removed in the southern sites and tunnellers and rollers were more effective. At the northernmost sites, where tunnellers were scarce or absent, other soil macro-invertebrates removed the majority of dung. Main conclusions The conservation of functionally complete dung beetle assemblages is crucial to maintain the ecosystem functions provided by dung beetles. Given the latitudinal variation in functional group diversity, it is reasonable to expect compositional changes due to climate change. These changes could lead to increased dung removal and a higher secondary seed dispersal rate in northern regions.

Do ecogeographical rules explain morphological variation in a diverse, Holarctic genus of small mammals?	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Bergmann's rule; Gloger's rule; Holarctic; Sorex	FOOD NICHE OVERLAP; BERGMANNS RULE; BODY-SIZE; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS; ECOLOGICAL SEPARATION; ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE; SHREWS; SORICIDAE; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY	Aim We use ecogeographical rules to understand the relationship between biogeography and morphological evolution in Sorex (Linnaeus, 1758) shrews. Specifically, we test for climatic correlations in body size (Bergmann's rule; larger species in colder habitats) and pelage brightness (Gloger's rule; darker species in more humid/warmer habitats). Location North America and Eurasia (Holarctic). Taxon Sorex spp. (Mammalia: Soricomorpha: Soricidae). Methods We compiled body size data for 51 species of Sorex and measured pelage brightness from museum specimens for 43 species. We sourced bioclimatic data across the geographical range of each species as well as specific to the museum specimen localities. For comparative purposes, we also estimated a Sorex phylogeny using existing sequence data. To test Bergmann's and Gloger's rules, we constructed phylogenetic least squares models considering latitude, altitude, and bioclimatic variables as predictors of interspecific variation in body size and pelage brightness across Sorex. We then performed these tests separately for the Palaearctic and Nearctic lineages. Results Sorex exhibits wide variation in both body size and pelage brightness. In models of the entire genus and of the Nearctic clade, neither trait is significantly predicted by the variables tested. A decrease in pelage brightness in the Palaearctic clade is significantly predicted by increasing mean annual temperature and annual precipitation, but only when considering climatic data specific to the measured specimen localities. Main conclusions Sorex does not conform to Bergmann's rule. This result aligns with intraspecific studies suggesting Bergmann's rule is less evident in smaller taxa, but it counters others that found support for the rule in North American and European assemblages. Different patterns in pelage evolution across the Nearctic and Palaearctic clades may result from different historical climatic pressures; however, the significance of the relationship between climate and pelage evolution is dependent on the specificity of the climatic data. Sorex may be a useful focal taxon for exploring the relationship between intra- and interspecific ecogeographical patterns as well as the relative roles of morphological, behavioural, physiological, and life history characteristics in explaining the ability to persist in climatically challenging environments.

Both subfamilies are partially allopatric in Eurasia, but in North America only Soricinae is present, thus providing a scenario to address the role of potential competition versus competitive release in determining species' realized distributions at a global scale. Location Global. Taxon Soricidae, Eulipotyphla. Methods We obtained climate data from WorldClim, spatial range data for 302 species from the IUCN Red List and 2614 cytb complete sequences from GenBank. We modelled the potential distribution of the subfamilies by computing three environmental niche models using Maxent: one for Crocidurinae, one for American Soricinae and one for Afro-Eurasian Soricinae. We created matrices for the genetic, spatial and climatic distance between all pairs of species to calculate the average climatic distance between pairs of species within and between subfamilies. We then evaluated this distance against a null model. To assess the effect of phylogeny on the segregation of the subfamilies, we checked for correlation between genetic and spatial distance. Results The Afro-Eurasian Soricinae environmental niche model under-predicted its occurrence in America. The average climatic distance between subfamilies was larger than expected by chance, while the distance within both Crocidurinae and Afro-Eurasian Soricinae was smaller. The average distance between the American and Afro-Eurasian Soricinae was also larger than expected. There was no correlation between spatial and genetic distance for genetic distances over 0.14 substitutions per nucleotide site. Main conclusions Climate significantly influences the distribution of both subfamilies. As expected in a scenario of competitive release, the climatic range of the Soricinae in America is larger than in Afro-Eurasia. Thus, besides climate, competition may play an important role in shaping species' global distributions.

However, several differences exist compared to oceanic islands: a tree is relatively young, is composed of numerous differently aged branches, may be phylogenetically isolated from neighbours, and some of its colonizers are specific to particular tree lineages. We suggest that these specificities strongly affect both alpha- and beta-diversity within trees, including positive effects of isolation on the diversity of generalists, and strengthening of the effect of isolation with tree age. Location Rennes, Bretagne, Western France Taxon Little-dispersive, generalist oribatid mites (Acari) and highly dispersive, specialist gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) on oak (Quercus sp.) trees. Methods We tested the effects of tree and branch age, tree and branch habitat diversity, and tree phylogenetic isolation on per-branch and per-tree alpha-diversity, and on within-tree beta-diversity of both taxonomic groups. Results For gall wasps, no variable explained diversity patterns at any level. In contrast, for oribatid mites, we found that high phylogenetic isolation of trees and high branch age increased alpha-diversity per tree and per branch (in young trees) as well as turnover among branches. High tree age decreased alpha-diversity per branch (in phylogenetically isolated trees) and increased turnover among branches. Increasing habitat diversity increased alpha-diversity per tree, but decreased alpha-diversity per branch (in young trees). Main conclusions For mites, contrary to common expectation, we suggest that: (a) phylogenetically distant neighbours are a source of immigration of distinct species and (b) with the increase of tree age, species-sorting results in a few species colonizing and dominating their preferred patches. In gall wasps, strict specialization on oaks, and efficient dispersal may render oak age or isolation unimportant. The positive relationship between isolation and within-tree turnover is a new contribution to biogeography in general.

Drivers of species richness and abundance of marine macrophytes on shallow tropical reefs of north-western Australia	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						benthic habitats; community structure; environmental drivers; grazing; macroalgae; periodic disturbances; seagrasses	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; PHASE-SHIFTS; CORAL-REEFS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; HERBIVOROUS FISHES; MACROALGAL COVER; WATER-QUALITY; PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; SEAGRASS	Aim Marine macrophytes are important components of tropical reefs that are influenced by environmental conditions and biotic interactions. Here, we aimed to identify the factors that shape macrophyte communities on shallow reefs in a region with limited anthropogenic impacts, but that is influenced by periodic disturbances from cyclones and marine heatwaves. Location Pilbara coast, Western Australia. Methods Macrophyte species richness and biomass were assessed at 75 shallow reefs along 300 km of shoreline in November 2013 and May 2014. The influence of 28 predictor variables including seascape descriptors, physico-chemical variables, and herbivore abundances were evaluated using distance based linear models (DistLM), redundancy analyses (dbRDA), and full-subsets multiple regressions. Results We identified 188 macrophyte species; 60% were Rhodophyta, whereas Phaeophyceae made up 67% of the biomass. Macrophyte assemblages did not show any broad-scale patterns but a number of key drivers were identified, including sea surface temperature, salinity, and sediment uniformity. Two of the main predictors of macrophyte abundance and species richness were rugosity and coral cover rather than herbivory, unlike what has been demonstrated for many reefs globally. Availability of space therefore appears to be a major factor on these reefs and it is possible that macrophytes benefit from periodic disturbances as they can free up space through physical removal of organisms. Main conclusions Macrophyte assemblages along the Pilbara coast show no distinct large-scale patterns; instead, local biotic and environmental drivers such as rugosity appear to be structuring assemblages. We propose that natural disturbance plays a key role on these shallow reefs by increasing substrate availability. Data on the long-term community structure of macroalgae, in particular how communities respond to heatwaves and cyclones, would improve our ability to manage these reefs and predict potential "phase shifts" which can have severe ecological and economic consequences.

These disjunct savanna areas share many plant and animal species with the Cerrado biome in central Brazil (the CC), fuelling debate over historical connections. We evaluate hypothesized corridors between the CC and the AS, and specifically investigate whether a history of isolation versus recent connections is supported by genetic tests. Location Cerrado and Amazon biomes. Taxon Two woody plant species: Byrsonima coccolobifolia and B. crassifolia (Malpighiaceae). Methods Analyses of genomic data (SNPs from more than 4,500 loci) in 28 populations, as well as chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), were used to test for parallel geographic structuring between the CC and AS-an expected structure if putative corridors provided regional connections between different areas of the CC and AS, and divergence times between the CC and AS were estimated using a composite-likelihood method based on the site frequency spectrum. Results Genomic data, in contrast with cpDNA, generally show strong, concordant genetic structure between the CC and AS in both species, rather than regional grouping of CC with AS populations. In addition, divergence between the CC and AS predates the Last Glacial Maximum. Main conclusions Our results suggest the AS have remained relatively isolated from the CC even though the strong structure of genomic variation is not shared by cpDNA. We note that past evidence of putative corridors between the CC and AS based solely on cpDNA should be interpreted cautiously since the lack of structure may reflect limited genetic resolution rather than gene flow. As such, the uniqueness of AS may be more pronounced than previously thought, highlighting the importance of protecting these highly threatened areas.

Most species occur in the seasonally dry tropical forest biome but can also be found in xeric microhabitats inside woody savannas (Cerrado) and moist forests (Brazilian Atlantic forest). The genus exhibits a highly disjunct distribution across the Neotropics. Using a 90% complete species-level phylogeny, we reconstructed the spatio-temporal evolution of Pilosocereus to explore the historical factors behind the species richness of Neotropical dry formations. Location South America, Mesoamerica, Caribbean, south-western North America. Taxon Genus Pilosocereus (Cactaceae, Cactoideae, Cereeae). Methods We used plastid and nuclear DNA sequences and Bayesian inference to estimate phylogenetic relationships and lineage divergence times. Ancestral ranges were inferred within the Pilosocereus subgenus Pilosocereus s. s. clade using the Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis model in a Bayesian framework to account for parameter estimation uncertainty and the effect of geographical distance on dispersal rates. Results Pilosocereus was recovered as polyphyletic, with representatives of other Cereeae nested within. The Pilosocereus subgenus Pilosocereus s. s. clade originated around the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition (2.7 Ma), probably within the Caatinga seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) formation. Species divergences were dated in the Middle and Upper Pleistocene, often constrained to the same geographic region but also associated to migration events to other xeric habitats in Mesoamerica and northern South America; dispersal rates were not dependent on distance. Main conclusions Diversification dynamics in the Pilosocereus subgenus Pilosocereus s. s. clade agree with other infrageneric studies in cacti. Species divergence was rapid, driven by in situ diversification and migration events between SDTF dry formations and xeric microhabitats within other biomes and probably linked to Pleistocene climatic changes. This dynamic history differs from that found in woody SDTF lineages, which are older in age and characterized by low-dispersal rates and long-term isolation.

To understand how socioecological differences and commonalities affect different social networks, we compared cooperative decision-making using gift games for 755 people working in herding groups across six sites in two countries (Saami areas in Norway and Tibetan areas in China). We found that members of the same herding group received more gifts from each other. Most variance in gift-giving between study sites was due to differences in the effects of relatedness. Tibetan herders were more likely than Saami herders to give gifts to closer relatives belonging to geographically distant herding groups. Also, stated reasons of giving gifts were different in the two societies: kin and wealth (measured by herd size) were more important among Tibetan pastoralists, while reciprocity was more important among Saami. Social ties within and beyond the family as well as the centrality of herding groups within social networks are general patterns of social organization favoring cooperation among pastoralists.Significance statementPastoralists around the world have independently developed social institutions built around cooperative herding units, known as siidas in Norway and ru skor in China. Our study investigates how kin and non-kin, in the same herding group or belonging to other groups, are associated with cooperation. Our results show that communities in both countries exhibit similar social pattern in terms of who they chose to give gifts to, despite differences in socioeconomic status and culture. Most of the variance in cooperation occurred between sites, primarily due to the effect of kinship. Members of the same herding group were preferred recipients of gifts, regardless of kinship, although closer kin were more likely to receive gifts. The stated reasons for giving were different in the two sites: siidas prioritized reciprocity whereas ru skor preferred kin and less wealthy herders. We discuss that ecology should be taken into consideration in understanding social behaviors, even if under similar subsistence system.

Using phylogenetic comparative methods to gain insight into the evolution of social complexity	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Analysis of covariance; Evolution; Group size; Social organization; Phylogenetic comparative method; Primates	RUN LENGTH CONTROL; SEXUAL SELECTION; INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; COPULATORY-BEHAVIOR; BRAIN SIZE; STABILIZING SELECTION; CORRELATED EVOLUTION; COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY; SPERM COMPETITION; BACULUM LENGTH	Social complexity can have important evolutionary implications, and phylogenetic comparative methods have long been used as a way to assess interspecific support for hypotheses on the subject. Statistical approaches for conducting such analyses have come a long way in the last few decades, and it is now possible to use comparative data to ask sophisticated questions about the evolution of complex phenotypes while taking also uncertainty in the phylogeny into account. Here, we illustrate these advances by applying a phylogenetic analysis of covariance to two data sets addressing the evolution of social complexity in primates. First, we find that social complexity (as inferred by group size) is predicted by whether a species is diurnal and terrestrial. Second, we find that social complexity (as inferred by social organization) has increased over evolutionary time and can impact trait evolution. Particularly, we find that baculum length has been growing with body size in dispersed, pair-living and, more weakly, multi-male species, becoming relatively smaller and more variable in aggregations that are more socially stable.Significance statementSociality poses a particular challenge for interspecific analyses because of the many ways that its intrinsic complexity can be coded into statistical variables and models. However, with methods that incorporate phylogenies and nuanced inferences about underlying evolutionary processes, even coarse measures of social complexity can offer valuable insights in the study of behavioral trends through time. Exploring two interspecific data sets on primates, we show how simple measures of sociality, either coded as continuous or categorical variables, can be used to revisit latent evolutionary hypotheses while revealing new pieces of information that become available thanks to the added complexity of novel phylogenetic comparative methods. One example reveals that larger and more variable groups are associated with shifts in habitat and activity patterns, while the other reveals that baculum evolution might be influenced by the increasing social stability of primate aggregations.

The particular objectives of the study were: 1) to identify and classify the vegetation units of rock communities; 2) to explain floristic differences between phytosociological units with different habitat conditions. Study area: The study area lies at the northern border of the Italian Peninsula, between 43 degrees 40' and 44 degrees 40' N and between 9 degrees and 11 degrees E. It is characterized by a great variety of rocky habitats and represents a centre of endemism and a zone of phytogeographic transition between the Alps and the Apennines. Methods: The study was based on a dataset including 693 phytosociological releves that were classified according to the recent updatings of the Braun-Blanquet method. During the classification, releves were assigned to phytosociological classes based on the cover-abundance prevalence of diagnostic species, taking into account the current literature. The definitive classification into associations was carried out through cluster analysis. The analysis of floristic variation within the rock vegetation was performed through Principal Component Analysis, adopting Ellenberg indicator values as indirect environmental factors. Results: We identified 36 basic vegetation units (35 of them evaluated as associations) belonging to four phytosociological classes (Crithmo-Staticetea, Adiantetea, Asplenietea trichomanis and Polypodietea). All these vegetation units were characterized by their floristic composition, structure, syntaxonomy, habitat and distribution. Conclusions: More than half of the identified associations and a new suballiance Primulenion apenninae (within the alliance Androsacion vandellii) were newly described. Two alliances (Moehringion muscosae and Hymenopbyllion tunbrigensis) were first documented as part of the Italian vegetation. Indirect gradient analysis indicated that, within the four classes, the floristic composition varied along different environmental gradients and that temperature can be identified as the factor most strongly correlated with the variation of rock-face vegetation.

For this reason, it has been identified by the Mexican National Commission for the Knowledge and Usage of Biodiversity as a priority resource to be evaluated and restored. In order to establish the means required for the restoration of the river, the condition of its riparian ecosystem must be evaluated. To evaluate the quality of the riparian forest, we adapted the Qualitat del Bosc de Ribera index methodology for Mediterranean rivers for the semiarid rivers of north-eastern Mexico (QBR-RNMX). The QBR-RNMX index included modifications to the four sections that comprise the original index, and their values range between 0 and 100. Using the five levels of riparian quality defined in the index, in the area surrounding the Pesqueria River, we found poor or very poor conditions at 66% of the sampling sites, average-good conditions at 27% of the sites, and only one sampling site with excellent conditions. These results show that the riparian forest has been impacted significantly by urbanization, agriculture, and the presence of many invasive species. We recommend the application of the QBR-RNMX annually in order to evaluate the riparian forest's quality and to assess its ecological status. This may be used for the establishment of restoration plans in high-impact zones and contingency plans to eliminate invasive species along the Pesqueria River.

Information is scarce regarding its ecology (and especially synecology) and its Grime's CSR functional strategy. For this reason, this research, as well as analysing the floristic composition and ecology of the L. tonzigii community by means of traditional methods, also evaluated the Grime's CSR strategy of this endemic species using the latest methods and tools. Analysis of the phytosociological releves conducted in five different areas revealed that the species constitutes a single plant community (the Linaria tonzigii-Hornungia alpina community) consisting of basophile and xerophile species mostly typical of limestone screes. The analysis of the CSR strategy revealed that the mean strategy of L. tonzigii is R/CSR, although the species presents slightly different strategies in the different sampling areas. This article reports the first ever data regarding inter-population variation in plant functional strategies in nature and suggests that the functional variability of the species is much wider than had been thought. The analysis of plant height of L. tonzigii also showed that the population isolated at the northern limit of the species' distribution range has significantly taller and less stress-tolerant individuals than those in other areas, suggesting that it may be a different ecotype. This article aims to stimulate researchers to study little-known endemic species in order to protect and valorize the biodiversity of protected areas.

TBZ was the most cytotoxic active compound tested inhibited in 77% mitotic active in the lowest concentration applied. PRD alter the frequency of mitotic cells only in the concentration above that recommended by the manufacture. C-metaphase and adherent chromosomes were the most frequent cell cycle alteration observed on the treated cells, followed by bridges and lost chromosomes.

The study area, Tlalpujahua, Michoacan, Mexico, has a mining history going back more than 400years. Including gold and silver extraction by means of mercury amalgamation for 352years (1554-1906). Mercury was present in all sampled materials. The highest values correspond to wood samples from the mine dump (13.84 +/- 3.88ppm), while wood samples from adjacent forests had 4.3 +/- 2.4ppm, almost twice as much as coniferous needles, shrub leaves and corn seeds (2.2 +/- 0.34ppm). The highest concentration was found for J. deppeana wood (16.05 +/- 2.3ppm). The capacity of accumulating mercury by Juniperus trees when growing on the mine dumps suggests that this species has a potential to be used for biosequestration purposes.

The recent 2015 fires were affected by an extended drought caused by a strong El Nino event. This led to severe haze conditions across Southeast Asia, resulting in adverse socioeconomic and health impacts. Here, we evaluate the social and environmental factors that contributed to the 2015 extreme fires in Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra. We developed proxy variables for plausible drivers of fire which contribute either as a predisposing condition or as an ignition source for fires. We evaluated how these variables influenced fire count at an administrative regency-level and fire occurrence at a pixel-level (1 km(2)). We used generalized linear mixed effect models to model fire count at the regency-level and boosted regression trees to model fire occurrence at the pixel-level. Rainfall, slope and population density were the most important variables predicting fires at both levels. Economic variables such as the proportion of small-scale (<10 ha) and medium-scale (10-100 ha) plantation landholdings, and the reported use of fires to clear agricultural lands in villages were important in explaining fire count at the regency-level. At the pixel-level, distance from roads and the number of recorded burns over peatlands were important in explaining fire occurrence. The main influence of rain on fires corroborates with previous studies, and highlights the importance of establishing an early warning system for droughts to better prevent and manage future extreme fire events. Mitigation efforts for future fires, especially during El Nino years, can focus on identifying high-risk areas using environmental data on rainfall, slope, peatlands, and previously burnt peat areas, as well as social data related to population density, access to roads, extents of small-and medium-plantation landholdings, and village-level propensity to burn land for agriculture.

However, the literature contains assays across numerous concentrations, on numerous species and genotypes, and conditions are far from consistent. We undertook a systematic review of the sublethal effects of copper and cadmium concentrations on Cladocera spp. life history (reproduction, maturation age, and somatic growth rate). Using meta-analysis, we tested the hypothesis that the effects of increasing Cu and Cd concentrations on traits may vary by species. We also evaluated where possible whether the effect of metal concentrations on traits vary by water hardness, exposure duration, or whether the metals were delivered in aqueous solution or via food. We surveyed > 200 papers, resulting in a set of 32 experimental studies representing 446 trials where the results were presented compared with Daphnia magna-the most commonly assayed species. We found qualitatively similar effects of Cu and Cd on life history traits that included reduction in reproduction and somatic growth rate and delay of maturation. Cladocera species showed marked variations in their susceptibility to metals, and D. magna was found to be the least sensitive species to sublethal changes in reproduction. The effects were largely consistent for aqueous vs. dietary food. Water hardness, where data were available, had no detectable effect. Available data indicate that exposure duration had no effect on the toxicity of Cu but did for D. magna reproductive response to Cd. Our study highlights the importance of including species identity when considering toxicological testing and regulation development.

Among others, an elevated exposure to environmental pollution can have negative consequences for wildlife populations. We examined the differences in the concentrations of trace elements between the field and forest ecotype of the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Naturally, roe deer inhabited various types of woodlands (forest ecotype), but within the last century, they adapted to life in a human-transformed agricultural areas (field ecotype), which could be associated with an increased exposure to pollution. In this study, we measured concentrations of seven trace metals (barium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, strontium, zinc) and fluoride in skull bones and permanent teeth of more than 230 roe deer from 8 study plots in East-Central Europe. We found that field roe deer had higher concentrations of four trace metals (copper, iron, lead, strontium) and fluoride compared with forest roe deer. These differences were consistent with variations in the general level of environmental contamination within the study plots, as assessed with trace element content in wild plants. Our study indicates that bone and teeth of the European roe deer can be used as a valid indicator of environmental pollution. Also, we expect that elevated exposure of field roe deer to environmental pollution can have negative consequences for wild populations of this species, as well as for the consumers of venison.

However, selection can also be mediated by other environmental factors. To understand the relative importance of pollinator-mediated selection and its variation among trait and pollinator types, we analyzed directional selection gradients on floral traits from experiments that manipulated the environment to identify agents of selection. Pollinator-mediated selection was stronger than selection by other biotic factors (e.g., herbivores), but similar in strength to selection by abiotic factors (e.g., soil water), providing partial support for the hypothesis that floral traits evolve primarily in response to pollinators. Pollinator-mediated selection was stronger on pollination efficiency traits than on other trait types, as expected if efficiency traits affect fitness via interactions with pollinators, but other trait types also affect fitness via other environmental factors. In addition to varying among trait types, pollinator-mediated selection varied among pollinator taxa: selection was stronger when bees, long-tongued flies, or birds were the primary visitors than when the primary visitors were Lepidoptera or multiple animal taxa. Finally, reducing pollinator access to flowers had a relatively small effect on selection on floral traits, suggesting that anthropogenic declines in pollinator populations would initially have modest effects on floral evolution.

The morphology of melanosomes in iridescent feathers is known to vary, but the extent of this diversity, and when it evolved, is unknown. We use scanning electron microscopy to quantify the diversity of melanosome morphology in iridescent feathers from 97 extant bird species, covering 11 orders. In addition, we assess melanosome morphology in two Eocene birds, which are the stem lineages of groups that respectively exhibit hollow and flat melanosomes today. We find that iridescent feathers contain the most varied melanosome morphologies of all types of bird coloration sampled to date. Using our extended dataset, we predict iridescence in an early Eocene trogon (cf. Primotrogon) but not in the early Eocene swift Scaniacypselus, and neither exhibit the derived melanosome morphologies seen in their modern relatives. Our findings confirm that iridescence is a labile trait that has evolved convergently in several lineages extending down to paravian theropods. The dataset provides a framework to detect iridescence with more confidence in fossil taxa based on melanosome morphology.

No evidence for sibling or parent-offspring coadaptation in a wild population of blue tits, despite high power	EVOLUTION			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; SIZE MANIPULATION; PIED FLYCATCHER; NESTLING GROWTH; PARUS-MAJOR; CLUTCH SIZE; BROOD SIZE; EVOLUTION; SURVIVAL; CARE	Parent and offspring behaviors are expected to act as both the agents and targets of selection. This may generate parent-offspring coadaptation in which parent and offspring behaviors become genetically correlated in a way that increases inclusive fitness. Cross-fostering has been used to study parent-offspring coadaptation, with the prediction that offspring raised by non-relatives, or parents raising non-relatives, should suffer fitness costs. Using long-term data from more than 400 partially crossed broods of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), we show that there is no difference in mass or survival between crossed and non-crossed chicks. However, previous studies for which the evidence for parent-offspring coadaptation is strongest compare chicks from fully crossed broods with those from non-crossed broods. When parent-offspring coadaptation acts at the level of the brood then partial cross-fostering experiments are not expected to show evidence of coadaptation. To test this, we performed an additional experiment (163 broods) in which clutches were either fully crossed, non-crossed, or partially crossed. In agreement with the long-term data, there was no evidence for parent-offspring coadaptation on offspring fitness despite high power. In addition there was no evidence of effects on parental fitness, nor evidence of sibling coadaptation, although the power of these tests was more modest.

The evolution of complex traits that require many mutations makes their reversal unlikely. Even in simpler traits, reversals might become less likely as neutral or beneficial mutations, with deleterious effects in the ancestral context, become fixed in the novel background. This is especially true in changes that involve large reorganizations of the organism and its interactions with the environment. The evolution of multicellularity involves the reorganization of previously autonomous cells into a more complex organism; despite the complexity of this change, single cells have repeatedly evolved from multicellular ancestors. These repeated reversals to unicellularity undermine the generality of Dollo's law. In this article, we evaluated the dynamics of reversals to unicellularity from recently evolved multicellular phenotypes of the brewers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae. Even though multicellularity in this system evolved recently, it involves the evolution of new levels of selection. Strong selective pressures against multicellularity lead to rapid reversibility to single cells in all of our replicate lines, whereas counterselection favoring multicellularity led to minimal reductions to the rates of reversal. History and chance played an important role in the tempo and mode of reversibility, highlighting the interplay of deterministic and stochastic events in evolutionary reversals.

Effects of Sagebrush Restoration and Conifer Encroachment on Small Mammal Diversity in Sagebrush Ecosystem	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bromus tectorum; cheatgrass; Great Basin National Park; rodent; spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR)	GREATER SAGE-GROUSE; BASIN; PINYON; HABITAT; DESIGN; BACI; WILDLIFE; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; SUCCESS	Conifer encroachment in sagebrush ecosystems reduces habitat heterogeneity, niche space, and resource availability, all of which negatively affect many wildlife populations. Sagebrush restoration is recommended as a management action to mitigate conifer encroachment and restore wildlife across millions of hectares in the Great Basin. Despite this recommendation, the effects of conifer encroachment and sagebrush restoration are unknown for most wildlife species. Small nonvolant mammal communities include keystone species, consumers and prey; facilitate energy flow and ecological function; and provide important ecological goods and services. We assessed causal relationships between conifer encroachment and sagebrush restoration (conifer removal and seeding native plants) on small mammal communities over 11 yr using a Before-After-Control-Impact design. Sagebrush habitat supported an additional small mammal species, twice the biomass, and nearly three times higher densities than conifer-encroached habitat. Sagebrush restoration increased shrub cover, decreased tree cover, and density but failed to increase native herbaceous plant density. Restoration caused a large increase in the non-native, invasive annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). Counter to prediction, small mammal diversity did not increase in response to sagebrush restoration, but restoration maintained small mammal density in the face of ongoing conifer encroachment. Pinon mice (Peromyscus truei), woodland specialists with highest densities in conifer-encroached habitat, were negatively affected by sagebrush restoration. Increasing cheatgrass due to sagebrush restoration may not negatively impact small mammal diversity, provided cheatgrass density and cover do not progress to a monoculture and native vegetation is maintained. The consequences of conifer encroachment, a long-term, slow-acting impact, far outweigh the impacts of sagebrush restoration, a short-term, high-intensity impact, on small mammal diversity. Given the ecological importance of small mammals, maintenance of small mammal density is a desirable outcome for sagebrush restoration.

In this study, we examine the effects of a postfire range-land environment on a dung beetle assemblage in north-central Texas. We deployed baited pitfall traps to examine spring prescribed fire treatment, differences in vegetation visual obstruction, and dung density influence on dung beetle abundance and community composition. Using model-based multivariate methods, we did not find an influence of prescribed burning on the dung beetle assemblage. We report a negative influence of vegetation visual obstruction and no significant influence of dung density on dung beetle assemblages. These results suggest that prescribed fire may not negatively affect dung beetle species within the North American Great Plains; however, vegetation structure correlated to postfire range-land environments may influence local beetle abundance.

Migratory shorebirds are important components of coastal rangeland ecosystems. Buff-breasted Sandpiper (BBSA, Calidris subruficollis) and American golden-plover (AMGP, Pluvialis dominica) are two insectivorous, migrant shorebirds that rely on livestock-grazed grasslands in the Southern Cone of South America during their nonbreeding season, as well as on migration in North America. We studied habitat selection of these species and contrasted their needs with livestock requirements needed to develop recommendations for grazing management that benefit wildlife and livestock production. Short grass height was positively related to BBSA and AMGP abundance, with ideal grass heights from 2 to 5 cm. However, maximum livestock production is associated with grass height over 6 cm. The amount of forest cover, which is used to provide shade to livestock, was negatively related to the occurrence of both shorebird species, likely due to higher risks of predation. Grassland improvement did not affect BBSA but negatively affected AMGP abundance. Short grass habitat was selected by both shorebird species in spite of the higher arthropod biomass in taller grasslands, suggesting that other factors besides food abundance, such as the ability to detect prey and predators, are driving habitat selection. To enhance shorebird (and other wildlife) conservation and livestock production, we recommend managers adjust grazing intensity so that grass height is> 6 cm from mid-February to September, when the Nearctic migrant shorebirds are absent, and from 2 to 5 an from October to early February when shorebirds are present. These austral summer adjustments should be restricted to paddocks with low forest cover so that livestock production in paddocks with high forest cover remains maximized. All adjustments should be evaluated by each farmer to ensure adequate economic returns are met. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Planned grazing, a strategy that commonly involves Lime-controlled rotations of high-density (bunched) groups of cattle across pasture, is marketed as a method to enhance rangeland health and lessen livestock impacts. However, the behavioral mechanisms underlying any potential rangeland improvements resulting from rotational, high-density planned grazing have rarely been examined. To investigate these mechanisms, we compared planned grazing with conventional continuous grazing management in a savanna ecosystem in Kenya. We surveyed cattle grazing behavior, measured changes in vegetation characteristics through surveys conducted before and after cattle grazing, and measured native ungulate abundance following grazing using camera traps. Stocking rates were held constant across treatments, resulting in a commensurate decline in total foliar hits per pin (a proxy for vegetative biomass) across treatments. Planned grazing management altered cattle behavior and reduced grazing selectivity by restricting movements, causing cattle to walk more slowly while grazing and to take more bites per step. Vegetation survey results supported this finding: cattle in the planned grazing treatment ate significantly more Pennisetum grasses (typically avoided because of their unpalatability), creating the opportunity for regrowth of more palatable species after seasonal rains. We also documented significantly higher zebra presence in planned grazing plots after cattle grazing, likely due to increased relative abundance of more palatable grass species. This investigation of grazing behavior, and specifically decreased grazing selectivity as a mechanism underpinning the benefits of planned grazing, shows that when conducted at appropriate stocking densities, planned grazing has the potential to help mitigate rangeland degradation and improve rangeland sustainability for both livestock and wildlife in pastoral African savanna ecosystems.

This population-level phenomenon is caused by individual-level variability in reproduction and its synchrony between individuals. The variability at the individual level is induced by synchronized reproduction between branches within an individual because a tree is an assemblage of branches that are considered as semiautonomous units. However, there have been no empirical studies that quantify the degree of reproductive synchrony at the branch level within the same tree in masting species. Here, we evaluated the reproductive synchrony within individuals by monitoring flowering dynamics and expression level of a flowering-time gene at the branch-level in a typical masting species, Fagus crenata Blume. The 4-year census showed that the branch-level gene expression was highly variable between years and was strongly synchronized between branches. The branch-level synchrony in flowering-time gene expression was followed by coherent flowering cycle at the whole individual. To examine the causal relationship between gene expression and climatic factors, we performed a nonlinear statistical analysis called convergent cross-mapping using the time course data of gene expression and environmental variables. Our results indicated that the observed gene expression pattern was well cross-mapped by temperature or precipitation. However, this cross-mapping skill was lower than that of randomly generated seasonal dynamics, implying a combination of internal and external environmental signals is more likely to regulate gene expression dynamics in F. crenata. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that synchronized expression of a flowering-time gene between branches underlies integrated flowering behavior at the individual level.

Protection improves with increasing knowledge of the biology and ecology of these species. However, species numbers rapidly increase with the ongoing description of cryptic species, resulting in a lack of ecological knowledge for each of these species. We studied the nutritional ecology of three cryptic bat species of the Myotis mystacinus group using stable isotope analysis and molecular fecal analysis. Inter- and intraspecific variations were compared by calculating the isotopic and dietary niches for each species. We hypothesized (a) that all three species are generalists, but (b) that M. mystacinus and Myotis brandtii are more similar to each other than to Myotis alcathoe. Third we assumed that the occupied niches are intraspecifically more similar than interspecifically. We could show that the members of the M. mystacinus group differ in their nutritional ecology. Our data suggest that M. alcathoe is the most specialized species of the group, occupying a more distinct ecological niche compared to the other two species. Interestingly, the dietary and isotopic niche overlap was higher interspecifically than intraspecifically. Furthermore, considering our findings and those from other studies we illustrate implications for the conservation of these cryptic species.

In this work, we estimate differences in reproductive traits, individual growth trajectories, survival, life histories and population dynamics between a native species living in allopatry and in sympatry with an invasive species of the same taxonomic Family. We used as a model system marble trout Salmo marmoratus (native species) and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (non-native) living in the Idrijca River (Slovenia). An impassable waterfall separates the stream into two sectors only a few 100 meters apart: a downstream sector in which marble trout live in sympatry with rainbow trout and an upstream sector in which marble trout live in allopatry. We used an overarching modelling approach that uses tag-recapture and genetic data (>2,500 unique marble and rainbow trout were sampled and genotyped) to reconstruct pedigrees, test for synchrony of population dynamics and model survival and growth, while accounting for individual heterogeneity. The population dynamics of the two marble trout populations and of rainbow trout were synchronous. We found higher prevalence of younger parents, higher mortality and lower population density in marble trout living in sympatry with rainbow trout than in marble trout living in allopatry. There were no differences in the average individual growth trajectories between the two marble trout populations. Faster life histories of marble trout living in sympatry with rainbow trout are consistent with predictions of life history theory.

Markov chain analysis of sessile community dynamics in a degraded Philippine reef to support restoration of coral populations	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						bayesian analysis; benthic competition; callyspongia samarensis; dirichlet-multinomial distribution; multispecies matrix model	COMPETITION; MODELS; GROWTH; MACROALGAE; RECRUITMENT; SURVIVAL; COEXISTENCE; RESILIENCE; SUCCESSION; HISTORY	Quantitative approaches are needed for assessing assisted recovery potential in degraded coral reefs. A lagoonal community (Bolinao, Philippines) that has experienced severe disturbances (overfishing, blast fishing and coral bleaching) in the past was observed for 26 months. Benthic state sequences in 4 x 4 cm patches were used to quantify monthly probabilities of transitions between reef states. Benthic cover distribution was consistent with a spatially heterogeneous Markov process, with high variability in transition probabilities within a subset of four states: crustose algae with cropped turf, the codominant sponge Callyspongia samarensis, articulated coralline algae and fleshy macroalgae (MA). Once a patch is dominated by any of these states, there is high likelihood of cycling within the set before escaping to the rarer invertebrate groups. The assemblage is unlikely to recover naturally given prevailing conditions. Patches dominated by juvenile and adult corals have mean turnover times of about 3 and 5 months, respectively, due to (partial) mortality and competition. Asymmetry was detected for coral-macroalgal competition, despite low fleshy algal cover (9.5%), that was more adverse for coral juveniles than adults. While competition between coral and the mat-forming C. samarensis was symmetrical, loss of coral cover through this path is relatively higher as a result of the higher interaction frequency. Articulated coralline algae do not appear as a constraint. Complementary strategies for assisted recovery were inferred from successional indices as well as the sensitivity of stationary coral cover to changes in transition probabilities. Results demonstrate that short-term, fine-scale observations of state variables can be used to resolve biotic constraints to inform restoration initiatives.

ZAMIACEAE; SEED DISPERSAL; PLANT; DEMOGRAPHY; GROWTH; ECOLOGY; FIRE; PERSISTENCE	Ecological and microevolutionary perspectives were used to investigate signs of background extinction in two endemic species. We studied relict populations of the cycad Dioon caputoi, contrasting its population structure and neighborhood size with those of Dioon planifolium as a demographically healthier reference population. Population dynamics analysis was performed on two populations of D. caputoi through Integral Projection Models and genetic neighborhoods compared between species through 172 Inter Simple Sequence Repeat loci performed in one population of each of the two study species. The D. caputoi populations mostly comprised adult plants, while D. planifolium presented mainly juvenile individuals. Dioon caputoi showed equilibrium in population growth (i.e., approximate to 1), with low recruitment, and its genetic neighborhood revealed highly related individuals in a unique distance class (r(ij) = 0.407, 33 m). A contrasting pattern was found in D. planifolium, which showed higher relatedness in the first distance class (r(ij) = 0.543, 5 m), gradually decreasing to 20 m. The discrepancies between the two species reflect different strategies of persistence. Dioon caputoi conserves a relict dynamics with signs of a multigenerational, attritional loss of reproductive fitness, while D. planifolium does not. This study furthers our understanding of the background extinction process and the information will thus contribute to the management and conservation of this endangered species.

Sheltered from the storm? Population viability analysis of a rare endemic under periodic catastrophe regimes	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						hurricane; Lepanthes caritensis (Orchidaceae); plant conservation; Puerto Rico; species extinction; tropical orchid	EPIPHYTIC ORCHID; HURRICANE HUGO; DEMOGRAPHIC-MODELS; SEED DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMICS; EXTINCTION; CONSERVATION; DISTURBANCE; GROWTH	Rare species are important targets for biodiversity conservation efforts because rarity often equates to small populations and increased endangerment. Rare species are prone to stochastic extinction events and may be particularly susceptible to catastrophes. Therefore, understanding how rare species respond to disturbances is critical for evaluating extinction risk and guiding conservation managers. Population viability analyses (PVAs) are essential for assessing rare species' status yet they seldom consider catastrophic events. Accordingly, we present a PVA of a rare tropical epiphyte, Lepanthes caritensis (Orchidaceae), under simulated disturbance regimes to evaluate its demographics and extinction risk. We aimed to test how demographic models incorporating catastrophes affect population viability estimates. Our goal was to better guide management of these orchids and other rare plants. Results revealed L. caritensis numbers have declined recently, but projected growth rates indicated that most subpopulations should increase in size if undisturbed. Still, projection models show that moderate catastrophes reduce growth rates, increase stochasticity in subpopulation sizes, and elevate extinction risk. Severe catastrophes had a more pronounced effect in simulations; growth rates fell below replacement level, there was greater variation in projected population sizes, and extinction risk was significantly higher. PVAs incorporating periodic catastrophes indicate that rare species may have greater extinction probabilities than standard models suggest. Thus, precautionary conservation measures should be taken in disturbance prone settings and we encourage careful monitoring after environmental catastrophes. Future rare plant PVAs should incorporate catastrophes and aim to determine if rescue and reintroduction efforts are necessary after disturbances to insure long-term population viability.

Comparing clustered sampling designs for spatially explicit estimation of population density	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						bear; cluster; density; mark-recapture; simulation; spatially explicit; Ursus	BLACK BEAR POPULATION; MARK-RECAPTURE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; CAMERA TRAPS; CAPTURE; SIZE; DEMOGRAPHY; RIVER	Spatially explicit capture-recapture methods do not assume that animals have equal access to sampling devices (e.g., detectors), which allows for gaps in the sampling extent and nonuniform (e.g., clustered) sampling designs. However, the performance (i.e., relative root mean squared error [RRMSE], confidence interval coverage, relative bias and relative standard error) of clustered detector arrays has not been thoroughly evaluated. I used simulations to evaluate the performance of various detector and cluster spacings, cluster configurations (i.e., number of detectors arranged in a square grid), sampling extents and number of sampling occasions for estimating population density, the relationship between detection rate and distance to a detector from the animal's center of activity (sigma) and base detection rates, using American black bears (Ursus americanus) as a case study. My simulations indicated that a wide range of detector configurations can provide reliable estimates if spacing between detectors in clusters is 1 sigma and 3 sigma. A number of cluster configurations and occasion lengths produced estimates that were unbiased, resulted in good spatial coverage, and were relatively precise. Moreover, increasing the duration of sampling, establishing large study areas, increasing detection rates and spacing clusters so that cross-cluster sampling of individuals can occur could help ameliorate deficiencies in the detector layout. These results have application for a wide array of species and sampling methods (e.g., DNA sampling, camera trapping, mark-resight and search-encounter) and suggest that clustered sampling can significantly reduce the effort necessary to provide reliable estimates of population density across large spatial extents that previously would have been infeasible with nonclustered sampling designs.

Didelphis aurita is the largest marsupial in the Atlantic Rainforest, and it occurs in higher abundances in the absence of top predators. This mesopredator has similar ecological requirements to the sympatric marsupial Metachirus nudicaudatus. Considering the similar requirements, and that D. aurita is about three times the size of M. nudicaudatus, our hypothesis is that the increase in D. aurita's abundance may negatively affect M. nudicaudatus' population. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a two-year capture-mark-recapture study in an area in the Southeast of Brazil where top predator community is depauperated. The relationship between the population dynamics of these two marsupials was analyzed by including abundance of D. aurita and environmental conditions as explanatory variables of the population parameters of M. nudicaudatus. We observed that all demographic parameters of M. nudicaudatus fluctuated over time and responded negatively to D. aurita abundance. Our conclusion is that, at least on a monthly timescale, the interspecific relationship with D. aurita seems to influence more M. nudicaudatus' population than any other environmental covariate. These findings suggest that mesopredator release can promote negative effects on population parameters of other species within the same trophic level. Considering that top predators are no longer present in most of the remaining Atlantic Rainforest fragments, the marsupial D. aurita has become a key species in this biome, with relevant consequences arising from its interspecific interactions.

It is known that sustainable management of a natural population requires a good understanding of its functioning, itself dependent on a good long term monitoring program. Such programs are usually very difficult to implement, especially for resources characterized by high spatio-temporal variation in their distribution, resulting in a trade off between efficiency and costs. Today, thanks to rapidly evolving statistical theory, new survey designs are developed, some with the characteristic of well balancing samples in the study area. This paper aims at demonstrating that theses advanced sampling designs perform better than the usual ones for long term monitoring program of local resources, with the added benefices of saving money and also increasing results accuracy. To prove it, and for it high spatio-temporal variation in it distribution, we choose the example of Manila clam's stock monitoring in Arcachon bay. This stock is under high scrutiny and last campaigns could not be done because of lack of funding (at least 50,000(sic)/survey). We use a simulation study based on real data to assess and compare performances of news and older sampling designs on this survey. Three sampling designs are tested in both of the 6 past monitoring campaigns data and we estimate the cost of their application in the field. Selected sampling designs are: 1 - simple random sampling (SRS - the one used in the past years of this monitoring program), 2 - generalized tessellation sampling (GRTS - a recent spatially balanced sampling design known for its high performance) and, 3 - balanced acceptance sampling design (BAS - a newly developed spatially balanced sampling design, never tested yet in a real population). We first confirm that the two spatially balanced sampling designs perform better than simple random sampling. Both of the advanced sampling designs perform equally and allow achieving same accuracy in the results with almost half sampling intensity than SRS. This makes them so cost-effective that 30% of each campaign price could be saved if they were used. Moreover, the three sampling designs need a constant sample size thought years to achieve a fixed accuracy in results. This will permit us to fix one sample size that could be done for all future campaigns; and this, despite the existence of spatial and temporal variations in clam's distribution.

We tested this hypothesis by conducting a common garden field experiment using 50 clonal genotypes of white clover (Trifolium repens) that varied in a Mendelian-inherited chemical antiherbivore defence-the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN). To evaluate whether plant defences alter herbivore- and/or pollinator-mediated selection, we factorially crossed chemical defence (25 cyanogenic and 25 acyanogenic genotypes), herbivore damage (herbivore suppression) and pollination (hand pollination). We found that herbivores weakened selection for increased inflorescence production, suggesting that large displays are costly in the presence of herbivores. In addition, herbivores weakened selection on flower size but only among acyanogenic plants, suggesting that plant defences reduce the strength of herbivore-mediated selection. Pollinators did not independently affect selection on any trait, although pollinators weakened selection for later flowering among cyanogenic plants. Overall, cyanogenic plant defences consistently increased the strength of positive directional selection on reproductive traits. Herbivores and pollinators both strengthened and weakened the strength of selection on reproductive traits, although herbivores imposed similar to 2.7x stronger selection than pollinators across all traits. Contrary to the view that pollinators are the most important agents of selection on reproductive traits, our data show that selection on reproductive traits is driven primarily by variation in herbivory and plant defences in this system.

Effects of variation in resource acquisition during different stages of the life cycle on life-history traits and trade-offs in a burying beetle	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						life history; Nicrophorus vespilloides; resource acquisition; resource allocation; trade-offs	REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT; EGG SIZE; NICROPHORUS-VESPILLOIDES; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; INDIVIDUAL QUALITY; BROOD SIZE; BODY-SIZE; FOOD; JUVENILE; NUMBER	Individual variation in resource acquisition should have consequences for life-history traits and trade-offs between them because such variation determines how many resources can be allocated to different life-history functions, such as growth, survival and reproduction. Since resource acquisition can vary across an individual's life cycle, the consequences for life-history traits and trade-offs may depend on when during the life cycle resources are limited. We tested for differential and/or interactive effects of variation in resource acquisition in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We designed an experiment in which individuals acquired high or low amounts of resources across three stages of the life cycle: larval development, prior to breeding and the onset of breeding in a fully crossed design. Resource acquisition during larval development and prior to breeding affected egg size and offspring survival, respectively. Meanwhile, resource acquisition at the onset of breeding affected size and number of both eggs and offspring. In addition, there were interactive effects between resource acquisition at different stages on egg size and offspring survival. However, only when females acquired few resources at the onset of breeding was there evidence for a trade-off between offspring size and number. Our results demonstrate that individual variation in resource acquisition during different stages of the life cycle has important consequences for life-history traits but limited effects on trade-offs. This suggests that in species that acquire a fixed-sized resource at the onset of breeding, the size of this resource has larger effects on life-history trade-offs than resources acquired at earlier stages.

Traditional theory holds that these signals should converge on similar forms, yet variation in visual traits and the levels of defensive chemicals is common, both within and between species. It is currently unclear how the strength of signals and potency of defences might be related: conflicting theories suggest that aposematic signals should be quantitatively honest, or, in contrast, that investment in one component should be prioritized over the other, while empirical tests have yielded contrasting results. Here, we advance this debate by examining the relationship between defensive chemicals and signal properties in a family of aposematic Lepidoptera, accounting for phylogenetic relationships and quantifying coloration from the perspective of relevant predators. We test for correlations between toxin levels and measures of wing colour across 14 species of day-flying burnet and forester moths (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae), protected by highly aversive cyanogenic glucosides, and find no clear evidence of quantitative signal honesty. Significant relationships between toxin levels and coloration vary between sexes and sampling years, and several trends run contrary to expectations for signal honesty. Although toxin concentration is positively correlated with increasing luminance contrast in forewing pattern in 1 year, higher toxin levels are also associated with paler and less chromatically salient markings, at least in females, in another year. Our study also serves to highlight important factors, including sex-specific trends and seasonal variation, that should be accounted for in future work on signal honesty in aposematic species.

During coalescence, theory suggests the success of a population will be enhanced by the presence of species it has coevolved with (relative to foreign species), because coevolution will result in greater resource specialization to minimize competition. Thus, more coevolved communities should dominate over less coevolved communities during coalescence events. We test these hypotheses using the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens which diversifies into coexisting niche-specialist morphotypes. We first evolved replicate populations for similar to 40 generations and then isolated evolved genotypes. In a series of competition trials, we determined if using coevolved versus random genotypes affected the relative performance of "communities" of single and multiple genotypes. We found no effect of coevolutionary history on either genotype fitness or community performance, which suggests parallel (co)evolution between communities. However, fitness was enhanced by the presence of other genotypes of the same strain type (wild-type or an isogenic strain with a LacZ marker; the inclusion of the latter necessary to distinguish genotypes during competition), indicative of local adaptation with respect to genetic background. Our results are the first to investigate the effect of (co)evolution on the outcome of coalescence and suggest that when input populations are functionally similar and added at equal mixing ratios, the outcome community may not be asymmetrically dominated by either input population.

Interplay between age-based competitive asymmetries within the brood and direct competition between inbred and outbred offspring in a burying beetle	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						asymmetric sibling competition; competitive ability; inbreeding depression; intraspecific competition; Nicrophorus vespilloides; offspring fitness	INBREEDING DEPRESSION; NICROPHORUS-VESPILLOIDES; SIBLING COMPETITION; PARENTAL CARE; FITNESS; HUNGER; GROWTH; MALES; SIZE; MECHANISM	Theory suggests that intraspecific competition associated with direct competition between inbred and outbred individuals should be an important determinant of the severity of inbreeding depression. The reason is that, if outbred individuals are stronger competitors than inbred ones, direct competition should have a disproportionate effect on the fitness of inbred individuals. However, an individual's competitive ability is not only determined by its inbreeding status but also by competitive asymmetries that are independent of an individual's inbreeding status. When this is the case, such competitive asymmetries may shape the outcome of direct competition between inbred and outbred individuals. Here, we investigate the interface between age-based competitive asymmetries within broods and direct competition between inbred and outbred offspring in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that inbred offspring had lower survival than outbred ones confirming that there was inbreeding depression. Furthermore, seniors (older larvae) grew to a larger size and had higher survival than juniors (younger larvae), confirming that there were age-based competitive asymmetries. Nevertheless, there was no evidence that direct competition between inbred and outbred larvae exacerbated inbreeding depression, no evidence that inbreeding depression was more severe in juniors and no evidence that inbred juniors suffered disproportionately due to competition from outbred seniors. Our results suggest that direct competition between inbred and outbred individuals does not necessarily exacerbate inbreeding depression and that inbred individuals are not always more sensitive to poor and stressful conditions than outbred ones.

In the case of birds, despite growth compensations, nestlings reared under harsh conditions typically show reduced survival chances in adulthood. It has been proposed that environmental early-life stressors could affect longevity via effects on telomere length, possibly mediated through oxidative stress. However, the link between these processes is not clear. In this study, we experimentally manipulated brood size in spotless starlings (Sturnus unicolor) to test the causal relationship between early stress, oxidative and corticosterone-mediated stress and telomere shortening. Our results show that experimentally enlarged brood sizes led to a reduction in morphometric development on nestlings, the effect being stronger for females than males. Additionally, basal corticosterone levels increased with increasing brood size in female nestlings. Neither plasma antioxidant status nor malondialdehyde levels (a marker of lipid peroxidation) were affected by experimental brood size, although the levels of a key intracellular antioxidant (glutathione) decreased with increasing brood size. We found that the treatment showed a quadratic effect on nestling telomere lengths: these were shortened either by increases or by decreases in the original brood size. Our study provides experimental evidence for a link between developmental stress and telomere length, but does not support a direct causal link of this reduction with corticosterone or oxidative stress. We suggest that future studies should focus on how telomere length responds to additional markers of allostatic load.

Our results support the current understanding that managing low-intensity fire for ecological benefit reduces exposure when compared to a high-intensity full suppression fire in the Sierra Nevada of California. More frequent use of fire provides an opportunity to mitigate smoke exposure for both individual events and future emission scenarios. The differences in relative exposure between high-intensity, low-intensity, and prescribed burn were significant (P value <0.01). Suppressing fire not only appears to shift the health burden of the emissions to a future date but also increases the intensity and number of people exposed in a single exposure. Increased use of ecologically beneficial fire may further be optimized to reduce human exposure through advantageous use of good dispersal conditions and incorporating a mitigation strategy that includes poor dispersal when smoke is largely over wilderness or other natural areas. Accepting naturally occurring fire typical of the environmental system benefits forest health and reduces public exposure to smoke.

The number of pneumatophores per plant is, however, quite variable. Thus we hypothesized that a higher number of pneumatophores may attenuate the stress effects on root system growth and induce higher tolerance to long-term waterlogging in oil palm seedlings. To test this hypothesis we compared morphological and physiological traits in well-watered (control) and waterlogged plants with 2-10, 30-40, 60-70, and 90-120 pneumatophores after ca. 77 days of waterlogging. Plant height was similar between control and waterlogged plants with 90-120 pneumatophores, but it was 21% lower in plants with 2-10 pneumatophores than in control. The stem diameter and bulb diameter and biomass were 16, 20 and 42% higher in waterlogged plants than in control, independent of number of pneumatophores. Similar number of leaves and leaflets were observed regardless of watering regime and pneumatophore number, but total leaflet area and leaflet biomass were higher in plants with 90-120 pneumatophores than in other plants. Root system biomass was remarkably decreased in waterlogged plants; however, such decreases were more expressive in plants with 2-10 pneumatophores. Leaf water potential, leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were unaffected by waterlogging. Thus, we conclude that waterlogging causes few changes in seedlings' above-ground morphology but remarkably affects root system development, mainly in those plants with lower number of pneumatophores. Regardless of pneumatophores, the stressed oil palm seedlings were able to adjust their leaf water status and gas exchange to cope properly with the imposed waterlogging.

Ionopsis utricularioides is a widespread Oncidiinae orchid that occurs from tropical South America to Florida, USA. The pollinators of this species are still unknown, but a previous study in Puerto Rico showed that the species is rewardless and self-compatible. Here we investigate the pollination biology of I. utricularioides in Brazil. To determine if this species is a Batesian mimic we specifically take into account the flower colour of this species and the co-flowering plants in the community. The breeding system experiments revealed that Brazilian populations of I. utricularioides are completely self-incompatible and produces less fruits than those from Puerto Rico under natural conditions. The flowers of I. utricularioides are also nectarless in Brazil and are pollinated by several bee species. The pollinarium is attached on the dorsal portion of the proboscis, while the pollinators put their head inside the flowers searching for nectar. Given that the flower colour is common to several other co-flowering species of the community, our results suggest that this orchid does not represent a case of Batesian mimicry, since it does not mimic a specific model.

Differences in slope, water availability, soil depth and sun exposure result in the creation of microhabitats characterized by distinct resource availability, where unique plant communities are found. However, there is a lack of studies examining specific traits structuring communities in each microhabitat. We investigated the leaf anatomical structure of Brazilian inselberg species by comparing leaf anatomical traits of plants occurring in two microhabitats with contrasting resource availability: monocot mats (MM; extremely stressful) and shallow depressions (SD; less stressful). We hypothesized that species in the contrasting microhabitats would show different arrays of leaf anatomical traits. Seventeen quantitative and qualitative anatomical traits that have functional significance were analyzed. Firstly, we qualitatively evaluated leaf structural features, and then measured and compared tissues between plants in SD and in MM, using ANOVA and ordination analyses. An ANOSIM was also run to look for differences between the two groups. Our results show that most of the species growing in MM showed more conservative traits related to water retention and drought resistance, whereas species growing in SD showed more diversified resource strategies. These findings reinforce the heterogeneous aspect of inselberg vegetation in Brazil, which is under variable degree of environmental stress.	[de Paula, Luiza F.

Multifunctional behaviour in a sandy shore crab enhances performance in extreme intertidal environments	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Behavioural thermoregulation; Thermal performance; Tropical shore; Scopimera; Evaporative cooling	THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR; FIDDLER-CRABS; LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; THERMAL CONSTRAINTS; SEXUAL SELECTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; HEAT; TEMPERATURE; UCA	Soft sediment shores in the tropics are highly dynamic environments, where behavioural patterns of organisms are constrained by tidal conditions, and environmental temperatures during an organisms' activity periods can exceed their thermal tolerance levels. In such extreme habitats, behavioural responses to environmental changes are key to survival, driving differential performance. We investigated sponging behaviour (water uptake from sediments) of the deposit-feeding crab, Scopimera intermedia, on tropical sandy shores to determine its thermoregulatory function. The thermal physiology of the crabs and their habitat conditions were quantified by measuring thermal performance curves and recording environmental temperatures during the crabs' activity periods. Environmental temperatures were combined with experimental data to investigate the role of sponging on the thermal performances of the crabs by simulating field body temperatures. Sponging rate was strongly and positively correlated with feeding rate, as sponging replenishes water for flotation feeding. Sponging, however, also reduced body temperatures on average by 1.3 degrees C. Simulated populations of crabs which were unable to sponge had more variable body temperatures, which exceeded the critical thermal maximum of the crabs (39 degrees C) nearly 2000 times more often than crabs able to sponge. Sponging is, therefore, a multifunctional behavioural trait important for both feeding and thermoregulation. The evolution of such multifunctional traits is likely to be a widespread, but overlooked phenomenon in intertidal species, as maintaining a functional body temperature is energetically costly in habitats where environmental conditions fluctuate strongly such as on tropical shores.

A test with functional response experiments	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Competition; Goat; Interference; Inter-individual variability; Hierarchy	INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; SOCIAL-DOMINANCE; PREDATOR; INTERFERENCE; BEHAVIOR; LIFE; FOOD; WEIGHT; GOATS; SIZE	The functional response describes how food abundance affects the intake rate of foraging individuals, and as such, it can influence a wide range of ecological processes. In social species, dominance status can affect the functional response of competing individuals, but studies conducted in an interference-free context have provided contrasting results on the extent of between-individual variability in functional response. We tested the prediction that individuals intrinsically differ in their functional response, and that these differences could predict body weight and dominance status in social species. We used goats as a model species and performed foraging experiments to assess the functional response of these goats in an interference-free context. Our results show that some individuals are consistently better foragers than others, and these individuals were more likely to be heavier and dominant. Parameters of the functional response are, however, more strongly associated with dominance status than with body weight. We conclude that interference while foraging is not needed to explain body weight differences between dominant and subordinate individuals. We suggest that these differences can emerge from intrinsic differences in foraging efficiency between individuals, which could also allow better foragers to demonstrate greater tenacity during agonistic interactions.

Several strategies have been undertaken to counteract or halt this decline, one of which is the implementation of wildflower fields. These supplementary flowers provide extra food resources and have proven their success in increasing pollinator biodiversity and abundance. Yet such landscape alterations could also alter the host-pathogen dynamics of pollinators, which could affect the populations. In this study, we investigated the influence of sown wildflower fields on the prevalence of micro-parasites and viruses in the wild bumble bee Bombus pascuorum, one of the most abundant bumble bee species in Europe and the Netherlands. We found that the effect of sown wildflower fields on micro-parasite prevalence is affected by the composition of the surrounding landscape and the size of the flower field. The prevalence of micro-parasites increases with increasing size of sown wildflower fields in landscapes with few semi-natural landscape elements. This effect was not observed in landscapes with a high amount of semi-natural landscape elements. We elaborate on two mechanisms which can support these findings: (1) transmission hot spots within the altered flower-networks, which could negatively impact hosts experiencing an increased exposure; (2) improved tolerance of the hosts, withstanding higher parasite populations.

Therefore, phenological responses may be mediated by influence of environmental variables, functional plant attributes or phylogenetic inertia. During 2years, we recorded the fruiting phenology of 151 species belonging to 5 different growth forms of a Neotropical dry forest in Mexico. We evaluated the relationships between fruiting phenology, abiotic factors (precipitation, temperature, day-length) and functional attributes (growth form, dispersal syndrome, size and time for fruit development) using phylogenetic least squares models (PGLS). More species had ripe fruits during the dry season (92%) than during rainy months and dispersed their seeds by autochory and endozoochory. We found that fruit development time was positively correlated with fruit size and together the morphological fruit traits (size and dispersal syndrome) showed an important relationship with the growth form, but with a strong phylogenetic signal. Environmental seasonality had a strong influence on fruit ripening time, without a relevant association to the phylogeny of plant species. However, the phenological response to the environment (rainfall and day-length) at the community level was mediated by growth form. In woody species, we documented a high interspecific fruiting variation linked with the different dispersal syndromes. In herbaceous species, fruiting phenology is a trait restricted by the duration of their life cycle byrainfall seasonality, whichin turn might have selected some traits (e.g., dry fruit, presence of spines, explosive dehiscence) for maximizing seed dispersal during the dry season.

Accounting for intraspecific diversity when examining relationships between non-native species and functional diversity	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Non-native species; Functional traits; Intraspecific variability; Functional diversity; Community assembly	CATFISH SILURUS-GLANIS; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; ENERGY RELATIONSHIPS; TRAIT VARIABILITY; FISH; SIZE; COEXISTENCE; DISTURBANCE; REVEALS; SUCCESS	Quantifying changes in functional diversity, the facet of biodiversity accounting for the biological features of organisms, has been advocated as one of the most integrative ways to unravel how communities are affected by human-induced perturbations. The present study assessed how functional diversity patterns varied among communities that differed in the degree to which non-native species dominated the community in temperate lake fish communities and whether accounting for intraspecific functional variability could provide a better understanding of the variation of functional diversity across communities. Four functional diversity indices were computed for 18 temperate lake fish communities along a gradient of non-native fish dominance using morphological functional traits assessed for each life-stage within each species. First, we showed that intraspecific variability in functional traits was high and comparable to interspecific variability. Second, we found that non-native fish were functionally distinct from native fish. Finally, we demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between functional diversity and the degree to which non-native fish currently dominated the community and that this association could be better detected when accounting for intraspecific functional variability. These findings highlighted the importance of incorporating intraspecific variability to better quantify the variation of functional diversity patterns in communities facing human-induced perturbations.

The discrepancy may arise due to a limited or closed local species pool in experiments, while natural systems in meta-community contexts experience dynamic processes, i.e., colonization and extinctions. In our study, we analysed plant community properties and above-ground biomass within a semi-natural (i.e., not weeded) experiment in an agricultural landscape. Eleven replicates with four different diversity levels were created from a species pool of 20 wildflower species. We found an overall significant negative relationship between total diversity and productivity. This relationship likely resulted from invasion resistance: in plots sown with low species numbers, we observed colonization by low-performing species; colonization increased species richness but did not contribute substantially to productivity. Interestingly, when analysing the biomass of the sown and the colonizer species separately, we observed in both cases positive BEF relationships, while this relationship was negative for the whole system. A structural equation modelling approach revealed that higher biomass of the sown species was linked to higher species richness, while the positive BEF relationship of the colonizers was indirect and constrained by the sown species biomass. Our results suggest that, in semi-natural conditions common in extensive agroecosystems, the negative BEF relationship results from the interplay between local dominant species and colonization from the regional species pool by subordinate species.

We used a long-term fertilization experiment conducted in a Panamanian forest to explore how nutrient availability and tree traits affect abundance of a higher-level consumer. We added nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in a factorial design for 18years. Given that phosphorus often limits ecosystem processes in lowland tropical forests, and addednitrogen reducesinsect abundance in our experiment, we first hypothesized that phosphorus addition would increase nest density and nest size of Azteca chartifex ants while nitrogen addition would have the opposite effects. We found 48% lower nest density in the canopy of nitrogen addition plots relative to plots that did not receive nitrogen. Phosphorus addition did not affect nest density or size. These nutrient effects were not diminished by the selectivity of host trees. In general, larger trees held more nests, despite their low frequencies across the forest, while some abundant species (e.g., palms) were rarely used. We further predicted higher nest frequency on trees with extrafloral nectaries, because this ant fuels its large colonies with extrafloral nectar. Despite the non-random distribution of A. chartifex nests, across tree species and nutrient treatments, trees with extrafloral nectaries did not host more nests. Our study suggests that areas of a tropical lowland forest which are not oversaturated with nitrogen, and contain large trees, have higher nest density. This could enable A. chartifex insimilar areas to outcompete other ants due to high abundance.

Antagonistic effects of temperature and dissolved organic carbon on fish growth in California mountain lakes	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Allochthony; Brook trout; Rainbow trout; Elevation; Bottom-up control	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER TEMPERATURE; ALPINE LAKES; LIGHT; TERRESTRIAL; FOOD; PHYTOPLANKTON; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; METABOLISM; EXCITATION	Resources and temperature play major roles in determining biological production in lake ecosystems. Lakes have been warming and browning' over recent decades due to climate change and increased loading of terrestrial organic matter. Conflicting hypotheses and evidence have been presented about whether these changes will increase or decrease fish growth within lakes. Most studies have been conducted in low-elevation lakes where terrestrially derived carbon tends to dominate over carbon produced within lakes. Understanding how fish in high-elevation mountain lakes will respond to warming and browning is particularly needed as warming effects are magnified for mountain lakes and treeline is advancing to higher elevations. We sampled 21 trout populations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California to examine how body condition and individual growth rates, measured by otolith analysis, varied across independent elevational gradients in temperature and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We found that fish grew faster at warmer temperatures and higher nitrogen (TN), but slower in high DOC lakes. Additionally, fish showed better body condition in lakes with higher TN, higher elevation and when they exhibited a more terrestrial C-13 isotopic signature. The future warming and browning of lakes will likely have antagonistic impacts on fish growth, reducing the predicted independent impact of warming and browning alone.

However, whether and how clonal plants with different growth forms differ in their responses to N deposition remains unclear. We investigated the long-term (14-year) and short-term (4-year) effects of N addition on clonal plants of three growth forms (clumper, stoloniferous and rhizomatous clonal plants) in temperate grasslands of northern China by monitoring the clonal traits and belowground meristems. We found that, for the first time, the effects of N addition on clonal plants were dependent on N-addition duration and growth forms of clonal plants. Short-term N addition enhanced growth of clumper clonal plants, while long-term N addition favored growth of rhizomatous clonal plants and suppressed growth of stoloniferous clonal plants. We further revealed that clumper clonal plants can preempt space by tillering rapidly, thus conferring their dominance in the community and suppressing vegetative reproduction of stoloniferous clonal plants upon exposure to short-term N enhancement. In contrast, long-term N addition depressed initiation of buds and tillering of clumper clonal plants. Moreover, long-term N addition shortened rhizome internode and enhanced vegetative reproduction of rhizomatous clonal plants, leading to their ultimate dominance in the steppe community. Our results highlight the important roles of belowground meristems and clonal traits in control of dynamic changes of plant community in response to N enrichment. These findings provide a new perspective to understand N-induced changes in plant community of temperate grasslands.

We examined differences in the arthropod community across a gradient of oak/hickory dominance, a plant community maintained by disturbance such as periodic fires and extensive land clearing. In southern Illinois, we used patches of forest that varied in tree dominance ranging from 94 to 0% oak/hickory composition dependent on prior land usage that occurred>50years ago at minimum, to test two predictions: (1) oak (Quercus) and hickory (Carya) species contain more arthropod biomass and diversity than mesic tree species [e.g., American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and maples (Acer spp.)] and (2) due to plant associations, arthropod communities are more diverse and abundant on host trees within oak/hickory stands than non-oak/hickory stands. Our results were consistent with the prediction that arthropod biomass, guild Shannon diversity, and guild richness are higher on oaks, hickories and tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) than beech and maples. We also found support for the prediction that due to plant associations, % non-oak/hickory stand composition negatively influenced arthropod guild Shannon diversity and guild richness on host trees, including maples and beech. These results are the first to demonstrate that modified disturbance regimes can influence multiple trophic levels both directly due to species-specific variation in susceptibility of plants to herbivory and indirectly through effects of plant associations. This result is concerning as modified disturbance regimes are influencing large-scale plant community composition among biomes worldwide.

These drivers might interact in unexpected ways, but our still limited understanding of these interactive effects precludes us from predicting the impact of global change on ecosystem functioning. In this study we assessed the direct effects of pathogen-induced tree mortality and predicted warming and drought on C, N and P in Mediterranean forest soils affected by the decline of their dominant tree species (i.e. Quercus suber) due to the invasive pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. We also explored the potential indirect effects due to species replacement after Q. suber mortality. To achieve our goal, we conducted a soil incubation experiment using soils collected under Q. suber trees with different health status (i.e. healthy, defoliated and dead trees) and from coexistent shrubs (i.e. pioneer and late successional shrubs). These soils were incubated under controlled temperatures and soil moistures, mimicking various climate change scenarios predicted for 2050 and 2100 in the Mediterranean Basin. Our results showed that P. cinnamomi-induced mortality and future warming and drought may interact to simultaneously alter biogeochemical cycles in Q. suber forest soils. Resistance of studied variables to changes in temperature and moisture tended to be lower for dead trees than for healthy and defoliated trees. Moreover, we found that soil respiration and nutrient availability might be affected indirectly by P. cinnamomi-induced mortality due to species replacement. Overall, our results support a high potential of invasive pathogen species for modifying the response of soil functioning to climatic stressors.

Water column nutrient processing rates in rivermouths of Green Bay (Lake Michigan)	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nutrient processing; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rivermouths; Green Bay; Water column uptake	LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; GREAT-LAKES; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; MASS-BALANCE; PHOSPHORUS; RIVER; DYNAMICS; EUTROPHICATION; ECOSYSTEMS; METABOLISM	Understanding the quantity and form of nutrient loads to large lakes is necessary to understand controls over primary production, phytoplankton community composition and the production of phytotoxins. Nutrient loading estimates to large lakes are primarily made at stream gages that are deliberately placed outside the direct influence of lake processes, but these estimates cannot take into account processes that occur in the biologically active river-to-lake transition zone. These transition zones (rivermouths) sometimes alter nutrient concentrations and ratios substantially, but few studies have directly measured processing rates of nutrients within rivermouths. From April through September 2016, we conducted 23 water column incubation experiments to measure nutrient loss rates in four rivermouths. First order loss rates (K) for inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) indicated greater loss in light than in dark treatments, suggesting primary production increases N and P removal. Variability in K was high across both time and space, and the measured environmental parameters did not appear to be strongly associated with this variation in K for most N and P forms. If the measured K values and water residence times are accurate, then between 0 and 99% of the inorganic P and nitrates entering the rivermouth would be lost (i.e., converted to organic or particulate P). In late summer, Fox River discharge is low and residence times are usually long, which allow for much higher proportional nutrient removal in the water column. Water column processing appears to be capable of transforming large quantities of dissolved N and P to particulate forms and thus altering its transport and presumably its bioavailability.

In this study, we investigate patterns of soil ANF and its biogeochemical controls across multiple land uses and topographic positions in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We report ANF rates derived from observational and manipulative laboratory experiments using N-15-labeled dinitrogen (N-15(2)) incubations of soils from primary forest, secondary forest, eucalypt plantations and pastures sampled at three hillslope positions (summit, backslope, and footslope). Our field observations revealed significant interactions between land use and topography on ANF rates, which among 14 measured soil parameters were primarily correlated with total nitrogen and available iron (explaining 69% of ANF variance). Complex non-linear relationships were observed between ANF and (mineral and organic) nutrient pools in forest soils, whereas simple positive linear relationships were found between ANF and total soil nitrogen in managed pastures and plantations. Consistent with this observation, experiments with nitrogen and phosphorus addition did not affect ANF rates in pasture or plantation soils, possibly as a result of previous fertilization and homogenization of plant and microbial communities, but variable positive and negative ANF responses were measured in primary and secondary forest soils depending on hillslope position. These findings show that ANF can be simultaneously affected by multiple variables that are sensitive to environmental conditions and demonstrate the need for considering land-use change and topography to improve predictions of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles.

In addition to providing predictions, both methods are able to deliver a quantification of the uncertainty associated with the prediction. In this paper, kriging with external drift and quantile regression forest are compared with respect to their ability to deliver reliable predictions and prediction uncertainties of spatial data. The comparison is carried out through both synthetic and real-world spatial data. The results indicate that the superiority of KED over QRF can be expected when there is a linear relationship between the variable of interest and auxiliary variables, and the variable of interest shows a strong or weak spatial correlation. In other hand, the superiority of QRF over KED can be expected when there is a non-linear relationship between the variable of interest and auxiliary variables, and the variable of interest exhibits a weak spatial correlation. Moreover, when there is a non-linear relationship between the variable of interest and auxiliary variables, and the variable of interest shows a strong spatial correlation, one can expect QRF outperforms KED in terms of prediction accuracy but not in terms of prediction uncertainty accuracy.

Microbial communities during litter decomposition were studied mainly with low-throughput techniques not allowing detailed insight, particularly into coniferous litter, as it is more difficult to obtain high quality DNA required for analyses. Motivated by these problems, we analyzed archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic communities at three decomposition stages: fresh, 3- and 8-month-old litter by 16/18S rDNA pyrosequencing, aiming at detailed insight into early stages of pine litter decomposition. Archaea were absent from our libraries. Bacterial and eukaryotic diversity was greatest in 8-month-old litter and the same applied to bacterial and fungal rDNA content. Community structure was different at various stages of decomposition, and phyllospheric organisms (bacteria: Acetobacteraceae and Pseudomonadaceae members, fungi: Lophodermium, Phoma) were replaced by communities with metabolic capabilities adapted to the particular stage of decomposition. Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae and fungal genera Sistotrema, Ceuthospora, and Athelia were characteristic for 3-month-old samples, while 8-month-old ones were characterized by Bradyrhizobiaceae and nematodes (Plectus). We suggest that bacterial and eukaryotic decomposer communities change at different stages of pine litter decomposition in a way similar to that in broadleaf litter. Interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes appear to be one of the key drivers of microbial community structure.

Both eukaryotic and bacterial members occur in these systems where they facilitate digestive and nutrient provisioning. The larval gut of the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) is associated with a microbial consortium that fulfills these metabolic roles. While members of the community vary in presence and abundance among individuals from different hosts, A. glabripennis is consistently associated with a fungus in the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC). We used amplicon sequencing, taxon-specific PCR, culturing, and imaging to determine how bacterial and fungal communities differ between life stages and possible modes of symbiont transfer. The bacterial and fungal communities of adult guts were more diverse than those from larvae and eggs. The communities of larvae and eggs were more similar to those from oviposition sites than from adult female guts. FSSC isolates were not detected in the reproductive tissues of adult females, but were consistently detected on egg surfaces after oviposition and in frass. These results demonstrate that frass can serve as a vehicle of transmission of a subset for the beetle gut microbiota. Vertically transmitted symbionts are often beneficial to their host, warranting subsequent functional studies.

Earthworm populations in forestry plantations (Araucaria angustifolia, Pinus elliottii) and Native Atlantic forest in Southern Brazil compared using two sampling methods	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Oligochaeta; Pontoscolex; Amynthas; Biodiversity; Handsorting; Formalin extraction	COLLECTION METHODS; COMMUNITIES; BIODIVERSITY; PEREGRINE	Earthworm populations have been little studied in forest systems in South America, and the choice of appropriate sampling methods is an important factor to consider. Hence, the present study evaluated earthworm populations using two methods: handsorting of large soil monoliths (40 x 40 cm x 20 cm depth), and application of formalin (0.5%) to the soil surface. Worms were sampled in fifteen areas at the Embrapa Forestry Research Station, including native Atlantic forest fragments, and native (Araucaria angustifolia) or exotic (Pinus elliottii) tree species plantations. Eight species of earthworms were collected overall, including four native species (Urobenus brasiliensis, Andiorrhinus duseni, Fimoscolex nivae and Glossoscolex embrapaensis) and one exotic (M. schmardae) in low abundance, and three other exotics in higher abundance (Pontoscolex corethrurus, Amynthas gracilis and Amynthas corticis). Total earthworm density ranged from 11.5 to 102 individuals m(-2) and biomass from 5.6 to 31.6 g m(-2), with higher values being found in P. elliottii plantations. Handsorting was more effective than formalin for sampling earthworms, resulting in higher species richness, overall abundance and biomass (particularly of the endogeic P. corethrurus) in both Pine and Araucaria plantations. Formalin extraction was better for extracting epi-endogeic species (particularly M. schmardae). Eveness and A. corticis densities were higher in native forests, while A. gracilis abundance was higher in Araucaria plantations and P. corethrurus predominated in both plantations, likely due to soil-related differences between the vegetation types. Earthworm population assessments in Brazilian forest systems should prioritize handsorting, while biodiversity inventories may benefit from combining handsorting with formalin extraction.

In Europe, agri-environmental schemes (AES) are implemented to enhance species richness and provision of ecosystem services, but the effectiveness of different AES types and the spatial extent of possible beneficial effects are little understood. In this study, we assessed the effects of different AES types on diversity, species traits and distance-decay functions of ground-dwelling predators in adjacent crop fields. On 31 study sites with winter oilseed rape (OSR) adjacent to four types of AES differing in management intensity and habitat age, we recorded ground-dwelling predators (carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles and spiders) during OSR growth from April to July. Effects of the AES on species richness, activity densities and different traits of these taxa were examined with transects of pitfall traps running along a continuous distance gradient from the AES across the habitat border into the OSR fields. Ground-dwelling predator communities benefitted similarly from the different AES types. In adjacent OSR, activity densities, carabid species richness and the proportion of predatory carabid beetles declined from the field edge, while mean body size increased. Adjacent AES increased the proportion of predatory species and simultaneously decreased the proportion of granivorous or frugivorous species in adjacent OSR fields. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a beneficial effect of adjacent agri-environmental schemes (AES) on ground-dwelling predators in oilseed rape (OSR), mostly irrespective of agri-environmental schemes type and therefore management intensity and habitat age. The short-ranged distance-decay effects on natural enemies in oilseed rape underpin that a strategic spatial placement of agri-environmental schemes in agricultural landscapes is required to maximize biological pest control. This could help replace anthropogenic input in modern agriculture and secure adequate yields.

Despite this, there is a lack of understanding about how landscape configuration and composition regulate the ecosystem service provided by ants in sun coffee farms within highly fragmented landscapes. We measured whether landscape structure influences ants' ability to regulate coffee berry borer (CBB) in sun coffee farms in Southeastern Brazil. Considering the ecological interactions between ants and CBB at three different stages of pest control (reduction of CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB bean damage), we measured pest control among 10 landscapes that represented a gradual difference in forest and coffee cover. We manipulated ants through exclusion experiments and tested whether interactions between ants and different landscape structure metrics (distance to forest fragments, 2-km-level forest cover, and 300-m-level forest and coffee cover) influenced pest control. The presence of ants reduced CBB presence and CBB damage by up to 40%. We show how pest control service indicators change depending on the landscape level. The probability of CBB presence increased with expanding coffee and forest cover at the 300-m-level but decreased at the 2-km-level. CBB infestation reduced further after 25 m from forest edges, suggesting ants that provide these ecosystem services are adapted to matrix conditions in sun coffee farms. Ants reduced CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB damage in landscapes with at least 40% 2-km-level forest cover. Beyond this threshold, there is a turning point for ecological processes involved in pest control. Synthesis and applications. This is the first long-term branch-level exclusion experiment to present strong evidence of ants as efficient providers of pest control in sun coffee farms. We show how landscape structure modulates key ecological processes involved in three different ant-CBB interactions that regulate CBB populations. Forest cover measured at different landscape levels yielded different results for CBB presence, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale studies for landscape management. Considering surrounding forest cover and crop proximity to forest fragments in planning the spatial arrangement of coffee farms can thus both improve pest control as well as contribute to biodiversity conservation.

Predation risk for reptiles is highest at remnant edges in agricultural landscapes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						edge effects; edge habitat; farming; landscape connectivity; matrix; mortality; predation risk; reptile	NEST PREDATION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; HABITAT STRUCTURE; GEHYRA-VARIEGATA; FRAGMENT SIZE; NICHE BREADTH; WHEAT FIELDS; RED FOXES; RESPONSES; MATRIX	Preventing biodiversity loss in fragmented agricultural landscapes is a global problem. The persistence of biodiversity within remnant vegetation can be influenced by an animal's ability to move through the farmland matrix between habitat patches. Yet, many of the mechanisms driving species occurrence within these landscapes are poorly understood, particularly for reptiles. We used scented and unscented plasticine lizard models and wildlife cameras to (a) estimate predation risk of reptiles in four farmland types (crop field, pasture paddock, restoration tree planting and areas with applied woody mulch) relative to the patch edge and remnant vegetation, and (b) examine how predation risk was influenced by temporal change in the matrix (crop harvesting). Birds (55.1%), mammals (41.1%), reptiles (3.4%), and invertebrates (0.5%) attacked models, of which 87% were native species. Mammalian predators were 60.2% more likely to attack scented models then unscented models. Bird predators were not influenced by scent. We found predator attacks on models were highest at edges (49%, irrespective of adjacent farmland type, with a reduced risk within farmland (29%) and remnant patches (33%) (p < 0.01). Both mammal and bird predators contributed to high numbers of predation attempts at edges. Removal of crops did not increase predation attempts in crop fields or other farmland types, although predation attempts were significantly lower along the crop transect after harvesting, compared to the woody debris transect. However, numbers of predation attempts were higher in edge habitats, particularly prior to harvesting. Synthesis and applications. Reptiles are at risk of predation by birds and mammals in both remnant patches and the farmland matrix, particularly in edge habitat. Our results demonstrate that edge habitats are potentially riskier for lizards than the farmland. Vulnerability to predation may be increased by a lack of shelter within edge habitats such as by increasing visibility of reptiles to predators. Therefore, to benefit reptiles, land managers could provide shelter (rocks, logs, and grasses), particularly between remnants and linear plantings which could improve landscape connectivity.

Most ranches in the western US rely upon seasonal grazing access to public lands, and conflict over biodiversity management has led to proposals to restrict grazing access on public lands. We evaluate whether grazing restrictions on public rangelands could have the unintended effect of increasing the conversion of private rangeland to cropland, causing habitat loss for sage-grouse, a species of conservation concern. Using a model parameterized with empirical observations of land use change and ranch versus cropland profitability, we explore how changes to public lands grazing policy could affect ranch profitability and consequently land use on private lands across the western US. We predict that restricting grazing of public lands by 50% would result in the loss of an additional 171,400 ha of sage-grouse habitat on private lands by 2050, on top of the 842,000 ha predicted to be lost under business as usual. Most of this conversion would affect sage-grouse mesic habitat, 75% of which occurs on private land and is vital to the species during brood rearing. Under such policy changes, we estimate that an additional 105,700 ha (3.24%) of sage-grouse mesic habitat held on private land in the study region would be directly lost by 2050, and the cumulative area affected by fragmentation would be much higher. By considering the human and ecological links between public and private land, we show that attempts to improve habitat on public lands via grazing restrictions could result in greater system-wide fragmentation of sage-grouse habitat from unintended habitat loss on private lands. Synthesis and applications. Policy interventions on public lands can affect private landholders. Landholders' responses can result in unintended consequences, both for habitat on private land and community support for conservation. Restricting grazing on US public lands is likely to increase habitat loss on private lands and reduce community support for sage grouse conservation. Policy that manages resources on public lands while also supporting sustainable, economically viable ranching operations on private lands is a promising approach to maximizing sage grouse habitat.

Diverse multispecies shade tree canopies are increasingly replaced by monospecific shade, often dominated by non-native tree species. The loss of tree diversity and the nature of the dominating tree can have strong implications for ecosystem functions, for example, nutrient cycling ultimately reducing crop production. To understand direct and indirect impacts of shade trees on nutrient cycling and crop production, we studied coffee agroforestry systems in India along a gradient from native multispecies canopies to Grevillea robusta (Proteaceae) -dominated canopy cover. We identified 25 agroforests, across a broad rainfall and management gradient and assessed litter quantity and quality, decomposition, nutrient release, soil fertility and coffee nutrient limitations. Increasing G. robusta dominance affected nutrient cycling predominantly by; (a) changing of litter phenology, (b) reducing phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), boron (B) and zinc (Zn) inputs via litterfall, decelerated litter decomposition and immobilization of P and Zn due to low-quality litter, (c) reducing soil carbon (C) and micronutrients (especially sulphur (S), Mg and B). Coffee plants were deficient in several nutrients (nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), Mg and S in organic and B in conventional management). (d) Overall G. robusta-dominated agroforests were characterized by a reduction of P cycling due to low inputs, strong immobilization while decomposition and antagonistic effects on its release in litter mixtures with coffee. Synthesis and applications. The conversion of shade cover in coffee agroforestry systems from diverse tree canopies to canopies dominated by Grevillea robusta (Proteaceae) reduces the inputs and cycling of several micro- and macronutrients. Soil fertility is therefore expected to decline in Grevillea robusta-dominated systems, with likely impacts on coffee production. These negative effects might increase under the longer dry periods projected by regional climate change scenarios due to the pronounced litter phenology of Grevillea robusta. Maintaining diverse shade canopies can more effectively sustain micro- and macronutrients in a more seasonal climate.

Winter cover crop legacy effects on litter decomposition act through litter quality and microbial community changes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon cycling; crop rotation; decomposition; legacy effects; microbial community composition; nitrogen cycling; standardised substrates; winter cover crop	HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE; PLANT ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; SOIL; DIVERSITY; CARBON; MANAGEMENT; BIOMASS; RATES; MECHANISMS; COMPLEXITY	In agriculture, winter cover crop (WCC) residues are incorporated into the soil to improve soil quality, as gradual litter decomposition can improve fertility. Decomposition rate is determined by litter quality, local soil abiotic and biotic properties. How these factors are interlinked and influenced by cropping history is, however, unclear. We grew WCC monocultures and mixtures in rotation with main crops Avena sativa (oat) and Cichorium endivia (endive) and tested how crop rotation influences WCC litter quality, abiotic and biotic soil conditions, and litter decomposition rates. To disentangle WCC litter quality effects from WCC soil legacy effects on decomposition, we tested how rotation history influences decomposition of standard substrates and explored the underlying mechanisms. In a common environment (e.g. winter fallow plots), WCC decomposition rate constants (k) correlated negatively with litter C, lignin and, surprisingly, N content, due to strong positive correlations among these traits. Plots with a history of fast-decomposing WCCs exhibited faster decomposition of their own litters as well as of the standard substrates filter paper and rooibos tea, as compared to winter fallow plots. WCC treatments differentially affected soil microbial biomass, as well as soil organic matter and mineral nitrogen content. WCC-induced soil changes affected decomposition rates. Depending on the main crop rotation treatment, legacy effects were attributed to biomass input of WCCs and their litter quality or changes in microbial biomass. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that decomposition in cropping systems is influenced directly through crop residues, as well as through crop-induced changes in soil biotic properties. Rotation history influences decomposition, wherein productive winter cover crops (WCC) with low lignin content decompose fast and stimulate the turnover of both own and newly added residues via their knock-on effect on the soil microbial community. Thus, WCC have promise for sustainable carbon- and nutrient-cycling management through litter feedbacks.

Crop rotation can mitigate this by introducing variable filters on the weed community through increasing management diversity. In this study, we investigate the effect of integrating livestock into no-till crop rotations to complement chemical weed control. We analysed 12 years of weed seedbank data from a trial of eight rotation systems with different crop sequence diversities, of which four included grazed forage phases. Linear mixed models and ordination were used to assess how weed abundance, diversity, and community composition responded to management filters, defined in terms of levels of disturbance strength and diversity (grazing and herbicides), and resource availability and diversity (inorganic fertilizers, legumes, and manure). Grazed rotation systems had less herbicide applied than ungrazed rotation systems, and had the lowest weed abundance and highest weed diversity. Herbicides and grazing apply contrasting selection pressures on weeds, and this combination was more effective in reducing weed pressure than increasing herbicide quantity or mode-of-action diversity. Lower resource availability and higher nitrogen source diversity in grazed systems may have further reduced weed abundance and promoted diversity. Crop sequence diversity also reduced weed abundance and promoted weed diversity, indicating that variable crop-weed interactions can enhance weed management. In addition, yields in the main cash crop (wheat) were highest where crop diversity was highest, regardless of whether the system contained grazed phases. Synthesis and applications. Diverse rotation systems produced high yields, and the inclusion of grazed forage phases maintained these yields at lower applications of herbicides and fertilizers: integrated livestock can therefore improve the sustainability of no-till systems. The role of grazing as a filter imposing a contrasting selection pressure to other weed control options could be further explored to improve weed management in different farming systems.

Landscape pivot points and responses to water balance in national parks of the southwest US	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; Colorado Plateau; drought; ecohydrology; evapotranspiration; NDVI; soil moisture; vegetation production	SOIL-MOISTURE; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; PRODUCTIVITY; RAINFALL; SCIENCE; DEFICIT; SAFETY; LEAVES; MODEL	A recent drying trend that is expected to continue in the southwestern US underscores the need for site-specific and near real-time understanding of vegetation vulnerability so that land management actions can be implemented at the right time and place. We related the annual integrated normalized difference vegetation index (iNDVI), a proxy for vegetation production, to water balance across landscapes of the Colorado Plateau. We determined how changes in production per unit of water (vegetation responses) and the water balance amounts at which production shifted from above to below average values (pivot points), varied across dominant vegetation and soil types. Precipitation (PRCP), actual evapotranspiration (AET), water deficit (D), and soil moisture (SM) explained 13%-82% of variation in vegetation production. Along an increasing water availability gradient, vegetation responses to PRCP and AET increased, responses to SM decreased, and responses to D became more negative. We found trade-offs between vegetation responses and pivot points within and across all vegetation types that were mediated by soil properties. Synthesis and applications. The water needed by native vegetation to maintain production depends on plant traits. The water available to vegetation depends on climate and soil properties that change along environmental gradients. Tracking this biologically relevant water availability in relation to water need provides an indicator of vegetation growth or stress that can help guide the time and place for management actions.

However, we currently lack general principles describing how to achieve this landscape multifunctionality. We combine theoretical simulations and empirical data on 14 ecosystem services measured across 150 grasslands in three German regions. In doing so, we investigate the circumstances under which spatial heterogeneity in a driver of ecosystem functioning (an "ecosystem-driver," e.g., the presence of keystone species, land-use intensification, or habitat types) increases landscape-level ecosystem multifunctionality. Simulations based on theoretical data demonstrated that relationships between heterogeneity and landscape multifunctionality are highly variable and can range from nonsignificant to strongly positive. Despite this variability, we could identify criteria under which heterogeneity-landscape multifunctionality relationships were most strongly positive: this happened when multiple ecosystem services responded contrastingly (both positively and negatively) to an ecosystem-driver. These findings were confirmed using empirical data, which showed that heterogeneity in land-use intensity (LUI) promoted landscape multifunctionality in cases where functions with both positive (e.g., plant biomass) and negative (e.g., flower cover) responses to land use intensification were included. For example, the simultaneous provisioning of ecosystem functions related to forage production (generally profiting from land-use intensification), biodiversity conservation and recreation (generally decreasing with land-use intensification) was highest in landscapes consisting of sites varying in LUI. Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that there are general principles governing landscape multifunctionality. A knowledge of these principles may support land management decisions. For example, knowledge of relationships between ecosystem services and their drivers, such as land use type, can help estimate the consequences of increasing or decreasing heterogeneity for landscape-level ecosystem service supply, although interactions between landscape units (e.g., the movement of pollinators) must also be considered.

Threatened species include bees and other pollinators, which deliver important ecosystem services but are sensitive to land use changes. We investigated the impact of urbanisation and vegetation management practices on pollinator abundance, bee diversity, and bee functional traits. We sampled 126 locations in a stratified random design across an urbanisation gradient in two medium-sized cities in the West African Forests biodiversity hot spot, encompassing three management practices (farmed sites; amenity lands, i.e. green spaces managed for aesthetics; informal green spaces), and tested their effect with generalised linear models. Urbanisation did not affect bee abundances or diversity but had a negative impact on both wasp and beetle abundances. There was also a management-mediated impact of urbanisation on bee abundances, which decreased with urbanisation on farmed sites but not amenity land or informal green spaces. Management practices alone influenced bee abundances with farms harbouring fewer bees, and amenity lands fewer beetles. Bee genera occurrence and dominance patterns were influenced by both urbanisation and management, with some otherwise common genera rare in urban areas. Most functional traits were influenced by management, with fewer polylectic bees, cavity-nesting bees and long-tongued bees in farmed sites. Amenity lands hosted smaller bees and fewer savanna specialists. Some traits were influenced by urbanisation, with more long-tongued bees and cavity-nesting bees found in urban areas. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator responses to urbanisation are complex. In our research, we demonstrate how bee, lepidopteran, and non-fruit fly abundances have been maintained across an urbanisation gradient in tropical Africa, but not wasp and beetle abundances. Moreover, bee community composition and the distribution of traits shifted markedly. How green spaces were managed was also critical. We found that farmed sites hosted the lowest bee abundances and amenity lands the fewest beetles. Retaining informal green spaces and amenity lands in African cities, including protecting nesting sites for stingless bees, and limiting pesticide application would be important for conserving bees and the pollination service they provide to both crops and native vegetation.

Plant functional diversity and nutrient availability can improve restoration of floating fens via facilitation, complementarity and selection effects	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						assisted colonization; floating fen; functional diversity; peat formation; restoration; rhizome formation; terrestrialization; wetlands	SPECIES RICHNESS; VEGETATION PATTERNS; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; BIODIVERSITY; WATER; DISPERSAL; COLONIZATION; COMPETITION; PRODUCTIVITY; GERMINATION	Peat-forming wetlands, particularly floating fens that form the initial stages of these ecosystems, are declining globally due to excavation, dehydration and eutrophication. Restoration typically involves reestablishment of early-successional open-water stages, with oligotrophic conditions that are characteristic for these systems. However, restoration success is notoriously limited. A potential improvement may be to initiate succession by reintroducing of target plant species. Knowledge is therefore needed on (a) which plant functional groups should be re-introduced to stimulate fen formation; and (b) how to manage nutrient levels during restoration, considering that plant growth may be slow in oligotrophic conditions. We hypothesized that increasing functional diversity of introduced species would stimulate the formation of peat-forming target communities, their biomass accumulation and expansion onto open water. We also hypothesized that nutrient availability would mediate the relative contribution of specific functional groups to these effects. We investigated this in 36 artificial outdoor ponds by manipulating plant functional diversity (clonal dominants, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials) on constructed rafts with fen-forming communities, and subjected these to a range of nutrient loadings over 2 years. Increasing functional diversity as well as increasing nutrient loadings had stimulating effects on plant biomass accumulation, cover formation and rhizome growth onto open water. Both complementarity (due to niche partitioning or facilitation) and selection effects were mechanisms underlying the diversity effect, with a constant relative importance over the entire range of nutrient availabilities. Different functional groups were important for biomass production at different nutrient availabilities. Rhizome formation by clonal stress-tolerators contributed disproportionately to open water colonization, identifying this functional group as key across all nutrient levels. Synthesis and applications. Restoration of floating fen communities can be stimulated during the first 2 years by introducing a high functional diversity of plant species. These include fast-growing clonal species, clonal stress-tolerators and interstitials, which facilitate each other. Restoration is dependent on the presence of clonal stress-tolerators such as Calla palustris, Comarum palustre and Menyanthes trifoliata for expansion onto the open water. Furthermore, restoration can start under a wide range of water nutrient levels, including eutrophic conditions.	[van Zuidam, Jeroen P.; van Leeuwen, Casper H. A.; Verhoeven, Jos T.

Influence of Library Composition on Source Tracker Predictions for Community-Based Microbial Source Tracking	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FECAL POLLUTION; GENETIC-MARKERS; BACTERIA; WATER; CONTAMINATION; PERFORMANCE	Community-based microbial source tracking (MST) utilizes high-throughput DNA sequencing to profile and compare the microbial communities in different fecal sources and environmental samples. Source Tracker, a program that compares a library of OTUs from fecal sources (i.e., sources) to those in environmental samples (i.e., sinks) in order to determine sources of fecal contamination, is an emerging tool for community-based MST studies. In this study, we investigated the ability of Source Tracker to determine sources of known fecal contamination in spiked, in situ mesocosms containing different source contributors. We also evaluated how Source Tracker results were impacted by accounting for autochthonous taxa present in the sink environment. While Source Tracker was able to predict most sources present in the in situ mesocosms, fecal source library composition substantially influenced the program's ability to predict source contributions. Moreover, prediction results were most reliable when the library contained only known sources, autochthonous taxa were accounted for and when source profiles had low intragroup variability. Although Source Tracker struggled to differentiate between sources with similar bacterial community structures, it was able to consistently identify abundant and expected sources, suggesting that the Source Tracker program can be a useful tool for community-based MST studies.

Fall Creek Monitoring Station: Highly Resolved Temporal Sampling to Prioritize the Identification of Nontarget Micropollutants in a Small Stream	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RESOLUTION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; WASTE-WATER CONTAMINANTS; EMERGING CONTAMINANTS; CHEMICAL-ANALYSIS; SURFACE-WATER; PESTICIDES; PHARMACEUTICALS; REPOSITORY; PREDICTION; INSIGHTS	The goal of this research was to comprehensively characterize the occurrence and temporal dynamics of target and nontarget micropollutants in a small stream. We established the Fall Creek Monitoring Station in March 2017 and collected daily composite samples for one year. We measured water samples by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry and developed and optimized a postacquisition data processing workflow to screen for 162 target micro-pollutants and group all mass spectral (MS) features into temporal profiles. We used hierarchical clustering analysis to prioritize nontarget MS features based their similarity to target micropollutant profiles and developed a high-throughput pipeline to elucidate the structures of prioritized nontarget MS features. Our analyses resulted in the identification of 31 target micropollutants and 59 nontarget micropollutants with varying levels of confidence. Temporal profiles of the 90 identified micropollutants revealed unexpected concentration-discharge relationships that depended on the source of the micropollutant and hydrological features of the watershed. Several of the nontarget micropollutants have not been previously reported including pharmaceutical metabolites, rubber vulcanization accelerators, plasticizers, and flame retardants. Our data provide novel insights on the temporal dynamics of micropollutant occurrence in small streams. Further, our approach to nontarget analysis is general and not restricted to highly resolved temporal data acquisitions or samples collected from surface water systems.	[Carpenter, Corey M.

Recovery of Benthic Microalgal Biomass and Community Structure Following Beach Renourishment at Folly Beach, South Carolina	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Benthic microalgae; Microphytobenthos; Beach nourishment; High-throughput sequencing; South Carolina; Erosion; Extracellular polymeric substances	WATER MARINE HABITATS; SEDIMENT STABILITY; ECOLOGICAL ROLE; ALGAL BIOMASS; SECRET GARDEN; MICROPHYTOBENTHOS; COASTAL; NOURISHMENT; SEQUENCES; SHELF	One method of preserving beaches against the effects of erosion and sea level rise is beach renourishment. While there have been many studies assessing the impact of renourishment on macrofauna, few studies have looked at its effects on microbes. Benthic microalgae (BMA) are important primary producers, representing the basis of nearshore food webs. BMA also secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which bind sediment and thus help prevent erosion. The objective of this study was to monitor recovery of BMA in terms of relative biomass (estimated as sediment chlorophyll a) and community structure (characterized using high-throughput DNA sequencing) following renourishment of Folly Beach, SC in 2014. We also examined the relationships among biomass, EPS, and erosion. Sediment samples were collected intermittently (n=9) from two renourished and two control sites within three intertidal zones (high, mid, low) from June 2014 to January 2015. Biomass recovered in sequence from low to high intertidal, corresponding to when the artificially-raised beach once again experienced regular tidal inundation (between 93 and 169days post-renourishment). Alpha diversity metrics misleadingly indicated recovery around this same time within the high intertidal, but compositional changes through time were unlike those seen in control samples, and these communities had yet to recover at similar to 7months post-renourishment. Renourishment therefore appears to impact BMA communities via artificial elevation of the beach face. While there were relationships between chl a, EPS, and erosion, BMA most likely play a minimal role in sediment stabilization in high-energy environments like Folly Beach.

Monthly phytoplankton and physicochemical samples were taken from March 2014 to September 2015. A total of 51 genera from six algal divisions were observed with phylum Bacillariophyta being the most represented (16 genera and on average similar to 59% of biomass). While diatoms were prevalent year-round, strong inter-seasonal variations of other phytoplankton groups were observed in response to environmental parameters. The seasonal succession of other taxa started with Chlorophyta (Chlorella sp.) in spring followed by Cyanophyta (Anabaena sp. and Microsystis sp.) and Euglenophyta (Euglena sp.) in summer, then Chrysophyta (Syndera) and Pyrrophyta (Prorocentrum sp., Exuviella sp., and Peridinium sp.) in the autumn and winter. The sites near the mouth of Gorgan Bay were characterized by slightly higher salinity with an annual mean of similar to 12 PSU compared with similar to 11 PSU for inner regions of the bay. Nitrate was higher in the mouth of the bay as well, with an annual mean of similar to 1.4ppm compared with similar to 0.80ppm in the inner region. Orthophosphate was also higher in the mouth of the bay with an annual mean of similar to 0.30ppm compared with similar to 0.23ppm in inner part of the bay. Euglena sp. and Microsystis sp. performed better in the mouth of the bay compared with their performance in the inner regions. Nutrients and salinity correlated strongest with phytoplankton in Gorgan Bay. During the period when Cyanophyta biomass was maximum, Microsystis sp. was the dominant taxa of the cyanobacteria present. Inorganic pollution from domestic wastewater in the eastern part of Gorgan Bay appears to be the cause of the Euglena maximum. According to the Palmer pollution index, Gorgan Bay experienced pollution from agricultural discharge and domestic wastewater.

Spatial Subsidies and Mortality of an Estuarine Copepod Revealed Using a Box Model	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Pseudodiaptomus forbesi; Population dynamics; Estuarine circulation; Gross Exchange Matrix; Bayesian analysis; San Francisco Estuary	SAN-FRANCISCO ESTUARY; MARINE PLANKTONIC COPEPODS; DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION; AGE-0 STRIPED BASS; PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM; PELAGIC FISHES; GLOBAL RATES; ZOOPLANKTON; GROWTH	Mortality of planktonic populations is difficult to determine because assumptions of the methods are rarely met, more so in estuaries where tidal exchange ensures violation of the assumption of a closed or spatially uniform population. Estuarine plankton populations undergo losses through movement from productive regions, creating a corresponding subsidy to regions that are less productive. We estimated mortality rates of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the San Francisco Estuary using a vertical-life-table approach with a Bayesian estimation method, combined with estimates of spatial subsidies and losses using a spatial box model with salinity-based boundaries. Data came from a long-term monitoring program and from three sample sets for 1991-2007 and 2010-2012. A hydrodynamic model coupled with a particle-tracking model supplied exchange rates between boxes and from each box to several sinks. In situ mortality, i.e., mortality corrected for movement, was highly variable. In situ mortality of adults was high (means by box and sampling program 0.1-0.9day(-1)) and appeared invariant with salinity or year. In situ mortality of nauplii and copepodites increased from fresh (similar to 0) to brackish water (means 0.4-0.8day(-1)), probably because of consumption by clams and predatory copepods in brackish water. High mortality in the low-salinity box was offset by a subsidy which increased after 1993, indicating an increase in mortality. Our results emphasize the importance of mortality and spatial subsidies in structuring populations. Mortality estimates of estuarine plankton are feasible with sufficient sampling to overcome high variability, provided adjustments are made to account for movement.

Using habitat models to identify marine important bird and biodiversity areas for Chinstrap Penguins Pygoscelis antarcticus in the South Orkney Islands	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Antarctica; Conservation; Habitat modelling; Marine important bird and biodiversity areas; Penguins; Tracking data	TRACKING; CONSERVATION	Tracking individual marine predators can provide vital information to aid the identification of important activity (foraging, commuting, rafting, resting, etc.) hotspots and therefore also to delineate priority sites for conservation. However, in certain locations (e.g. Antarctica) many marine mammal or seabird colonies remain untracked due to logistical constraints, and the colonies that are studied may not be the most important in terms of conservation priorities. Using data for one of the most abundant seabirds in the Antarctic as a case study (the Chinstrap Penguin Pygoscelis antarcticus), we tested the use of correlative habitat models (used to predict distribution around untracked colonies) to overcome this limitation, and to enable the identification of important areas at-sea for colonies where tracking data are not available. First, marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBA) were identified using a standardised, published approach using empirical data from birds tracked from colonies located in the South Orkney Islands. Subsequently, novel approaches using predicted distributions of Chinstrap Penguins derived from correlative habitat models were applied to identify important marine areas, and the results compared with the IBAs. Data were collected from four colonies over 4years and during different stages of the breeding season. Results showed a high degree of overlap between the areas identified as important by observed data (IBAs) and by predicted distributions, revealing that habitat preference models can be used to identify marine IBAs for these penguins. We provide a new method for designating a network of marine IBAs for penguins in Antarctic waters, based on outputs from correlative habitat models when tracking data are not available. This can contribute to an evidence-based and precautionary approach to aid the management framework for Antarctic fisheries and for the protection of birds.	[Dias, M. P.; Carneiro, A. P.

As such, understanding ringed seal (Pusa hispida) dive and haul-out behavior is vital to understanding if and how these environmental changes affect seal foraging behavior. Working with Alaska Native subsistence hunters, we tagged 14 adult and 20 subadult ringed seals with satellite-linked data recorders in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, during late-September and October 2007-2009. Information about dive and haul-out behavior in the Bering and Chukchi seas was collected for 12-297days. We analyzed indices of dive depth, duration, and rate, and haul-out probability using a model selection framework for adults during fall (late-September-November) and winter (December-March) and for subadults during fall, winter, and also spring (April-June). We found differences by season and time of day, but not by sex. Where subadults and adults occurred together, they dove to similar depths; although subadults were commonly located in deeper waters where they generally dove deeper than adults. Both age classes dove longer during winter and subadults tended to make a few more (similar to 3.5) dives per hour than adults. Both age classes hauled out less and dove deeper, longer, and more frequently during midday than at other times of day. We suspect that seals dive deeper during midday because their prey migrates deeper. Dive and haul-out behaviors of ringed seals are influenced by a combination of factors, including prey distribution and abundance, sea ice, and seal diving physiology.

Such knowledge might help us understand how species interact within communities and highlight scale-dependent ecological processes in play among species. Here, I propose to analyze the inter-annual variation of a species assemblage at different ecological levels. For this, I joined a two-stage modeling approach and a spatially explicit multivariate model to analyze the interspecies relationships among six species of pelagic seabirds from 2004 to 2015 in the Barents Sea. The large-scale (similar to 400km) pattern of interactions revealed by the analyses suggests a change in the composition of the seabird community along the climatic gradient from south to north. At medium-scale (similar to 300km), the community was split into two areas (i.e., Arctic and sub-Arctic areas) suggesting niche differentiation of Arctic and sub-Arctic species driven by resource partitioning and interference competition. At a small-scale (similar to 40km), species with different body sizes were positively associated suggesting facilitation for accessing food although the species with the smallest body size was negatively associated with the species involved in the facilitation process suggesting interspecific interference competition. Over the years, the large-scale patterns were persistent, suggesting niche establishment, while small-scale patterns were highly variable suggesting only ephemeral interactions among species. My study demonstrates that interspecific relationships are scale-dependent and play major roles in structuring community. Untangling how species are associated with different ecological levels over time is indispensable to better understand how community structure contributes to ecological system dynamics.

Biomass allocation, as one of these traits, is responsible for resource acquisition, and its plastic modifications can be of adaptive value in new environments before any genetic adaptations may occur. Our aim was to compare in situ biomass allocation in aboveground and belowground organs in an Antarctic and a Polish population of annual bluegrass (Poa annua), the only alien plant species successfully invading Antarctica. The Antarctic population was characterised by three times lower aboveground biomass, more compact plant growth habit and higher fraction of biomass allocated into belowground organs than in the Polish population. The differences between populations are probably a result of adaptation to local conditions. The modifications of the studied traits in the Antarctic population are most likely a response to extreme atmospheric and edaphic conditions and enable the species to survive and spread in this hostile environment. Our results are in accordance with the balanced growth hypothesis. At the same time, these trait values enhance species performance under Antarctic conditions making P. annua a potential threat to local plant communities under altering climate changes and growing human impact scenario.

Thus, our prediction of how global change will affect distribution and survival of species can be estimated by using our knowledge, how species richness and distribution is related with latitude and elevation. We used 193 terrestrial orchid species and subspecies as an example and we classified them according to their root system. This trait represents the evolution of strategies for underground storage of resources and resource acquisition as well as a characteristics that can be described as a life history trait. Classification of orchid life history traits that focus on belowground strategies has never been examined in a macroecological study. We then explored the associations between species richness, mean niche breadth and mean distribution on one hand and selected predictors on the other hand, using regression techniques for all orchids, and then for their subsets with different root systems. The predictive power, as well as the significance of the predictors, was also tested using polynomial second order generalized linear models. Species richness for the three belowground strategies was significantly affected by the predictors, whereas their mean niche breadth and mean distribution were largely dependent on their evolutionary history. The correlations of mean niche breadth and mean distribution with maximum elevation, latitude and longitude were significant for all orchid taxa and their subsets. All the variables together accounted for almost 50% or more of the variance in each of the subsets. The maximum elevation was the most significant factor for rhizomatous and intermediate orchids, whereas minimum temperature in the coldest month was highly significant for the tuberous orchids. Spatial distribution of Greek orchids is associated with a combination of elevation, latitude and climate. The distributions of rhizomatous and intermediate orchids are mainly associated with the orographic configuration of Greece, whereas the tuberous orchids are widely distributed in the southern, central and north-western areas of Greece, where most of them are limited by the harsh winter climate.

Incorporating local-scale variables into distribution models enhances predictability for rare plant species with biological dependencies	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Conservation planning; Endangered species; Navasota ladies' tresses; Restoration; Scale; Species distribution models	ORCHID CONSERVATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SELECTION	The conservation of rare species is typically challenging because of incomplete knowledge about their biology and distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs) have emerged as an important tool for improving the efficiency of rare species conservation. However, these models must include biologically relevant predictor variables at scales appropriate for discriminating suitable and unsuitable habitat. We used a species distribution modelling tool, maximum entropy (Maxent), to assess the relative influence of biologically relevant topographic characteristics, land cover features, geological formations, and edaphic factors on the occurrence of the endangered endemic orchid Spiranthes parksii (Navasota ladies' tresses). Our final model produced an excellent AUC value (0.984), with the permutation importance to model fit of predictor variables representing topographic characteristics, land cover features, geological formations, and edaphic factors summing to 8.17, 35.12, 10.43, and 46.28%, respectively. Local-scale edaphic variables were the most informative, with soil taxonomic units explaining the highest amount of variance (36.40%) of all variables included in the model. These results document the importance of local edaphic characteristics in discriminating between suitable and unsuitable habitat for S. parksii, and emphasize the importance of including local-scale edaphic factors in SDMs for species such as S. parksii with specialized habitat requirements and close relationships with other organisms.

We tested whether reliable SDMs can be generated for benthic marine organisms at the scale of the Southern Ocean. We aimed at identifying the main large-scale factors that determine the distribution of the selected species. The robustness of SDMs was tested with regards to sampling effort, species niche width and biogeography. Location Southern Ocean. Methods The impact of sampling effort was tested using two sets of data: one set with all presence-only data available until 2005, and a second set using all data available until 2015 including recent records from campaigns carried out during the Census of Antarctic Marine Life (CAML) and the International Polar Year (IPY) period (2005-2010). The accuracy of SDMs was tested using a ground-truthing approach by comparing recent presence/absence data collected during the CAML and IPY period to pre-CAML model predictions. Results Our results show the significance of the SDM approach and the role of abiotic factors as important drivers of species distribution at broad spatial scale. The addition of recent data to the models significantly improved the prediction of SDM and changed the respective contributions of environmental predictors. However, the intensity of change varied between models depending on sampling tools, species ecological niche width and biogeographic barriers to dispersal. Main conclusions We highlight the need for new data and the significance of the ground-truthing approach to test the accuracy of SDMs. We show the importance of data collected through international initiatives, such as the CAML and IPY to the improvement of species distribution modelling at broad spatial scales. Finally, we discussed the relevance of SDM as a relevant marine conservation tool particularly in the context of climate change and the definition of Marine Protected Areas.

We examined whether the composition of freshwater species differs between landscapes dominated by urban, agricultural or more natural structures in a region with a long history of landscape transformation. We determined the differences and characteristics of the dragonfly fauna in relation to major land use categories. We particularly focused on urban land use, as it generally induces a high level of landscape transformation. Location Germany. Methods We used distribution data of dragonflies derived from a citizen science database, which was compiled for the German distribution atlas. To analyse whether different land use categories are associated with distinct species compositions, we performed the classification method random forest. Results Based on dragonfly abundance per grid cell, we identified distinct land use-related assemblages that were separated by two gradients, that is, the level of transformation and a gradient from open land to forest. In particular, urban landscapes possessed a distinct species composition with specific species, all of which were opportunistic and supported by warm climate. They also comprised significantly higher alpha-diversity than intensive agricultural landscapes. Similar values of gamma-diversity over all land use categories implied a countrywide homogenized dragonfly fauna, which is probably caused by historic land use. Main conclusions Our results indicate that land use is a relevant driver for the composition of freshwater species at the landscape scale. Urban landscapes maintain species diversity better than agricultural landscapes, but they modify the species composition. Additional research on the effects of land use change is required to understand species responses and predict future distributions in a changing world in order to plan sustainable conservation strategies.

Empirical support of this idea is weak in terrestrial systems, though tests of fragmentation effects are typically confounded with landscape composition and potentially obscured by imperfect detection. Here, we used multispecies occupancy models and a mensurative experimental design to test competing hypotheses about how forest fragmentation influences distributions of breeding forest bird species and communities. Location Southern Indiana, USA. Methods During the breeding seasons of 2011-2013, we recorded over 80,000 bird detections in 202 forest fragments using a sampling design that isolated the effects of patch size per se from the effects of forest amount within a 2 km radius, edge distance, local vegetation and sampling area. We modelled the effects of these covariates on distributions of individual species categorized by ecological trait groups (i.e., forest, forest interior or forest edge), and evaluated how forest loss and fragmentation impact species richness. Results Though our results indicated little effect of patch size on total species richness, decreasing patch size had a negative effect on interior species, and a positive effect on edge species. The effects of total forest amount were much more variable, and surprisingly had a negative influence on many species, particularly cavity nesters. Main conclusions Our results do not support theoretical predictions that forest patch size should positively influence bird species richness. However, composition of bird communities shifted towards edge species from interior species with decreasing patch size. Maintaining large forest patches is thus critical for supporting forest interior species, which tend to be of the greatest conservation concern.

Despite their importance, many species are of conservation concern and efforts to improve conditions are limited. Here, we address two major impediments to improving conditions: (a) our lack of knowledge of the interplay among natural landscape and human-induced changes; and (b) a very limited understanding of how species interactions affect overall crayfish distributions. Location Ozark Highlands ecoregion, USA. Methods We used both existing data and field-collected data to examine the relationships between 12 Faxonius species and physicochemical variables at multiple spatial scales. Data were analysed using a generalized linear mixed model. After fitting our environmental variables, we also considered possible relationships between species considered strong competitors and species occurrence. Results Our results indicated that elevation, lithology, an interaction between drainage area and anthropogenic disturbance, and the presence of strong competitors were associated with Faxonius occurrences. Faxonius occurrences were associated with assemblage-structuring variables: lithology and elevation. More interestingly, we found several patterns of interactions between drainage area and disturbance. The most common pattern among several species was a decline in occurrence in larger drainages when disturbance was high; however, longpincered crayfish (Faxonius longidigitus) was more likely to occupy large drainages as disturbance increased. Additionally, the presence of species considered strong competitors resulted in lower occurrence probability for many species, including two of the species classified as competitors. Main conclusions In addition to identifying the relationships between native species and assemblage-structuring variables, we show how the probability of species occurrences relate to interactions between disturbance and natural landscape features. Further, our results suggest competitor presence also plays a role in structuring distributions at the stream segment scale. Our findings emphasize the value of considering both competitor presence and interactions among landscape variables and disturbances in structuring crayfish assemblages.

Location The alpine belt of Sierra Nevada, Spain. Methods We analysed the spatial pattern of cpDNA diversity of the three species. To explain the distribution of genetic diversity, we investigated the effect of topographic features and the evolutionary history of the species (demography, habitat availability and colonization dynamics). Results Genetic diversity was heterogeneous across the landscape. We found moderate positive correlation values between genetic diversity indices of the two Linaria species. We also observed moderate negative correlation values between genetic diversity indices of C. glareosum and those of L. glacialis and L. nevadensis. Topographic variables correlated positively with genetic diversity of the Linaria species and negatively with genetic diversity of C. glareosum. Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) displayed a shared demographic pattern with a population size stabilization/increase since the LGM (the last 21 kyr) in all three species. Discrete phylogeographical analyses showed similar patterns of westward diffusion for L. nevadensis and C. glareosum. Species distribution models pointed to similar range dynamics in all three species, with a reduction in range size since the LGM. Main conclusions Different dispersal abilities, demographic trends and colonization patterns can hardly explain the differences in spatial patterns of genetic diversity between the Linaria species and C. glareosum. In contrast, topographic features seem to be an important factor to explain the distribution of genetic diversity in the alpine belt of Sierra Nevada. We point to a relevant role of microniche partitioning in determining patterns of genetic diversity distribution in alpine Mediterranean ecosystems. Furthermore, we highlight the role of microhabitat heterogeneity in the maintenance of distinct lineages, species and genetic diversity in high mountain biodiversity hotspots.

Drivers of chaparral type conversion to herbaceous vegetation in coastal Southern California	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						disturbance; Mediterranean; site aridity; vegetation change; wildfire	GRASS-FIRE CYCLE; SAGE SCRUB; SPECIES ABUNDANCE; POSTFIRE RECOVERY; SHORT-INTERVAL; FUEL BREAKS; SHRUBLANDS; PATTERNS; USA; INCREASES	Aim In Southern California, native woody shrublands known as chaparral support exceptional biodiversity. However, large-scale conversion of chaparral into largely exotic herbaceous cover is a major ecological threat and serious conservation concern. Due to substantial uncertainty regarding the causes and extent of this vegetation change, we aimed to quantify the primary drivers of and map potentially vulnerable locations for vegetation type conversion from woody into herbaceous cover. Location Santa Monica Mountains National Recreational Area, Southern California, USA. Methods We used air photograph image interpretation to quantify the extent to which chaparral shrublands transitioned to herbaceous cover from 1943 to 2014 across nearly 800 randomly located plots. Comparing plots that remained chaparral to those that converted to herbaceous cover, we performed hierarchical partitioning to quantify the independent contribution of a range of explanatory variables, and then used classification trees to explore variable interactions. We also developed a spatial model to create a seamless map delineating relative probability of type conversion. Results Of the original plots that were chaparral in 1943, 284 (36%) changed cover by 2014, with 79 completely converting, and 142 mostly converting to herbaceous cover. The primary mechanism behind shrubland decline and replacement was short intervals between fires (<=10 years), and type conversion was most likely to occur in arid parts of the landscape with low topographic heterogeneity and close proximity to trails and roads. Predictive maps delineated several hotspots with environmental conditions similar to those of type-converted plots. Main conclusions Chaparral type conversion is a widespread conservation concern, and results here suggest that short-interval fire and landscape disturbance are the most likely factors to exacerbate it, particularly in water-limited portions of the landscape where chaparral is subject to greater physiological stress and slower recovery. Reducing fire ignitions and mapping vulnerable areas may be important strategies for prevention.

Grazing networks promote plant functional connectivity among isolated grassland communities	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						archipelago; Campanula rotundifolia; functional connectivity; genetic diversity; grazing networks; habitat fragmentation; landscape configuration; landscape genetics; rotational grazing	SEED DISPERSAL; POPULATION-GENETICS; CONTEMPORARY POLLEN; POLLINATED HERB; EXTINCTION DEBT; LAND-USE; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SIZE; FLOW	Aim Habitat loss threatens plant diversity globally. Lack of plant functional connectivity between isolated populations is often pinpointed as one of the major underlying mechanisms driving subsequent species extinctions. Therefore, landscape-scale conservation management promoting functional connectivity needs to be implemented urgently. Supporting the movement of seed dispersal vectors such as grazing animals may help safeguard local and regional plant diversity in fragmented landscapes. However, the efficacy of such management remains to be thoroughly assessed. Location Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Methods We test how grazing animals may serve as mobile corridors within rotational grazing networks promoting plant functional connectivity via directed seed dispersal. Using landscape genetics, we compare isolated populations of the grassland perennial Campanula rotundifolia located in either active or abandoned grazing networks, to test if spatial patterns in their genetic diversity, differentiation and allele frequencies relate to the presence or absence of connectivity via rotational grazing management. Results Grazing networks imprinted strong landscape-scale spatial patterning in pairwise population genetic differentiation and within-population genetic diversity. Isolated C. rotundifolia populations functionally connected by grazing animals held higher genetic diversity compared to populations no longer connected by grazing livestock. Gene flow linked to the directed seed dispersal was higher between populations within grazing networks, confirmed by their increased allele richness. We found a predictable, nested loss of genetic diversity among C. rotundifolia populations in abandoned grazing networks. Main conclusions Grazing animals were important seed dispersal vectors, functionally connecting isolated grassland communities, so being vital to the successful long-term persistence and conservation of not only species but also genetic diversity. Crucially, the study underlines the possibilities of using domestic livestock as mobile corridors within rotational grazing networks as an effective tool to manage, conserve and restore both genetic and species diversity among isolated plant communities in fragmented landscapes.

In this study, we aimed to characterize how the above-mentioned factors shaped the genetic structure and demographic history of the Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi). Location The reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Methods Using mtDNA control region sequences and 15 nuclear microsatellite loci as genetic markers, we analysed population genetic structure with a factorial correspondence analysis (FCA), AMOVA, F-ST estimates and Bayesian cluster analysis. In addition, we estimated the demographic history using Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) analysis and MSVAR simulation. Results High genetic diversity was detected in Chinese muntjac populations. Population structure analysis strongly suggesting three genetic clusters (QL/BA/WLS, DB and JLS/WN/WYS). The demographic analyses showed that Chinese muntjac experienced population fluctuation during the late Pleistocene, followed by bottleneck during the Holocene. Main conclusions The extant Chinese muntjac populations harbour a surprisingly high genetic diversity despite of the bottleneck they went through. The populations show significant population structure separating populations in the upper, middle and lower regions of the Yangtze River, supporting the presence of three independent management units (QL/BA/WLS, DB and JLS/WN/WYS). The population demography of the Chinese muntjac presents high concordance with the rotation of glacial-interglacial in late Pleistocene. In addition, our study identified that the Chinese muntjac's recent population history may have been influenced by early human activities (8,509-1,605 years ago).

The experimental design was a large paired-plot design. Treatments consisted of chiseling in the planting row (CPR) and chiseling in total area (CTA) in an Oxisol and Ultisol. Soil CO2 emission, soil temperature, and soil moisture were assessed over 12days in the Oxisol and 11days in the Ultisol at a depth of 0-0.10m. Organic carbon associated with minerals (OCAM) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were also assessed. OCAM, pore class C2 (0.05?<0.1mm), soil moisture, and soil temperature explained 72 and 53% of the variability of soil CO2 emission in CPR and CTA, respectively. In the Ultisol, pore class C1 (?0.1mm) and OCAM explained 82% of the variability of soil CO2 emission in CPR. In CTA, soil moisture, OCAM, and POC explained 67% of the variability of soil CO2 emission. In the Oxisol, CPR and CTA affected soil structure, causing changes in both soil porosity and soil CO2 emission. In the Oxisol, the lowest average value of soil CO2 emission (2.8molm(-2)s(-1)) was observed in CPR whereas its highest value (3.4molm(-2)s(-1)) was observed in CTA. In the Ultisol, soil tillage (CPR and CTA) did not affect soil CO2 emission. These results indicate that the intensity of soil tillage in more clayey textured soils favors soil CO2 emission possibly due to a higher carbon availability for microbial activity when compared to more sandy textured soils. A less intensive soil tillage can be considered as an efficient strategy to reduce soil CO2 emission and hence soil organic carbon losses. Thus, this management strategy proved to be efficient in terms of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the contribution of agriculture to global climate change.

Over the last decade, global scale models have produced varied predictions of the size and distribution of SOC stocks, ranging from 1000 to >3000 Pg of C within the top 1m. Regional assessments may help validate or improve global maps because they can examine landscape controls on SOC stocks and offer a tractable means to retain regionally-specific information, such as soil taxonomy, during database creation and modeling. We compile a new transboundary SOC stock database for coastal water sheds of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, using soil classification data to guide gap-filling and machine learning approaches to explore spatial controls on SOC and predict regional stocks. Precipitation and topographic attributes controlling soil wetness were found to be the dominant controls of SOC, underscoring the dependence of C accumulation on high soil moisture. The random forest model predicted stocks of 4.5 PgC(to 1m) for the study region, 22% of which was stored in organic soil layers. Calculated stocks of 228 +/- 111 Mg C ha(-1) fell within ranges of several past regional studies and indicate 11-33 Pg C may be stored across temperate rainforest soils globally. Predictions compared very favorably to regionalized estimates fromtwo spatially explicit global products (Pearson's correlation: rho = .0.73 versus 0.34). Notably, SoilGrids 250 m was an outlier for estimates of total SOC, predicting 4-fold higher stocks (18 Pg C) and indicating bias in this global product for the soils of the temperate rainforest. In sum our study demonstrates that CTR ecosystems represent amoisture-dependent hotspot for SOCstorage at mid-latitudes.

Traditional monitoring networks do not capture the high spatial variability of Nr emissions sources; as such, pleurocarpous moss species have been used as a biomonitor for Nr deposition. Tissue concentrations of nitrogen (%N) in the moss species Hylocomium splendens at more than 100 locations in Ireland were used in conjunction with environmental variables (e.g., mean temperature (degrees C), sun hours, rain (mm), distance to coast) to determine predictive models of total nitrogen (N) deposition (kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and atmospheric ammonia (NH3) concentrations (mu g m(-3)). Tissue N concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 1.2%, with an average of 0.8%; concentrations showed a (low - high) gradient from the west (Atlantic) coast to the east coast Univariate regression analysis showed that %N tissue concentrations and environmental variables had similar spatial trends and associations. Tissue N concentrations had a stronger relationship with total N deposition compared with atmospheric NH3 (R-2 = 0.2, p < 0.001; R-2 = 0.1, p < 0.001, respectively). The best predictive model (based on backwards stepwise multiple regression, with model selection based on corrected Akaike Information Criterion) for total N deposition included tissue N concentrations; however, the model for atmospheric NH3 only included environmental variables (Total N deposition: R-2 = 0.61, p < 0.001; atmospheric NH3: R-2 = 0.73, p < 0.001). Sampling strategies involving pleurocarpous moss species have the potential to inform traditional monitoring networks towards improved spatial mapping of N deposition.

The ML methods include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Traffic, meteorological and pollutant data collected at nineteen Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) sites in London for a period between 2007 and 2012 was used. The ML models performed very well in predicting the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 with around 95% of their predictions falling within the factor of two of the observed concentrations at the roadsides. The prediction errors observed were very small as indicated by the average normalised mean gross errors of 0.2. Also, the predictions of the models correlated well with the observed concentrations as shown by the average values of R (0.8) and index of agreement (0.74). Additionally, when some PM10 and PM2.5 reduction scenarios were modelled, the ML models predicted various degree of reductions in the roadside concentrations. In conclusion, well trained ANN and BRT models can be successfully applied in predictions of roadside PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. Moreover, they can be applied in measuring the effectiveness of roadside particle reduction scenarios.	[Suleiman, A.] Bayero Univ Kano, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kano, Nigeria; [Tight, M.

To do this, we used structural equation modeling (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent "generalized fertility," F-G, of a soil using four indicator variables: the relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of F-G in this study were the supply rates of NO3-, P, and K as well as three indirect causes consisting of three physical soil properties, but these can change between studies. The model was calibrated using 76 grassland soils from southern Quebec, Canada and independently tested using aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the natural vegetation over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and the full SEM fit the data well. The F-G values predicted 51% of the variance in NPP and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including the actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied to grassland soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the causes and effects of soil fertility are clearly separated.

Abyssal deposit-feeding rates consistent with the metabolic theory of ecology	ECOLOGY			English	Article						deep sea; echinoderm; grazing; ingestion; invertebrate; megafauna	EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC; DEEP-SEA; ORGANIC-MATTER; TIME-SERIES; EMPIRICAL-MODEL; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; BODY-SIZE; STRATEGIES; COMMUNITY; SEDIMENTS	The Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) posits that metabolic rate controls ecological processes, such as the rate of resource uptake, from the individual- to the ecosystem-scale. Metabolic rate has been found empirically to be an exponential function of whole organism body mass. We test a fundamental assumption of MTE, whether resource uptake scales to metabolism, by examining detritivores accessing a single common resource pool, an ideal study case. We used an existing empirical model of ingestion for aquatic deposit feeders adjusted for temperature to test whether ingestion by abyssal deposit feeders conforms to MTE-predicted feeding rates. We estimated the sediment deposit-feeding rates of large invertebrates from two abyssal study sites using time-lapse photography, and related those rates to body mass, environmental temperature, and sediment organic matter content using this framework. Ingestion was significantly related to individual wet mass, with a mass-scaling coefficient of 0.81, with 95% confidence intervals that encompass the MTE-predicted value of 0.75, and the same pattern determined in other aquatic systems. Our results also provide insight into the potential mechanism through which this fundamental assumption operates. After temperature correction, both deep- and shallow-water taxa might be summarized into a single mass-scaled ingestion rate.

In a tritrophic system consisting of a plant, an insect herbivore, and an insect pathogen, plant based trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) can alter host-pathogen interactions and, thereby, indirectly affect disease transmission. In a series of field experiments, individual soybean plants (Glycine max) were sprayed with either a jasmonic acid (JA) solution to trigger induction of plant defenses or a similar control compound. Fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larvae along with varying amounts of a lethal baculovirus were placed on the plants to measure transmission. Induction of plant defenses decreased viral transmission due to increased population heterogeneity arising from changes in individual susceptibility. The change in susceptibility via TMIEs was driven by a decrease in feeding rates and an increase viral dose needed to infect larvae. While the induction against herbivore attack may decrease herbivory, it can also decrease the efficacy of the herbivore's pathogen potentially to the plant's detriment. While TMIEs have been well-recognized for being driven by top-down forces, bottom-up interactions can dictate community dynamics and, here, epizootic severity.

However, many flowers actively move during their daily cycle, changing both their detectability and accessibility to pollinators. The flowers of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata orientate their corolla upward at sunset and downward after sunrise. Here, we investigated the effect of different flower orientations on a major pollinator of N. attenuata, the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. We found that although flower orientation influenced the flight altitude of the moth in respect to the flower, it did not alter the moth's final flower choice. These behavioral observations were consistent with the finding that orientation did not systematically change the spatial distribution of floral volatiles, which are major attractants for the moths. Moreover, hawkmoths invested the same amount of time into probing flowers at different orientations, even though they were only able to feed and gather pollen from horizontally and upward-oriented flowers, but not from downward-facing flowers. The orientation of the flower was hence crucial for a successful interaction between N. attenuata and its hawkmoth pollinator. Additionally, we also investigated potential adverse effects of exposing flowers at different orientations to natural daylight levels, finding that anther temperature of upward-oriented flowers was more than 7 degrees C higher than for downward-oriented flowers. This increase in temperature likely caused the significantly reduced germination success that was observed for pollen grains from upward-oriented flowers in comparison to those of downward and horizontally oriented flowers. These results highlight the importance of flower reorientation to balance pollen protection and a successful interaction of the plant with its insect pollinators by maintaining the association between flower volatiles and flower accessibility to the pollinator.

However, conventional statistical PVA requires long-term data from every population of interest, whereas many species of concern exist in multiple isolated populations that are only monitored occasionally. We present a hierarchical multi-population viability analysis model that increases inference power from sparse data by sharing information among populations to assess extinction risks while accounting for incomplete detection and sampling biases with explicit observation and sampling sub-models. We present a case study in which we customized this model for historical population monitoring data (1985-2015) from federally threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout populations in the Great Basin, USA. Data were counts of fish captured during backpack electrofishing surveys from locations associated with 155 isolated populations. Some surveys (25%) included multi-pass removal sampling, which provided valuable information about capture efficiency. GIS and remote sensing were used to estimate August stream temperatures, peak flows, and riparian vegetation condition in each population each year. Field data were used to derive an annual index of nonnative trout densities. Results indicated that population growth rates were higher in colder streams and that nonnative trout reduced carrying capacities of native trout. Extinction risks increased with more environmental stochasticity and were also related to population extent, water temperatures, and nonnative densities. We developed a graphical user interface to interact with the fitted model results and to simulate future habitat scenarios and management actions to assess their influence on extinction risks in each population. Hierarchical multi-population viability analysis bridges the gap between site-level field observations and population-level processes, making effective use of existing datasets to support management decisions with robust estimates of population dynamics, extinction risks, and uncertainties.

In insects, this often means producing an annual number of generations (voltinism) appropriate to the local season length. Variation in voltinism may arise from variation in environmental factors (e.g., temperature or photoperiod) acting on a single reaction norm shared across populations, but it may also result from local adaptation of reaction norms. However, such local adaptation is poorly explored at short geographic distances, especially within latitudes. Using a combination of common-garden rearing and life cycle modeling, we have investigated the causal factors behind voltinism variation in Swedish populations of the butterfly Pararge aegeria, focusing on a set of populations that lie within a single degree of latitude but nonetheless differ in season length and voltinism. Despite considerable differences in ambient temperature between populations, modeling suggested that the key determinant of local voltinism was in fact interpopulation differences in photoperiodic response. These include differences in the induction thresholds for winter diapause, as well as differences in photoperiodic regulation of larval development, a widespread but poorly studied phenomenon. Our results demonstrate previously neglected ways that photoperiodism may mediate insect phenological responses to temperature, and emphasize the importance of local adaptation in shaping phenological patterns in general, as well as for predicting the responses of populations to changes in climate.

It has been argued that native-exotic richness relationships (NERR) are negative at small spatial scales and positive at large scales, but evidence for the role of spatial scale on NERR has been contradictory. However, no formal quantitative synthesis has previously examined whether NERR is scale-dependent across multiple studies, and previous studies on NERR have not distinguished spatial grain and extent, which may drive very different ecological processes. We used a global systematic review and hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the patterns of NERR over a range of spatial grain sizes and spatial extents, based on 204 individual cases of observational (non-experimental) NERRs from 101 publications. We show that NERR was indeed highly scale dependent across studies and increased with the log of grain size. However, mean NERR was not negative at any grain size, although there was high heterogeneity at small grain sizes. We found no clear patterns of NERR across different spatial extents, suggesting that extent plays a less important role in determining NERR than does grain, although there was a complex interaction between extent and grain size. Almost all studies on NERR were conducted in North America, western Europe, and a few other regions, with little information on tropical or Arctic regions. We did find that NERR increased northward in temperate regions and also varied with longitude. We discuss possible explanations for the patterns we found, and caution that our results do not show that invasive species are benign or have no negative consequences for biodiversity preservation. This study represents the first global quantitative analysis of scale-based NERR, and casts doubt on the existence of an "invasion paradox" of negative NERR at small scales and positive correlations at large scales in non-experimental studies.

Drivers of elevational richness peaks, evaluated for trees in the east Himalaya	ECOLOGY			English	Article						beta diversity; diversification rate; elevational gradient; geometric constraints; Himalaya; mid-elevational peak; species richness; trees	PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; RAPOPORTS RULE; SEED PLANTS; DIVERSITY; GRADIENT; SCALE; DIVERSIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; BIODIVERSITY	Along elevational gradients, species richness often peaks at intermediate elevations and not the base. Here we refine and test eight hypotheses to evaluate causes of a richness peak in trees of the eastern Himalaya. In the field, we enumerated trees in 50 plots of size 0.1 ha each at eight zones along an elevational gradient and compared richness patterns with interpolation of elevational ranges of species from a thorough review of literature, including floras from the plains of India. The maximum number of species peaks at similar elevations in the two data sets (at 500 m in the field sampling and between 500 m and 1,000 m in range interpolation); concordance between the methods implies that statistical artefacts are unlikely to explain the peak in the data. We reject most hypotheses (e.g., area, speciation rate, mixing of distinct floras). We find support for a model in which climate (actual evapotranspiration [AET] or its correlates) sets both the number of species and each species optimum, coupled with a geometric constraint. We consider that AET declines with elevation, but an abrupt change in the association of AET with geographical distance into the plains means that the location of highest AET, at the base of the mountain, receives range overlaps from fewer species than the location just above the base. We formalize this explanation with a mathematical model to show how this can generate the observed low-elevation richness peak.

Experimental habitat fragmentation disrupts nematode infections in Australian skinks	ECOLOGY			English	Article						Australia; biodiversity; fragmentation experiment; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; Hedruris; Lampropholis guichenoti; lizard; nematode; parasite; skink; Wog Wog	SPECIES INTERACTIONS; PARASITE; BIODIVERSITY; FOREST; PREDATORS	Habitat conversion and fragmentation threaten biodiversity and disrupt species interactions. While parasites are recognized as ecologically important, the impacts of fragmentation on parasitism are poorly understood relative to other species interactions. This lack of understanding is in part due to confounding landscape factors that accompany fragmentation. Fragmentation experiments provide the opportunity to fill this knowledge gap by mechanistically testing how fragmentation affects parasitism while controlling landscape factors. In a large-scale, long-term experiment, we asked how fragmentation affects a host-parasite interaction between a skink and a parasitic nematode, which is trophically transmitted via a terrestrial amphipod intermediate host. We expected that previously observed amphipod declines resulting from fragmentation would result in decreased transmission of nematodes to skinks. In agreement, we found that nematodes were absent among skinks in the cleared matrix and that infections in fragments were about one quarter of those in continuous forest. Amphipods found in gut contents of skinks and collected from pitfall traps mirrored this pattern. A structural equation model supported the expectation that fragmentation disrupted this interaction by altering the abundance of amphipods and suggested that other variables are likely also important in mediating this effect. These findings advance understanding of how landscape change affects parasitism.

Dry conditions and disturbance promote liana seedling survival and abundance	ECOLOGY			English	Article						community dynamics; growth; land use history; Neotropical forest; precipitation; seedlings crowding; survival	SUBTROPICAL WET FOREST; LAND-USE HISTORY; TROPICAL FORESTS; RAIN-FOREST; ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; NATURAL DISTURBANCE; SECONDARY FOREST; DYNAMICS; DROUGHT; BIOMASS	Species composition and community structure in Neotropical forests have been severely affected by increases in climate change and disturbance. Among the most conspicuous changes is the proliferation of lianas. These increases have affected not only the carbon storage capacity of forests but also tree dynamics by reducing tree growth and increasing mortality. Despite the importance of lianas in Neotropical forests, most of the studies on lianas have focused on adult stages, ignoring dynamics at the seedlings stage. Here, we asked whether observed increases in liana abundance are associated with a demographic advantage that emerges early in liana ontogeny and with decreased precipitation and increased disturbance. To test this, we compared patterns of growth and survival between liana seedlings and tree seedlings using a long-term data set of seedling plots from a subtropical wet forest in Puerto Rico, USA. Then, we examined the effect of precipitation and land use history on these demographic variables. We found evidence for liana seedling survival advantage over trees, but no growth advantages. This survival advantage exhibited significant temporal variation linked with patterns of rainfall, as well as differences associated with land-use history in the study area. Furthermore, we found that neighborhood density has a negative effect on liana survival and growth. Our results indicate that liana proliferation is likely related to a survival advantage that emerges in early stages and is influenced by climatic conditions and past disturbance. Predicted climatic changes in rainfall patterns, including more frequent and severe droughts, together with increases in disturbance, could have a significant effect on seedling tropical communities by favoring lianas.

Flow-divergence feedbacks control propagule retention by in-stream vegetation: the importance of spatial patterns for facilitation	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Aquatic macrophytes; Bio-physical feedbacks; Stress divergence; Establishment; Flume tank; Hydrochory	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES; EMERGENT MACROPHYTE; SPARGANIUM-ERECTUM; CURRENT VELOCITY; WATER DISPERSAL; PLANT FRAGMENTS; SEDIMENT; HYDROCHORY	Facilitation (enhancement of propagule retention in this case) is increasingly recognized as an important driver of biodiversity, but it is still unknown if facilitation during dispersal and colonization is affected by self-organized spatial pattern formation. We investigated the ability of in-stream submerged macrophyte patches to trap the vegetative propagules of three species (Berula erecta, Groenlandia densa, Elodea nuttallii in two size classes: 13-22 and 40-48cm long), and to potentially benefit the colonization of these three species. We tested the effects of propagule traits, hydrodynamic forcing, and spatial patch configuration on propagule trapping. Propagule buoyancy was negatively correlated with trapping chance, while propagule size did not influence trapping. Species-specific differences in buoyancy were maintained for weeks after fragmentation. Propagule retention was interactive and conditional upon the interplay between incoming flow velocities and vegetation spatial patterning. In the flume experiment at low flows, a patchy configuration (one patch filling 66% of the flume width) retained more surface-drifting propagules (B. erecta, G. densa), than near-homogeneous cover (two patches close together, filling the entire flume width). In contrast, retention of sinking E. nuttallii propagules increased in the two-patch configurations. In flume and field releases where patches did not completely fill the channel width, water flowed around the patches rather than over or through them. This resulted in low-flow velocity areas within patches where canopies were upright and propagules were retained, and higher velocity flows around patches. In contrast, when vegetation filled the channel width, water could not be diverted laterally around the patches and preferentially flowed over them, causing the canopies to bend and reduce their trapping capacity. In flume experiments at high flows, retention of all species decreased, regardless of vegetation configuration, as propagules passed over the reconfigured vegetation canopies. These findings on the interplay of water movement and patch reconfiguration suggest that environmental heterogeneity generated by the self-organizing behavior of aquatic plants might enhance colonization of sessile organisms, calling for landscape-scale processes like dispersal to be better investigated.

Comparison of fluorometric and microscopical quantification of phytoplankton in a drinking water reservoir by a one-season monitoring program	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Phytoplankton composition; Monitoring; FluoroProbe; Spectral fluorescence	IN-VIVO; FLUORESCENCE; CHLOROPHYLL; BIOVOLUME; PIGMENT; LAKE	Phytoplankton are key components in aquatic ecosystems and therefore an important target of monitoring analyses. Microscopical counting, although providing most detailed results, is time and labor intensive and requires highly skilled analysts. In situ spectral fluorescence measurements provide a much faster analysis with a higher spatiotemporal resolution. A one-season survey of phytoplankton assemblages was performed in order to compare the results of the spectrofluorometric measurements to classical microscopical determination in different sections of a drinking water reservoir. The investigations were performed with the spectrofluorometer FluoroProbe (FP) by bbe Moldaenke GmbH (Kiel, Germany), which is designed to discriminate among diatoms, green algae, Cryptophyta and cyanobacteria. The results of phytoplankton quantification as revealed by total chlorophyll a (Chla) measurements with the FP and total biovolumes determined by microscopy showed a good correlation.The accordance between the two approaches was best for diatoms and much lower for the other spectral groups. The proportion of green algae was generally overestimated by FP measurements in comparison to biovolumes. Contrary, the percentage of cyanobacteria was often underestimated by FP compared to microscopical analyses. A clear underestimation of cyanobacteria by FP measurements even at high abundances of Microcystis sp. was observed in two samples. No influence of species composition on the congruence between microscopical analyses and FP measurements was detected.

Interspecific associations between Hydrilla verticillata and three dominant native genera of submerged macrophytes are taxa dependent	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Exotic; Alien; Non-native; Facilitation; Competition; Biotic resistance; Biotic acceptance	INVASION SUCCESS; DIVERSITY; PLANT; COMPETITION; EGERIA; HYDROCHARITACEAE; FACILITATION; ABUNDANCE; FISH	Hydrilla verticillata is a submerged macrophyte that has invaded every continent except Antarctica. In this study, we tested the predictions that (i) H. verticillata invades sites with a higher prevalence of native species; (ii) co-occurrences between the invasive and natives depend on their degree of similarity in morphology and resource use and that (iii) native species morphologically similar to H. verticillata decreases in sites colonized by H. verticillata overtime, while occurrences of morphologically dissimilar species increase post-invasion. The incidences of H. verticillata and three taxa of dominant natives were inspected across 87 sites in a reservoir in South Brazil before and after invasion by H. verticillata. The predictions were tested through co-occurrence metrics and logistic regression analyses. The logistic regression indicated that H. verticillata invaded sites independently of the occurrence of dominant natives, but it co-occurred more than expected by chance with the morphologically dissimilar native Characeae species, Nitella sp. and Chara cf. guairensis. On the other hand, Egeria spp. (morphologically similar to H. verticillata) occurrences were not correlated with the presence of H. verticillata. Moreover, the probability of occurrence of Characeae increased significantly overtime in sites invaded by H. verticillata. These results indicate that H. verticillata invaded sites independently of environmental suitability and likely facilitated more dissimilar taxa, such as Characeae, but there was no evidence that it influenced Egeria spp. occurrences. The patches of H. verticillata probably provide favorable habitats for the establishment of Characeae.	[Silveira, M. J.; Thomaz, S.

A test of top-down control on plant production and nutrient quality in low-salinity tidal marshes	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Top-down; bottom-up controls; Tidal freshwater marsh; Oligohaline marsh; Productivity; Nutrient content; Insect herbivory	INTRODUCED SMOOTH CORDGRASS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; FRESH-WATER MARSH; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; SALT-MARSH; CONSUMER; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; PRESSURE	Herbivory has been shown to play a strong role in controlling primary productivity in tidal salt marshes, but little work has been conducted in low salinity marshes. We measured aboveground plant biomass and nutrient response to insect exclusion along a salinity gradient from tidal freshwater to oligohaline marshes. We expected higher biomass in plants protected from herbivory and more so in the higher salinity marshes where tissue quality was anticipated to improve. Among three marshes along the salinity gradient, aboveground biomass within experimental plots did not vary across control and insect exclosure treatments. Overall tissue quality did not increase with increasing salinity, thus we did not find increasing grazing pressure along that gradient. Tissue N-content in Zizania aquatica (a low-salt tolerant, C3, annual grass) was significantly higher (p<0.05) in plants within the insect exclosures, and it is the only species of those tested to demonstrate this effect. The lower tissue N-content in controls of this species could be either a response to grazing pressure that disrupts the ability of the plant to develop amino acids or a loss of N through guttation. We found that increasing levels of salt may have little effect on biomass in these marshes, but nutrient dynamics may shift as species like Zizania adjust the pool of tissue N-content.

Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 degrees C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems.

Prescribed burning and timber harvesting are two common, co-occurring, forest management practices that may alter forest carbon pools. Prescribed burning for forest management, such as wildfire risk reduction, may shorten inter-fire intervals and potentially reduce carbon stocks. Timber harvesting may further increase the susceptibility of forest carbon to losses in response to frequent burning regimes by redistributing carbon stocks from the live pools into the dead pools, causing mechanical damage to retained trees and shifting the demography of tree communities. We used a 27-yr experiment in a temperate eucalypt forest to examine the effect of prescribed burning frequency and timber harvesting on aboveground carbon (AGC). Total AGC was reduced by similar to 23% on harvested plots when fire frequency increased from zero to seven fires, but was not affected by fire frequency on unharvested plots. The reduction in total AGC associated with increasing fire frequency on harvested plots was driven by declines in large coarse woody debris (>= 10 cm diameter) and large trees (>= 20 cm diameter). Small tree (DBH) AGC increased with fire frequency on harvested plots, but decreased on unharvested plots. Carbon in dead standing trees decreased with increasing fire frequency on unharvested plots, but was unaffected on harvested plots. Small coarse woody debris (<10 cm diameter) was largely unaffected by fire frequency and harvesting. Total AGC on harvested plots was between 67% and 82% of that on unharvested plots, depending on burning treatment. Our results suggest that AGC in historically harvested forests may be susceptible to declines in response to increases in prescribed burning frequency. Consideration of historic harvesting will be important in understanding the effect of prescribed burning programs on forest carbon budgets.

Pelagic food webs of humic lakes show low short-term response to forest harvesting	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						autochthony; boreal lakes; forest clear-cut; land use; light; nutrient; primary production; resource use; zooplankton	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; PHYTOPLANKTON NUTRIENT LIMITATION; CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON; WATER-QUALITY; NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; STABLE-ISOTOPES; BOREAL LAKES; PHOSPHORUS; GRADIENT	Forest harvest in the boreal zone can increase the input of terrestrial materials such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-) into nearby aquatic ecosystems, with potential effects on phytoplankton growth through enhanced nutrient (i.e., positive) or reduced light availability (i.e., negative), which may affect ecosystem productivity and consumer resource use. Here, we conducted forest clear-cutting experiments in the catchments of four small, humic, and nitrogen-limited unproductive boreal lakes (two controls and two clear-cut, 18% and 44% of area cut) with one reference and two impact years. Our aim was to assess the effects of forest clear-cutting on pelagic biomass production and consumer resource use. We found that pelagic biomass production did not change after two years of forest clear-cutting: Pelagic primary and bacterial production (PP, BP), PP:BP ratio, chl a, and seston carbon (seston C) were unaffected by clear-cutting; neither did tree harvest affect seston stoichiometry (i.e., N:phosphorus [P], C:P) nor induce changes in zooplankton resource use, biomass, or community composition. In conclusion, our findings suggest that pelagic food webs of humic lakes (DOC > 15 mg/L) might be resilient to a moderate form of forest clear-cutting, at least two years after tree removal, before mechanical site preparation (e.g., mounding, plowing) and when leaving buffer strips along lakes and incoming streams. Thus, pelagic food web responses to forest clear-cutting might not be universal, but could depend on factors such as the time scale, share of catchment logged, and the forest practices involved, including the application of buffer strips and site preparation.

Indicators based on soils are not well developed and are absent in some current assessment protocols; these could be advantageous, particularly for soils, which are complex habitats for plants, invertebrates, and microbial communities. In this study, we examine whether multivariate soil indicators, correlated with microbial biomass and community composition, can be used to distinguish reference standard (i.e., high condition) headwater wetland complexes from impacted headwater wetland complexes in central Pennsylvania, USA. Our reference standard sites existed in forested landscapes, while our impacted sites were situated in multi-use landscapes and were affected by a range of land-use legacies in the 1900s. We found that current assessment protocols are likely underrepresenting sampling needs to accurately represent site mean soil properties. On average, more samples were required to represent soil property means in reference standard sites compared to impacted sites. Reference standard and impacted sites also had noticeably different types of microbial habitats for the two multivariate soil indices assessed, and impacted sites were more homogenized in terms of the fine-scale (i.e., 1 and 5 m) spatial variability of these indices. Our study shows promise for the use of multivariate soil indices as indicators of wetland condition and provides insights into the sample sizes and scales at which soil sampling should occur during assessments. Future work is needed to test the generalizability of these findings across wetland types and ecoregions and establish definitive links between structural changes in microbial habitats and changes in wetland soil functioning.

Here, using a multi-scale hierarchical design in southwestern France, we examined the effects of organic farming and seminatural habitats at the local and landscape scales on biological control services of three pests, including weeds and insects, in 42 vineyards. Organic farming at the local and landscape scales was beneficial to the mean and temporal stability of biological control services, while the proportion of seminatural habitats in the landscape reduced the level of biological pest control potential. The effects of organic farming and seminatural habitats across spatial scales varied with the type of prey considered and with time. Egg moth removal rates were higher in fields under organic management compared to conventional management while weed seed removal rates increased with the proportion of organic farming in the landscape. Larval removal rates as well as seed removal rates were always more stable within time in organic fields than in conventional fields. Moreover, independently of farming system type, local variables describing the agricultural management intensity, such as pesticide use or crop productivity, were also found to be important variables explaining levels of biological control services. Pesticide use tended to reduce biological control potential, while crop productivity was associated with contrasting biological control responses depending on the pest type. Our study demonstrates the need to target multiple spatial scales and to consider farming practices, as well as the proportion of seminatural habitats, to design functional landscapes that optimize biological pest control services.

A city-scale assessment reveals that native forest types and overstory species dominate New York City forests	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						forest management; invasive species; native biodiversity; spatial scale; urban biodiversity; urban canopy; urban forest; urban natural areas; woodland	URBAN FOREST; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY; FLORA; URBANIZATION; IMPACTS; PARKS; REGENERATION; COMMUNITIES; VEGETATION	Cities are increasingly focused on expanding tree canopy cover as a means to improve the urban environment by, for example, reducing heat island effects, promoting better air quality, and protecting local habitat. The majority of efforts to expand canopy cover focus on planting street trees or on planting native tree species and removing nonnatives in natural areas through reforestation. Yet many urban canopy assessments conducted at the city-scale reveal co-dominance by nonnative trees, fueling debates about the value of urban forests and native-specific management targets. In contrast, assessments within cities at site or park scales find that some urban forest stands harbor predominantly native biodiversity. To resolve this apparent dichotomy in findings, about the extent to which urban forests are native dominated, between the city-scale canopy and site-level assessments, we measure forest structure and composition in 1,124 plots across 53 parks in New York City's 2,497 ha of natural area forest. That is, we assess urban forests at the city-scale and deliberately omit sampling trees existing outside of forest stands but which are enumerated in citywide canopy assessments. We find that on average forest stand canopy is comprised of 82% native species in New York City forests, suggesting that conclusions that the urban canopy is co-dominated by nonnatives likely results from predominantly sampling street trees in prior city-scale assessments. However, native tree species' proportion declines to 75% and 53% in the midstory and understory, respectively, suggesting potential threats to the future native dominance of urban forest canopies. Furthermore, we find that out of 57 unique forest types in New York City, the majority of stands (81%) are a native type. We find that stand structure in urban forest stands is more similar to rural forests in New York State than to stand structure reported for prior assessments of the urban canopy at the city scale. Our results suggest the need to measure urban forest stands apart from the entire urban canopy. Doing so will ensure that city-scale assessments return data that align with conservation policy and management strategies that focus on maintaining and growing native urban forests rather than individual trees.

Wetland compensation and its impacts on beta-diversity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						biodiversity offsetting; biotic homogenization; hydrological gradient; wetland mitigation; wetlands; beta-diversity	BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; RESTORATION; SCALE; CONSEQUENCES; TRAJECTORIES; HOMOGENEITY; MITIGATION; PATTERNS; ZONATION	The anthropogenic degradation of natural ecological communities can cause biodiversity loss in the form of biotic homogenization (i.e., reduced beta-diversity). Biodiversity offsetting practices, such as compensatory wetland mitigation, may inadvertently cause biotic homogenization if they produce locally homogenous or regionally recurring communities. The fact that compensation wetlands often resemble degraded wetlands suggests that potential impacts to beta-diversity are likely. Yet, it is unknown how high-quality, low-quality (degraded), and compensation wetlands compare in terms of beta-diversity. We compared the beta-diversity of high-quality, low-quality, and compensation wetlands at local and regional scales. beta-diversity was quantified as the average distance to group centroids in multivariate space based on pairwise comparisons of community composition. The local spatial structure of beta-diversity was assessed using species turnover across plots. Indicator species analysis was used to describe compositional differences potentially contributing to differences in beta-diversity. Overall, the beta-diversity of compensation sites did not differ from high-quality or low-quality natural wetlands. However, compensation wetlands had a high degree of internal turnover along the hydrological gradient, which culminated in homogenous zones in the wettest areas. Compared to high-quality wetlands, low-quality wetlands had significantly lower beta-diversity at local scales, but significantly greater beta-diversity at regional scales. Indicator species results showed that compensation wetlands were distinguished by low conservation value species typically found in old fields and waste areas. This analysis also indicated that the invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea was indicative of low-quality and compensation wetlands. This species is likely contributing to differing patterns of beta-diversity between high-quality and low-quality wetlands. These results indicate that conclusions regarding beta-diversity depend on scale and scope of analysis. Particularly, the unique architecture of compensation wetlands makes conclusions regarding within-site beta-diversity dependent on the observer's position along the hydrological gradient. Additionally, while we conclude that compensation wetlands are not contributing to biotic homogenization at the regional scale, these wetlands are distinct from both high-quality and low-quality wetlands in their composition and structure. Therefore, assessments of the overall success of wetland mitigation programs should acknowledge the reality of these differences.	[Price, Edward P.

Beyond the model: expert knowledge improves predictions of species' fates under climate change	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate change impact; endemic species; expert knowledge; fine-scale data; Maxent; rainforest; refugia; species distribution modeling	BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; RESPONSES; IMPACTS; NICHE; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; ABUNDANCE	The need to proactively manage landscapes and species to aid their adaptation to climate change is widely acknowledged. Current approaches to prioritizing investment in species conservation generally rely on correlative models, which predict the likely fate of species under different climate change scenarios. Yet, while model statistics can be improved by refining modeling techniques, gaps remain in understanding the relationship between model performance and ecological reality. To investigate this, we compared standard correlative species distribution models to highly accurate, fine-scale, distribution models. We critically assessed the ecological realism of each species' model, using expert knowledge of the geography and habitat in the study area and the biology of the study species. Using interactive software and an iterative vetting with experts, we identified seven general principles that explain why the distribution modeling under- or overestimated habitat suitability, under both current and predicted future climates. Importantly, we found that, while temperature estimates can be dramatically improved through better climate downscaling, many models still inaccurately reflected moisture availability. Furthermore, the correlative models did not account for biotic factors, such as disease or competitor species, and were unable to account for the likely presence of micro refugia. Under-performing current models resulted in widely divergent future projections of species' distributions. Expert vetting identified regions that were likely to contain micro refugia, even where the fine-scale future projections of species distributions predicted population losses. Based on the results, we identify four priority conservation actions required for more effective climate change adaptation responses. This approach to improving the ecological realism of correlative models to understand climate change impacts on species can be applied broadly to improve the evidence base underpinning management responses.

Artificial lighting at night alters aquatic-riparian invertebrate food webs	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						cross-boundary subsidies; ecological light pollution; food webs; stream functioning; trophic position; urbanization	CHAIN LENGTH; ECOSYSTEM SIZE; STREAM; URBAN; PREY; DISTURBANCE; POLLUTION; PREDATORS; BEHAVIOR; LINKAGE	Artificial lighting at night (ALAN) is a global phenomenon that can be detrimental to organisms at individual and population levels, yet potential consequences for communities and ecosystem functions are less resolved. Riparian systems may be particularly vulnerable to ALAN. We investigated the impacts of ALAN on invertebrate community composition and food web characteristics for linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. We focused on food chain length (FCL), a central property of ecological communities that can influence their structure, function, and stability; and the contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies originating from stream periphyton). We collected terrestrial arthropods and emergent aquatic insects from a suite of stream and wetland sites in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Stable isotopes of carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) were used to infer FCL and contribution of aquatically derived energy. We found that moderate-to-high levels of ALAN altered invertebrate community composition, favoring primarily predators and detritivores. Impacts of ALAN, however, were very taxon specific as illustrated, for example, by the negative impact of ALAN on the abundance of orb-web spiders belonging to the families Tetragnathidae and Araneidae: key invertebrate riparian predators. Most notably, we observed decreases in both invertebrate FCL and reliance on aquatically derived energy under ALAN (although aquatic energetic contributions appeared to increase again at higher levels of ALAN), in addition to shifts in the timing of reciprocal nutritional subsidies. Our study demonstrates that ALAN can alter the flows of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems, thereby representing an environmental perturbation that can cross ecosystem boundaries. Given projections for global increases in ALAN, both in terms of coverage and intensity, these results have broad implications for stream ecosystem structure and function.	[Sullivan, S.

Black walnut alley cropping is economically competitive with row crops in the Midwest USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						agroforestry; discount rate; intercropping; land-use change; marginal land; silvoarable	JUGLANS-NIGRA L.; SOUTHERN ONTARIO; TEMPERATE REGION; GROWTH; AGROFORESTRY; SYSTEMS; CARBON; LAND; YIELD; SITE	The maize-soybean rotation (MSR) dominates the Midwest United States and degrades many ecological functions. Black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) plantation forestry (PF) and alley cropping (AC) are two alternative land-uses that can enhance productivity and restore ecosystem services. Given the lack of robust market mechanisms to monetize ecosystems services, we tested whether the profitability of PF and AC could drive adoption in the Midwest. Publically available data on black walnut soil suitability, timber prices, crop productivity, and cash rents were combined in a high-resolution spatial analysis to identify regions where these alternatives can outcompete MSR. To avoid selecting an arbitrary discount rate at which to make comparisons, we determined the threshold discount rate necessary to make PF or AC economically competitive with MSR. We show that, with a 5% discount rate, PF and AC could be more profitable on 17.0% and 23.4% of MSR land, respectively. Contrary to the common assumption that woody agricultural alternatives should first be adopted in marginal row crop areas, the economic competitiveness of PF and AC was not correlated with MSR productivity. Instead, black walnut growth rate was the central driver of PF and AC competitiveness, underscoring a necessary shift away from the current MSR-centric perspective in defining target regions for land-use alternatives. Results reveal major opportunities for landowners and investors to increase profitability by investing in PF and AC on both "marginal" and productive MSR land.

However, little is known about the contribution of marginal permanent and temporary riverine aquatic systems to river carbon metabolism. Elevation, in relation to flooding, hydro-morphological, and ecological features of such habitats, can affect the gas fluxes across the water-atmosphere interfaces and the periodically air-exposed riverbeds. This hypothesis was investigated in the lowland sector of the Po River (Northern Italy) from May to September 2008. Five different aquatic habitats were considered: the main river course; a backwater habitat; and three lateral lentic waterbodies-an oxbow and two quarry lakes of different age. The water mass was always CO2 and CH4 supersaturated, and gas fluxes were from the water to the atmosphere. In the highly dynamic river course and backwaters, CO2 emission rates were nearly one order of magnitude greater than in the lentic and hypoxic oxbow and quarry lakes. By contrast, CH4 fluxes peaked in the lentic, deeper, and permanent water bodies. At sediment-atmosphere interfaces, the CO2 emissions increased along an organic matter, a water saturation, and a chlorophyll a gradient, attaining the maximum rates in the periodically air-exposed riverbed and marginal sandy sediments. These differences in gas fluxes resulted from either the submersion persistence or the alternation of submersion and emersion phases, which were ultimately due to the gap between elevation and river water variations. All this stresses the critical role of marginal aquatic habitats for river C budget.

To fill these gaps, Tohoku hynobiid salamanders, Hynobius lichenatus (Amphibia, Caudata), were chronically irradiated with Cs-137 gamma-rays from embryonic to adult stages over 1954 days, and the effects on their growth and sexual maturation were examined under laboratory conditions. Irradiation at a dose rate of 33 mu Gy h(-1) had some stimulatory effects on growth (body weight increase) of H. lichenatus, while growth was temporarily or permanently suppressed at 150 or 510 mu Gy h(-1), respectively. On day 1802, secondary sexual characteristics (a tubercle at the anterior angle of the cloacal vent for males and ovisac development for females) were observed in 91% of the salamanders irradiated at 33 mu Gy h(-1), and in a similar percentage of non-irradiated controls. At 150 and 510 mu Gy h(-1), secondary sexual characteristics were not observed in any individuals. These results suggest that the derived consideration reference level (DCRL) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) for Reference Frog, i.e. 40-400 mu Gy h(-1), is applicable for the protection of H. lichenatus, and that growth and sexual maturation of this salamander may not have been adversely affected even in the most severely contaminated area in Fukushima, where the highest dose rate to salamanders was estimated to be 50 mu Gy h(-1). However, observations in the contaminated area are required to confirm this conclusion, considering the possible confounding factors which may make this salamander more sensitive to radiation in the natural environment than under laboratory conditions.

While overall seasonal changes in the frost resistance of herbaceous species are well documented, knowledge of the variability during the growth period is scarce. Responses could be expected due to differences in temperature yet investment in frost resistance might be at the expense of plant performance. To analyse temporal and spatial (i.e. same date but differing temperatures) variability, FR of leaves of six herbaceous species on five sampling dates were assessed along an elevational gradient in the northern limestone Alps. We used chlorophyll fluorescence techniques to calculate the lethal temperature of 90% of the population (LT90) thereof. To test the association with plant performance, we measured eco-morphological leaf traits (specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content, leaf phosphorous and magnesium content as well as stomatal pore area index (SPI)) in parallel. We found that FR as well as leaf traits exhibit a strong temporal variation whereas spatial variability was low. When analysing the relationship of FR to leaf traits we found that SLA as a proxy of growth rate was negatively associated with FR indicating a trade-off between growth and resistance, whereas SPI showed a positive relationship to FR. This finding gives further insight into the variability of traits and will help to improve predictions concerning plant performance and distribution under changing climate regimes.
