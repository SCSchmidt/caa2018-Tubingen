Modeling the relationship of aeration, oxygen transfer and treatment performance in aerated horizontal flow treatment wetlands	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Constructed wetland; Treatment wetland; Reactive transport modeling; Process simulation; Nature-based technology; Optimization	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; REACTIVE TRANSPORT; WATER; ORGANICS; DESIGN	Mechanical aeration is commonly used to improve the overall treatment efficacy of constructed wetlands. However, the quantitative relationships of air flow rate (AFR), water temperature, field oxygen transfer and treatment performance have not been analyzed in detail until today. In this study, a reactive transport model based on dual-permeability flow and biokinetic formulations of the Constructed Wetland Model No.1 (CWM1) was developed and extented to 1) simulate oxygen transfer and treatment performance for organic carbon and nitrogen of two pilot-scale horizontal flow (HF) aerated wetlands (Test and Control) treating domestic sewage, and, 2) to investigate the dependence of oxygen transfer and treatment performance on AFR and water temperature. Both pilot-scale wetlands exhibited preferential flow patters and high treatment performance for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4-N at AFRs of 128-700 L m(-2) h(-1). A reduction of the AFR in the Test system from 128 to 72 L h(-1) m(-2) substantially inhibited NH4-N removal. Conservative tracer transport as well as reactive transport of dissolved oxygen (DO), soluble and total chemical oxygen demand (CODs, CODt), NH4-N and NOx-N measured in pilot-scale experiments were simulated with acceptable accuracy ((E-1) over bar = 0.39 +/- 0.26). An equation to estimate the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient was found to be: k(La,20) = 0.511 In(AFR). Simulated treatment performance depended on k(La,20) in a non-linear manner. A local sensitivity analysis of the calibrated parameters revealed porosity, hydraulic permeability and dispersion length of the fast flow field as well as k(La,20) as most important. An optimal AFR for a spatially and temporally continuous aeration pattern for treatment wetlands treating similar influent was estimated to 150-200 L h(-1) m(-2). This study provides insights into aeration mechanisms of aerated treatment wetlands and highlights the benefits of process modeling for in-depth system analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the effectiveness of the two most used adhesives in aerobiological sampling, silicone prepared with cyclohexane solvent (Silicone) and petroleum jelly (Vaseline), was compared under outdoor conditions. This comparison was carried out using the traditional method based on the identification and quantification by optical microscopy (OM) of the airborne pollen and the novel methodology by high-throughput sequencing analysis (HTS). Globally, the results from both methods of analysis (OM and HTS) showed a good agreement between the two adhesives tested regarding the abundance of the main pollen types present in the samples: Cupressaceae, Olea, Poaceae, Platanus, Quercus. We concluded that the results from both adhesives are comparable data. Furthermore, the comparisons between methodologies, OM vs. HTS, showed that both techniques can accurately identify the most abundant pollen types in the atmosphere for the studied periods, with a good agreement of their relative abundances especially when the airborne pollen diversity is low but showing some divergences as the number of pollen types increases.

Negative effects of the sea lice therapeutant emamectin benzoate at low concentrations on benthic communities around Scottish fish farms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Atlantic salmon aquaculture; Sea lice; Emamectin benzoate; Benthic crustaceans; Canonical Correspondance Analysis; Generalised Linear Mixed Modelling	LEPEOPHTHEIRUS-SALMONIS; ORGANIC ENRICHMENT; SEDIMENTS; IMPACT; BIOTURBATION; PESTICIDE; TOXICITY; FAUNA	Emamectin benzoate is used as an in-feed treatment for the control of sea lice parasites in all of the main farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) facilities worldwide (Norway, Chile, Scotland and Canada). Investigations into its effect on non-target benthic fauna resulting fromits excretion fromfarmed fish and uneaten feed have been limited. This paper presents the findings from a study that intended to assess the impact of emamectin benzoate on benthic fauna using a new low detection method for emamectin benzoate. Eight fish farms in the Shetland Isles, Scotland were surveyed, with sediment sampled along transects radiating from the farms analysed for benthic ecology, sediment chemistry and sediment veterinary medicine residues (analysed for emamectin benzoate and teflubenzuron). Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Generalised Linear Mixed Modelling (GLMM) were used to assesswhich environmental parameters observed during the survey had the biggest effect on benthic community composition and abundance, and more specifically crustacean abundance and richness. Emamectin benzoate was found in 97% of samples, demonstrating widespread dispersion in the sediments sampled. The CCA showed that species composition was predominantly ordinated along a gradient of particle size, with a secondary axis dominated by a change in emamectin benzoate and organic carbon enrichment. Peaks in abundance of crustacean specieswere predicted to be organised along a gradient ofemamectin benzoate concentration. The GLMM corroborated this by showing that emamectin benzoate had the strongest negative effect on total crustacean abundance and species richness, though there was some degree of collinearity with organic carbon, that had a smaller effect. Overall, this study shows that, following its use as an in-feed treatment for sea lice, emamectin benzoate residues are more widely distributed in the benthic environment than previously thought, and have a statistically significant effect on benthic ecology at the concentrations observed in this study.

Blood and bone lead levels in South Africa's Gyps vultures: Risk to nest-bound chicks and comparison with other avian taxa	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Vulture; Lead; Blood; Bone; Chick; Ammunition	OXIDATIVE STRESS; HEAVY-METALS; EXPOSURE; RAPTORS; FULVUS; POPULATIONS; AMMUNITION; BIOMARKERS; RESIDUES; DECLINES	Poisoning, including secondary lead poisoning, is cited as the single most important cause of vulture mortalities in Africa. To evaluate the prevalence of lead poisoning among South Africa's Gyps vultures compared to other, non-scavenging birds, we obtained blood and bone samples from Cape (Gyps coprotheres) and White-backed (G. africanus) vultures. We found that 66% of White-backed Vultures (n = 110, including 85 nest-bound chicks sampled at Dronfield Nature Reserve) and 80% of Cape Vultures (n = 15) had blood [Pb] in excess of 10 mu g/dL, the upper limit of background exposure. Average blood [Pb] were 15.4 mu g/dL and 29.7 mu g/dL for White-backed and Cape vultures, respectively. Bone samples revealed that 12% of White-backed Vultures (n = 18) and 9% of Cape Vultures (n = 75) suffered from subclinical to severe clinical lead poisoning upon their deaths. By contrast, none of the 40 blood, bone or liver samples obtained from non-scavenging bird species were found to exceed background exposure levels. Our results suggest that, unlike non-scavenging birds, the scavenging lifestyle of Gyps vultures subjects them to lead poisoning on a regular basis. Had environmental sources of lead (e.g., dust) been the source of the lead poisoning at the White-backed Vulture breeding colony at Dronfield, all the chicks would have displayed similar blood lead concentrations. Instead the values ranged from barely detectable to very high, leading us to conclude that metallic lead fragments regurgitated by parents during feeding are responsible for the elevated lead levels in some of the chicks at this site. We conclude the likely source of these particles to be fragments of lead ammunition embedded in the carcasses of hunted animals. These results add to a growing body of evidence underscoring the threat posed by the use of lead ammunition and its potential role in the declines of vultures and other scavenging taxa.

Since Zn and Cd are chemically similar, increasing Zn concentrations in wheat grains (biofortification), while preventing Cd accumulation, is an agronomic challenge. We used two Swiss agricultural long-term field trials, the "Dynamic-Organic-Conventional System Comparison Trial" (DOK) and the "Zurich Organic Fertilization Experiment" (ZOFE), to investigate the impact of long-term organic, mineral and combined fertilizer inputs on total and phytoavailable concentrations of soil Zn and Cd and their accumulation in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). "Diffusive gradients in thin films" (DGT) and diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) extraction were used as proxies for plant available soilmetals. Compared to unfertilized controls, long-term organic fertilization with composted manure or green waste compost led to higher soil organic carbon, cation exchange capacity and pH, while DGT-available Zn and Cd concentrations were reduced. The DGT method was a strong predictor of shoot and grain Cd, but not Zn concentrations. Shoot and grain Zn concentrations correlated with DTPA-extractable and total soil Zn concentrations in the ZOFE, but not the DOK trial. Long-term compost fertilization led to lower accumulation of Cd in wheat grains, but did not affect grain Zn. Therefore, Zn/Cd ratios in the grains increased. High Zn and Cd inputs with organic fertilizers and high Cd inputs with phosphate fertilizers led to positive Zn and Cd mass balances when taking into account atmospheric deposition and fertilizer inputs. On the other hand, mineral fertilization led to the depletion of soil Zn due to higher yields and thus higher Zn exports than under organic management. The study supports the use of organic fertilizers for reducing Cd concentrations of wheat grains in the long-term, given that the quality of the fertilizers is guaranteed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A GC x GC-based estimation model was calibrated for 12 physicochemical properties that were relevant to the environment or to biological organisms, including human beings. Vehicle engine oil that had been contaminated by numerous compounds during its use was investigated as a case study to which the GC x GC model could be applied. Engine-oil samples were collected from a vehicle at intervals over a distance of 11407 km. The carbon and nitrogen contents in the oil remained unchanged at 83%-84% and 2%-5%, respectively, during the run; however, in excess of 100 compounds were present in the oil upon completion of the run. Post analyses of the studied mixture samples were performed with the developed GC x GC model, which links mass spectral information for structural identification. The GC x GC model allows us to classify the detected analytes in complex mixtures in terms of their properties, such as their aquatic bioaccumulation potential. The application of the model showed that the analyzed engine oil contained in excess of 100 compounds that could accumulate in aquatic biota and reach the arctic via long-range transport, which suggests that the components in the complex mixture of engine oil could pose a risk. The newly developed model that was derived in this study shows great potential for use in the mixture assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessment of freshwater discharge into a coastal bay through multi-basin ensemble hydrological modelling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Coastal bay; Ensemble prediction; Geomorphology; Streamflow; Transposition; Prediction in ungauged basins	NETWORK GEOMORPHOLOGY; MARINE EUTROPHICATION; TIME-SERIES; CATCHMENTS; RUNOFF; FLOW; HYDROGRAPHS; GENERATION; SIMILARITY; INVERSION	Coastal basins of the Brittany peninsula (France) are hydrological hot spots. A high level of nutrient pollution affects many of these basins and causes algal blooms in several coastal bays; nine have been a specific focus of the European Commission since 2007. The flux of each contributing basin flowing into these bays must be examined to assess the conditions and explore mitigation options. However, this task encounters a large lack of data since most of the basins are ungauged. In this context, this study developed a method which facilitates transposition of hydrographs from gauged basins to ungauged neighbouring basins of interest. Inverting a simple geomorphology-based transfer function of the gauged basin which describes travel time through channels enables the net rainfall time-series to be estimated from the discharge time-series of donor basins. To estimate the net rainfall of a given ungauged catchment, several net rainfall time series of gauged catchments are averaged. The resulting net rainfall is then transposed onto the ungauged target basin and convoluted by its own transfer function to estimate the hydrograph. This allows the transposition of as many hydrographs as there are different donor basins. This ensemble prediction enables the proportion of prediction uncertainty that is due to the heterogeneity in hydrological behaviour to be estimated. Moreover, the time-series of the donor basins are combined to estimate the ungauged net rainfall time-series. This provides a discharge prediction which values all available measurements. The method was applied to the highly controversial Saint Brieuc Bay, where it was possible to quantify the contribution of each coastal basin, even those influenced by dams, and ultimately the entire volume of fresh water entering the bay at an hourly time step. This work opens perspectives to additionally refine estimation of the associated nutrient fluxes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Physiological effects of gamma irradiation in the honeybee, Apis mellifera	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Honeybee, Apis mellifera; Biomarkers; Gamma rays; Acetylcholinesterase; Phenoloxidase; Catalase; Superoxide dismutase; Carboxylesterases	RADIONUCLIDE CONTAMINATION; ADAPTIVE RESPONSE; ESTERASE-ACTIVITY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; LIFE-SPAN; EXPOSURE; BEE; BIOMARKERS; RADIATION; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE	Terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to various kinds of pollutants, including radionuclides. The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is commonly used in ecotoxicology as a model species for evaluating the effects of pollutants. In the present study, honeybees were irradiated right after birth for 14 days with gamma rays at dose rates ranging between 4.38 x 10(-3) and 588 mGy/d. Biological tissues (head, intestine and abdomen) were sampled at D3, D10 and D14. Ten different physiological markers involved in nervous (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), anti oxidative (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)), immune system (phenoloxidase (PO)) and metabolism (carboxylesterases (CaEs) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) were measured. Univariate analyses were conducted to determine whether each individual biomarker response was positively or negatively correlated with the dose rate. Then, multivariate analyses were applied to investigate the relationships between all the biomarker responses. Although no mortality occurred during the experiment, several biomarkers varied significantly in relation to the dose rate. Globally, the biomarkers of antioxidant and immune systems decreased as the dose rate increased. Reversible effects on the indicator of the neural system were found. Concerning indicators of metabolism (carboxylesterases), variations occurred but no clear pattern was found. Taken altogether, these results help better understand the effects of ionizing radiation on bees by identifying relevant physiological markers of effects. These results could improve the assessment of the environmental risk due to ionizing radiation in terrestrial ecosystems.

In addition, sublethal exposure to insecticides may have an effect on the physiology and behaviors of surviving insects. Similar to other agricultural pests, pesticide use may have led to insecticide resistance in populations of Paederus fuscipes Curtis. In this study, we determined the median lethal time of 10 field-collected strains in Taiwan for three insecticides that are commonly employed to manage agricultural pests. We determined that the susceptibility of these strains to cyhalothrin and fenitrothion were similar, with resistance ratios (RRs) ranging from 1 to 4; however, significantly different to imidacloprid (RRs: 1-16). The effect of imidacloprid resistance on the life history traits studied of Paederus beetles was limited; only a prolonged egg incubation period, and adult longevity decreased as imidacloprid resistance increased. Regarding sublethal exposure to imidacloprid, adult sex ratios were female biased in most combinations, though nonsignificant. The quality of offspring, particularly the length of eggs significantly decreased. In addition, a hormetic effect was apparent when the individual was exposed to LT25 and LT50; mean fecundity per female increased from 12.80 +/- 8.95 (+/- standard error [SE]) to 42.70 +/- 13.77 eggs compared with that of the control (7.10 +/- 1.32). However, the hormetic effect was inconsistent among the tested strains, possibly because of the difference in insecticide resistance levels given that reproductive compensation was absent among the resistant population.

Effect of algal surface area and species interactions in toxicity testing bioassays	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Copper; Multispecies interactions; Cell density	COPPER TOXICITY; HEAVY-METALS; SENSITIVITY; ADSORPTION; MICROALGAE; TOLERANCE; GROWTH	Single and multispecies algal bioassays were assessed using copper toxicity with three green algae (Scenedesmus subspicatus, Scenedesmus quadricauda and Ankistrodesmus angustus) and one blue-green algae species (Oscillatoria prolifera). Single and multispecies toxicity tests were conducted based on cell density as per standard toxicity testing, and on equivalent surface area. A higher copper sulfate toxicity was registered for O. prolifera, followed by S. subspicatus, S. quadricauda, and A. angustus in single-species toxicity tests based on cell density. Single species toxicity tests based on surface area showed increased copper toxicity with increasing algal surface area except for A. angustus. In multispecies control bioassays, the growth of A. angustus was inhibited in the presence of other species in surface area-based tests. As compared to single species bioassays, O. prolifera, and S. quadricauda showed a decreased sensitivity to copper sulfate in both cell density and surface area based multispecies tests. However, for the algae species with the smallest surface area, S. subspicatus, 96h-EC50 value decreased in multispecies bioassays based on surface area as compared to the single species test, while it increased in multispecies bioassays based on cell density. The difference in S. subspicatus sensitivity to copper between tests based on cell density and surface area supports the need to adopt multispecies toxicity testing based on surface area to avoid the confounding effect on copper toxicity of increased biomass for metal binding. 96h-EC50 values for all species combined in the multispecies test based on cell density and on surface area were significantly different from 96h-EC50 values obtained in single species bioassays. These results demonstrate that single-species bioassays may over- or underestimate metal toxicity in natural waters.

We identified a native estuarine pelagic copepod species suitable for assessing the ecotoxicological impact of anthropogenic contaminants. Gladioferens pectinatus fulfilled the necessary-selection criteria of: wide distribution and abundance across New Zealand estuaries, ease of maintenance in the laboratory, short life cycle, sensitivity to toxicants with different modes of action, and providing reproducibility of biological response to toxicants. Measured endpoints were survival and larval development rate for the nauplii, and survival, realized offspring and total potential offspring for adults. LC50 values for the survival of G. pectinatus exposed to copper, phenanthrene and chlorpyrifos were 170 (143-193), 181.3 (131.3-231.3) and 4.3 (3.8-4.9) mu g/L, respectively. The most sensitive chronic endpoint identified for G. peetinatus was the larval development rate, with EC50 values of 49.8 (45-55.3), 31.3 (24.8-44.7) and 1.97 (1.6-2.31) mu g/L for copper, phenanthrene and chlorpyrifos, respectively. The acute and chronic responses obtained for G. pectinatus against the three reference toxicants are comparable with those reported for other copepod species and confirm its sensitivity and suitability to assess the toxicity of New Zealand estuarine samples.

Bioassays in higher plants are means of understanding the cytogenotoxic effects of these substances. In the present work, Allium cepa L. was used as a model species to assess nucleolar changes induced by environmental pollutants. The substances used were Methyl Methane Sulfonate (MMS), cadmium (Cd), Spent Potliner (SPL) and the herbicide Atrazine. Water was used as a negative control. The silver stained nucleolar organizer region (AgNOR) assay was used making it possible to evaluate how nucleolar parameters (number of nucleoli per nucleus and nucleoli area) behave when facing stress caused by such pollutants. The results obtained showed a variation in the observed parameters: an increase in the number of nucleoli in the treated cells and tendency to a reduction in nucleolar area, indicating that the tested pollutants may have impaired nucleolar activity. In addition, it was possible to establish a relationship between the behavior of the nucleolus with other changes as plantlet growth, cell proliferation, and DNA damage.

The Interplay Between Extrinsic and Intrinsic Factors in Determining Migration Decisions in Brown Trout (Salmo trutta): An Experimental Study	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						climate change; partial migration; anadromy; aquatic; brown trout; genotype by environment; Salmo trutta; proximate drivers	LIFE-HISTORY PATTERNS; MALE ATLANTIC SALMON; FRESH-WATER; SMOLT TRANSFORMATION; INDIVIDUAL CONDITION; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; GENETIC-VARIATION; REACTION NORMS; BODY-SIZE; SALAR L.	Many species are capable of facultative migration, but the relative roles of extrinsic vs. intrinsic factors in generating diverse migratory tactics remain unclear. Here we explore the proximate drivers of facultative migration in brown trout in an experimental laboratory setting. The effects of reduced food, as a putative environmental cue, were examined in two populations: one that exhibits high rates of anadromy (sea-migration) in nature, and one that does not exhibit anadromy in nature. Juveniles derived from wild-caught parents were reared for 2 years under four environmental treatments: low food in years 1 and 2 (Low-Low); high food in years 1 and 2 (High-High), low food in year 1 and high in year 2 (Low-High), and vice versa (High-Low). Food restriction had a significant effect on migratory tactics, with the frequency of smolts (juveniles choosing migration) highest in the Low-Low treatment in both populations. No individuals became smolts in the High-High treatment, and intermediate smolting rates were observed in the Low-High and High-Low treatments. Higher overall smolting rates in the naturally anadromous population suggested an inherited component to anadromy/migration decisions, but both populations showed variability in migratory tactics. Importantly, some fish from the naturally non-anadromous population became smolts in the experiment, implying the capacity for migration was lying "dormant," but they exhibited lower hypo-osmoregulatory function than smolts from the naturally anadromous population. Tactic frequencies in the naturally anadromous population were more affected by food in the 2nd year, while food in the 1st year appeared more important for the naturally non-anadromous population. Migratory tactics were also related to sex, but underpinned in both sexes by growth in key periods, size, and energetic state. Collectively these results reveal how migration decisions are shaped by a complex interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors, informing our ability to predict how facultatively migratory populations will respond to environmental change.

Two scenarios, i.e., single-pulse vs. repetitive deposition of same amounts of algal detritus, were tested in sediment core incubation experiments. In the first case, a single pulse of phytodetritus emulated the sudden large input of phytoplanktonic material onto sediments following the decline of spring blooms in surface waters, whereas the repetitive deposition of small amounts of algal detritus represented the low, continuous flow of marine input of either pelagic or benthic origin that remains significant all year round. The mineralization rate of wheat detritus to (CO2)-C-13 in each treatment was measured on days 6, 8, 14, and 20 following the initiation of the experiment. No evidence of PEs on C-13-wheat mineralization upon the addition of labile phytodetritus could be detected in either scenario under the experimental conditions employed in this study.

This is evidenced by high chlorophyll concentrations and increased frequency of phytoplankton blooms. However, shifts in nutrient loads to estuarine ecosystems can also cause modifications in the structure of phytoplankton communities which can have adverse impacts right through the food web. Acknowledging these modifications is imperative if response mechanisms are to be fully understood. In this study, Ireland's current water framework directive (WFD) tool for determining the status of phytoplankton communities was built upon to encompass not only biomass and bloom frequency but also community structure (diversity and evenness) and abundance. This method allows for comparison with site- and date-specific environmental data which could give an indication of cause and effect relationships. The newly developed phytoplankton index performed well against current methods to determine ecological status. Furthermore, it had a better agreement with other physico-chemical and biological WFD parameters. Statistical analysis captured the relationship between the phytoplankton index and physicochemical parameters, allowing for a more detailed look at the impact of disturbance on the system. The inclusion of community structure acknowledged the imbalances in the phytoplankton communities of some systems even when frequent blooms are not evident. In bloom conditions, the disparity between the chlorophyll and abundance metrics within the phytoplankton index can be linked to winter dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration and forms, temperature, and light conditions. Application of the phytoplankton index will allow not only for compliance with WFD requirements, but also a method for understanding and assessing ecosystem health of estuarine phytoplankton communities over spatial and temporal timelines in line with changes in physiochemical parameters.

The three sites Braviken, Himmerfjarden, and Adfjarden, have been impacted to various degree during the last millennia by multiple stressors like excessive nutrient discharge and hazardous substances, leading to coastal hypoxia, eutrophication, and pollution. These stressors are mainly caused by drivers in the drainage area as increased human population, changed land use, and point sources as industries and a sewage treatment plant. Even though their detailed history differs, the results show similar general patterns for all three sites. We find no evidence in our data from the coastal zone supporting the hypothesis that the extensive areal distribution of hypoxia in the open Baltic Sea during the Medieval Climate Anomaly was caused by human impact. Timing of the onset of man-made eutrophication, as identified from delta N-15 and changes in diatom composition, differs between the three sites, reflecting the site specific geography and local environmental histories of these areas. The onset of eutrophication dates to similar to 1800 CE in Braviken and Himmerfjarden areas, and to similar to 1900 CE in the less urban area of Adfjarden. We conclude that the recorded environmental changes during the last centuries are unique in a thousand year perspective.

Individual Spatial Consistency and Dietary Flexibility in the Migratory Behavior of Northern Gannets Wintering in the Northeast Atlantic	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						individual variation; carry-over effects; Geolocator (GLS); stable isotope analysis (SIA); animal migration	STABLE-ISOTOPES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; MARINE PREDATOR; BODY CONDITION; SITE FIDELITY; SULA-BASSANA; SPECIALIZATION; CONSEQUENCES; SEABIRDS; STRATEGIES	Migration is a fundamental behavioral process prevalent among a wide variety of animal taxa. As individuals are increasingly shown to present consistent responses to environmental cues for breeding or foraging, it may be expected that approaches to migration would present similar among-individual consistencies. Seabirds frequently show consistent individual differences in a range of traits related to foraging and space-use during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons, but the causes and consequences of this consistency are poorly understood. In this study, we combined analysis of geolocation and stable isotope data across multiple years to investigate individual variation in the non-breeding movements and diets of northern gannets Morus bassanus, and the consequences for changes in body condition. We found that individuals were highly repeatable in their non-breeding destination over consecutive years even though the population-level non-breeding distribution spanned >35 degrees of latitude. Isotopic signatures were also strongly repeatable, with individuals assigned to one of two dietary clusters defined by their distinct trophic (delta N-15) and spatial (delta C-13) position. The only non-breeding destination in which the two dietary clusters co-occurred was off the coast of northwest Africa. The majority of individuals adopted a consistent foraging strategy, as they remained within the same dietary cluster across years, with little variation in body mass corrected for size among these consistent individuals. In contrast, the few individuals that switched clusters between years were in better condition relative to the rest of the population, suggesting there may be benefits to flexibility during the non-breeding period. Our results indicate that a consistent migratory strategy can be effective regardless of wintering region or diet, but that there may be benefits to those individuals able to display flexibility. This appears to be an important behavioral strategy that may enhance individual condition.	[Grecian, W.

However, estimates of the contribution of different primary production sources sustaining these organisms are not well characterised. We measured the stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) of essential amino acids (EAAs) in muscle tissue from two common bivalve genera (Macoma spp. and Astarte spp.) collected in Hanna Shoal in the northeastern Chukchi Sea. Mixing models comparing the delta C-13(EAA) fingerprints of the bivalves to a suite of primary production endmembers revealed relatively high contributions of EAAs from phytoplankton and bacteria in both species. We also examined whether delta C-13(EAA) fingerprints could be produced from the EAAs preserved in bivalve shells, which could allow primary production sources to be estimated from ancient bivalve shells. The delta C-13(EAA) fingerprints from a suite of paired modern bivalve shells and muscle from Macoma calcarea from across the Chukchi Sea revealed a correspondence between the estimates of the dominant primary production source of EAAs derived from analyses of these two tissue types. Our findings indicate that delta C-13(EAA) fingerprinting of marine bivalves can be used to examine dominant organic matter sources in the Arctic marine benthos in recent years as well as in deeper time.

Plant-Soil Feedbacks of Maize Companion Cropping Increase Chemical Plant Defenses Against Herbivores	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						plant defenses; plant-soil feedback; push-pull technology; sustainable agriculture; local biodiversity; associational resistance; functional diversity	CHILO-PARTELLUS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; OVIPOSITION; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; LEPIDOPTERA; MANAGEMENT; PARASITOIDS; POPULATIONS; FERTILITY	Plants can alter nutritional availability, structure, and chemistry of the soil they grow in. These soil changes can positively or negatively influence the growth and metabolism of other plants that co-occur or grow later in the conditioned soil. Plant-soil feedbacks could affect community interactions and dynamics but also be applied in sustainable agriculture to promote plant growth and resistance to pests. In this study, we use a maize companion cropping system, commonly known as "push-pull," as a model to investigate soil-mediated effects of functional biodiversity, on maize plant growth, and resistance against insect herbivores. We grew maize in soils collected from push-pull (polyculture) and non-push-pull (monoculture) fields. We evaluated maize performance by measuring plant growth, as well as resistance traits (herbivore oviposition and larval feeding, production of defense-related volatile, and non-volatile secondary defense metabolites). Maize plants grown in soil conditioned by push-pull companion cropping had a higher growth rate compared to those grown in soil from non-push-pull monoculture fields. In addition, soil from push-pull fields induced a constitutively higher and qualitatively different emission of volatile organic compounds than soil from non-push-pull fields. Moreover, secondary defense metabolites such as 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA), were produced in larger quantities in plants grown in soil from push-pull fields compared to those from monoculture fields. These soil-mediated alterations in plant secondary metabolism were associated with reduced herbivory by larvae of the stemboring pest Chilo partelillus. This study provides novel evidence that plant-soil feedbacks can affect plant metabolism, growth, and resistance to pests. The observed soil-mediated effects on maize plant secondary metabolism can be viewed as emergent properties of plant community composition as well as a potent mechanism of associational resistance. In addition, these soil-conditioning effects provide a novel pest control mechanism of push-pull companion cropping.

However, it is not known whether such queen pheromones might also play a role in regulating reproductive division of labor in primitively eusocial insects that lack morphologically defined castes. Here, we experimentally tested whether a blend of CHCs which occurred in higher concentrations in the dominant breeding female acts as a queen pheromone, and inhibits reproduction by subordinate females in the primitively eusocial paper wasp Polistes satan. In contrast to earlier findings with highly eusocial species, our results show that although specific compounds were enhanced in dominant, reproductively active females, a blend of five of these compounds did not inhibit development of the ovaries of female nestmates. Instead, the dominant female had to be physically present to prevent subordinate females from reproducing. Our results are in line with earlier evidence suggesting that fertility-linked compounds in primitively eusocial wasps act only as cues and help to regulate reproduction when used in conjunction with aggressive dominance behavior, meaning the physical presence of the dominant female. Alternatively, our results support the hypothesis that queen pheromones in highly eusocial insects were co-opted from fertility cues that were already present in primitively eusocial ancestors, even when initially, such compounds were merely produced as by-products of ovarian activation, without actually serving to signal reproductive status.

The case-study of tropical grazing practices in the French West Indies	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Soil ingestion; Pasture allowance; Soil surface moisture; Beef cattle; Contaminant; Exposure risk	RELATIVE BIOAVAILABILITY; ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS; BOUND CHLORDECONE; N-ALKANES; LONG-TERM; INGESTION; SHEEP; AREA; VEGETATION; PASTURES	Ingested soil is a major vector of organic contaminants from environment to free-ranged animals, particularly for grazing herbivores. Therefore, a better understanding of processes driving soil intake may provide new insights to limit animal exposure to contaminants and ensure safety of animal products. To maintain the supply service of livestock farming activities in contaminated areas, it is necessary to design adapted farming practices aiming at controlling the risk for human health. This study was conducted in the French West Indies, where chlordecone, an organochlorine insecticide previously used to protect banana plantation against the black weevil and banned since 1993, has polluted nearly 20% of agricultural surfaces since the 1970s. A crossover study design was performed to estimate soil intake by twelve tethered Creole young bulls according to different grazing practices. The objectives were to characterize the influence of (i) daily herbage allowance (LOW. HIGH, ADLIB: 100, 150, 300 g DM/kg BW0.75 respectively); (ii) and soil surface moisture (SSM) testing grazing on a water-saturated (HUM) vs dried (DRY) ground. The herbage offer was managed via the allocated surfaces varying the chain length as animal holders commonly do in informal Caribbean systems. The results evidenced an increase in soil intake with DHA reduction (2.1 to 3.8% of DM intake; P < 0.05) and with SSM increase (2.4 to 3.6% of DM intake; P < 0.05). Herbage offer reduction involved a doser-to-the-ground grazing with shorter post-grazing sward surface height (82.2 to 63.3 mm; P < 0.001), and both herbage offer reduction and SSM increase amplified sward soiling (measured from titanium content in unwashed herbage and image analysis). This work showed that soil intake is unavoidable even when herbage offer is very generous. The animals will significantly increase soil intake when herbage offer would be at 150 g DM/kg BW0.75 or less, especially when the grazed surface is humid. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study characterized and modelled SOC stocks at two soil depth intervals, topsoil (0-30 an) and subsoil (30-100 cm), based on both legacy and recent data from 7245 agricultural soil profiles and using environmental drivers (climate, agricultural practices and soil properties) for agricultural soils in Catalonia (NE Spain). Generalized Least Square (GLS) and Geographical Weighted Regression (GWR) were used as modelling approaches to: (i) assess the main SOC stock drivers and their effects on SOC stocks; (ii) analyse spatial variability of SOC stocks and their relationships with the main drivers; and (iii) predict and map SOC stocks at the regional scale. While topsoil variation of SOC stocks depended mainly on climate, soil texture and agricultural variables, subsoil SOC stocks changes depended mainly on soil attributes such us soil texture, clay content, soil type or depth to bedrock. The GWR model revealed that the relationship between SOC stocks and drivers varied spatially. Finally, the study was only able to predict and map topsoil SOC stocks at the regional scale, because controlling factors of SOC stocks at the subsoil level were largely unavailable for digital mapping. According to the resulting map, the mean SOC stock value for Catalan agriculture at the topsoil level was 4.88 +/- 0.89 kg/m(2) and the total magnitude of the carbon pool in agricultural soils of Catalonia up to 30 cm reached 47.9 Tg. The present study findings are useful for defining carbon sequestration strategies at the regional scale related with agricultural land use changes and agricultural management practices in a context of climate change.

Advancing soil ecological risk assessments for petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soils in Canada: Persistence, organic carbon normalization and relevance of species assemblages	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Species sensitivity distribution; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Organic carbon normalization; Site-specific risk assessment; Soil ecological risk assessment; Remediation	SENSITIVITY DISTRIBUTIONS; AVOIDANCE-BEHAVIOR; QUALITY CRITERIA; ORIBATID MITE; OPPIA-NITENS; OIL-SPILL; TOXICITY; BIOAVAILABILITY; PESTICIDES; TESTS	Sediment toxicity studies and ecological risk assessments on organic contaminants routinely apply organic carbon normalization to toxicity data; however, no studies examine its potential for use in soils with petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) contamination. Limited studies in soil ecotoxicology assess the influence of species assemblages used in species sensitivity distribution construction on the resulting guideline designated to of soil dwelling organisms. Canadian regulations utilize more conservative approaches to deriving guidelines with soil ecotoxicology data compared to the rest of the world, so we investigated the impact of these on soil invertebrates in a variety of field soils. In addition to toxicity, the persistence of a medium PHC mixture was also assessed in the field soils to determine the duration of toxic effects. We found organic matter influenced PHC toxicity to soil invertebrates, but persistence was influenced more by soil cation exchange capacity. Incorporating organic carbon normalization into species sensitivity distribution curves provided a higher level of protection to soil dwelling receptors in low organic matter soils as well as reduce the variability of PHC soil toxicity data. Soil remediation guidelines derived for protection of soil dwelling organisms using a diverse species assemblage provided similar levels of protection as guidelines developed with test species specific for remote, forested land uses in Canada. We conclude that: (i) Canadian hazard concentration values for PHC contamination of soils should be revisited as they may not be protective and (ii) that soil PHC guidelines for protection of soil dwelling organisms should be expressed as carbon normalized values.

This is most important in agricultural areas where soils are sensitive to erosion. The geology of these areas is often characterized by large expanses of relatively homogeneous quaternary silts. The possibility of distinguishing the sources of erosion according to their geological substratum is thus very delicate. This information is important because its lack can lead to the mis-implementation of erosion control measures. To address this request, a confluence-based sediment fingerprinting approach was developed on the Canche river watershed (1274 km(2); northern France), located in the European loess belt, an area that is affected by diffuse and concentrate erosion processes. Suspended particulate matter was collected during five seasonal sampling campaigns using sediment traps at the outlet of each tributary and confluence with the main stream of the Canche river. The final composite fingerprint was defined using physico-chemical and statistical analyses. The best tracer parameters for each tributary were selected using stepwise discriminant function analyses. These parameters were introduced into a mass balance mixing model incorporating Monte-Carlo simulations to represent the uncertainty. Estimates of the overall mean contributions from each tributary were quantified at different temporal scales. The annual sediment flux tributaries contributions range from 3 to 22% at the outlet of the Canche river, and annual sediment flux range from 0.87 to 40.7 kt yr(-1). The Planquette and the Crequoise tributaries appear to be those producing the largest sediment flux. In contrast, tributaries with the highest number of erosion control on their area exhibit the lowest values of sediment flux. Our results indicate a positive impact of recent land management policies in the Canche river watershed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cadmium uptake by onions, lettuce and spinach in New Zealand: Implications for management to meet regulatory limits	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Cadmium uptake; Cultivar; Onion; Spinach; Plant-soil relationship	LACTUCA-SATIVA L.; CD CONCENTRATIONS; HEAVY-METALS; SOIL; ACCUMULATION; FOOD; CULTIVARS; WHEAT; ZINC; FERTILIZERS	Paired soil and plant samples collected from the main commercial growing areas for onions (Allium cepa), lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and spinach (Spinacia olearacea) in New Zealand were used to assess the influence of plant and soil factors on cadmium (Cd) uptake in these crops. Differences in Cd concentration between eight lettuce sub-types were not consistent across sites, nor were differences in Cd concentrations in three crisphead cultivars assessed at two sites. Similarly, differences in Cd concentrations between four onion cultivars were inconsistent across sites. Mean lettuce Cd concentrations in eight lettuce varieties (range 0.005-0.034 mg.kg(-1) (fresh weight, FW) were markedly lower than those in baby leaf and bunching spinach, (range 0.005-0.19 mg.kg(-1) FW). Significant regional variation was observed in Cd concentrations in one onion cultivar (mean range 0.007-0.05 mg.kg(-1) FW). Soil Cd concentration, pH and region were statistically significant predictors of onion Cd concentration, explaining low (38% for soil Cd and pH) to moderate (50% for all three parameters) percentage of the variation. Soil Cd concentration and exchangeable magnesium or total carbon were statistically significant predictors of Cd concentration in baby leaf and bunching spinach, respectively, explaining a moderate percentage (49% and 42%) of the variation in Cd concentration. Increasing pH and soil carbon may assist in minimising Cd uptake in onion and bunching spinach, respectively. The low to moderate proportion of explained variation is partly attributable to the narrow range in some measured soil properties and indicates factors other than those assessed are influencing plant uptake. This highlights a challenge in using these relationships to develop risk-based soil guideline values to support compliance with food standards. Similarly, the inconsistency in Cd concentrations in different cultivars across sites highlights the need for multi-site assessments to confirm the low Cd accumulation status of different cultivars.

The FSM, used a fuzzy rule based algorithm FURIA, as attribute evaluator, whereas GA were used as the search method, in order to obtain optimal set of variables used in flood susceptibility modeling assessments. The novel FURIA-GA was combined with LogitBoost, Bagging and AdaBoost ensemble algorithms. The performance of the developed methodology was evaluated at the Bao Yen district and the Bac Ha district of Lao Cai Province in the Northeast region of Vietnam. For the case study, 654 floods and twelve geo-environmental variables were used. The predictive performance of each model was estimated through the calculation of the classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity, the success and predictive rate curve and the area under the curves (AUC). The FURIA-GA FSM compared to a conventional rule based method gave more accurate predictive results. Also, the FURIA-GA based models, presented higher learning and predictive ability compared to the ensemble models that had not undergone a FSM. Based on the predictive classification accuracy, FURIA-GA-Bagging (93.37%) outperformed FURIA-GA-LogitBoost (92.35%) and FURIA-GA-AdaBoost (89.03%). FURIA-GA-Bagging showed also the highest sensitivity (96.94%) and specificity (89.80%). On the other hand, the FURIA-GA-LogitBoost showed the lowest percentage in very high susceptible zone and the highest relative flash-flood density, whereas the FURIA-GA-AdaBoost achieved the highest prediction AUC value (0.9740), based on the prediction rate curve, followed by FIJRIA-GABagging (0.9566), and FURIA-GA-LogitBoost (0.8955). It can be concluded that the usage of different statistical metrics, provides different outcomes concerning the best prediction model, which mainly could be attributed to sites specific settings. The proposed models could be considered as a novel alternative investigation tools appropriate for flash flood susceptibility mapping. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Metal solubility and transport at a contaminated landfill site - From the source zone into the groundwater	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Soil and groundwater metal pollution; Glass waste; Soil:Solution partitioning (Kd); Leachability; Mobility; Colloids	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; BATCH LEACHING TESTS; HEAVY-METALS; DISTRIBUTION COEFFICIENTS; PARTITION-COEFFICIENTS; CALCAREOUS SOILS; SANDY SOIL; E-WASTE; LEAD; LEACHATE	Risks associated with metal contaminated sites are tightly linked to material leachability and contaminant mobility. In this study, metal solubility and transport were characterized within a glass waste landfill through i) lysimeter-collection of pore water and standardized batch leaching tests, ii) soil profiles extending from the landfill surface, through unsaturated soil underneath, and into the groundwater zone, and iii) groundwater samples upstream, at, and downstream of the landfill. The soil analyzes targeted both pseudo-total and geochemically active concentrations of contaminant metals (As, Cd, Pb, Sb) and basic soil geochemistry (pH, org. C, Fe, Mn). Water samples were analyzed for dissolved, colloid-bound and particulate metals, and speciation modelling of the aqueous phase was conducted. The results revealed a highly contaminated system, with mean metal concentrations in the waste zone between 90 and 250 times the regional background levels. Despite severe contamination of the waste zone and high geochemically active fractions (80-100%) of all contaminant metals as well as elevated concentrations in landfill pore water, the concentrations of Cd and Pb decrease abruptly at the transition between landfill and underlying natural soil and no indication of groundwater contamination was found. The efficient cation retention is likely due to the high pH. However, the sorption of As and Sb is weaker at such high pH, which explains their higher mobility from the pore water zone into groundwater. The field soil:solution partitioning (Kd) displayed a high spatial variability within the waste zone (the highest Kd variability was seen for Pb, ranging from 140 to 2,900,000 1 kg(-1)), despite little variability in basic geochemical variables, which we suggest is due to waste material heterogeneity.

Molecular indices, calculated based on the relative abundance of 4699 formulas assigned from FT-ICR MS data, showed depth stratification. The degradation index (I-DEG) varied from 0.610 to 0.663 (0.645 +/- 0.014) in the surface layer to 0.668-0.754 (0.722 +/- 0.021) in the deep ocean (below 500 m), indicating that the DOM in the deep layer was more refractory than that of the surface layer. This was confirmed by an increase of modified aromaticity index (AI(mod)) from 0.196 to 0.207 (0.200 +/- 0.003) in the surface layer to 0213-0.225 (0.220 +/- 0.003) at depth. Multivariate analysis based on both bulk molecular parameters and relative abundance of individual formulas showed that the molecular composition of DOM was highly stratified and could be well separated into three groups: the upper layer (5-75 m), the middle layer (200 m) and the deep layer (500-2000 m). In addition, surface-enriched and deep-enriched formulas were identified based on Spearman correlation between relative abundance of individual formulas and depth. The surface-enriched formulas were characterized by higher H/C and lower AI(mod), while deep-enriched formulas showed lower H/C and higher AI(med). Variations in AI(mod) and H/C for these formulas indicated that extracellular release (mainly from primary production) and photochemical processes strongly affected the DOM composition in euphotic zone, while microbial processes likely exerted a tremendous influence on the DOM composition at all depths. Moreover, strong correlations between spectroscopic indices (a(325). S-275(-)295 and S-280(-)400) and FT- ICR MS derived proxies indicated these two approaches can be integrated to provide valuable information on the molecular characterization of open ocean DOM.

We performed a metanalysis integrating all available studies that evaluated TL shifts in fishes between trawled and untrawled environments and conducted a local study comparing several features of the trophic ecology in two species of fishes. According to the metanalysis, TL does not change significantly with trawling. In contrast, the local study showed higher TLs and broader isotopic niches in the trawled environment. Diet reconstruction indicated a potential consumption of hake, the main discard component, at the trawled environment. All the studies used in the metanalysis were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the local study represents the first data available from the Southern Hemisphere. As industrial commercial fisheries in Argentina are relatively recent, it is possible that our data are capturing the initial stage of ecological changes induced by trawling, compared with the historical fisheries located at the Northern Hemisphere.

This study aimed to automatically map the occurrence of riparian bugweed (Solanum mauritianum) using airborne AISA Eagle hyperspectral data (393 nm-994 nm) in conjunction with LiDAR derived height. Utilising an unsupervised random forest (RF) classification approach and Anselin local Moran's I clustering, results indicate that the integration of LiDAR with minimum noise fraction (MNF) produce the best detection rate (DR) of 88%, the lowest false positive rate (FPR) of 7.14% and an overall mapping accuracy of 83% for riparian bugweed. In comparison, utilising the original hyperspectral wavebands with and without LiDAR produced lower DRs and higher FPRs with overall accuracies of 79% and 68% respectively. This research demonstrates the potential of combining spectral information with LiDAR to accurately map IAPs using an automated unsupervised RF anomaly detection framework.

We use a landscape genomics approach at sites sampled throughout the range of this system in Kenya to investigate the demographics and genetic structure of the different partners in the association. We find that different species of ant associates of V. drepanolobium show striking differences in their spatial distribution throughout Kenya, and these differences are only partly correlated with abiotic factors. A comparison of the population structure of the host plant and its three obligately arboreal ant symbionts, Crematogaster mimosae, Crematogaster nigriceps, and Tetraponera penzigi, shows that the ants exhibit somewhat similar patterns of structure throughout each of their respective ranges, but that this does not correlate in any clear way with the respective genetic structure of the populations of their host plants. A lack of evidence for local coadaptation in this system suggests that all partners have evolved to cope with a wide variety of biotic and abiotic conditions.

However, sequestration can also be costly, impacting immunological responses important for other types of natural enemies, such as parasites and pathogens. These costs could also vary across herbivorous insect development, as both immune function and sequestration abilities change, although few studies have assessed variation in the cost of sequestration across life stages. The buckeye, Junonia coenia (Nymphalidae), is a specialist butterfly that sequesters iridoid glycosides from its host plants, including the introduced weed, Plantago lanceolate (Plantaginaceae). To determine the immunological costs of sequestration and how the immune response varies with host plant and across development, we reared caterpillars on a native host plant, Mimulus guttatus (Phrymaceae), which does not contain iridoid glycosides, and on P. lanceolata, which does. We assayed immune function across 3rd, 4th, and 5th instar caterpillars, estimating both hemocyte density and the ability of hemocytes to encapsulate foreign bodies by challenging the immune system with nylon filaments. For caterpillars reared on P. lanceolate, we then explored the relationships between iridoid glycoside sequestration and immune function across instars. We found that while hemocyte density tended to increase with instar regardless of host plant, caterpillars reared on P. lanceolate had lower encapsulation ability, and encapsulation decreased with increasing sequestration of iridoid glycosides, though patterns varied between instars and experimental periods. Interestingly, immune challenged caterpillars sequestered more iridoid glycosides than unchallenged caterpillars, suggesting that caterpillars responded to immune challenge by sequestering or retaining more iridoids, even though that may decrease their ability to encapsulate. These results suggest that sequestration can have important consequences for immune function across caterpillar development, and that the incorporation of novel hosts may affect defense against natural enemies.

Landscape Structure and Species Interactions Drive the Distribution of Salmon Carcasses in Coastal Watersheds	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						cross-ecosystem; fisheries; landscape ecology; nutrient subsidies; pacific salmon	ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH CARCASSES; BEARS URSUS-ARCTOS; EGG BURIAL DEPTHS; PACIFIC SALMON; HABITAT FEATURES; RIPARIAN FORESTS; SPAWNING SALMON; FRESH-WATER; NUTRIENTS; STREAM	The disproportionate effects of some species can drive ecosystem processes and shape communities. This study investigates how distributions of spawning Pacific salmon within streams, salmon consumers, and the surrounding landscape mediate the distribution of salmon carcasses to riparian forests and estuaries. This work demonstrates how carcass transfer can vary spatially, within and among watersheds, through differences in pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon distributions within 16 streams on the central coast of British Columbia over a five-year period. Spawning pink salmon concentrated in the lower reaches of all streams, whereas chum salmon shifted from lower to upper stream reaches as the area of spawning habitat increased. Salmon carcasses transferred to riparian areas by gray wolves (Canis lupus) were concentrated in estuaries and lower stream reaches, particularly shallow reaches of larger streams surrounded by large meadow expanses. Black and grizzly bears (Ursus americanus and U. arctos) transferred higher numbers and proportions of salmon carcasses to riparian areas compared to wolves, transferred more carcasses in areas of higher spawning density, and tended to focus more on chum salmon. Riparian subsides were increasingly driven by bear-chum salmon associations in upper stream reaches. In addition, lower proportions of salmon carcasses were exported into estuaries when densities of spawning salmon were lower and spawning reaches of streams were longer. This study demonstrates how salmon subsidies vary between and within watersheds as a result of species associations and landscape traits, and provides a nuanced species-specific and spatially explicit understanding of salmon-subsidy dynamics.

However, we know little about their relationships with plants at large scales. Here, using soil fungal data collected from 28 forest reserves across China, we explored the latitudinal diversity gradients of overall fungi and different fungal functional guilds, including putative plant pathogens, EMF, and saprotrophic fungi. We further linked the spatial patterns of alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF to the variation of plant species richness. We found that the relationships between latitude and alpha diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were region-dependent with sharp diversity shifts around the mid-latitude (similar to 35 degrees N), which differed from the unimodal diversity distributions of the overall and saprotrophic fungi. The variations in the diversities of putative plant pathogens and EMF were largely explained by the spatial regions (south vs. north/subtropical zone vs. temperate zone). Additionally, the alpha diversities of these two fungal guilds exhibited opposing trends across latitude. EMF could alter the relationship between diversities of putative plant pathogens and plants in the south/subtropical region, but not vice versa. We also found that the ratio of their alpha diversities (EMF to putative plant pathogens) was negatively related to plant species richness across the spatial regions (north to south), and explained similar to 10% of the variation of plant species richness. Overall, our findings suggest that plant-microbe interactions not only shape the local plant diversity but also may have non-negligible contributions to the large-scale patterns of plant diversity in forest ecosystems.

Functional Traits of Fish Species: Adjusting Resolution to Accurately Express Resource Partitioning	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						resolution; functional diversity; diet analysis; trophic guild; similarity	DIETARY-MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS; RESPONSE DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; TROPHIC ECOLOGY; ASSEMBLAGES; PLASTICITY; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	One of the core challenges of functional diversity is the identification of traits that can accurately be linked to ecological processes. Trait-based metrics have been used to detect and quantify the effects of deterministic processes, such as niche filtering and co-occurrence mechanisms. However, most functional studies have simplified the measured attributes, especially for fish species. Here, we aimed to test the influence of trait resolution and surrogates on the accuracy in expressing resource partitioning among tropical fish species. We assessed pairwise species similarity between distinct ways of express resource use by species (through increasing trait resolution), and tested whether differences in resolutions are strong enough to provide different patterns in the functional structure of tropical fish assemblages. Our study shows that distinct ways of expressing resource partitioning among species may provide different ecological interpretations of this process as different resolutions or surrogates can change pairwise species, similarity.

Still, the joint impact of space and time have remained relatively unstudied in most marginal regions. In order to examine the influence of climate variability on mussel distribution patterns, we monitored three sublittoral and marginal blue mussel (Mytilus trossulus) populations, spaced along a salinity gradient. Densities and biomasses peaked toward the saltier parts of the study area and showed relatively larger variations toward the low saline edge. Temporally, the areas showed a consistent increase in abundance after a synchronized large-scale recruitment event, which was followed by a decline in population size, occurring much faster toward the very range edge. Salinity, temperature, winter severity, and wave exposure explained most of the spatiotemporal variation in mussel abundances and adults showed positive effects on recruit abundance. We show empirically that the dynamics of edge populations are not driven by large changes in climate variables but that small spatial and temporal changes in key environmental variables have large and non-linear population level effects. Our results also show that fluctuating recruitment is a key factor for population stability affecting the storage potential of marginal populations, which dramatically decrease toward the edge. Our study provides a window into future population patterns and processes that drive marginal mussel populations in an altered sea characterized by rising temperature and declining salinity.

To date, the potential environmental consequences of mining operations in the remote deep sea are poorly known. Experimental studies are scarce, especially with regard to the effect of sediment and nodule debris depositions as a consequence of seabed mining. To elucidate the potential effects of the deposition of crushed polymetallic nodule particles on abyssal meiobenthos communities, a short (11 d) in situ experiment at the seafloor of the Peru Basin in the south-east Pacific Ocean was conducted in 2015. We covered abyssal, soft sediment with approx. 2 cm of crushed nodule particles and sampled the sediment after 11 d of incubation at 4200m water depth. Short-term ecological effects on the meiobenthos community were studied including changes in their composition and vertical distribution in the sediment as well as nematode genus composition. Additionally, copper burden in a few similar-sized but randomly selected nematodes was measured by means of micro X-ray fluorescence (mu XRF). At the end of the experiment, 46 +/- 1% of the total meiobenthos occurred in the added crushed nodule layer, while abundances decreased in the underlying 2 cm compared to the same depth interval in undisturbed sediments. Densities and community composition in the deeper 2-5 cm layers remained similar in covered and uncovered sediments. The migratory response into the added nodule material was particularly seen in polychaetes (73 +/- 14 %, relative abundance across all depth layers) copepods (71 +/- 6 %), nauplii (61 +/- 9 %) and nematodes (43 +/- 1 %). While the dominant nematode genera in the added nodule material did not differ from those in underlying layers or the undisturbed sediments, feeding type proportions in this layer were altered, with a 9% decrease of non-selective deposit feeders and an 8% increase in epistrate feeders. Nematode tissue copper burden did not show elevated copper toxicity resulting from burial with crushed nodule particles. Our results indicate that burial with a 2 cm layer of crushed nodule particles induces changes in the vertical structure of meiobenthos inside the sediment and an alteration of nematode feeding type proportions within a short time frame of 11 d, while nematode tissue copper burden remains unchanged. These findings considerably contribute to the understanding of the short-term responses of meiobenthos to physical disturbances in the deep sea.

Wild harvesting of seaweeds, particularly of those that are ecosystem engineers, must be demonstrably sustainable: here we address the topic of resource sustainability in the context of harvesting Corallina officinalis in Ireland for bioceramics. C. officinalis provides habitat for a diverse macrofaunal community and the effects of harvesting C. officinalis on the associated fauna must be included in any assessment of harvesting sustainability. Corallina intertidal turfs subject to experimental harvesting were confirmed, using DNA barcoding with cox1, to comprise only C. officinalis and not the pseudocryptic species C. caespitosa, despite the wide range of morphologies, and they had high genetic diversity. Harvesting of C. officinalis was carried out at experimental sites by two techniques (hand cutting and pulling) to test the recovery of the primary resource and the associated macroinvertebrate assemblage. Harvesting the alga by both methods encouraged regrowth: cut and pulled plots had a much higher growth rate than unharvested turfs, regaining their original length within 4-6 months of harvesting, suggesting that turfs of this species may grow to a predetermined length. The structure, richness and evenness of the invertebrate assemblage were not significantly affected by harvesting C. officinalis by cutting or pulling, though some organisms within the community showed a response to harvesting. The pattern of recovery of the sediment, an important component of the C. officinalis habitat, was consistent with the shorter (harvested) turf trapping more sediment than longer natural turfs. As many of the organisms associated with the habitat use the sediment for food or building materials, this may have ameliorated the effects of harvesting on the community. A period of a year between harvests is recommended to allow the C. officinalis biomass to return to baseline levels and unharvested fallow areas should be included in a harvesting plan to allow macroinvertebrates to re-colonize the harvested turf.

Dynamics and persistence of rabies in the Arctic	POLAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Vulpes lagopus; epidemiological model; Arctic rabies; virus transmission; public health; climate change	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; CANINE-DISTEMPER; FOX POPULATION; ALOPEX-LAGOPUS; RED FOX; VIRUS; VULPES; MODEL; PREY; TRANSMISSION	Rabies is a major issue for human and animal health in the Arctic, yet little is known about its epidemiology. In particular, there is an ongoing debate regarding how Arctic rabies persists in its primary reservoir host, the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), which exists in the ecosystem at very low population densities. To shed light on the mechanisms of rabies persistence in the Arctic, we built a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model of rabies virus transmission in an Arctic fox population interacting with red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), a rabies host that is increasingly present in the Arctic. The model suggests that rabies cannot be maintained in resource-poor areas of the Arctic, characterized by low Arctic fox density, even in the presence of continuous reintroduction of the virus by infected Arctic foxes from neighbouring regions. However, in populations of relatively high Arctic fox density, rabies persists under conditions of higher transmission rate, prolonged infectious period and for a broad range of incubation periods. Introducing the strong cyclical dynamics of Arctic prey availability makes simulated rabies outbreaks less regular but more intense, with an onset that does not neatly track peaks in Arctic fox density. Finally, interaction between Arctic and red foxes increases the frequency and/or the intensity of rabies outbreaks in the Arctic fox population. Our work suggests that disruption of prey cycles and increasing interactions between Arctic and red foxes due to climate change and northern development may significantly change the epidemiology of rabies across the Arctic.

In addition, sponges host dense and diverse prokaryotic communities, which are potential sources of novel bioactive metabolites and other complex compounds. Those sponge-derived natural products can span a broad spectrum of bioactivities, from antibacterial and antifungal to antitumor and antiviral compounds. However, most analyses concerning sponge-associated prokaryotes have mainly focused on conveniently accessible relatively shallow sampling locations for sponges. Hence, knowledge of community composition, host-relatedness and biotechnological potential of prokaryotic associations in temperate and cold-water sponges from greater depths (mesophotic to mesopelagic zones) is still scarce. Therefore, we analyzed the prokaryotic community diversity of four phylogenetically divergent sponge taxa from mesophotic to mesopelagic depths of Antarctic shelf at different depths and locations in the region of the South Shetland Islands using 16S rRNA gene amplicon-based sequencing. In addition, we predicted functional profiles applying Tax4Fun from metagenomic 16S rRNA gene data to estimate their biotechnological capability and possible roles as sources of novel bioactive compounds. We found indications that cold and deep-water sponges exhibit host-specific prokaryotic communities, despite different sampling sites and depths. Functional prediction analysis suggests that the associated prokaryotes may enhance the roles of sponges in biodegradation processes of xenobiotics and their involvement in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.

Little to no inbreeding depression in a tapeworm with mixed mating	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						cestode; inbreeding; inbreeding depression; odds ratio; Oochoristica javaensis; selfing rate	SELF-FERTILIZATION; SIMULTANEOUS HERMAPHRODITE; OOCHORISTICA-JAVAENSIS; SELECTIVE INTERFERENCE; PARASITE TRANSMISSION; FITNESS CONSEQUENCES; SYSTEM EVOLUTION; LIFE-CYCLE; POPULATION; CYCLOPHYLLIDEA	Meta-studies on hermaphrodites have found a negative relationship between primary selfing rates and levels of inbreeding depression (ID) and, thus, generally support purging in inbred systems. However, in plants, high among-taxa variance in ID results in no difference in the mean ID between outcrossing and mixed-mating taxa. Selective interference likely explains high ID among mixed-mating taxa, whereas low levels of ID among mixed-mating taxa are not as stressed. Among animal hermaphrodites, primarily molluscs, there are little data on mixed-mating systems. To fill a taxonomic and mating system gap, we tested for ID in a mixed-mating tapeworm, Oochoristica javaensis. We provide a direct estimate of ID across infection of an intermediate host by comparing selfing rates at two life history stages. We found little to no evidence for ID, and the level of ID falls in line with what is reported for highly selfing species even though O. javaensis has mixed mating. We discuss this result within the context of kin mating in O. javaensis. Our results emphasize that primary selfing rates alone may be insufficient to classify the inbreeding history in all species when testing for a relationship to ID. Mixed-mating taxa, and possibly some outcrossing taxa, may exhibit low levels of ID if biparental inbreeding is also driving purging. We advocate that ID studies report estimates of inbreeding history (e.g. F-IS or identity disequilibrium) from nature-derived adult samples to provide context rather than relying on primary selfing rates alone.

Studying the manner in which animals are distributed in their natural environment relative to conspecifics and other species provides basic information about behavioural aspects, including social tendencies, aggressiveness, nesting and mating system, among others. The invasive shrimp Palaemon macrodactylus has shown aggressive behaviour in laboratory conditions, whereas in natural conditions it seems to live aggregated, sharing patchy habitats with other species such as the small goby fish Gobiosoma parri. In this study we investigated the abundance, density, group structure (i.e. size, sex, reproductive condition), and the possible coexistence of P. macrodactylus with G. parri in the fouling community of Mar del Plata harbour (Argentina), where this shrimp has invaded and established a stable population since 2000. Samples taken included all individuals present in each fouling patch. The results show that P. macrodactylus, inhabiting in the fouling community, are in groups of up to 20 individuals, without sex or size structure and that a positive correlation exists with the goby fish. This suggests a gregarious behaviour, and tolerance to other species using the same area, at least in an environment with high availability of refuges, traits that may be crucial for a successful invader. The persistence of such behaviour in different contexts and the effect of refuge should be investigated in order to fully understand and make predictions of new invasions.

Rescue interacts with trophic structure because physical stress experienced by a focal assemblage within the community may also be experienced by its predators and prey. In general, trophic structure will facilitate rescue only when a stress has a less severe effect on a focal assemblage than on its predators. In other circumstances, when stress affects prey or has only a weak effect on predators, trophic structure is likely to hamper rescue. We exposed a community of phytoplankton and zooplankton derived from a natural lake to acidification in outdoor mesocosms large enough to support trophically complex communities. Rescue of the phytoplankton from severe acidification was facilitated by prior exposure to sublethal stress, confirming previous results from microcosm experiments. Even communities that have previously been less highly stressed were eventually rescued, however, because their zooplankton predators were more sensitive to acidification and became extinct. Our experiment shows how community rescue following severe stress is modulated by the differential effect of the stress relative to trophic level.

Tool use and social homophily among male bottlenose dolphins	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						bottlenose dolphins; tool use; alliance formation; activity budget; social networks; homophily	SEX-DIFFERENCES; TURSIOPS SP.; GROUP-SIZE; ASSOCIATION; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; SUCCESS; TESTS	Homophilous behaviour plays a central role in the formation of human friendships. Individuals form social ties with others that show similar phenotypic traits, independently of relatedness. Evidence of such homophile can be found in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay, Western Australia, where females that use marine sponges as foraging took often associate with other females that use sponges. 'Sponging' is a socially learned, time-consuming behaviour, transmitted from mother to calf. Previous research illustrated a strong female bias in adopting this technique. The lower propensity for males to engage in sponging may be due to its incompatibility with adult male-specific behaviour, particularly the formation of multi-level alliances. However, the link between sponging and male behaviour has never been formally tested. Here, we show that male spongers associated significantly more often with other male spongers irrespective of their level of relatedness. Male spongers spent significantly more time foraging, and less time resting and travelling, than did male non-spongers. Interestingly, we found no difference in time spent socializing. Our study provides novel insights into the relationship between tool use and activity budgets of male dolphins, and indicates social homophily in the second-order alliance composition of tool-using bottlenose dolphins.

While some species may have the capacity to adapt to predicted average future global change conditions, the ability to survive extreme events is largely unknown. We used single-generation selection experiments on hundreds of thousands of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea urchin larvae generated from wild-caught adults to identify adaptive genetic variation responsive to moderate (pH 8.0) and extreme (pH 7.5) low-pH conditions. Sequencing genomic DNA from pools of larvae, we identified consistent changes in allele frequencies across replicate cultures for each pH condition and observed increased linkage disequilibrium around selected loci, revealing selection on recombined standing genetic variation. We found that loci responding uniquely to either selection regime were at low starting allele frequencies while variants that responded to both pH conditions (11.6% of selected variants) started at high frequencies. Loci under selection performed functions related to energetics, pH tolerance, cell growth and actin/cytoskeleton dynamics. These results highlight that persistence in future conditions will require two classes of genetic variation: common, pH-responsive variants maintained by balancing selection in a heterogeneous environment, and rare variants, particularly for extreme conditions, that must be maintained by large population sizes.

In the case of haemosporidian blood parasites, epidemic wild bird mortalities on oceanic islands have been linked to Plasmodium spp., but not genera like Haemoproteus. Indeed, Haemoproteus is absent from many oceanic islands. By contrast, birds on continental islands share long coevolutionary histories with both Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, and are thus ideal model systems to elucidate eco-evolutionary endpoints associated with these parasites in oceanic islands. Here, we examine eco-evolutionary dynamics of avian haemosporidian in the Shola sky-island archipelago of the Western Ghats, India. Our analyses reveal that compared to Plasmodium, Haemoproteus lineages were highly host-specific and diversified via co-speciation with their hosts. We show that community structure of host-generalist Plasmodium was primarily driven by geographical factors (e.g. biogeographic barriers), while that of host-specialist Haemoproteus was driven by host species barriers (e.g. phylogenetic distance). Consequently, a few host species can harbour a high diversity of Plasmodium lineages which, in turn, are capable of infecting multiple host species. These two mechanisms can act in concert to increase the risk of introduction, establishment, and emergence of novel Plasmodium lineages in island systems.

Leaf hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) can be regulated by vein architecture in conjunction with the water channel protein aquaporin. However, our understanding of how leaf veins and aquaporins affect leaf hydraulics and stomata' conductance (g(s)) remains poor. By inducing blockage of the major veins and inhibition of aquaporin activity using HgCl2 we examined the effects of major veins and aquaporins on K-leaf and g(s) in species with different venation types. A vine species, with thick first-order veins and Flow vein density, displayed a rapidly declined g(s) with high leaf water potential n response to vein blockage and a greatly reduced K-l(eaf) and g(s) in response to aquaporin inhibition, suggesting that leaf aquaporins are involved in isohydric/anisohydric stomatal behaviour. Across species, the decline in K-leaf and g(s) due to aquaporin inhibition increased linearly with decreasing major vein density, possibly indicating that a trade-off function between vein architect ure (apoplastic pathway) and aquaporin activity (cell-to-cell pathway) affects leaf hydraulics.

Symbolic representation of numerosity by honeybees (Apis mellifera): matching characters to small quantities	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Apis mellifera; delayed-matching-to-sample; number; numerical; Piaget's theory; sign	CHIMPANZEE PAN-TROGLODYTES; NUMERICAL COMPETENCE; NUMBER; PARROT; DISCRIMINATION; ENUMERATION; ABILITIES; CAPACITY; COUNT; ZERO	The assignment of a symbolic representation to a specific numerosity is a fundamental requirement for humans solving complex mathematical calculations used in diverse applications such as algebra, accounting, physics and everyday commerce. Here we show that honeybees are able to learn to match a sign to a numerosity, or a numerosity to a sign, and subsequently transfer this knowledge to novel numerosity stimuli changed in colour properties, shape and configuration. While honeybees learned the associations between two quantities (two; three) and two signs (N-shape; inverted T-shape), they failed at reversing their specific task of sign-tonumerosity matching to numerosity-to-sign matching and vice versa (i.e. a honeybee that learned to match a sign to a number of elements was not able to invert this learning to match the numerosity of elements to a sign). Thus, while bees could learn the association between a symbol and numerosity, it was linked to the specific task and bees could not spontaneously extrapolate the association to a novel, reversed task. Our study therefore reveals that the basic requirement for numerical symbolic representation can be fulfilled by an insect brain, suggesting that the absence of its spontaneous emergence in animals is not due to cognitive limitation.

Pairing with a high-quality partner elicits positive affective states which, in turn, validate and reinforce the mate choice. Affective states thus strongly affect pair stability and future reproductive success. We propose generalizing the link between affective states and pair-bonding to encompass other monogamous species exhibiting biparental care, chiefly where the reproductive success of the pair critically depends on the coordination between partners. The convict cichlid Amatitlania siquia is a monogamous fish species that forms long-lasting pairs with strong cooperation between parents for parental care. In this species, we showed that females paired with their non-preferred male had lower reproductive success than those paired with their preferred male. We then transposed the judgement bias paradigm, previously used in other animal species, to assess objectively affective states in fishes. Females that were assigned their non-preferred partner exhibited pessimistic bias, which indicates a negative affective state. By contrast, females that were assigned their preferred partner did not exhibit changes in their affective state. Our results highlight that the influence of pair-bonding on affective states is not human-specific and can also be observed in non-human species.

We manipulated the opportunity for sexual selection in populations of Ae. aegypti by controlling the number of males competing for a single female. Populations exposed to higher levels of male competition rapidly evolved higher male competitive mating success relative to populations evolved in the absence of competition, with an evolutionary response visible atter only five generations. We also detected correlated evolution in other important mating and life-history traits, such as acoustic signalling, fecundity and body size. Our results indicate that there is ample segregating variation for determinants of male mating competitiveness in wild populations and that increased male mating success trades-off with other important life-history traits. The mating conditions imposed on laboratory-reared mosquitoes are likely a significant determinant of male mating success in populations destined for release.

However, transmission chain experiments in human and non-human primates suggest that cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) might not necessarily depend on high-fidelity copying after all. In this study, we test whether defining properties of CCE can emerge in a non-copying task. We performed transmission chain experiments in Guinea baboons and human children where individuals observed and produced visual patterns composed of four squares on touchscreen devices. In order to be rewarded, participants ad to avoid touching squares that were touched by a previous participant. In other words, they were rewarded for innovation rather than copying. Results nevertheless exhibited fundamental properties of CCE: an increase over generations in task performance and the emergence of systematic structure. However, these properties arose from different mechanisms across s pecies: children, unlike baboons, converged in behaviour over generations by copying specific patterns in a different location, thus introducing alternative copying mechanisms into the non-copying task. In children, prior biases towards specific shapes led to convergence in behaviour across chains, while baboon chains showed signs of lineage specificity. We conclude that CCE can result from mechanisms with varying degrees of fidelity in transmission and thus that high-fidelity copying is not necessarily the key to CCE.

While these biological alterations have been widely documented, studies identifying specific mechanisms linking climate change to population declines are scarce. Extreme events, such as heatwaves can have devastating effects on living organisms and are increasing in frequency as Earth warms. Hence, understanding the effects of heatwaves on insects is necessary to inform conservation efforts and to develop predictions of population dynamics under future climate scenarios. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of heatwaves on the survival and phenology of the Baltimore Checkerspot (Euphydryas phaeton phaeton), a wetland butterfly with imperiled populations that has incorporated a novel host. We performed laboratory manipulations (implementing realistic temperature regimes) to assess the effect of heatwaves during summer and winter on the survival and phenology of E. p. phaeton. In addition, we analyzed historical temperature records to quantify the incidence of heatwaves within E. p. phaeton's range to assess their potential role in the decline of southeastern populations. We found that winter heatwaves with maximum temperatures of 20 degrees C can have more devastating effects on survival than summer heatwaves (up to 41 degrees C). Eggs endured acute heat stress during summer with no significant effects on phenology and survival; similarly, pre-overwintering larvae were robust to heatwave exposure, as only the most intense heatwave treatment reduced their survival (37% reduction compared to control conditions). By contrast, dormant larvae were the most vulnerable stage, as they lost from 2 to 6% of their body mass after a three-day summer heatwave. Furthermore, their exposure to winter heatwaves resulted in 75 to 100% mortality. Feeding on the native host provided higher resilience under thermal stress than feeding on the invasive, recently acquired host. Finally, both heatwave incidence and severity have increased in the southern range of E. p. phaeton in the period from 1894 to 2011. We show that warm winter days induced severe mortality, providing a mechanistic explanation of how climate change can trigger population declines in E. p. phaeton and other insects.

However, it suffers from low activity towards immature stages of the worm, and its prolonged use induces resistance/tolerance. During the last 40 years, 263 PZQ analogues have been synthesized and tested against Schistosoma spp. worms, but less than 10% of them showed significant activity. Here, we propose a rationalization of the chemical space of the PZQ derivatives by a ligand-based approach. First, we constructed an in-house database with all PZQ derivatives available in the literature. This analysis shows a high heterogeneity in the data. Fortunately, all studies include PZQ as a reference, permitting the classification of compounds into three classes according to their activities. Models involving ligand-based pharmacophore and logistic regression were performed. Five physicochemical parameters were identified as the best to explain the biological activity. In the end, we proposed new PZQ derivatives with modifications at positions 1 and 7, we analysed them with our models, and we observed that they can be more active than the previously synthesized derivatives. The main goal of this work was to conduct the most valuable meta-pharmacometrics/pharmacoinformatics analysis with all Praziquantel medicinal chemistry data available in the literature.

Several different Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have been tested for predicting the energy consumption/production based on the information of hydro-meteorological data. The methods analysed include Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and various Quantile Regression (QR) models like Quantile Random Forest (QRF) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). Additionally, a Nonhomogeneous Gaussian Regression (NGR) approach has been tested for combining and calibrating monthly ML based forecasts driven by ensemble weather forecasts. The novelty and main focus of this study is the comparison of the capability of ML methods for producing reliable predictive uncertainties and the application of monthly weather forecasts. Different skill scores have been used to verify the predictions and their uncertainties and first results for combining the ML methods applying the NGR approach and coupling the predictions with monthly ensemble weather forecasts are shown for the southern Switzerland (Canton of Ticino). These results highlight the possibilities of improvements using ML methods and the importance of optimally combining different ML methods for achieving more accurate estimates of future energy consumptions and productions with sharper prediction uncertainty estimates (i.e., narrower prediction intervals).

However, the ability of urban cemeteries to support these birds on current landscapes is largely unknown. We surveyed cavity-nesting birds and their habitat in 18 cemeteries in Chicago, Illinois (USA). At each location, we examined vegetation, availability of gravestones and monuments for perches, and landscape-level environmental conditions. We tested the importance of these variables for presence of individual bird species, and for overall richness of native cavity-nesting birds. We also assessed the availability and characteristics of tree cavities and their distribution among different tree species. We found that most cemeteries contained at least one dead or dying tree. Across all sampled areas, we detected 207 naturally-occurring and 77 excavated tree cavities. Tree species generally supported cavities in proportion to their abundance. We observed 12 native and two non-native cavity-nesting bird species in the cemeteries. Cavity-nesting bird species richness was best explained by landscape-level variables such as canopy cover and distance to water, but local-level variables (e.g., number of graves in a 50 m radius) influenced habitat selection for some species. Based on our results, we make suggestions for how both existing cemeteries and new green cemeteries can support biodiversity conservation.

There is, however, little empirical evidence on the effects of road access on income patterns. We contribute to existing literature by analyzing the effects of road access on income activity choice in Korup National Park, Cameroon using a difference-in-difference approach. Road access led to a rise in total household income by 38% due to higher household participation in self-employment and wage labor. We neither found an effect on income from crop farming nor on participation in hunting activities. The effects of road access can be diverse and unforeseeable. Road construction in protected areas should thus be carefully considered and planned and only be implemented when other options are not feasible.

The Global Solar Ultraviolet Index (UVI) was introduced as a tool to visualize the intensity of UV radiation on a certain day, which should enable and encourage people to take appropriate protective measures. The 'low' exposure category of the UVI, defined by a rounded UVI value of 0, 1 or 2, was linked to the health message 'No protection required' by the World Health Organization and partner organizations. However, published evidence corroborating this advice is not available. To evaluate the erythemal risk of low UVI days, we analyzed 14,431 daily time series of ambient erythemal irradiance data measured at nine stations of the German solar UV monitoring network during the years 2007-2016. We analyzed the proportion of days in the sample for which ambient erythemal doses calculated for various time intervals exceed average minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of the Fitzpatrick skin phototypes I-VI to assess the potential for erythema arising from sun exposure on days with low UVI values. Additionally, we calculated for each day the minimum exposure duration needed to receive one MED. Our results indicate that on days with a UVI value of 0, risk of erythema is indeed negligible. Conversely, the abovementioned health message appears misleading when melano-compromised individuals (skin type I and II) spend more than 1.5 hours outdoors on days with a UVI value of 2. Under rare circumstances of prolonged exposure, MEDs of the two most sensitive skin types can also be exceeded even on days with a UVI value of 1. Hence, current WHO guidance for sun protection on days with low UVI values needs reconsideration.

Evolution of Dissolved Organic Matter Along a Septic System Plume: Evidence of Sustained Biogeochemical Activity in the Groundwater Zone	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						dissolved organic matter; carbon cycling; groundwater quality	NATURAL ATTENUATION; CARBON; NITROGEN; WATER; BIODEGRADABILITY; DENITRIFICATION; TRANSFORMATION; FLUORESCENCE; DEGRADATION; REACTIVITY	Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important energy source for biogeochemical reactions. However, DOM is often assumed to be recalcitrant in the groundwater zone due to extensive microbial processing in the overlying soil zone and long groundwater residence times. Consequently, further heterotrophic microbial processes proceed at inherently low rates. Septic systems provide an ideal opportunity to study the evolution of groundwater DOM due to the development of confined and easily identifiable plumes of known age. Here we use measures of DOM composition (size-exclusion liquid chromatography, ultraviolet absorbance, and C:N) to quantify DOM evolution along an exceptionally well-characterized septic-impacted groundwater plume. Elevated concentrations (5 to 8 mg C/L) close to the tile bed decrease to values below 2 mg C/L with lower UV-absorbing components normalized to overall DOM concentration (specific ultraviolet absorbance) along the six-year-old plume flow path. The humic substance fraction (HSF) comprises the largest percentage of DOM and decreases in concentration along the septic plume. HSF properties also change with travel time becoming lower in molecular weight, specific ultraviolet absorbance, and C:N. Denitrification continues along the length of the plume concomitant with changes in DOM and HSF composition. Thus, HSF, typically considered recalcitrant in subsurface environments, is actively cycled by microorganisms on multiyear time frames in accordance with the recent paradigm shift for soil organic matter evolution. Lastly, measures of DOM composition indicate changes in DOM that are not evident from measures of concentration alone. Plain Language Summary On-site wastewater disposal in septic systems is a known source of groundwater pollution, including large amounts of organic matter. Dissolved organic matter (DOM), made up of thousands of different molecules, plays a number of important roles within the environment. For instance, DOM is an energy source for microbes. Generally, groundwater DOM can be difficult to use as an energy source as easily degradable components have been lost as slow groundwater transport leads to enhanced physical, chemical, and biological processing. However, recent studies find continuous reworking and recycling of DOM occurring on longer time scales. Septic plumes provide an ideal environment to study this as they provide a known source of easily degradable DOM that can be tracked. Our objective was to measure changes to the concentration and composition of DOM along an extensively studied septic-impacted plume. This allowed us to link DOM evolution with known groundwater ages and known processes. We found that as DOM degraded, most of the change over time came from the humic substance fraction. We were also able to calculate one of few rates for wastewater DOM in groundwater. Results from this study illustrate how DOM continues to change on long time scales in ways that are not observed by measuring only its concentration.	[Aukes, P. J. K.; Schiff, S. L.; Robertson, W.

To inform conservation, we need better understanding of ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling that regulate forest productivity and biomass accumulation. Here we report on patterns in nitrogen (N) cycling across a 100-year forest regrowth chronosequence in the Tanzanian Miombo woodlands. Soil and vegetation indicators showed that low ecosystem N availability for trees persisted across young to mature forests. Ammonium dominated soil mineral N pools from 0- to 15-cm depth. Laboratory-measured soil N mineralization rates across 3- to 40-year regrowth sites showed no significant trends and were lower than mature forest rates. Aboveground tree N pools increased at 6 to 7 kg Nha(-1)yr(-1), accounting for the majority of ecosystem N accumulation. Foliar delta N-15 <0 in an N-fixing canopy tree across all sites suggested that N fixation may contribute to ecosystem N cycle recovery. These results contrast N cycling in wetter tropical and Neotropical dry forests, where indicators of N scarcity diminish after several decades of regrowth. Our findings suggest that minimizing woody biomass removal, litter layer, and topsoil disturbance may be important to promote N cycle recovery and natural regeneration in Miombo woodlands. Higher rates of N mineralization in the wet season indicated a potential that climate change-altered rainfall leading to extended dry periods may lower N availability through soil moisture-dependent N mineralization pathways, particularly for mature forests. Plain Language Summary In dry tropical Miombo woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, forests have experienced high rates of clearing and degradation from growing demands for land and resources (e.g., charcoal, firewood). A lack of knowledge regarding controls on forest regrowth, such as nutrient cycling, has limited development of recommendations for managing regrowth as part of forest landscape restoration. This work studied patterns of ecosystem nitrogen (N) availability with regrowth, and how the sensitivity of N availability from an important soil decomposition process (N mineralization) varied between wet and dry seasons in the Tanzanian Miombo. Across 12 sites spanning a 100-year regrowth chronosequence, increases in ecosystem N stocks were dominated by aboveground vegetation (trees). Soil N mineralization of regrowth sites did not recoup rates of mature forests. Sources and processes whereby trees accumulated N were unclear from the data, but evidence suggested the importance of redistribution of N from soil to vegetation and a possible role for N fixation. We also found in lab measurements that N mineralization rates were 2 to 3 times higher in the wet than dry season. For management of regrowth and forest landscape restoration, results indicated the importance of maintaining aboveground biomass in regrowth forests for conserving ecosystem N resources.

At the vanguard of this growth is the boundary between the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in Brazil, driven primarily by expansion of soybean and corn croplands. Here we examine the impacts of cropland expansion on receiving lowland Amazon Basin headwater streams in terms of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition via ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Streams draining croplands had lower DOC concentrations and DOM molecular signatures enriched in N- and S-containing formula in comparison to forested streams. Cropland streams were also enriched in aliphatic, peptide-like, and highly unsaturated and phenolic (low O/C) compound categories in comparison to forest streams (enriched in polyphenolics, condensed aromatics, and highly unsaturated and phenolic [high O/C] compound categories) indicative of the shifting of sources from organic-rich surface soils and litter layers to autochthonous and more microbial biomass. Distinct molecular assemblages were strongly correlated with cropland and forest catchments, highlighting headwater streams as sentinels for detecting change. On investigation of unique molecular formulae present in only cropland sites, four cropland markers provided the ability to track agricultural impacts in the region. Overall, these patterns indicate reduced organic matter inputs in croplands and greater microbial degradation at these sites leading to declining DOC concentrations, and DOM of more microbial character in receiving streams that is more biolabile, with clear ramifications for downstream ecology and biogeochemical cycles.

The influence of abiotic incubation conditions on the winter mortality of wild salmonid embryos	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						Atlantic salmon; embryo survival; ice-covered streams; partial least squares regression; river ecology	ATLANTIC SALMON; PACIFIC SALMON; ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH; FINE SEDIMENT; EGG SIZE; SALAR L; TEMPERATURE; SURVIVAL; OXYGEN; HABITAT	Embryos of many valued salmonid species incubate in the hyporheic zone of boreal streams over winter. Influence of individual winter-related environmental variables on salmonid embryo success has been previously investigated. However, how multiple variables act together to influence embryo incubation remains poorly understood. Using a naturally spawning population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Miramichi River basin (New Brunswick, Canada), we related variation in the abiotic embryo incubation habitat in different streams (spatial) and over the course of two winters (temporal) to embryo mortality between fertilisation and hatch. Over two years (2013-2014 and 2014-2015), we introduced fertilised eggs to six simulated salmon redds in each of three riffles in each of five active spawning reaches (n(redds)=90) with a range of hyporheic conditions. Embryo mortality was quantified at an early sampling event (March; pre-freshet and during late embryonic development) and a late sampling event (May; post-freshet and post-hatch). We extracted 22 abiotic predictor variables for statistical analyses from continuous records of hyporheic environmental conditions, collected for the duration of the incubation period in each study reach. Through partial least squares regression analyses, 37.6% of the total variation in mortality was explained by the predictor variables. Each group of predictor variables explained similar proportions of variation (water temperature: 8.4%, water level: 7.4%, dissolved oxygen: 7.1%, ice conditions: 7.2%, and substrate characteristics: 7.5%), which suggests that mortality is influenced by multiple interacting abiotic conditions, rather than a single variable in isolation, and that the factors contributing to ideal salmonid incubation habitats are complex and interconnected. Our research highlights the value of a multi-faceted research perspective and provides a baseline from which future changes in threatened salmonid populations can be measured and compared in an effort to identify relevant species- or population-specific differences.

The effects of land use disturbance vary with trophic position in littoral cichlid fish communities from Lake Tanganyika	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						cichlids; nitrogen loading; sedimentation; stable isotopes; stomach contents	INCREASED SEDIMENT LOADS; STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; NITROGEN ISOTOPES; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; STREAM ECOSYSTEMS; DELTA-C-13 VALUES; CARBON ISOTOPES; PROTECTED AREAS; BETA-DIVERSITY	Impacts of anthropogenic disturbance are especially severe in freshwater ecosystems. In particular, land use disturbance can lead to increased levels of pollution, including elevated nutrient and sediment loads whose negative impacts range from the community to the individual level. However, few studies have investigated if these impacts are uniform across species represented by multiple trophic levels. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Lake Tanganyika cichlid fishes, which comprise hundreds of species representing a wide range of feeding strategies. Cichlids are at their most diverse within the near-shore environment; however, land use disturbance of this environment has led to decreasing diversity, particularly in herbivores. We therefore tested if there is a uniform effect of pollution across species and trophic groups within the hyper-diverse rocky shore cichlid fish community. We selected three sites with differing levels of human impact along the Tanzanian coastline and 10 cichlid species, comprising varying taxonomic and trophic groups, common to these sites. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope values for 528 samples were generated and analysed using generalised linear mixed models. We also estimated stomach contents including sediment proportions. Our study highlights that multiple sources of pollution are having differing effects across species within a diverse fish community. We found that nitrogen stable isotope values were significantly higher at the most disturbed (urbanised) site for benthic feeding species, whereas there was no difference in these isotopes between sites for the water column feeding trophic group. Stomach contents revealed that the elevated delta N-15 values were unlikely to have been caused by differences in diet between sites. However, at the most disturbed site, higher proportions of sediment were present in most herbivores, irrespective of foraging behaviour. It is likely that anthropogenic nitrogen loading is the cause of higher nitrogen stable isotope values since there was no evidence of species shifting trophic levels between sites. Results support our previous study showing herbivore species to be most affected by human disturbance and make the link to pollution much more explicit. As lower diversity of consumers can negatively affect ecosystem processes such as stability, alleviating environmental impact through sewage treatment and afforestation programmes should continue to be a global priority for the conservation of aquatic ecosystems, as well as human health.

In turn, this effect on epiphytic biofilm biomass and nutrient content has a potential effect on the macroinvertebrates that depend on epiphyton as a food source. We studied the effect of living macrophytes and their growth form on biofilm development in a semi-controlled replicated microcosm experiment. Conditions of a nutrient-poor water layer and nutrient-rich sediment were created to study the effects of nutrient exudation by living macrophytes. We compared biofilm quantity and quality on structurally simple (Vallisneria spiralis) versus complex (Egeria densa) living plants and artificial analogues. Subsequently, the biofilm that had developed on the plants was fed, in a laboratory growth experiment, to two species of macroinvertebrate grazers (the snail Haitia acuta and the mayfly nymph Cloeon dipterum). This enabled us to assess if and how the macrophyte-induced effects on the epiphyton can influence macroinvertebrate grazers. Living macrophytes were found to have a significant effect on epiphytic algal cover, which was mostly expressed by a lower cover on living macrophytes compared to their artificial analogues. Additionally, epiphyton cover on artificial macrophytes was found to be higher on complex structures compared to simple ones, yet this was not observed on living macrophytes. Plant specific traits, such as the release of allelopathic substances, competition for nutrients and DIC, and the amount of CaCO3 deposition on plant surfaces might explain these results. The density of epiphytic bacteria was found to be negatively correlated with biofilm Ca content from macrophytes in every treatment except living E.densa, which differed in leaf anatomy from the other plants by possessing polar leaves. Furthermore, biofilm on living macrophytes had lower C:N:P molar ratios compared to that on artificial plants, which is likely to be explained by nutrient exudation by the living plants. Although it was expected that a more nutritious biofilm would lead to increased grazer growth, this was observed only for H.acuta on E.densa. Because biofilm quantity was not a limiting factor, this lack of effect may be caused by compensatory feeding. It can be concluded that, depending on their traits, living macrophytes can have a positive effect on macroinvertebrate grazers by providing a large surface area for colonisation by epiphytic algae and bacteria, by improving biofilm stoichiometry and by stimulating bacterial growth.

Biological trends need to be assessed over long periods of time to better understand past and current community responses. The present study developed a methodological framework for meta-analyses to be conducted that account for the temporal and spatial autocorrelation of observational data. We provided the R code for processing this framework, which enables temporal trends to be tested through the analysis of long-term, spatially structured datasets. Taking both types of autocorrelation into account resulted in more conservative but arguably more reliable statistical outcomes. This meta-analysis framework was then applied to investigate long-term trends in environmental and fish-community time series in multiple stations in large French rivers over the past 4 decades. General significant upward and downward trends were highlighted in water temperature and flow discharge, respectively, over the study period. Concomitantly, the density of numerous species increased, resulting in large increases in both species richness (about + 50%) and total fish abundance (approximately four-fold), but with no significant trend in species evenness. Strong changes in species composition were observed during the study period, with an overall upward trend in the relative abundance of newcomers (i.e. species not sampled during the first years of the survey), while the trend in relative abundance of non-native species was non-significant. Moreover, the strongest signal underlying community changes was replacement of northern by southern species. This study showed major changes in fish density and community structure in large rivers over the past 40years and represents, to our knowledge, one of the first large-scale actual demonstrations (i.e. based on observations rather than predictions) of an overall poleward shift of freshwater fish communities in response to ongoing global changes.

The ability of wild animals to adapt to environmental changes has important consequences for their fitness, survival, and reproduction. Behavioural flexibility, an immediate adjustment of behaviour in response to environmental variability, may be particularly important for coping with anthropogenic change. The main aim of this study was to quantify the response of two wintering goose species (bean goose Anser fabalis and lesser white-fronted goose Anser erythropus) to poor habitat condition at population level by studying foraging behaviour. In addition, we tested whether behavioural plasticity could alter trophic niche. We characterised foraging behaviours and calculated daily home range (HR) of the geese using global positioning system tracking data. We calculated standard ellipse areas to quantify niche width using the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of individual geese. We linked behavioural plasticity with habitat quality using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) models. We also tested the correlation between standard ellipse areas and HR using ANCOVA model. We found significant differences in geese foraging behaviours between years in their daily foraging area, travel distance and speed, and turning angle. Specifically, the birds increased their foraging area to satisfy their daily energy intake requirement in response to poor habitat conditions. They flew more sinuously and travelled faster and longer distances on a daily basis. For the endangered lesser white-fronted goose, all behaviour variables were associated with habitat quality. For bean goose, only HR and turning angle were correlated with habitat quality. The birds, especially the lesser white-fronted goose, may have had a higher trophic position under poor conditions. Our findings indicate that wintering geese showed a high degree of behavioural plasticity. However, more active foraging behaviours under poor habitat condition did not lead to a broader trophic niche. Habitat availability could be responsible to the divergent responses of foraging HR and isotopic niche to human-induced environmental change. Therefore, maintaining natural hydrological regimes during the critical period (i.e. September-November) to ensure that quality food resources are available is central to the future of populations of geese within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.

The importance of pilot studies and understanding microhabitat requirements when reintroducing endemic plants during coastal dune restoration	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Microhabitat requirements; Rare plant introduction; Dune restoration; Lupinus nipomensis; Reintroduction; Endangered species	BIODIVERSITY; MICROSITE; ECOLOGY; SEED	In coastalCalifornia dune ecosystems protect coastal cities from damaging storms and provide habitat for native wildlife. Despite the economic and ecological importance of coastal dunes, habitat loss has continued and is predicted to accelerate with a changing climate. To combat the effects of climate change and ensure that coastal dunes will persist into the future, they need to be prioritized for conservation and restoration. However, for restoration to be successful, endemic plants, which are plant with specialized habitat requirements, need to be prioritized because they make up a significant portion of the biodiversity in California coastal dunes. Because endemic plants are rare and there is limited stock of plants available for transplant, we need to be more aggressive in using pilot studies. These can be used to evaluate the biotic and abiotic conditions that maximize growth and reproduction and to help guide effective reintroduction. To evaluate how exploratory pilot studies can enhance the restoration of rare and endemic plant species, weconducted a study restoring Lupinus nipomensis, aUnited States federally endangered species, on coastal dunes in San Luis Obispo County, California. We found that L. nipomensis had the highest seed production in plots that had a steep, north facing slope and were protected from herbivores. Our results suggest that restoration efforts should be focused on areas with these characteristics to maximize restoration success. Our pilot reintroduction of L. nipomensis highlights the importance of using pilot experiments to enhance reintroduction success and to quicken the recovery of coastal dune ecosystems.

We conducted auditory and visual surveys along trails and streams in Ilha Grande (an Atlantic forested island in southeast Brazil, the only place where the species occurs), to estimate the frequency of occurrence and the density of H. fredi between the island slopes (according to the ridgeline which crosses the island from east to west) and along the streams. Hylodes fredi was detected in 31.5% of the streams sampled, occurring only in forested localities. We did not record H. fredi in streams with any sort of human disturbance (like buildings, pollution and/or pipes). Hylodes fredi had a higher frequency of occurrence in streams of the oceanic slope (42.6%) than in continental slope (23.1%), probably due to the higher levels of precipitation in this slope together with the reduced levels of human occupation in comparison with the continental slope. We found an overall average density of 0.04 individuals per meter of stream, possibly because of its territorial behaviour and specific habitat requirements. The distribution of H. fredi along the island is probably consequence of the species' restrict habitat requirement, together with a possible negative impact of human occupation in lower altitudes.

Soils in the coastal wetland are nutrient-poor, nutrient enrichment may enhance the spread of S. alterniflora towards the non-tidal marsh of the Yellow River Delta. We conducted a 2-year transplant and nutrient addition field experiment to investigate the influence of nutrient enrichment and interspecific interactions on the performance (growth, survival or inflorescence) of S. alterniflora. We found that nutrient addition and species competition did not have significant effects on the variation in performances of S. alterniflora. However, vegetative zones (Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis), years (2013 and 2014) significantly contributed to the variation. The biomass per stem, survival and inflorescence were much higher in the P. australis than the S. salsa zone (biomass per stem: 1.86 +/- 0.17g vs. 0.82 +/- 0.15g; survivorship: 79% vs. 36%; inflorescence: 40% vs. 2%), and in 2013 than 2014 (biomass per stem: 1.72 +/- 0.19g vs. 0.91 +/- 0.13g; survivorship: 65% vs. 50%; inflorescence: 36% vs. 6.94%), which may be due to the combination of less flooding frequency and high salinity in the S. salsa zone and year 2014. These findings implied that eutrophication may not enhance the spread of S. alterniflora towards the non-tidal wetlands in the Chinese Yellow River Delta.

Understanding the patterns of beach use can assist in developing management actions designed to promote sustainable use. We assessed whether remotely piloted aerial systems (commonly known as drones) are an appropriate tool for quantifying beach use, and if beach activities are influenced by environmental conditions. Novel drone-based methods were used to quantify beach use. Drone flights recorded 2km of beach, capturing video footage of the beach from the dune to water interface and the breaker zone. Flights were undertaken during three school holiday periods at four popular beaches in New South Wales, Australia. These videos were later analysed in the laboratory to categorise beach users. Of the total users sampled, 45.0% were sunbathing, 22.8% swimming, 21.2% walking, 10.6% surfing, and less than 0.5% were fishing. Participation in walking, surfing and fishing was similar throughout the sampling periods. However, sunbathing and swimming significantly increased during the austral spring and summer sampling periods. Usage patterns varied significantly among beaches, and during the different sampling periods, suggesting that adaptive management strategies targeted to specific areas are the most appropriate way to protect beach habitats and users. Furthermore, we demonstrate that drones are an effective assessment tool to improve coastal management decisions.

Rapid evolution with generation overlap: the double-edged effect of dormancy	THEORETICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Environmental stochasticity; Evolutionary lag; Fluctuating selection; Moving optimum; Standing genetic variation; Storage effect	FRESH-WATER ZOOPLANKTON; FLUCTUATING SELECTION; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; INFINITESIMAL MODEL; QUANTITATIVE TRAITS; NATURAL-SELECTION; SEED BANKS; ADAPTATION; DISPERSAL; ECOLOGY	In life histories with generation overlap, selection that acts differently on different life-stages can produce reservoirs of genetic variation, for example, in long-lived iteroparous adults or long-lived dormant propagules. Such reservoirs provide migration from the past to the current population, and depending on the trend of environmental change, they have the potential either to slow adaptive evolution or accelerate it by re-introducing genotypes not affected by recent selection (e.g., through storage effect in a fluctuating environment). That is, the effect of generation overlap is a double-edged sword, with each edge cutting in a different direction. Here, we use sexual (quantitative trait) and asexual (clonal) models to explore the effects of generation overlap on adaptive evolution in a fluctuating environment, either with or without a trend in the mean environment state. Our analyses show that when environmental stochasticity scaled by strength of selection is intermediate and when the trend in mean environment is slow, intermediate values of generation overlap can maximize the rate of response to selection and minimize the adaptation lag between the trait mean and the environmental trend. Otherwise, increased generation overlap results in smaller selection response and larger adaptation lag. In the former case, low generation overlap results in low heritable trait variance, while high generation overlap increases the migration load from the past. Therefore, to understand the importance of rapid evolution and eco-evolutionary dynamics in the wild for organisms with overlapping generations, we need to understand the interaction of generation overlap, environmental stochasticity, and strength of selection.

The host-parasite interaction between honey bees (Apis mellifera) and the mite Varroa destructor is unusual, as honey bee colonies are relatively poorly defended against this parasite. The interaction has existed since the mid-20th Century, when Varroa switched host to parasitize A. mellifera. The combination of a virulent parasite and relatively naive host means that, without acaricides, honey bee colonies typically die within 3 years of Varroa infestation. A consequence of acaricide use has been a reduced selective pressure for the evolution of Varroa resistance in honey bee colonies. However, in the past 20 years, several natural-selection-based breeding programmes have resulted in the evolution of Varroa-resistant populations. In these populations, the inhibition of Varroa's reproduction is a common trait. Using a high-density genome-wide association analysis in a Varroa-resistant honey bee population, we identify an ecdysone-induced gene significantly linked to resistance. Ecdysone both initiates metamorphosis in insects and reproduction in Varroa. Previously, using a less dense genetic map and a quantitative trait loci analysis, we have identified Ecdysone-related genes at resistance loci in an independently evolved resistant population. Varroa cannot biosynthesize ecdysone but can acquire it from its diet. Using qPCR, we are able to link the expression of ecdysone-linked resistance genes to Varroa's meals and reproduction. If Varroa co-opts pupal compounds to initiate and time its own reproduction, mutations in the host's ecdysone pathway may represent a key selection tool for honey bee resistance and breeding.

As the amount of genetic variation is central for long-term persistence of populations, understanding how these processes affect variation over large-scale geographical gradients is pivotal. We investigated the distribution of neutral and putatively adaptive genetic variation, and reconstructed demographic history in the moor frog (Rana arvalis) using 136 individuals from 15 populations along a 1,700-km latitudinal gradient from northern Germany to northern Sweden. Using double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing we obtained 27,590 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identified differentiation outliers and SNPs associated with growing season length. The populations grouped into a southern and a northern cluster, representing two phylogeographical lineages from different post-glacial colonization routes. Hybrid index estimation and demographic model selection showed strong support for a southern and northern lineage and evidence of gene flow between regions located on each side of a contact zone. However, patterns of past gene flow over the contact zone differed between neutral and putatively adaptive SNPs. While neutral nucleotide diversity was higher along the southern than the northern part of the gradient, nucleotide diversity in differentiation outliers showed the opposite pattern, suggesting differences in the relative strength of selection and drift along the gradient. Variation associated with growing season length decreased with latitude along the southern part of the gradient, but not along the northern part where variation was lower, suggesting stronger climate-mediated selection in the north. Outlier SNPs included loci involved in immunity and developmental processes.

Accidental mass escapes can induce the loss of genetic diversity in wild populations by increasing genetic drift and inbreeding. Farm escapes probably represent an important issue in the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), which accounted for 76.4% of total escapees recorded in Europe during a 3-year survey. Here, we investigated patterns of genetic variation in farmed and wild populations of gilthead sea bream from the Western Mediterranean, a region of long gilthead sea bream farming. We focused on the role that genetic drift may play in shaping these patterns. Results based on microsatellite markers matched those observed in previous studies. Farmed populations showed lower levels of genetic diversity than wild populations and were genetically divergent from their wild counterparts. Overall, farmed populations showed the smallest effective population size and increased levels of relatedness compared to wild populations. The small broodstock size coupled with breeding practices that may favour the variance in individual reproductive success probably boosted genetic drift. This factor appeared to be a major driver of the genetic patterns observed in the gilthead sea bream populations analysed in the present study. These results further stress the importance of recommendations aimed at maintaining broodstock sizes as large as possible and equal sex-ratios among breeders, as well as avoiding unequal contributions among parents.

To assess whether limited dispersal could be critical for the sustainability of selective logging practices, we performed parentage analyses in two Central African legume canopy species displaying contrasted floral and fruit traits: Distemonanthus benthamianus and Erythrophleum suaveolens. We also developed new tools linking forward dispersal kernels with backward migration rates to better characterize long-distance dispersal. Much longer pollen dispersal in D. benthamianus (mean distance d(p) = 700 m, m(p) = 52% immigration rate in 6 km(2) plot, s = 7% selfing rate) than in E. suaveolens (d(p) = 294 m, m(p) = 22% in 2 km(2) plot, s = 20%) might reflect different insect pollinators. At a local scale, secondary seed dispersal by vertebrates led to larger seed dispersal distances in the barochorous E. suaveolens (d(s) = 175 m) than in the wind-dispersed D. benthamianus (d(s) = 71 m). Yet, seed dispersal appeared much more fat-tailed in the latter species (15%-25% seeds dispersing >500 m), putatively due to storm winds (papery pods). The reproductive success was correlated to trunk diameter in E. suaveolens and crown dominance in D. benthamianus. Contrary to D. benthamianus, E. suaveolens underwent significant assortative mating, increasing further the already high inbreeding of its juveniles due to selfing, which seems offset by strong inbreeding depression. To achieve sustainable exploitation, seed and pollen dispersal distances did not appear limiting, but the natural regeneration of E. suaveolens might become insufficient if all trees above the minimum legal cutting diameter were exploited. This highlights the importance of assessing the diameter structure of reproductive trees for logged species.

While in some cases bird diversity continuously decreases in response to urbanization, in others a non-linear response is evident, with peak bird diversity observed at intermediate levels of urbanization. But many studies previously investigating this pattern are spatially or temporally constrained.ObjectivesIn this study, we analyzed the impacts of urbanization on bird diversity, stratified to native and exotic species. We specifically investigated the differences in bird diversity between natural and urban green areas.MethodsWe used eBird citizen science data (>4,000,000 bird-survey lists) and remotely-sensed landcover data, throughout the contiguous United States of America.ResultsWe found a non-linear response to urbanization for both species richness and Shannon diversity. There was distinctly greater bird richness and Shannon diversity in urban green areas compared to natural green areas. Our observed response is likely explained by an increase in habitat heterogeneity of urban green areas compared with natural green areas.ConclusionsOur work highlights the importance of diverse urban green areas for supporting bird diversity in urban areas. We recommend that urban planning should focus on maintaining high habitat heterogeneity in urban green areas to promote greater bird diversity.

However, it is unknown whether local associations with clearcuts translate to an effect of clearcut amount in the surrounding landscape on occupancy or abundance at local sites. This question is important because forest management decisions are made at landscape scales.ObjectivesWe examined whether the amount of clearcut in the surrounding landscape influenced site occupancy of two threatened aerial insectivores, Common Nighthawk and Eastern Whip-poor-will. Both species nest in/near clearcuts at a local-scale.MethodsWe used acoustic recorders placed on edges of recent clearcuts (<= 15years old, n=49 sites) to measure presence-absence. We estimated occupancy in relation to the proportion of clearcut and open wetland within the surrounding landscapes at spatial extents between 0.5 and 5.0km.ResultsOccupancy of Eastern Whip-poor-will was not related to clearcut amount in the surrounding landscape at any scale. Common Nighthawk occupancy was lower in sites surrounded by landscapes with higher proportion of older (11-15years old) clearcuts. Both species' occupancy was higher in sites where the surrounding landscapes had higher proportions of open wetland.ConclusionsTwo possible mechanisms for our results include multi-scale selection of breeding sites or demographic responses to higher productivity in wetlands than clearcuts; both need further study. Our results show how the association of species with clearcut habitats at a local scale does not necessarily translate to a higher occurrence of those species at the landscape scale at which management decisions are made.

Using linear mixed effect models, we modeled seed diversity, abundance, richness and evenness as functions of the biological features and landscape context of isolated trees.ResultsThroughout all regions, the amount of woody vegetation surrounding trees in pastures was negatively related to rainforest seed diversity, evenness and abundance. Seed diversity and evenness increased significantly with the distance of isolated trees to forest fragments in the Australian sub-tropics, but elsewhere, seed diversity and evenness tended to decline with distance to forest, though not significantly.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the tree composition of landscapes surrounding isolated pasture trees is important for influencing zoochorous-dispersed seed rain, regardless of the region studied. Our study highlights the prominent role of landscape-scale, rather than local-scale factors on seed dispersal to isolated pasture trees, while providing strong evidence that early stage successional processes involving isolated pasture trees are similar throughout global tropical regions.

Although it is generally summarized as an isotropic metric, functional connectivity may be anisotropic, i.e. may vary as a function of movement axis and direction. In addition, variation in functional connectivity among species within the same landscape has rarely been examined.ObjectivesHere, we asked to what extent the functional connectivity of managed forest landscapes is species-specific, and whether there is evidence for directional anisotropy in functional connectivity for two species of forest songbirds.MethodsWe performed 6-km reciprocal translocations between two pairs of sites and we monitored return times of territorial male Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla; n=47) and Black-throated Green Warblers (Setophaga virens; n=37) in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. Each landscape was dominated by deciduous forest and comprised a 500- to 900-m wide strip of conifer plantation perpendicular to the movement axis.ResultsHoming time was shorter for Black-throated Green Warbler than for Ovenbird and anisotropy in functional connectivity was detected in the Ovenbird in one of the landscapes. Differences between species may reflect the Ovenbird's narrower habitat and foraging niche.ConclusionsOur results indicate that spatially-explicit population models should account for variability in functional connectivity among species, even when they are closely related. Our findings also suggest that anisotropy can be present under specific conditions.

Shrinking skinks: lizard body size declines in a long-term forest fragmentation experiment	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Deforestation; Habitat fragmentation; Thermal biology; Temperature-size rule; Temperature; Morphometrics; Climate change; Ectotherms; Lampropholis guichenoti; Wog Wog	WOODLAND REMNANT EDGES; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; THERMAL BIOLOGY; RAPID EVOLUTION; GROWTH-RATE; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; MORPHOLOGY; PATTERNS; SALAMANDERS	ContextIncreasing rates of habitat fragmentation globally underscore the importance of understanding the full spectrum of fragmentation's ecological consequences. Fragmentation alters the thermal environment of fragments, which may alter the body size of ectothermic organisms and in turn impact survival and reproduction.ObjectivesTo determine whether experimental habitat fragmentation alters body size in the heliothermic, ground-dwelling common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti).MethodsWe use body size data spanning 29years to experimentally test the prediction that lizards will experience morphological changes in forest fragments but not in non-fragmented controls.ResultsLizards were smaller in forest fragments relative to those in the non-fragmented controls after the fragmentation treatment was applied. For lizards within forest fragments, the greater the exposure to deforested areas, the greater the decline in body size. This pattern was strongest in the first 5 years following fragmentation and weakened or reversed over time as the pine plantation matrix surrounding the fragments matured. Using sampling site-scale temperature data for the most recent 5years of the experiment, we show that temperature predicts lizard body size. Our findings are consistent with predictions made under the temperature-size rule that ectotherms will be smaller in fragmented landscapes because of temperature increases at newly created edges.ConclusionsOur results raise new concerns about the effects of fragmentation on organisms in remnant patches and offer new research priorities, as more evidence is needed to determine the generality of body size declines in fragmented landscapes. Our results also highlight that body size declines, often attributed to climate change, may be amplified by habitat fragmentation, which has been global in its impact.

Species-rich boreal forests grew more and suffered less mortality than species-poor forests under the environmental change of the past half-century	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF); climate change impacts; drought; growth; mitigation; mortality; net aboveground biomass change; productivity; tree species diversity; warming	TREE MORTALITY; SITE INDEX; BIOMASS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; CLIMATE; RESISTANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; INCREASE; DROUGHT	Climate and other global environmental changes are major threats to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. However, the importance of plant diversity in mitigating the responses of functioning of natural ecosystems to long-term environmental change remains unclear. Using inventory data of boreal forests of western Canada from 1958 to 2011, we found that aboveground biomass growth increased over time in species-rich forests but decreased in species-poor forests, and importantly, aboveground biomass loss from tree mortality was smaller in species-rich than species-poor forests. A further analysis indicated that growth of species-rich (but not species-poor) forests was statistically positively associated with rising CO2, and that mortality in species-poor forests increased more as climate moisture availability decreased than it did in species-rich forests. In contrast, growth decreased and mortality increased as the climate warmed regardless of species diversity. Our results suggest that promoting high tree diversity may help reduce the climate and environmental change vulnerability of boreal forests.	[Hisano, Masumi; Chen, Han Y.

Assessing Ecological Risks from Atmospheric Deposition of Nitrogen and Sulfur to US Forests Using Epiphytic Macrolichens	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						critical load; lichen; air pollution; environmental assessment; quantile regression; ecological risk; climate; biodiversity; conservation; land management; CMAQ; PRISM	LICHEN COMMUNITIES; CRITICAL LOADS; AIR-POLLUTION; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; PLANT DIVERSITY; WESTERN OREGON; CLIMATE; RESPONSES; RECOLONIZATION	Critical loads of atmospheric deposition help decision-makers identify levels of air pollution harmful to ecosystem components. But when critical loads are exceeded, how can the accompanying ecological risk be quantified? We use a 90% quantile regression to model relationships between nitrogen and sulfur deposition and epiphytic macrolichens, focusing on responses of concern to managers of US forests: Species richness and abundance and diversity of functional groups with integral ecological roles. Analyses utilized national-scale lichen survey data, sensitivity ratings, and modeled deposition and climate data. We propose 20, 50, and 80% declines in these responses as cut-offs for low, moderate, and high ecological risk from deposition. Critical loads (low risk cut-off) for total species richness, sensitive species richness, forage lichen abundance and cyanolichen abundance, respectively, were 3.5, 3.1, 1.9, and 1.3 kg N and 6.0, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.3 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1). High environmental risk (80% decline), excluding total species richness, occurred at 14.8, 10.4, and 6.6 kg N and 14.1, 13, and 11 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1). These risks were further characterized in relation to geography, species of conservation concern, number of species affected, recovery timeframes, climate, and effects on interdependent biota, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem services.

This information is currently limited for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and is necessary for understanding the impacts of disturbances and the system's potential for recovery. This study reports juvenile and adult hard coral abundance and composition from 122 reefs on the GBR during a period of limited acute disturbance. The data represent baseline observations for juvenile hard coral assemblages spanning the longitudinal cross-shelf gradient of the GBR and 12 degrees of latitude and augment reported distribution of adult coral assemblages over the same scale with inclusion of additional reefs. Juvenile and adult coral assemblages reflected broad differences imposed by the gradient of environmental conditions across the GBR. The mean density of juvenile hard corals was lower in the inshore reefs (5.51 m(2)) than at either the mid-shelf (11.8 m(2)) or outer shelf reefs (11.2 m(2)). The composition of juvenile and adult coral assemblages covaried overall, although there were different relationships between these two life stages across the continental shelf and among community types. Dissimilarity between juvenile and adult coral assemblages was greater on inshore and outer shelf reefs than on reefs in the mid-shelf, although, there were differences in community types both within these shelf positions and those that spanned mid- and outer shelf reefs. Dissimilarity was greatest for Inshore branching Acropora and high for Southern Acropora communities, although very high coral cover and very low juvenile densities at these reefs precluded interpretation beyond the clear competitive dominance of Acropora on those reefs. Dissimilarity was also high between juvenile and adult coral assemblages of Turbid inshore communities suggesting water quality pressures, along with synergistic effects of other stressors, pose ongoing selective pressures beyond the juvenile stage. Conversely, relatively low dissimilarity between juvenile and adult coral assemblages on mid-shelf and lower latitude outer shelf reefs suggests pressures beyond those influencing settlement and early post-settlement survival were having less influence on the composition of adult coral assemblages.

However, available habitats for bird species are changing due to intensifying human activity, especially in the context of China's mass urbanization. Urban sprawl has taken over the wetlands along the lakes in the past decades, which places tremendous pressure on wetland ecosystems and, therefore, on bird communities. However, the ways urban land cover pattern along the urban-rural gradient affects bird communities is still unclear. To investigate the influence of land cover pattern on the alpha and beta diversity of birds in the urban-rural gradient we chose 31 sites distributed within the wetlands around the Dianchi Lake in Yunnan, China. We calculated the species richness to indicate alpha diversity and used the Morisita-Horn index to indicate beta diversity. Meanwhile, we assessed the land cover pattern of each site by measuring the proportion of emergent plants, floating plants, submerged plants, ponds, forests, lawns, roads, agricultural lands and built lands in a quadrat of 1 square kilometer. Simple linear regressions, model selection, and an averaging approach based on corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) were used to test the effects of land cover pattern on bird diversity. Using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test, we compared the difference between alpha and beta diversity, respectively, along the urban-rural gradient. Based on our analyses, urban and suburban wetland birds were significantly homogeneous. The community structure in rural wetlands, however, was significantly different from that of the suburban and urban areas. According to our research, the land cover patterns that influenced bird species richness were the built lands acreage, submerged plants acreage, ponds acreage, and the edge density of emergent plants. Meanwhile, of these variables, the built lands acreage, ponds acreage and edge density of emergent plants were significantly different in urban, suburban, and rural wetlands. Therefore, to maintain high biodiversity in wetlands affected by urbanization, we must pay more attention to the land cover patterns.

Trophic Trait Evolution Explains Variation in Nutrient Excretion Stoichiometry among Panamanian Armored Catfishes (Loricariidae)	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						nutrient recycling; Neotropical stream; nitrogen; phosphorus; suckermouth catfish	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; NICHE CONSERVATISM; GRAZING CATFISH; LIFE-HISTORY; SILURIFORMES; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; COMMUNITIES; IDENTITY; QUALITY	Variation in nutrient excretion rates and stoichiometric ratios (e.g., nitrogen to phosphorus) by consumers can have substantial effects on aquatic ecosystem function. While phylogenetic signals within an assemblage often explain variation in nutrient recycling rates and stoichiometry, the phylogenetically conserved traits that underlie this phenomenon remain unclear. In particular, variation in nutrient excretion stoichiometry across a phylogeny might be driven by phylogenetic patterns in either diet or body stoichiometry. We examined the relative importance of these traits in explaining variation in nutrient recycling rates and stoichiometry in a diverse family of Neotropical-armored catfishes, Loricariidae, in Panamanian streams. We found significant variation in nutrient mineralization traits among species and subfamilies, but variation in nutrient excretion stoichiometry among species was best explained by trophic position rather than body stoichiometry. The variation in trophic position among Panamanian species was consistent with variation in the trophic niche of their genera across South America, suggesting that phylogenetic patterns underpin the evolution of trophic and nutrient excretion traits among these species. Such geographical variation in nutrient mineralization patterns among closely related species may be common, given that trophic variation in fish lineages occurs widely. These results suggest that information on trophic trait evolution within lineages will advance our understanding of the functional contribution of animals to biogeochemical cycling.

However, the understanding of the diversity, composition, and assembly of the bacterial communities in different epiphytic microenvironments of large emerged macrophytes has remained elusive, especially the abundant and rare taxa across rhizosphere and phyllosphere communities. In this study, we collected samples of two different epiphytic compartments (rhizosphere and phyllosphere) of Phragmites australis. Both 16S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing and null-model analysis were employed to determine the difference in the composition and assembly of above-mentioned epiphytic bacterial communities. Our results indicated that bacterial communities of rhizosphere exhibited higher diversity and richness than those of phyllosphere. Deterministic processes dominated the assembly of bacterial community in both compartments, and stochastic processes contributed a certain proportion (30.30%) in the assembly of phyllosphere bacterial community. We also found that rare taxa contributed more significantly to the alpha- and beta-diversity of bacterial community than those of abundant taxa. The obtained data are useful for better understanding the bacterial community of different epiphytic compartments of P. australis.

A multi-scale comparison of elevation measurement methods in northeastern tidal marshes of the United States	WETLANDS			English	Article						Elevation; Tidal marsh; RTK; UAS; Photogrammetry	SEA-LEVEL RISE; MODELS; IMPACT	Coastal ecosystems are at risk across the globe due to combined effects of sea-level rise and human development. This threat is prevalent in the northeastern USA, where sea levels increase 2-6 mm annually. Much of this coastline is buffered by tidal marsh, directly linking monitoring of this ecosystem to effective coastal management into the future. We estimated local and regional elevations of tidal marshes from Maine to Virginia using real-time kinematic (RTK) technology, unmanned aircraft system (UAS) technology, and regional datasets from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) to evaluate elevation monitoring methods for coastal marshes. Locally we found that RTK-sourced elevation measurements are predicted well using the 1/9 arc-second NED layer, however UAS-derived DSMs did not predict RTK values well. Regionally we found the 1/9 arc-second NED explained 90% of the variation in RTK measurements, and this relationship was strongest in high marsh and terrestrial border across spatial scales. Additionally, we found that elevation increases from south to north in the majority of marsh cover types, indicating that continent-scale mechanisms may determine elevation relative to mean sea level. We suggest further work using UAS-sourced Digital Terrain Models and the NED as an economical substitute for RTK in higher-elevation cover types.

Soil Organic Matter Temperature Sensitivity Cannot be Directly Inferred From Spatial Gradients	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES			English	Article						microbial dynamics; soil modeling; organomineral associations; temperature sensitivity; soil carbon; climate change	MICHAELIS-MENTEN KINETICS; BELOW-GROUND CARBON; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; PHOSPHORUS SORPTION; DYNAMICS; DECOMPOSITION; RESPIRATION; RESPONSES; FOREST; MODEL	Developing and testing decadal-scale predictions of soil response to climate change is difficult because there are few long-term warming experiments or other direct observations of temperature response. As a result, spatial variation in temperature is often used to characterize the influence of temperature on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under current and warmer temperatures. This approach assumes that the decadal-scale response of SOC to warming is similar to the relationship between temperature and SOC stocks across sites that are at quasi steady state; however, this assumption is poorly tested. We developed four variants of a Reaction-network-based model of soil organic matter and microbes using measured SOC stocks from a 4,000-km latitudinal transect. Each variant reflects different assumptions about the temperature sensitivities of microbial activity and mineral sorption. All four model variants predicted the same response of SOC to temperature at steady state, but different projections of transient warming responses. The relative importance of Q(max), mean annual temperature, and net primary production, assessed using a machine-learning algorithm, changed depending on warming duration. When mineral sorption was temperature sensitive, the predicted average change in SOC after 100 years of 5 degrees C warming was -18% if warming decreased sorption or +9% if warming increased sorption. When microbial activity was temperature sensitive but mineral sorption was not, average site-level SOC loss was 5%. We conclude that spatial climate gradients of SOC stocks are insufficient to constrain the transient response; measurements that distinguish process controls and/or observations from long-term warming experiments, especially mineral fractions, are needed.

This study reviewed the interest of the scientific research on the pain issue in pig production to assess if the societal instances may be a driving force for the research activity. A literature search protocol was set up to identify the peer-reviewed papers published between 1970 and 2017 that covered the topic of pain in pigs' using Scopus((R)), database of Elsevier (c). One hundred and thirty papers were selected and they were mainly focused on the practice of castration (64%) followed by tail docking (24%). The scientific community first focused on these painful practices as a way to improve production efficiency and quality issues while more recently, due to the increased pressure by the public opinion, turned its interest towards the search of alternative solutions. A text mining analysis on the abstract of the selected papers clearly indicated the effort of the research to explore solutions to alleviate pain. Evocative words of this target were the selected terms pharmacological analgesic' and anaesthetic treatments'. The text mining highlighted vocalizations as the main pain indicators in pigs as this term was frequently associated to acute stress'. Ethical issues were a minor research topic in the scientific literature on pig breeding but in the short run, they are supposed to become a major subject to justify the acceptance of the modern production systems at the eyes of the consumers.

Connectivity explains local ant community structure in a Neotropical forest canopy: a large-scale experimental approach	ECOLOGY			English	Article						arboreal; Dipteryx oleifera; Formicidae; lianas; Panama; species--area relationship	BARRO-COLORADO ISLAND; TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS; BETA DIVERSITY; LIANAS; TREES; AVAILABILITY; COEXISTENCE; PATTERNS; LIMITATION	Understanding how habitat structure and resource availability affect local species distributions is a key goal of community ecology. Where habitats occur as a mosaic, variation in connectivity among patches influences both local species richness and composition, and connectivity is a key conservation concern in fragmented landscapes. Similarly, availability of limiting resources frequently determines species coexistence or exclusion. For primarily cursorial arthropods like ants, gaps between neighboring trees are a significant barrier to movement through the forest canopy. Competition for limited resources such as nest sites also promotes antagonistic interactions. Lianas (woody vines) connect normally isolated neighboring tree crowns and often have hollow stems inhabited by ants. We used two large-scale liana-removal experiments to determine how connectivity and nest site availability provided by lianas affect arboreal ant species richness, species composition, and beta-diversity in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. Removing lianas from a tree crown reduced ant species richness up to 35%, and disproportionately affected species that require large foraging areas. Adding artificial connectivity to trees mitigated the effects of liana removal. Ant colonization of artificial nests was higher (73% occupied) in trees without lianas vs. trees with lianas (28% occupied). However, artificial nests typically were colonized by existing polydomous, resident ant species. As a result, nest addition did not affect ant community structure. Collectively, these results indicate that lianas are important to the maintenance of arboreal ant diversity specifically by providing connectivity among neighboring tree crowns. Anticipated increases in liana abundance in this forest could increase the local (tree-level) species richness of arboreal ants, with a compositional bias toward elevating the density of broad-ranging specialist predators.

Intra-individual variation includes behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions and hence behavioral plasticity in the context of novel or variable conditions. Inter-individual variation determines the degree of variation on which selection can act and the rate of evolutionary responses to changes in average and extreme environmental conditions. Here we focus on variation in the partial migratory behavior of giant Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) and its energetic consequences. We evaluate the extent and mechanisms by which tortoises adjust migration timing in response to varying annual environmental conditions, and integrate movement data within a bioenergetic model of tortoise migration to quantify the fitness consequences of migration timing. We find strong inter-individual variation in the timing of migration, which was not affected by environmental conditions prevailing at the time of migration but rather by average expectations estimated from multi-annual averaged conditions. This variation is associated with an average annual loss in efficiency of 15% relative to optimal timing based on year-specific conditions. These results point towards a limited ability of tortoises to adjust the timing of their migrations based on prevailing (and, by extension, future) conditions, suggesting that the adaptability of tortoise migratory behavior to changing conditions is predicated more by past "normal" conditions than responses to prevailing, changing conditions. Our work offers insights into the level of environmental-tuning in migratory behavior and a general framework for future research across taxa.

However, natural environments are often fragmented and variable in time and space. In such contexts, regional coexistence depends on complex interactions between competition, niche differentiation and stochastic colonization-extinction dynamics. Quantifying all these processes at landscape scale has always been a challenge for ecologists. We propose a new statistical framework to evaluate metapopulation parameters (colonization and extinction) in a two-species system and how they respond to environmental variables and interspecific competition. It requires spatial surveys repeated in time, but does not assume demographic equilibrium. We apply this model to a long-term survey of two snails inhabiting a network of freshwater habitats in the West Indies. We find evidence of reciprocal competition affecting colonization or extinction rates, modulated by species-specific sensitivity to environmental variables. Simulations using model estimates allow us to predict species dynamics and explore the role of various coexistence mechanisms described by metacommunity theory in our system. The two species are predicted to stably coexist, because niche partitioning, source-sink dynamics and interspecific differences in extinction-colonization parameters all contribute to reduce the negative impacts of competition. However, none of these mechanisms is individually essential. Regional coexistence is primarily facilitated by transient co-occurrence of the two species within habitat patches, a possibility generally not considered in theoretical metacommunity models. Our framework is general and could be extended to guilds of several competing species.

Although several studies have reported on these effects, there is yet no general consensus on the strength and sign of such interactions or their contingency on herbivory features such as the plant tissue attacked. We performed a meta-analysis of studies testing for effects of herbivores on floral traits, plant attractiveness to pollinators, and plant reproductive success. We also assessed whether herbivore effects depended on the plant tissue attacked by herbivores and if real or simulated herbivory was used. We found an overall significant negative effect of herbivores on floral traits, plant attractiveness to pollinators, and plant reproductive success. These effects were, however, contingent on the plant tissue attacked and on whether real or simulated damage was used. Real floral and leaf, but not root, herbivores showed detrimental effects on floral traits and plant attractiveness to pollinators. In addition, real leaf, but not floral or root herbivory, lowered plant reproductive success. Contrastingly, simulated leaf and floral herbivory showed no effect on any of the response variables. These findings help move forward our understanding of the strength and directionality of herbivore effects on plant attractiveness to pollinators and their underlying mechanisms.

Generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions describe most ecologically relevant extreme events, including hurricanes, wildfires, and disease spread. In climate science, the GEV is widely used as an accurate and flexible tool over large spatial scales (>10(5) km(2)) to study how changes in climate shift extreme events. However, ecologists rarely use the GEV to study how climate change affects populations. Here we show how to estimate a GEV for hurricanes at an ecologically relevant (<10(3) km(2)) spatial scale, and use the results in a stochastic, empirically based, matrix population model. As a case study, we use an understory shrub in southeast Florida, USA with hurricane-driven dynamics and measure the effects of change using the stochastic population growth rate. We use sensitivities to analyze how population growth rate is affected by changes in hurricane frequency and intensity, canopy damage levels, and canopy recovery rates. Our results emphasize the importance of accurately estimating location-specific storm frequency. In a rapidly changing world, our methods show how to combine realistic extreme event and population models to assess ecological impacts and to prioritize conservation actions for at-risk populations.

A potential solution to the challenge of conflicting or piecemeal data relies on the integration of multiple data types into a unified modeling framework, such as integrated population models (IPMs). IPMs are a powerful approach for species that inhabit spatially and seasonally complex environments. We provide guidance on exploiting the capabilities of IPMs to address inferential discrepancies that stem from spatiotemporal data mismatches. We illustrate this issue with analysis of a migratory species, the American Woodcock (Scolopax minor), in which individual monitoring programs suggest differing population trends. To address this discrepancy, we synthesized several long-term data sets (1963-2015) within an IPM to estimate continental-scale population trends, and link dynamic drivers across the full annual cycle and complete extent of the woodcock's geographic range in eastern North America. Our analysis reveals the limiting portions of the life cycle by identifying time periods and regions where vital rates are lowest and most variable, as well as which demographic parameters constitute the main drivers of population change. We conclude by providing recommendations for resolving conflicting population estimates within an integrated modeling approach, and discuss how strategies (e.g., data thinning, expert opinion elicitation) from other disciplines could be incorporated into ecological analyses when attempting to combine multiple, incongruent data types.

Yet despite an abundant literature documenting thermal constraints on ant activity and behavior, we know little about whether temperature variation can influence the benefits conferred by ants to plants. We evaluated the effects of dawn-to-dusk fluctuations in temperature on patrolling and aggressive behavior in four arboreal ant mutualists of Acacia drepanolobium trees in central Kenya. We found that ant aggressive behavior significantly increased with branch surface temperature, primarily in the two most aggressive ant species: Crematogaster mimosae and C. nigriceps workers attacked a simulated herbivore at higher rates as surface temperature rose. In a browsing experiment, we found that goats browsed more frequently and for longer durations on C. mimosae-defended trees during cooler times of day, while goat browsing on plants from which ants had been removed was not affected by temperature. Our study demonstrates temperature-dependence in the efficacy of ant defense against herbivory and suggests that these ant-plants may be more vulnerable to herbivory during cooler hours of the day, when many native browsers are most active.

Narrow pollen diets are associated with declining Midwestern bumble bee species	ECOLOGY			English	Article						dietary specialization; Fabaceae; introduced weeds; low-intensity agriculture; niche breadth; pollen analysis; tongue length	HYMENOPTERA-APIDAE; WESTERN HEMISPHERE; BOMBUS; VULNERABILITY; SPECIALIZATIONS; ANDRENA; HABITAT; RARITY	Many species of bumble bee (Bombus) have declined in range and abundance across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, whereas other species have persisted and remain common and widespread. One explanation as to why some species have declined, based primarily on studies of the European bumble bee fauna, is that declining species have relatively narrow pollen-foraging niches and are less able to use alternative host plants in the absence of their preferred hosts. Though extensively explored in Europe, this hypothesis has not been investigated in North America, in part due to incomplete information on the foraging niche of many species. We selected 12 bumble bee species found in Michigan and quantified their pollen diets using museum specimens. We also extensively resurveyed the state to understand their contemporary status and distribution. Compared to a pre-2000 baseline, six species remain relatively common and widespread, whereas six species show range contractions of over 50%. There was a significant relationship between dietary breadth and distributional range change, with declined or declining species collecting around one-third fewer pollen types than stable species. Though there were significant compositional differences, we found no differences in the number of pollen types collected by species with differing tongue lengths. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that species with narrower dietary niches are at greater risk of decline. However, it is not clear if narrow dietary niches are a cause of declines, or if both are driven by an underlying factor such as proximity to the edge of climatic niches. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of dietary niche in bumble bees, and how it interacts with other factors to influence population trajectories of stable and at-risk species.

Identifying occupancy model inadequacies: can residuals separately assess detection and presence?	ECOLOGY			English	Article						hierarchical model; imperfect detection; model assessment; occupancy models; posterior predictive checks; residual diagnostics	FIT; DIAGNOSTICS; CHECKING	Occupancy models are widely applied to estimate species distributions, but few methods exist for model checking. Thorough model assessments can uncover inadequacies and allow for deeper ecological insight by exploring structure in the observed data not accounted for by a model. We introduce occupancy model residual definitions that utilize the posterior distribution of the partially latent occupancy states. Residual-based assessments are valuable because they can target specific assumptions and identify ways to improve a model, such as adding spatial correlation or meaningful covariates. Our approach defines separate residuals for occupancy and detection, and we use simulation to examine whether missing structure for modeling detection probabilities can be distinguished from that for occupancy probabilities. In many scenarios, our residual diagnostics were able to separate inadequacies at the different model levels successfully, but we describe other situations when this may not be the case. Applying Moran's I residual diagnostics to assess models for silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and little brown (Myotis lucifugus) bats only provided evidence of residual spatial correlation among detections. Targeting specific model assumptions using carefully chosen residual diagnostics is valuable for any analysis, and we remove previous barriers for occupancy analyses-lack of examples and practical advice.

Periodical cicada (Magicicada spp.) adults represent a pulsed detrital subsidy that fertilizes plants, and live cicada nymphs are long-lived root-feeding herbivores. Previous studies of cicada herbivory effects have been inconclusive, and previous studies of cicada-mediated fertilization did not examine effects on trees, or on a multiyear timescale. Here, we describe the results of a 3-yr experiment that factorially manipulated the presence and absence of cicada fertilization and herbivory in a population of 100 American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) trees. We found that cicada fertilization strongly increased tree growth in the year of emergence, creating differences in tree size that persisted at least 2 yr later. By comparison, we did not detect reductions in tree growth associated with cicada herbivory in any year of this experiment. However, cicada herbivory reduced the densities of, and damage from, other aboveground herbivores. These results suggest that cicadas affect the size structure of forests over multiple years, and raise questions about how cicada-mediated fertilization and herbivory will affect tree growth over longer timescales.

Because of their unique eco-evolutionary formation and functioning, they should display distinct functional trait signatures. However, comparative trait-based studies of plants in refugia and non-refugia are lacking. Here, we provide a comparison between resource-rich (putative microrefugia for species preferring mesic habitats under increasing aridity) and resource-impoverished woodlands (non-refugia) around two granite outcrops in south-western Australia. We measured and compared six functional traits (bark thickness, foliar delta C-13, foliar C:N, leaf dry matter content, plant height, specific leaf area) in four woody species. We performed multiple-trait, multiple-species and single-trait, within-species analyses to test whether plants in resource-rich habitats were functionally distinct and more diverse than those in the surrounding resource-impoverished woodlands. We found that species in resource-rich woodlands occupied larger and distinct multiple-trait functional spaces and showed distinct single-trait values (for specific leaf area and bark thickness). This suggests that plants in resource-rich woodlands can deploy unique and more diverse ecological strategies, potentially making these putative microrefugia more resilient to environmental changes. These findings suggest that species in microrefugia may be characterised by unique functional signatures, illustrating the utility of comparative trait-based approaches to improve understanding of the functioning of refugia.

We investigated the response of forbs, shrubs, grasses and non-grass monocotyledons from warm temperate environments in Australia to repeated heatwaves to determine if responses differed with growth form and whether the addition of hot night temperatures influenced the ability of species to grow and acclimate. Plants were subjected to 3, 3-day heatwaves comprising either hot days and nights or hot days and cool nights, with control plants maintained under cool days and nights. All species were thermotolerant to repeated heatwaves, although two species showed lower biomass under heat treatments, indicating repeated heatwaves influenced function in some, but not all species. While there was evidence of photosynthetic damage in some species, these recovered by the end of the experiment. While grasses and one herb showed some evidence of photosystem acclimation, increases in the threshold temperatures for membrane breakdown only occurred in one shrub. Leaf sacrifice in grasses was significantly increased after repeated heatwaves suggesting that fuel loads in grass communities will increase in the future. These results indicate high resilience for these Australian native warm temperate plants although lower growth rates in some species after heatwaves may result in changes to community composition.

In this study, conducted at a nature reserve in Pretoria East, South Africa, the range of insects utilising Aloe pretoriensis (Asphodelaceae) fruits and/or seeds and the impact of this usage on its reproductive output were investigated. Using a GLMM, we explored the effects of morphological features (e.g. floral display size) and selected ecological factors (viz. distance between the aloes and conspecifics and other surrounding vegetation) on fruit utilisation and seed predation. A variety of insect visitors to A. pretoriensis (mainly bees and wasps) were identified including a number of seed predators and parasitoids. Evidence of phytophagy in dissected flowers showed increasing evidence of fruit utilisation and seed predation over an 8-week period. Emergence boxes with infructescences revealed a range of insect phytophages (and their associated parasitoids) in the aloe fruits and seeds: the drosophilid fly, Apenthecia and six species of wasp - five of them associated with ultilisation of aloe fruits/seeds for the first time: Eurytoma aloineae (Chalcididae), Mesopolobus sp., Pteromalus sp., and c.f. Chlorocytus in the Pteromalidae, Bracon sp. (Braconidae) and Pediobius (Eulophidae). Fruit set ranged between 48% and 93%, with an average of 76%, while average percentage utilisation of fruits was 29%, ranging between 7% and 68%. Average seed set was 23 seeds per fruit and average percentage seed predation 21% (range: 0-51%). Fruit utilisation was found to be significantly negatively correlated with distance to the nearest flowering bush (usually Helichrysum kraussii), but display size did not significantly affect fruit utilisation, nor did distance to conspecifics. Aloe pretoriensis thus serves as host to a variety of phytophagous insects and their associated parasitoids, which impacts considerably on its reproductive output with possible implications for the future conservation of this aloe species.

A total of 67 males and 45 females were flushed during the chick stages of 2011 and 2012. Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) was the main prey in terms of importance by mass in males and females in all stages and years (52.4-86.6% and 83.8-88.7%, respectively), except during the old chick stage in 2011 when the main prey in males and females was the Shortfin Squid (Illex argentinus) (63.1% and 44.4%, respectively). Analyses of similarity showed that diet composition in terms of contribution by mass of the main prey species was similar between sexes. Based on the isotopic values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 corresponding to 38 males and 21 females, the Bayesian mixing model outputs showed that Argentine Anchovy was also the main prey. In both years and chick stages, the isotopic niche of males and females was similar. The similarity in the dietary niche between male and female Magellanic Penguins raising chicks may be due to the high availability of Argentine Anchovy during the study period and the consequent dominance of this forage species in the diet of both sexes.

Grass greenness and grass height promote the resource partitioning among reintroduced Burchell's zebra and blue wildebeest in southern Mozambique	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						diet; partitioning; resource; wildebeest; zebra	COMPETITION; HABITAT; DIET; FACILITATION; PREFERENCES; HERBIVORES; SELECTION; BOVIDS; EQUIDS; PARK	Differences in the selection of habitat and specific dietary items support resource partitioning and coexistence of sympatric African grazing herbivores, such as zebra and wildebeest. In Maputo Special Reserve (MSR), southern Mozambique, these two species were extirpated during the civil war (1977-1992); since 2010, they have been reintroduced into the Reserve. Identifying the resource selection by reintroduced species and how these species coexist, while utilising the same resources, is both of ecological interest and important for the management of wildlife communities and parks. This is a key application of our research. Therefore, the present study investigated resource partitioning between Burchell's zebra (Equus burchelli, Smuts 1832) and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus, Burchell 1823) in the MSR. We conducted the study from July 2016 to June 2017. The data were collected by direct observation, driving the vehicle along the reserve's roads that covered the vegetation communities where zebras and wildebeest are known to commonly occur. The composition of the diet and specific features of the grass grazed by the two species, including greenness, height, and the number of stems, were assessed. The widely available grass, Aristida barbicollis, contributed most to the diet of both herbivores. The dietary overlap between the two herbivores was higher during the dry season (95%) than wet season (86%). Resources partitioning appears to be determined, principally, by the height and greenness of the grass, with the zebra grazing taller grass, which may facilitate the access of the wildebeest to the greener, lower proportion of the forage. That results follow the expectation that, among native herbivores, overlap in resource use is not expected based on evolutionary segregation.	[Mandlate Jr, Luis Comissario; Rodrigues, Flavio H.

This is particularly poignant for kowaro (or Canterbury mudfish, Neochanna burrowsius), a critically endangered fish largely restricted to drying-prone waterways on the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. By comparing three catchment-wide surveys (2007, 2010, 2015) within the Waianiwaniwa Valley, we assessed the scale and magnitude of population change induced by 2 years of consecutive drought (2014-15), when compared to surveys during wetter conditions (2007, 2010). The droughts triggered a catchment-wide switch from adult-dominated populations to populations comprised of juveniles indicated by a significant reduction in median size (similar to 95 mm during the wet to similar to 60 mm after drought). In comparison, population abundances were highly variable, indicated by no significant change in catch-per-unit-effort. The large variation in catch rates and connection of median size to reproductive potential mean median size will be useful to measure in monitoring to infer potential changes to population resilience, particularly during extreme events. Furthermore, because N. burrowsius could be regarded as extremophile fish, already restricted to harsh habitats, they are likely to become increasingly threatened by climate change. Thus, tools that allow for insightful comparisons between populations, such as a population resilience framework based on both abundance and body size distribution, will be increasingly important for pragmatic decision-making for targeted conservation measures.

As a consequence, in several areas Chaco forests persist as forest remnants of different sizes embedded in an agricultural matrix. Ants are social insects that have key roles in ecosystem functioning, and the effects of this ongoing land use change process on ant communities are little known for this region. In the present study, we assessed the consequences of land use replacement by monocultures and forest fragmentation on ant communities. Particularly, we assessed whether patch size, patch isolation and edge effect affect species richness and composition of ground-dwelling ants in fragmented landscapes of Chaco forests. We collected ants by combining hand collecting and pitfall traps in 17 forest fragments and the surrounding matrix from two sites in Cordoba, Argentina. Patch size and patch isolation had no effect on ant richness; however, patch isolation and, to a lesser extent, patch size altered ant species composition. The ant community was not affected by edge but it was negatively affected by the crop matrix, which reduced richness and altered species composition. These results indicate that monoculture matrices severely affect ant communities in the Chaco forests, and that the effects of other indicators of habitat fragmentation (patch size and edge effect) are subtler and less relevant. In the present context of land use change, even small fragments could have an important value for the conservation of ant diversity.

One explanation of this relates to changes in invertebrate resources due to anthropogenic pressures. The northern population of the eastern bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus) relies heavily on invertebrate food resources, and has experienced an 80% population reduction over the past 40 years. We investigated invertebrate abundance and nutritional quality across 23 currently and historically occupied northern bristlebird sites to determine whether extant territories were associated with more, or more nutritious, invertebrate resources. Pitfall and leaf-litter invertebrate sampling were done in both breeding and non-breeding seasons from 2014 to 2016. There was no difference in abundance, biomass or nutritional value of invertebrates between occupied and abandoned territories; however, within territories invertebrate abundance and nutritional value did correspond to the habitat characteristics with which bristlebirds are associated. Nutritional value of invertebrates increased with proximity to rainforest, while the abundance of macro-invertebrates (>1 mm) was correlated with grass height. Bristlebird territories are often close to rainforest margins, and these ecotones may provide more nutritious mesic-associated invertebrates. Higher abundances of large invertebrates in tall grasses may also contribute to the known association of bristlebirds with tall grasses. Maintenance of tall grass adjacent to rainforest through appropriate fire and grazing management is likely to be important for northern bristlebird recovery and long-term persistence of the population.

Nest composition and structure can play a critical role in the breeding success and/or adult survival of nest-building vertebrates. Although nest traits are expected to vary adaptively across elevational gradients, few studies address this relationship. We studied the variation in nest traits (composition and structure) across elevation for two taxa with two different functions in the Andean temperate forests of southern Chile: a bird (Aphrastura spinicauda, Furnariidae, 170 breeding nests) and a marsupial mammal (Dromiciops gliroides, Microbiotheriidae, 91 winter torpor nests). For A. spinicauda, we further assessed how nest traits influenced clutch size and hatching success. Both species used fewer types of nest materials (items) with increasing elevation, and a greater proportion of leaves were used in highland compared to lowland forests. Aphrastura spinicauda used feathers and hair, and D. gliroides used bryophytes more frequently in lowland forests. The mass and volume of nests decreased with increasing elevation for A. spinicauda and increased for D. gliroides. Nest traits had subsequent fitness consequences for A. spinicauda, such that: (i) greater cup volume and depth were associated with larger clutch sizes, (ii) more items used during nest building were linked to improved clutch size at high elevation only, and (iii) nest wall thickness was negatively associated with hatching success. Thus, in temperate mountain ecosystems, elevation may be an important factor influencing nest-building behaviour for cavity-using vertebrates. However, the direction of the elevational effects may vary among taxa and nest functions in these ecosystems.

Inverted invasions: Native plants can frequently colonise urban and highly disturbed habitats	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						colonisation; invasion; native species; novel habitats; urban	ALIEN PLANT; SPECIES RICHNESS; LIFE-HISTORY; COMMUNITIES; SUCCESS; RESTORATION; ATTRIBUTES; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY	There is an enormous body of literature on plant invasions, including many investigations of the types of introduced species that are most likely to invade natural ecosystems. In this study we turn invasion biology upside down, and ask what sort of native species colonise novel anthropogenic habitats such as roadside lawns, infrequently tended road shoulders, railway embankments and fire trails. We quantified species richness and cover in roadside lawns and infrequently tended road shoulders in five regions of New South Wales, Australia. The native vegetation in these regions included sclerophyll forest, fertile and infertile Eucalypt-dominated woodlands, rainforest, and semi-arid woodland. We performed a complementary survey of sites spanning five disturbance levels within the region containing sclerophyll forest vegetation. Although many non-native species were present in disturbed, novel habitats, a total of 136 native species were also found. Most of these native species were in sites with low levels of disturbance (fire trails and railway embankments), but 35 native species were found to colonise roadside lawns, our most highly-disturbed vegetation type. There was a significant negative relationship between the disturbance level in novel habitats and the number and cover of native species. Native species that colonised novel habitats were disproportionately likely be generalist species whose natural habitat includes both high and low light and high and low disturbance conditions. The native species colonising novel habitats also tended to have traits associated with a fast life-history, including short stature and small seeds. A surprisingly high number of native plant species are colonising novel, anthropogenic habitats. Our findings highlight the potential importance of urban ecosystems for conservation and restoration biology.

Also, fire can modify pollinator communities and thus affect plant reproduction. Here we evaluate the effect of frequent fires on sexual expression, pollination and reproductive success of Vachellia caven (Leguminosae), an andromonoecious tree that is highly dependent on animal pollination and is abundant in burned sites. We expect that increased fire frequency will favour maleness but it will decrease reproductive success due to abiotic resource depletion in repeated burned sites. To test this, we selected focal plants in three unburned sites and three frequently burned sites and measured their sexual expression, basal diameter, pollination and fruit set. The proportion of male inflorescences per plant was not affected by fire and it was negatively related with the diameter of the plant. The proportion of pollinated flowers was not affected by fire, and fruit set increased with maleness only in frequently burned sites. These results indicate that V. caven is adapted to regimes of high fire frequency: not only was there similar fruit set in both burned and unburned sites, but more male plants had higher fruit set in burned sites. Despite the soil impoverishment triggered by repeated fires, V. caven is able to maintain its sexual and reproductive functions, allowing it to persist and maintain viable populations in fire-prone environments. in Spanish is available with online material.

Limited evidence of compositional convergence of restored vegetation with reference states after 20 years of livestock exclusion	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						compositional change; livestock grazing exclusion; restoration reference sites; soil restoration; temperate woodland; vegetation restoration	TEMPERATE GRASSY WOODLANDS; GRAZING EXCLUSION; FLORISTIC COMPOSITION; EUCALYPT WOODLANDS; RESTORATION; RANGELANDS; MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEM; CONSERVATION; DEGRADATION	Native pastures and rangelands may become degraded by intensive pastoral use through clearing of woody components, loss of sensitive native species, invasion of opportunistic exotics and soil erosion, compaction and nutrient imbalance. Livestock exclusion is commonly a first management step to restore ecosystems degraded by overgrazing. However, few studies evaluate the outcomes of livestock exclusion on plant species composition and soil chemistry, while those that do are inconclusive due partly to highly variable responses and to inexplicit performance criteria. We adopted a conceptual model that characterised responses to fencing in terms of divergence from initial states and convergence with targeted states that represent restoration goals. We used the model to design an investigation of fencing effects on grassy woodlands within livestock production landscapes in subhumid southeastern Australia. First, we asked whether fencing initiated divergence from continually grazed vegetation and convergence with reference states with respect to plant species composition and soil properties. Secondly, we asked how responses depend on livestock exclusion time, degradation of the initial state, and soil conditions. Compositional trajectories based on a 17-year chronosequence showed that livestock exclusion initiated some divergence from unfenced controls but convergence with reference states was limited, variable among sites and unrelated to time-since-livestock-exclusion. Fencing initiated the development of novel communities comprising exotic taxa and a subset of native taxa from the reference species pool. Initial state offered limited explanation for the variability in compositional divergence from unfenced controls. Soil properties did not converge with reference states over time, and initial state did not explain the degree divergence of fenced from unfenced plots. The findings suggest site selection is crucial to successful restoration and reinforce the need to consider supplementary management actions, such as planting, scalping, direct seeding and weed control, in addition to livestock grazing exclusion, to restore woodlands towards desired states.

Limiting future degradation requires an understanding of the drivers of reduced water quality at both catchment and site scales. The goal of this study was to identify the probable drivers of turbidity in river ecosystems in highly urbanized areas, under the premise that turbidity does not respond consistently to urbanization. Catchment-scale data were compiled from remotely sensed datasets, whereas local-scale data were collected by citizen scientists as part of the global FreshWater Watch (FWW) program. The local-scale data included nearly 2600 coincident measurements of turbidity and observations of other local characteristics taken with a common method between March 2013 and June 2016 across 127 unique locations in 6 major population centers: Vancouver (Canada), Sao Paulo (Brazil), Curitiba (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Hong Kong SAR (China), and Guangzhou-Foshan (China). Catchment- and site-scale information were modeled with Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) to identify likely drivers of increased turbidity both across the entire dataset and within individual cities. Urbanization was not consistently associated with turbidity. The global BRT model explained 60% of the variation in turbidity, and key predictors were catchment area, % of the catchment as grassland, rainfall, Gross Domestic Product, and % of the catchment as artificial surfaces. City-specific BRT models explained 35-67% of the variation in turbidity. Key predictors varied between cities and were often different than those observed at the global scale. Local-scale data collected by citizen scientists were less predictive of turbidity than catchment-scale factors and explained similar to 12% of the observed global variability in turbidity. Factors such as riverbank vegetation and the presence of point pollution sources explained some of the variation in turbidity, indicating their management could help mitigate elevated turbidity and sediment load in some urban rivers. Through this high-resolution, site-scale information, we highlight how community-sourced data may add value to freshwater monitoring programs.

Furthermore, post-restoration monitoring is rarely done or documented. Pashan Lake in Pune, India has been the site of an integrated restoration project since 2005, which was implemented after the lake suffered a decline in quality as a result of increased urbanization and changes in catchment land cover. These restoration efforts focused on improving the abiotic and biological integrity of the lake and included draining, extracting silt and construction debris, developing 2 islands for birds and the planting of indigenous tree species. To assess long-term restoration benefits on the biological and chemical status of the lake, volunteers from the local community and schools were trained to regularly assess water quality following globally recognized and standardized water testing methods suitable for citizen science. In parallel, bird populations around Pashan Lake were studied to identify relationships between species richness or abundance and water conditions. Measurements were made each month during the 18-mo period from December 2014 to June 2016. We found that species richness and abundance of birds around the lake increased following restoration and that nutrient concentrations (N-NO3 and P-PO4) decreased within the lake. Changes in avifauna diversity were most strongly associated with hydrological conditions related to water-level fluctuation and chemical conditions related to pH. Peak turbidity levels were observed during later winter and summer periods, which were weakly and positively correlated to wetland bird diversity. Citizen scientist assessments of lake ecosystems that combine water-quality tests, wetland bird surveys, and visual observations of environmental conditions provided important insights into the effectiveness of restoration activities in this urban ecosystem. Furthermore, citizen science increased advocacy in the local community.

Light intensity regulates stoichiometry of benthic grazers through changes in the quality of stream periphyton	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						grazers; aquatic insects; stoichiometry; light; nutrients; periphyton; stream	LITTORAL INVERTEBRATES; ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE; PRIMARY PRODUCERS; GROWTH-RATE; NUTRIENTS; PHOSPHORUS; BIOMASS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	In mountain streams, light is a key factor for primary production and primary producer nutrient stoichiometry, or the relative composition of carbon (C) compared to phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) in primary producers. Light conditions, therefore, determine the stoichiometric quality of food available to grazers because periphyton primary producers are one of the most important food sources for grazers in stream communities. Here, one of our main goals was to analyze the stoichiometric response of macroinvertebrate grazers to different periphyton nutrient ratios that result from different light conditions. We hypothesized that the elemental imbalance between a consumer and its food source can change depending on food quality and the nutrient content of the consumer. Considering that under high light conditions photoinhibition causes low C : nutrient ratio in periphyton, we further expected that this inhibition would result in high food quality. Thus, the gap between the food quality needs of the consumer and the quality of food would be smaller. In addition, we expected better food quality to stimulate grazer growth and, thus, increase grazer body size. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a field study and a 3-mo field experiment in which we manipulated light (unshaded and shaded treatments) in a glacier-fed, naturally canopy-free stream in the North-Patagonian Andes. In our field study and during the experiment, grazers were dominated by the stonefly Notoperla magnaspina and the mayfly Meridialaris chiloeensis. C : P and C : N ratios of Notoperla magnaspina did not vary significantly in response to different light intensities. In contrast, M. chiloeensis showed higher variability in elemental composition and had significantly higher C : P and C : N ratios under reduced light conditions tracking the differences in C content of the periphyton. We interpret the light manipulation experiments to show that the elemental imbalance between periphyton and Notoperla magnaspina increased under low-light conditions as a result of an increase in the periphyton C : nutrient ratio. Our findings highlight the importance of light as a modulator of C fluxes in the benthic ecosystem. We conclude that light availability can play a key role in determining elemental imbalances within mountain stream food webs.

Ecological and sociopolitical assessment of congressional and presidential designation of federal protected areas	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						biodiversity; designation process; governance; legislation; national monument; natural resources; protected area; social determinants	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; NATIONAL-PARKS; PATTERN	Protected areas are one of the most effective means by which biodiversity is conserved, but are often criticized for either neglecting the importance of local communities or sacrificing conservation objectives for political expedience. In the United States, federal protected areas can be designated via a democratic legislation process or via executive action, which allows for comparison of the ecological and sociopolitical context of these top-down and bottom-up processes. We compared protected areas resulting from congressional designation vs. presidential designation with respect to their ecological context (using measures of biodiversity and climate refugial potential) and sociopolitical context (using measures of local support for conservation and reliance on natural resource-based industries). We found minimal differences between these designation modes for both ecological and sociopolitical variables. These results suggest that presidentially designated protected areas tend to be no more burdensome to local communities and no less valuable for ecological conservation than more widely accepted federal protected areas such as national parks, and they provide new evidence to inform the current debate over national monuments.

We applied a linked land-sea modeling framework based on remote sensing and empirical data, which couples groundwater nutrient export and coral reef models at fine spatial resolution. This spatially explicit (60 x 60 m) framework simultaneously tracks changes in multiple benthic and fish indicators as a function of community-led marine closures, land-use and climate change scenarios. We applied this framework in Ha'ena and Ka'upulehu, located at opposite ends of the Hawaiian Archipelago to investigate the effects of coastal development and marine closures on coral reefs in the face of climate change. Our results indicated that projected coastal development and bleaching can result in a significant decrease in benthic habitat quality and community-led marine closures can result in a significant increase in fish biomass. In general, Ka'upulehu is more vulnerable to land-based nutrients and coral bleaching than Ha'ena due to high coral cover and limited dilution and mixing from low rainfall and wave power, except for the shallow and wave-sheltered back-reef areas of Ha'ena, which support high coral cover and act as nursery habitat for fishes. By coupling spatially explicit land-sea models with scenario planning, we identified priority areas on land where upgrading cesspools can reduce human impacts on coral reefs in the face of projected climate change impacts.

Estimating the biodiversity of terrestrial invertebrates on a forested island using DNA barcodes and metabarcoding data	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						28S; biodiversity estimation; COI; Hauturu; leaf litter; Little Barrier Island; New Zealand; OTUs; soil	OXIDASE SUBUNIT-I; EXTRACELLULAR DNA; SPECIES RICHNESS; SOIL; PATTERNS; ARTHROPODS; SEQUENCES; PRIMERS; SAMPLES; SEARCH	Invertebrates are a major component of terrestrial ecosystems, however, estimating their biodiversity is challenging. We compiled an inventory of invertebrate biodiversity along an elevation gradient on the temperate forested island of Hauturu, New Zealand, by DNA barcoding of specimens obtained from leaf litter samples and pitfall traps. We compared the barcodes and biodiversity estimates from this data set with those from a parallel DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil from the same locations, and with pre-existing sequences in reference databases, before exploring the use of combined data sets as a basis for estimating total invertebrate biodiversity. We obtained 1,282 28S and 1,610 COI barcodes from a total of 1,947 invertebrate specimens, which were clustered into 247 (28S) and 366 (COI) OTUs, of which <= 10% were represented in GenBank. Coleoptera were most abundant (730 sequenced specimens), followed by Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Amphipoda. The most abundant OTU from both the 28S (153 sequences) and COI (140 sequences) data sets was an undescribed beetle from the family Salpingidae. Based on the occurrences of COI OTUs along the elevation gradient, we estimated there are 1,000 arthropod species (excluding mites) on Hauturu, including 770 insects, of which 344 are beetles. A DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA from the same sites resulted in the identification of similar numbers of OTUs in most invertebrate groups compared with the DNA barcoding, but less than 10% of the DNA barcoding COI OTUs were also detected by the metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA. A mark-recapture analysis based on the overlap between these data sets estimated the presence of approximately 6,800 arthropod species (excluding mites) on the island, including 3,900 insects. Estimates of New Zealand-wide biodiversity for selected arthropod groups based on matching of the COI DNA barcodes with pre-existing reference sequences suggested over 13,200 insect species are present, including 4,000 Coleoptera, 2,200 Diptera, and 2,700 Hymenoptera species, and 1,000 arachnid species (excluding mites). These results confirm that metabarcoding analyses of soil DNA tends to recover different components of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity compared to traditional invertebrate sampling, but the combined methods provide a novel basis for estimating invertebrate biodiversity.

An approach to incorporating inferred connectivity of adult movement into marine protected area design with limited data	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						British Columbia; ecological connectivity; graph theory; habitat proxy; marine conservation; marine reserve; marine spatial planning; multiplex network; network analysis; Northern Shelf Bioregion; population connectivity	ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS; LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; LARVAL DISPERSAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEASCAPE CONNECTIVITY; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; GRAPH-THEORY; CONSERVATION; MODEL; COAST	Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools that can support the resilience of marine ecosystems. Many countries, including Canada, have committed to protecting at least 10% of their marine areas under the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11, which includes connectivity as a key aspect. Connectivity, the movement of individuals among habitats, can enhance population stability and resilience within and among MPAs. However, little is known about regional spatial patterns of marine ecological connectivity, particularly adult movement. We developed a method to assess and design MPA networks that maximize inferred connectivity within habitat types for adult movement when ecological data are limited. We used the Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada, to explore two different approaches: (1) evaluating sites important for inferred regional connectivity (termed hotspots) and (2) assessing MPA network configurations based on their overlap with connectivity hotspots and interconnectedness between MPAs. To assess inferred connectivity via adult movement, we used two different threshold distances (15 and 50 km) to capture moderate home ranges, which are most appropriate to consider in MPA design. We applied graph theory to assess inferred connectivity within 16 habitat and depth categories (proxies for distinct ecological communities), and used novel multiplex network methodologies to perform an aggregated assessment of inferred connectivity. We evaluated inferred regional connectivity hotspots based on betweenness and eigenvector centrality metrics, finding that the existing MPA network overlapped a moderate proportion of these regional hotspots and identified key areas to be considered as candidate MPAs. Network density among existing MPAs was low within the individual habitat networks, as well as the multiplex. This work informs an ongoing MPA planning process, and approaches for incorporating connectivity into MPA design when data are limited, with lessons for other contexts.

However, the ability of individuals to move between habitat patches is notoriously difficult to estimate. One solution is to quantify functional connectivity via realistic individual-based movement models. Such simulation models, however, are difficult to build and even more difficult to parameterize. Here, we use the example of natal little owl (Athene noctua) dispersal to develop a new analysis chain for the calibration of individual-based dispersal models using a hybrid of statistical parameter estimation and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Specifically, we use locations of 126 radio-tracked juveniles to first estimate habitat utilization by generalized additive models (GAMs) and the biased random bridges (BRB) method. We then include the estimated parameters in a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) of little owl dispersal and calibrate further movement parameters using ABC. To derive efficient summary statistics, we use a new dimension reduction method based on random forest (RF) regression. Finally, we use the calibrated IBM to predict the dispersal potential of little owls from local populations in southwestern Germany to suitable habitat patches in northern Switzerland. We show that pre-calibrating habitat preference parameters while inferring movement behavioral parameters via ABC is a computationally efficient solution to obtain a plausible IBM parameterization. We also find that dimension reduction via RF regression outperforms the widely used least squares regression, which we applied as a benchmark approach. Estimated movement parameters for the individuals reveal plausible inter-individual and inter-sexual differences in movement behavior during natal dispersal. In agreement with a sex-biased dispersal distance in little owls, females show longer individual flights and higher directional persistence. Simulations from the fitted model indicate that a (re)colonization of northern Switzerland is generally possible, albeit restricted. We conclude that the presented analysis chain is a sensible work-flow to assess dispersal connectivity across species and ecosystems. It embraces species- and individual-specific behavioral responses to the landscape and allows likelihood-based calibration, despite an irregular sampling design. Our study highlights existing, yet narrow dispersal corridors, which may require enhancements to facilitate a recolonization of little owl habitat patches in northern Switzerland.

Bat carcasses are being found underneath wind turbines across North and South America, Eurasia, Africa, and the Austro-Pacific. However, relatively little is known about the comparative impacts of techniques designed to modify turbine operations in ways that reduce bat fatalities associated with wind energy facilities. This study tests a novel approach for reducing bat fatalities and curtailment time at a wind energy facility in the United States, then compares these results to operational mitigation techniques used at other study sites in North America and Europe. The study was conducted in Wisconsin during 2015 using a new system of tools for analyzing bat activity and wind speed data to make near real-time curtailment decisions when bats are detected in the area at control turbines (N = 10) vs. treatment turbines (N = 10). The results show that this smart curtailment approach (referred to as Turbine Integrated Mortality Reduction, TIMR) significantly reduced fatality estimates for treatment turbines relative to control turbines for pooled species data, and for each of five species observed at the study site: pooled data (-84.5%); eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis, -82.5%); hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus, -81.4%); silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans, -90.9%); big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, -74.2%); and little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, -91.4%). The approach reduced power generation and estimated annual revenue at the wind energy facility by <= 3.2% for treatment turbines relative to control turbines, and we estimate that the approach would have reduced curtailment time by 48% relative to turbines operated under a standard curtailment rule used in North America. This approach significantly reduced fatalities associated with all species evaluated, each of which has broad distributions in North America and different ecological affinities, several of which represent species most affected by wind development in North America. While we recognize that this approach needs to be validated in other areas experiencing rapid wind energy development, we anticipate that this approach has the potential to significantly reduce bat fatalities in other ecoregions and with other bat species assemblages in North America and beyond.

However, anthropogenic pressure from intensified forest management, eutrophication, and climate change may alter the ecosystem functions of understory vegetation and services boreal forests provide. Swedish forests span long gradients of climate, nitrogen deposition, and management intensity. This makes them ideal to study how the species composition and functions of other, more pristine, boreal forests might change under increased anthropogenic pressure. Moreover, the National Forest Inventory (NFI) has collected systematic data on Swedish forest vegetation since the mid-20th century. We use this data to quantify changes in vegetation types between two periods, 1953-1962 and 2003-2012. The results show changes in forest understory vegetation since the 1950s at scales not previously documented in the boreal biome. The spatial extent of most vegetation types changed significantly. Shade-adapted and nutrient-demanding species (those with high specific leaf area) have become more common at the expense of light-demanding and nutrient-conservative (low specific leaf area) species. The cover of ericaceous dwarf shrubs decreased dramatically. These effects were strongest where anthropogenic impacts were greatest, suggesting links to drivers such as nitrogen deposition and land-use change. These changes may impact ecosystem functions and services via effects on higher trophic levels and faster plant litter decomposition in the expanding vegetation types. This, in turn, may influence nutrient dynamics, and consequently ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration.

Management intensification maintains wood production over multiple harvests in tropical Eucalyptus plantations	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						intensification; land use; near-infrared from vegetation; plantation forestry; remote sensing; time series; wood production	LAND-USE; GLOBAL METAANALYSIS; MULTISOURCE DATA; PLANTED FORESTS; BASIC DENSITY; STAND-VOLUME; TIME-SERIES; NITROGEN; CARBON; CONSERVATION	Plantation forestry, in which trees are grown as a crop, must maintain wood production over repeated harvest cycles (rotations) to meet global wood demands on a limited land area. We analyze 33 yr of Landsat observations across the world's most productive forestry system, Eucalyptus plantations in southeastern Brazil, to assess long-term regional trends in wood production. We apply a simple algorithm to time series of the vegetation index NIRv in thousands of Eucalyptus stands to detect the starts and ends of rotations. We then estimate wood production in each identified stand and rotation, based on a statistical relationship between NIRv trajectories and inventory data from three plantation companies. We also compare Eucalyptus NIRv with that of surrounding native vegetation to assess the relative influence of management and environment on plantation productivity trends. Across more than 3,500 stands with three complete rotations between 1984 and 2016, modeled wood volume decreased significantly between the first and second rotation, but recovered at least partially in the third; mean wood volumes for the three rotations were 262, 228, and 247 m(3)/ha. This nonlinear trend reflects intensifying plantation management, as rotation length decreased by an average of 15% (decreasing wood volume per rotation) and NIRv proxies of tree growth rates increased (increasing volume) between the first and third rotation. However, NIRv also increased significantly over time in unmanaged vegetation around the plantations, suggesting that environmental trends affecting all vegetation also contribute to sustaining wood production. Management inputs will likely continue to be important for maintaining wood production in future harvests.

Warm, dry winters truncate timing and size distribution of seaward-migrating salmon across a large, regulated watershed	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						dams; drought; flow; migration; nursery; phenology; reservoirs; salmonids; snow; temperature mitigation; thermal tolerance	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHINOOK SALMON; MATCH-MISMATCH; LIFE-HISTORY; TEMPERATURE; GROWTH; IMPACTS; RIVER; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT	Ecologists are pressed to understand how climate constrains the timings of annual biological events (phenology). Climate influences on phenology are likely significant in estuarine watersheds because many watersheds provide seasonal fish nurseries where juvenile presence is synched with favorable conditions. While ecologists have long recognized that estuaries are generally important to juvenile fish, we incompletely understand the specific ecosystem dynamics that contribute to their nursery habitat value, limiting our ability to identify and protect vital habitat components. Here we examined the annual timing of juvenile coldwater fish migrating through a seasonally warm, hydrologically managed watershed. Our goal was to (1) understand how climate constrained the seasonal timing of water conditions necessary for juvenile fish to use nursery habitats and (2) inform management decisions about (a) mitigating climate-mediated stress on nursery habitat function and (b) conserving heat-constrained species in warming environments. Cool, wet winters deposited snow and cold water into mountains and reservoirs, which kept the lower watershed adequately cool for juveniles through the spring despite the region approaching its hot, dry summers. For every 1 degrees C waters in April were colder, the juvenile fish population (1) inhabited the watershed 4-7 d longer and (2) entered marine waters, where survival is size selective, at maximum sizes 2.1 mm larger. Climate therefore appeared to constrain the nursery functions of this system by determining seasonal windows of tolerable rearing conditions, and cold water appeared to be a vital ecosystem component that promoted juvenile rearing. Fish in this system inhabit the southernmost extent of their range and already rear during the coolest part of the year, suggesting that a warming climate will truncate rather than shift their annual presence. Our findings are concerning for coldwater diadromous species in general because warming climates may constrain watershed use and diminish viability of life histories (e.g., late springtime rearing) and associated portfolio benefits over the long term. Lower watershed nurseries for coldwater fish in warming climates may be enhanced through allocating coldwater reservoir releases to prolong juvenile rearing periods downstream or restorations that facilitate colder conditions.

Identity of coral reef herbivores drives variation in ecological processes over multiple spatial scales	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						bioerosion; coral reef; ecological impacts; facilitation; Florida Keys; grazing; herbivory; macroalgae; parrotfish	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; PARROTFISH SCARUS-VETULA; REGION-WIDE DECLINES; PHASE-SHIFTS; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; CALCIUM-CARBONATE; SPECIES RICHNESS; ECOSYSTEM ROLES; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; GRAZING FISHES	Overexploitation of key species can negatively impact ecosystem processes, so understanding the ecological roles of individual species is critical for improving ecosystem management. Here, we use coral reefs and the process of herbivory as a model to examine how species identity of consumers influence ecosystem processes to inform management of these consumers. Herbivorous fishes can facilitate the recruitment, growth, and recovery of corals by controlling the fast-growing algae that can outcompete corals for space. However, herbivorous fish guilds are species rich with important differences among species in diet, movement, and habitat preferences. Yet, we lack a general understanding of (1) how these species-specific differences in feeding and behavior scale up to reef-wide rates of ecosystem processes and (2) how species identity and diversity impact these processes. To address these knowledge gaps, we used field observations to derive key species- and size-specific foraging parameters for nine herbivorous parrotfish species on coral reefs in the Florida Keys, USA. We then combined these foraging parameters with fish survey data spanning multiple spatial scales to estimate the rates of three ecosystem processes: area of reef grazed, amount of macroalgae removed, and rate of bioerosion. We found that predicted rates of ecological processes varied dramatically among habitats and among reef zones within habitats, driven primarily by variation in abundance among species with different foraging behaviors. In some cases, assemblages with similar levels of total biomass had different rates of ecological processes, and in others, assemblages with different biomass had similar rates of ecological processes. Importantly, our models of herbivory using species-specific parameters differed from those using genus-level parameters by up to 300% in rates of ecological processes, highlighting the importance of herbivore identity in this system. Our results indicate that there may be little overlap in the roles species play, suggesting that some systems may be vulnerable to loss of ecological function with the reduction or loss of just a few species. This work provides a framework that can be applied across the region to predict how changes in management may affect the ecological impact of these important herbivores.

However, as many ecological processes effectively link BMI stream communities there is a need to describe groups of communities using measures of regional diversity. Here we demonstrate a role for incorporating both a traditional pairwise measure of community turnover, beta diversity, in assessing community health as well as zeta diversity, a more generalized framework for describing similarity between multiple communities. Using 4,395 samples of BMI stream communities in California, we constructed a model using measures of alpha, beta, and zeta diversity, which accounted for 71.7% of among-watershed variation in the mean health of communities, as described by the California Streams Condition Index (CSCI). We also investigated the use of zeta diversity in assessing models of stochastic vs. niche assembly across communities of BMIs within watersheds, with the niche assembly model found to be the likelier of the two.

Estimating effects of arable land use intensity on farmland birds using joint species modeling	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						agriculture; agri-environment measures; farmland birds; intensification; Joint Species Distribution model; production land	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY; POPULATION TRENDS; CROP-ROTATION; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; IMPACTS	Declines in European farmland birds over past decades have been attributed to the combined effects of agricultural intensification and abandonment. Consequently, aspirations to stop declines should focus attention on reversing these changes through voluntary or policy-driven interventions. The design of such interventions should ideally be informed by scientific knowledge of which aspects of the transformation of agricultural landscapes have contributed to the farmland bird declines. Declines may be associated with loss of natural habitats or the intensification and homogenization of land use management on production land, and furthermore, these changes may interact. Here, we applied an orthogonal design exploiting spatial variation in land use in a major agricultural region of Sweden to seek evidence for benefits to farmland birds of reversing some of the intensifications on and among arable fields and whether effects are modified by the availability of seminatural habitats (pastures and field borders) in the landscape. We accounted for the potentially confounding effect of interactions between species by using a joint species distribution model explicitly controlling for additional variation and covariation among species. We found that interventions aimed specifically at land in production could provide benefits to farmland birds. Landscapes with a higher proportion leys or fallows and/or with a more diverse set of crops held higher abundances of most farmland birds. However, effects were only apparent in landscapes with low availability of seminatural habitats and were sometimes even negative in landscapes with high amounts of such habitats, demonstrating context dependence. Even if we found little evidence of interactions between species, the joint modeling approach provided several benefits. It allowed information to be shared between species making analyses robust to uncertainty due to low abundances and provided direct information about the mean and variability in effects of studied predictors among species. We also found that care needs to be taken regarding prior and distributional assumptions as the importance of species interactions might otherwise be overstated. We conclude that this approach is well suited for evaluating agricultural policies by providing evidence for or against certain interventions or to be linked to policy scenarios of land use change.

Climate and lawn management interact to control C-4 plant distribution in residential lawns across seven US cities	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						C-4 plant distribution; lawns; macroecology; plant delta C-13; residential; urban; yard management	PHOTOSYNTHETIC PATHWAYS; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON ISOTOPES; URBAN LAWNS; TEMPERATURE; GRASSES; MODEL; HOMOGENIZATION	In natural grasslands, C-4 plant dominance increases with growing season temperatures and reflects distinct differences in plant growth rates and water use efficiencies of C-3 vs. C-4 photosynthetic pathways. However, in lawns, management decisions influence interactions between planted turfgrass and weed species, leading to some uncertainty about the degree of human vs. climatic controls on lawn species distributions. We measured herbaceous plant carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13, index of C-3/C-4 relative abundance) and C-4 cover in residential lawns across seven U.S. cities to determine how climate, lawn plant management, or interactions between climate and plant management influenced C-4 lawn cover. We also calculated theoretical C-4 carbon gain predicted by a plant physiological model as an index of expected C-4 cover due to growing season climatic conditions in each city. Contrary to theoretical predictions, plant delta C-13 and C-4 cover in urban lawns were more strongly related to mean annual temperature than to growing season temperature. Wintertime temperatures influenced the distribution of C-4 lawn turf plants, contrary to natural ecosystems where growing season temperatures primarily drive C-4 distributions. C-4 cover in lawns was greatest in the three warmest cities, due to an interaction between climate and homeowner plant management (e.g., planting C-4 turf species) in these cities. The proportion of C-4 lawn species was similar to the proportion of C-4 species in the regional grass flora. However, the majority of C-4 species were nonnative turf grasses, and not of regional origin. While temperature was a strong control on lawn species composition across the United States, cities differed as to whether these patterns were driven by cultivated lawn grasses vs. weedy species. In some cities, biotic interactions with weedy plants appeared to dominate, while in other cities, C-4 plants were predominantly imported and cultivated. Elevated CO2 and temperature in cities can influence C-3/C-4 competitive outcomes; however, this study provides evidence that climate and plant management dynamics influence biogeography and ecology of C-3/C-4 plants in lawns. Their differing water and nutrient use efficiency may have substantial impacts on carbon, water, energy, and nutrient budgets across cities.	[Trammell, Tara L.

Congruence between arthropod and plant diversity in a biodiversity hotspot largely driven by underlying abiotic factors	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						alpha diversity; beta diversity; biodiversity hotspot; biodiversity indicator; conservation planning; surrogate	CROSS-TAXON CONGRUENCE; CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; BETA-DIVERSITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; INSECT DIVERSITY; SURROGATE TAXA; CONSERVATION; CLIMATE; ASSEMBLAGES; PATTERNS	Plants often form the basis of conservation planning and management. The effectiveness of plant diversity as a surrogate for arthropod diversity was assessed in natural areas in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, a floral endemism hotspot in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. Arthropods and plants were sampled across 30 topographically heterogeneous sites in a spatially nested design. The relationship between plants and arthropods were quantified in terms of species richness, assemblage variation, and assemblage turnover. The influence of arthropod trophic groups, habitat association, and spatial scale were also explored. Generalized dissimilarity modelling was used to investigate differential influence of explanatory groups (geology, disturbance, local site characteristics, refuge, mesoclimate, terrain) on arthropod and plant turnover. Congruence in assemblage variation was restricted to local scales, and only present between plants and those arthropods associated with the foliar component of the habitat. Weak congruence in species turnover was due to differences in the relative importance of explanatory groups, with different variables within each explanatory group being important, and similar variables predicting different turnover patterns. For both groups, variables related to geology and fire history were important for assemblage turnover. These variables are already incorporated in conservation planning and management for plant diversity across the CFR. Overall plant diversity was a weak surrogate for the arthropod groups included in this study, suggesting that as an alternative, environmental surrogates for arthropod diversity perform better.

There is growing interest in the use of Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UAS) for mapping and monitoring of seagrass habitats. UAS provide flexibility with timing of imagery capture, are relatively inexpensive, and obtain very high spatial resolution imagery compared to imagery acquired from sensors mounted on satellite or piloted aircraft. However, research to date has focused on UAS applications for exposed intertidal areas or clear tropical waters. In contrast, submerged seagrass meadows in temperate regions are subject to high cloud cover and water column turbidity, which may limit the application of UAS imagery for coastal habitat mapping. To test the constraints on UAS seagrass mapping, we examined the effects of five environmental conditions at the time of UAS image acquisition (sun angle, tidal height, cloud cover, Secchi depth and wind speed) and five site characteristics (eelgrass patchiness and density, presence and density of non-eelgrass submerged aquatic vegetation, sediment tone, eelgrass deep edge and site exposure) at 26 eelgrass (Zostera marina) monitoring sites in British Columbia, Canada. Eelgrass was delineated in UAS orthomosaics using object-based image analysis, combining image segmentation with manual classification. Each site was ranked according to the analysts' confidence in the delineated eelgrass. Robust Linear Regression revealed sun angle and 'theoretical visibility' (an aggregate of tidal height, Secchi depth, and eelgrass deep edge conditions) to be the most important variables affecting mapping confidence. In general, ideal environmental conditions to obtain high confidence eelgrass mapping included: (1) sun angles below 40 degrees; (2) positive theoretical visibility with Secchi depths >5 m; (3) cloud cover conditions of 90%; and (4) wind speeds less than 5 km h(-1). Additionally, high mapping confidence was achieved for sites with dense, continuous, and homogeneous eelgrass meadows. The results of this analysis will guide implementation of UAS mapping technologies in coastal temperate regions.

Remote sensing of three-dimensional coral reef structure enhances predictive modeling of fish assemblages	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Coral reef fishes; LiDAR; light detection and ranging; predictive modeling; remote sensing; seascape ecology	BISCAYNE NATIONAL-PARK; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; SPECIES RICHNESS; SEASCAPE STRUCTURE; LIDAR; RUGOSITY; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; HABITAT; PREDICTABILITY	LiDAR (light detection and ranging) allows for the quantification of three-dimensional seascape structure, which is an important driver of coral reef communities. We hypothesized that three-dimensional LiDAR-derived covariables support more robust models of coral reef fish assemblages, compared to models using 2D environmental co variables. Predictive models of coral reef fish density, diversity, and biomass were developed using linear mixed effect models. We found that models containing combined 2D and 3D covariables outperformed models with only 3D covariables, followed by models containing only 2D covariables. Areas with greater three-dimensional structure provide fish more refuge from predation and are crucial to identifying priority management locations that can potentially enhance reef resilience and recovery. Two-dimensional seascape metrics alone do not adequately capture the elements of the seascape that drive reef fish assemblage characteristics, and the application of LiDAR data in this work serves to advance seascape ecology theory and practice in the third dimension.

Optimal placement of environmental sensors and probabilistic localization of sources have previously been considered only in theory, and not tested for terrestrial acoustic sensors. Conservation applications conventionally model detection as a function of distance. We developed probabilistic algorithms for near-optimal placement of sensors, and for localization of the sound source as a function of spatial variation in sound pressure. We employed a principled-GIS tool for mapping soundscapes to test the methods on a tropical-forest case study using gunshot sensors. On hilly terrain, near-optimal placement halved the required number of sensors compared to a square grid. A test deployment of acoustic devices matched the predicted success in detecting gunshots, and traced them to their local area. The methods are applicable to a broad range of target sounds. They require only an empirical estimate of sound-detection probability in response to noise level, and a soundscape simulated from a topographic habitat map. These methods allow conservation biologists to plan cost-effective deployments for measuring target sounds, and to evaluate the impacts of sub-optimal sensor placements imposed by access or cost constraints, or multipurpose uses.

Experimentally induced increases in fecundity lead to greater nestling care in blue tits	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						current-future trade-offs; life-history theory; matching; provisioning rules; quality-quantity trade-offs; residual reproductive value	LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION; EGG-PRODUCTION; PARENTAL CARE; CLUTCH SIZE; TRADE-OFF; TERMINAL INVESTMENT; REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; SEXUAL CONFLICT; OFFSPRING CARE; PARUS-MAJOR	Models on the evolution of bi-parental care typically assume that maternal investment in offspring production is fixed and predict subsequent contributions to offspring care by the pair are stabilized by partial compensation. While experimental tests of this prediction are supportive, exceptions are commonplace. Using wild blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), we provide, to our knowledge, the first investigation into the effects of increasing maternal investment in offspring production for subsequent contributions to nestling provisioning by mothers and male partners. Females that were induced to lay two extra eggs provisioned nestlings 43% more frequently than controls, despite clutch size being made comparable between treatment groups at the onset of incubation. Further, experimental males did not significantly reduce provisioning rates as expected by partial compensation, and if anything contributed slightly (9%) more than controls. Finally, nestlings were significantly heavier in experimental nests compared with controls, suggesting that the 22% average increase in provisioning rates by experimental pairs was beneficial. Our results have potential implications for our understanding of provisioning rules, the maintenance of bi-parental care and the timescale over which current-future life-history trade-offs operate. We recommend greater consideration of female investment at the egg stage to more fully understand the evolutionary dynamics of bi-parental care.

Particularly, interactions between donor hosts and potential recipients are understudied. Here, we investigate the importance of genetic similarity between naturally co-occurring Escherichia coli isolates in plasmid transfer. We uncover extensive variability, spanning over five orders of magnitude, in the ability of isolates to donate and receive two different plasmids, R1 and RP4. Overall, transfer is strongly biased towards clone-mates, but not correlated to genetic distance when donors and recipients are not clone-mates. Transfer is limited by the presence of a functional restriction-modification system in recipients, suggesting sharing of strain-specific defence systems contributes to bias towards kin. Such restriction of transfer to kin sets the stage for longer-term coevolutionary interactions leading to mutualism between plasmids and bacterial hosts in natural communities.

In aquatic ecosystems, organisms may interact with environmental bacteria to influence the pool of potential symbionts, but the effects of these interactions on host microbiome assembly and pathogen resistance are unresolved. We used replicated bromeliad microecosystems to test for indirect effects of arthropod-bacteria interactions on host microbiome assembly and pathogen burden, using tadpoles and the fungal amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis as a model host-pathogen system. Arthropods influenced host microbiome assembly by altering the pool of environmental bacteria, with arthropod-bacteria interactions specifically reducing host colonization by transient bacteria and promoting antimicrobial components of aquatic bacterial communities. Arthropods also reduced fungal zoospores in the environment, but fungal infection burdens in tadpoles corresponded most closely with arthropod-mediated patterns in microbiome assembly. This result indicates that the cascading effects of arthropods on the maintenance of a protective host microbiome may be more strongly linked to host health than negative effects of arthropods on pools of pathogenic zoospores. Our work reveals tight links between healthy ecosystem dynamics and the functioning of host microbiomes, suggesting that ecosystem disturbances such as loss of arthropods may have downstream effects on host-associated microbial pathogen defenses and host fitness.

Long-Term Vegetation Recovery and Invasive Annual Suppression in Native and Introduced Postfire Seeding Treatments	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BLM; competition; monitoring; restoration; wheatgrass	CRESTED-WHEATGRASS; GREAT-BASIN; BROMUS-TECTORUM; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PLANT ESTABLISHMENT; EXOTIC GRASSES; RESTORATION; FIRE; WILDFIRE; COMMUNITIES	Seed mixes used for postfire seeding in the Great Basin are often selected on the basis of short-term rehabilitation objectives, such as ability to rapidly establish and suppress invasive exotic annuals (e.g., cheatgrass, Bronms tectorum L). Longer-term considerations are also important, including whether seeded plants persist, continue to suppress invasives, and promote recovery of desired vegetation. To better understand long-term effects of postfire seed mixes, we revisited study sites in Tintic Valley, Utah, where seeding experiments had been initiated after the 1999 Railroad wildfire. Four different mixes, including two comprised entirely of native species, had been applied using rangeland drills at a shrubland site and aerial seeding followed by one-way Ely chaining at a woodland site. New vegetation data collected 16 years post fire revealed changes relative to 3 years post fire. We found significant increases in total cover of seed-mix species in all treatments, including the unseeded control where these species were present as residual populations or had spread from seeded treatments. Significant increases of seed-mix species cover and density were observed in blocks where seeding treatments had previously been considered unsuccessful. Some seed-mix species, particularly rhizomatous grasses, increased while others declined. Exotic annual forb cover decreased in all treatments while cheatgrass increased in the unseeded control and to a lesser extent in the native-only seeded treatments. Recruitment of non-seed-mix native perennials was highest in the unsealed control. Results indicate that postfire seeding has lasting effects on vegetation composition and structure, implying that seed mixes should be carefully formulated to promote long-term management objectives. Seed mixes containing large amounts of competitive introduced species may be especially effective for long-term cheatgrass suppression, but native-only mixes can also serve this purpose to a lesser degree while avoiding drawbacks of non-native species introductions.

Comparison of Methods To Examine Diet of Feral Horses from Noninvasively Collected Fecal Samples	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bureau of Land Management; DNA barcoding; Equus; Herd Management Area; microhistology	BROMUS-TECTORUM L; HERBIVORE DIETS; PERSISTENCE; COMMUNITIES; CHEATGRASS; VEGETATION; RANGELANDS; CATTLE; DESERT; EQUIDS	Feral horses (Equusferus caballus) have become abundant on public lands in the American West, particularly over the past 10 yr. In areas where they are overabundant, there is risk of habitat degradation. Most previous studies on diet and habitat use of feral horses were conducted more than 20 yr ago; rangelands have changed considerably in that time, so it is useful to revisit horse diets. We conducted a study to examine the diet of feral horses using noninvasive methods and subjectively compare diet analysis techniques. We collected feral horse fecal samples from a sagebrush/pinyon-juniper ecosystem in Colorado in May, August, and October 2014. We analyzed 30 fecal samples from each collection session by both microhistology and plant DNA barcoding. Both microhistology and plant DNA barcoding results indicated horse diet consisted primarily of graminoids (78.5% and 68.8%, respectively, both of which are in greater proportion than availability based on ecological site descriptions); however, the two methods differed in species composition of grasses. Similar to other studies, microhistological analyses underestimated the proportion of forbs in the diet compared with plant DNA barcoding analyses, which showed a surprisingly high contribution of forbs to the diet compared with previous studies. Our results suggest plant DNA barcoding analyses have great potential, although both methods have inherent biases. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.

Role of Grazing Intensity on Shaping Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Communities in Patagonian Semiarid Steppes	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; disturbance level; diversity; ecosystem functioning; grazing; life history strategy	SEASONAL-VARIATION; VASCULAR PLANTS; SOIL CARBON; GRASSLAND; DIVERSITY; GRASSES; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; DECOMPOSITION	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are vital for maintaining ecosystem structure and functioning and can be affected by complex interactions between plants and herbivores. Information found in the literature about how ungulate grazing affects AMF is in general contradictory but might be caused by differences in grazing intensities (GIs) among studies. Hence we studied how different GIs affect the composition, diversity, and abundance of AMF communities in a semiarid steppe of Patagonia. We predicted that 1) total AMF spore abundance (TSA) and diversity would decrease only under intense-grazing levels and 2) AMF species spore abundance would depend on their life-history strategies and on the GI. To test our predictions, we compared AMF communities among nongrazed (NG), moderately grazed (MG, 0.1-0.3 sheep ha(1)), and intensely grazed sites (IG, > 0.3 sheep ha(1)). GI was the most important factor driving changes in TSA and diversity, regardless of host plant identity. TSA, diversity, and evenness significantly decreased in IG sites but were not affected by MG. AMF species spore abundance varied depending on their life-history strategies and Gl. Families with high growth rates like Glomeraceae and probably Pacisporaceae showed the highest spore abundance in all sites but decreased under IG. Species with higher carbon demands like Gigasporaceae showed low spore abundance and frequency in NG and MG sites and were absent in IG sites. In contrast, species with low growth rates, but efficient carbon usage, like Acaulosporaceae, showed low spore abundance in all sites but increased in IG sites compared with NG or MG sites. We conclude that intensification of grazing reduces AN' diversity and abundance, with the likely loss of AMF benefits for plants, such as improved nutrient and water uptake and soil aggregation.

Potential Spread of Cheatgrass and Other Invasive Species by Feral Horses in Western Colorado	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cheatgrass; diet; equid; germination; invasive species; Bromus tectorum; Equus fetus caballus	BROMUS-TECTORUM L; GREAT-BASIN; SEED DISPERSAL; PLANT SEEDS; CLIMATE; CATTLE; PERSISTENCE; DISTURBANCE; RESILIENCE; SHRUBLANDS	The invasive grass cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) presents major challenges for land management and habitat conservation in the western United States. Feral horses (Equus ferns caballus) have become overabundant in some areas of the West and can impact fragile semiarid ecosystems. Amid ongoing efforts to control cheatgrass in the Great Basin, we conducted a study to determine if feral horses contribute to the spread of cheatgrass through distribution via their feces. We collected feral horse fecal samples from Little Book Cliffs Herd Management Area in western Colorado in 2014. Fecal samples were dried, and 20 from each of 3 collection sessions were cultivated to examine germination success. Six species germinated from 18 samples (30%; mostly one plant per sample where germination occurred), including cheatgrass from 8% of samples. In a separate study we examined the diet of this same horse population using fecal plant DNA barcoding. Plant species that germinated were rare in the diet and germinated from fewer samples than expected relative to their detection in the diet. Our results suggest that feral horses could be contributing to cheatgrass propagation. Native ungulates and domestic cattle also have this potential. Although management of all large ungulates is necessary to mitigate cheatgrass spread, control of feral horse numbers is particularly necessary.

Changes in some soil enzymes related to soil quality were measured by spectrophotometry, simazine dissipation rates were measured by gas chromatography, and biomass production in the contaminated soil was evaluated. Results of this study indicated that application of the organic amendment inoculated with Trametes versicolor enabled a decrease in negative effects of the herbicide on soil enzymatic activities and a reduction in final concentrations of simazine (similar to 80% at both doses). The simazine half-life time was reduced from 14 to 10 days and from 36 to 15 days for doses of 2 and 20 mg kg(-1), respectively. These findings prove that the combined strategy of biostimulation and bioaugmentation using these residues can be effectively used to reduce residue pesticides in soils, mainly by increasing the microbiological activity, thus improving simazine dissipation in an Andisol soil.

We conducted a factorial experiment. Endophytes and selected rhizospheric fungi were isolated and identified, and the colonization of mycorrhizal fungi was recorded. While the most interesting result was the significant increase in mycorrhizal colonization when J. curcas was associated with endophytes, it was also evident that this association is able to modulate some soil chemical parameters. This study suggests that the association between J. curcas and endophytes has an impact on specific root symbiotic fungi that usually plays relevant roles in nutrient availability for plants, and it would provide tools to enhance plant growth and oil yields.

The function of this propulsive mode during routine swimming has not been well quantified. At low speeds, propulsive cycle frequencies and amplitudes were constant, and average speed and power output were controlled by modulating coasting duration. This fixed-gear gait may accommodate muscle level constraints on power production. At higher speeds bluegills switched to a mixed power-modulation strategy, increasing speed and power through increased propulsive cycle frequency and reduced coasting time.	[Gellman, E.

The energetics of thermoregulation is, therefore, an important aspect of their ecology, yet few studies have quantified thermoregulatory patterns in wild passerines. We used miniature telemetry to record the skin temperature (T-skin) of free-living superb fairywrens (Malurus cyaneus, 8.6 g; n = 6 birds over N = 7-22 days) and determine the importance of controlled reductions in body temperature during resting to their winter energy budgets. Fairy-wrens routinely exhibited large daily fluctuations in T-skin between maxima of 41.9 +/- 0.68 degrees C and minima of 30.4 +/- 0.78 degrees C, with overall individual minima of 27.4 +/- 1.18 degrees C (maximum daily range: 14.7 +/- 0.98 degrees C). These results provide strong evidence of nocturnal torpor in this small passerine, which we calculated to provide a 42% reduction in resting metabolic rate at a T-a of 58 degrees C compared to active-phase T-skin. A capacity for energy-saving torpor has important consequences for understanding the behaviour and life-history ecology of superb fairy-wrens. Moreover, our novel field data suggest that torpor could be more widespread and important than previously thought within passerines, the most diverse order of birds.

Most studies have reported that birds are more consistent in the timing than in the routes or stopover sites during migration, but some specialist species showed the opposite patterns, being more consistent in spatial than temporal aspects of migration. One possible explanation for this contrast is that specialists rely on particular food or habitat resources, which restrict the migratory routes they can take, leading to high spatial consistency. If this is the case, the effect of specialist foraging should become apparent only when birds forage, instead of fasting and flying continuously. To test this effect, we analysed individual consistency in migration of the oriental honey buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus), a specialist raptor that feeds on honeybees and wasps, using a long-term tracking dataset. As honey buzzards make extended stopovers during which they forage in spring but not in autumn, the spatial consistency should be higher in spring than in autumn. Honey buzzards were highly consistent in both their migratory routes and stopover sites in Southeast Asia, but only during spring migration. Our results highlight an important link between species' migratory consistency and foraging ecology.

Here, we quantified three components, namely, diversity, biomass, and other relevant variables, in numerous protected and unprotected areas across four marine ecoregions in southwestern Europe. We created a "global conservation status index" (CSIglobal) as the sum of CSIdiversity, CSIbiomass, and CSIrelevant. We then tested whether CSI and its three components varied as a function of protection and marine ecoregion. MPA efficiency, defined as the effect size of protection on CSIglobal was unreliable and varied with geography. CSIbiomass and CSIrelevant contributed to the unreliability of MPA efficiency, while CSIdiversity was reliable. CSIbiomass showed the major efficiency in protected areas (60%). Biomass of threatened species was the single largest variable that contributed to MPA efficiency. Our easy-to-use approach can identify high- and low-efficient MPAs and help to clarify their actual roles.

In this study, I evaluated mercury concentrations in their tissues (muscle, liver), which revealed high concentrations (ug/g ww) of mercury (mean +/- SE) in liver (6.18 +/- 0.86) and muscle (1.12 +/- 0.06) tissue that increased with size and age. Mercury concentrations were highest in fish caught off Florida's Atlantic coast, but varied on a finer regional scale. Mercury concentrations in muscle tissue were generally greater near urbanized areas with known mercury sources and environmental conditions appropriate for higher methylation rates. This suggests that management should consider improving the water quality in these areas to reduce the risk of health effects to human consumers and to the fish themselves.	[Malinowski, C.

Differential responses to ocean acidification between populations of Balanophyllia elegans corals from high and low upwelling environments	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						corals; ocean acidification; transcriptomics; upwelling	LOCAL ADAPTATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT-STRESS; IMPACTS; WATER; SEAWATER; PCO(2); RESILIENCE; PLASTICITY	Ocean acidification (OA), the global decrease in surface water pH from absorption of anthropogenic CO2, may put many marine taxa at risk. However, populations that experience extreme localized conditions, and are adapted to these conditions predicted in the global ocean in 2,100, may be more tolerant to future OA. By identifying locally adapted populations, researchers can examine the mechanisms used to cope with decreasing pH. One oceanographic process that influences pH is wind-driven upwelling. Here we compare two Californian populations of the coral Balanophyllia elegans from distinct upwelling regimes, and test their physiological and transcriptomic responses to experimental seawater acidification. We measured respiration rates, protein and lipid content, and gene expression in corals from both populations exposed to pH levels of 7.8 and 7.4 for 29 days. Corals from the population that experiences lower pH due to high upwelling maintained the same respiration rate throughout the exposure. In contrast, corals from the low upwelling site had reduced respiration rates, protein content and lipid-class content at low pH exposure, suggesting they have depleted their energy reserves. Using RNA-Seq, we found that corals from the high upwelling site upregulated genes involved in calcium ion binding and ion transport, most likely related to pH homeostasis and calcification. In contrast, corals from the low upwelling site downregulated stress response genes at low pH exposure. Divergent population responses to low pH observed in B. elegans highlight the importance of multi-population studies for predicting a species' response to future OA.

Widespread species introductions provide a unique opportunity to study selection on introgressed alleles in independent, replicated populations. We examined selection on alleles that repeatedly introgressed from introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) into native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) populations in western Canada. We found that the degree of introgression of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms from the invasive species into the native is correlated between independent watersheds. A number of rainbow trout alleles have repeatedly swept to high frequency in native populations, suggesting parallel adaptive advantages. Using simulations, we estimated large selection coefficients up to 0.05 favoring several rainbow trout alleles in the native background. Although previous studies have found reduced hybrid fitness and genome-wide resistance to introgression in westslope cutthroat trout, our results suggest that some introduced genomic regions are strongly favored by selection. Our study demonstrates the utility of replicated introductions as case studies for understanding parallel adaptation and the interactions between selection and introgression across the genome. We suggest that understanding this variation, including consideration of beneficial alleles, can inform management strategies for hybridizing species.

Delineation of ecologically distinct units of marine Bacteroidetes in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						16S rRNA gene; Bacteroidetes; community structure; ecological units; NW Mediterranean	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; GENE CLONE LIBRARIES; CYTOPHAGA-FLAVOBACTERIA; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; WATER COLUMN; DIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; ATLANTIC; PRIMERS; ECOLOGY	Bacteroidetes is one of the dominant phyla of ocean bacterioplankton, yet its diversity and population structure is poorly understood. To advance in the delineation of ecologically meaningful units within this group, we constructed near full-length 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from contrasting marine environments in the NW Mediterranean. Based on phylogeny and the associated ecological variables (depth and season), 24 different Bacteroidetes clades were delineated. By considering their relative abundance (from iTag amplicon sequencing studies), we described the distribution patterns of each of these clades, delimiting them as Ecologically Significant Taxonomic Units (ESTUs). Spatially, there was almost no overlap among ESTUs at different depths. In deep waters there was predominance of Owenweeksia, Leeuwenhoekiella, Muricauda-related genera, and some depth-associated ESTUs within the NS5 and NS2b marine clades. Seasonally, multi-annual dynamics of recurring ESTUs were present with dominance of some ESTUs within the NS4, NS5 and NS2b marine clades along most of the year, but with variable relative frequencies between months. A drastic change towards the predominance of Formosa-related ESTUs and one ESTU from the NS5 marine clade was typically present after the spring bloom. Even though there are no isolates available for these ESTUs to determine their physiology, correlation analyses identified the environmental preference of some of them. Overall, our results suggest that there is a high degree of niche specialisation within these closely related clades. This work constitutes a step forward in disentangling the ecology of marine Bacteroidetes, which are essential players in organic matter processing in the oceans.

Oceanographic barriers, divergence, and admixture: Phylogeography and taxonomy of two putative subspecies of short-finned pilot whale	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						cetacean; Globicephala macrorhynchus; phylogeography; population structure; taxonomy	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS; SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; CONTROL REGION; MUTATION-RATE; R-PACKAGE; DIVERSITY; OCEAN	Genomic phylogeography plays an important role in describing evolutionary processes and their geographic, ecological, or cultural drivers. These drivers are often poorly understood in marine environments, which have fewer obvious barriers to mixing than terrestrial environments. Taxonomic uncertainty of some taxa (e.g., cetaceans), due to the difficulty in obtaining morphological data, can hamper our understanding of these processes. One such taxon, the short-finned pilot whale, is recognized as a single global species but includes at least two distinct morphological forms described from stranding and drive hunting in Japan, the "Naisa" and "Shiho" forms. Using samples (n = 735) collected throughout their global range, we examine phylogeographic patterns of divergence by comparing mitogenomes and nuclear SNP loci. Our results suggest three types within the species: an Atlantic Ocean type, a western/central Pacific and Indian Ocean (Naisa) type, and an eastern Pacific Ocean and northern Japan (Shiho) type. mtDNA control region differentiation indicates these three types form two subspecies, separated by the East Pacific Barrier: Shiho short-finned pilot whale, in the eastern Pacific Ocean and northern Japan, and Naisa short-finned pilot whale, throughout the remainder of the species' distribution. Our data further indicate two diverging populations within the Naisa subspecies, in the Atlantic Ocean and western/central Pacific and Indian Oceans, separated by the Benguela Barrier off South Africa. This study reveals a process of divergence and speciation within a globally-distributed, mobile marine predator, and indicates the importance of the East Pacific Barrier to this evolutionary process.

Fungal disease and temperature alter skin microbiome structure in an experimental salamander system	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						antifungal; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; climate; epidemic; invasion; microbiota; symbiosis	PATHOGEN BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS; SOUTHERN LEOPARD FROGS; JANTHINOBACTERIUM-LIVIDUM; CUTANEOUS BACTERIA; RANA-SPHENOCEPHALA; CHYTRID FUNGUS; KILLING FUNGUS; R PACKAGE; CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS; ABUNDANCE	Pathogens compete with host microbiomes for space and resources. Their shared environment impacts pathogen-microbiome-host interactions, which can lead to variation in disease outcome. The skin microbiome of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) can reduce infection by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) at moderate infection loads, with high species richness and high abundance of competitors as putative mechanisms. However, it is unclear if the skin microbiome can reduce epizootic Bd loads across temperatures. We conducted a laboratory experiment to quantify skin microbiome and host responses (P. cinereus: n = 87) to Bd at mimicked epizootic loads across temperatures (13, 17 and 21 degrees C). We quantified skin microbiomes using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and identified operational taxonomic units (OTUs) taxonomically similar to culturable bacteria known to kill Bd (anti-Bd OTUs). Prior to pathogen exposure, temperature changed the microbiome (OTU richness decreased by 12% and the abundance of anti-Bd OTUs increased by 18% per degree increase in temperature), but these changes were not predictive of disease outcome. After exposure, Bd changed the microbiome (OTU richness decreased by 0.1% and the abundance of anti-Bd OTUs increased by 0.2% per 1% increase in Bd load) and caused high host mortality across temperatures (35/45: 78%). Temperature indirectly impacted microbiome change and mortality through its direct effect on pathogen load. We did not find support for the microbiome impacting Bd load or host survival. Our research reveals complex host, pathogen, microbiome and environmental interactions to demonstrate that during epizootic events the microbiome will be unlikely to reduce pathogen invasion, even for putatively Bd-resistant species.

Ordinal cover data often need to be transformed to a quantitative form (0%-100%), especially when scrutinising summed cover of multiple species. Traditional approaches to transforming ordinal data often assume that data are symmetrically distributed. However, skewed abundance patterns are ubiquitous in plant community ecology. The questions this paper addresses are (a) how can we estimate transformation values for ordinal data that account for the underlying right-skewed distribution of plant cover; (b) do different plant groups require different transformations; and (c) how do our transformations compare to other commonly used transformations within the context of exploring the aggregate properties of vegetation? Location Global. Methods We assigned Braun-Blanquet cover-abundance ordinal values to continuous cover observations. We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical beta regression to estimate the predicted mean (PM) cover of each of six plant growth forms within six ordinal classes. We illustrate our method using a case study (2,809 plots containing 95,812 observations), compare the model-derived estimates to other commonly used transformations and validate our model using an independent dataset (2,227 plots containing 51,497 observations) accessed through the VegBank database. Results Our model found that PM estimates differed by growth form and that previous methods overestimated cover, especially of smaller growth forms such as forbs and grasses. Our approach reduced the cumulative compounding of errors and was robust when validated against an independent dataset. Conclusions By accounting for the right-skewed distribution of cover data, our alternate approach for estimating transformation values can be extended to other ordinal scales. A more robust approach to transforming floristic data and aggregating cover estimates can strengthen ecological analyses to support biodiversity conservation and management.

It is distributed throughout upland Europe but overgrazing has contributed to an unfavourable conservation status. To guide tall herb restoration, we asked: (a) Does using grazing exclusion where the tall herb habitat is confined to cliff ledge patches promote an expansion into the grassland below? (b) Does this management negatively affect vascular plant diversity? Location Ben Lawers NNR, Scotland. Methods Large herbivores have been excluded from a 180-ha area containing patches of outcrops rich in tall herb habitat. Using 1999 and 2017 surveys of permanent plot transects located in the grassland below (Before-After design), we quantify impacts on community composition and tall herb abundance. Results Species diversity remained constant although total species richness declined slightly and tall herb species richness increased significantly. There was a large expansion in tall herb cover (+29.67%) and a corresponding decrease in grass cover (-26.16%), as well as smaller increases in bryophytes and small herbs and a reduction in bare ground. Community composition shifted significantly from species typical of upland calcareous grassland towards those found in tall herb habitats. Seven tall herb species were amongst those showing the greatest increase in cover, along with taller grasses and understory herbs. Grazing tolerant grasses and low-growing, prostrate and annual herbs decreased. Competition for light, rather than resilience to herbivory, now has a major influence on the vegetation. Conclusions Using grazing exclusion where the tall herb habitat is largely confined to patches on cliff ledges facilitates an expansion into the upland grassland below. Although this management favours species tolerant of shadier conditions, there is no evidence of a negative impact on vascular plant community composition. It is therefore an effective strategy for promoting the restoration and favourable condition of this grazing-sensitive habitat.

Location Transylvania, Romania. Methods We collected data on vegetation and seed bank composition in 4 m(2) plots in 16 shrub-encroached grasslands and adjacent open grassland. Data were analyzed with regard to the impact of woody species encroachment (native vs non-native) and fire on grassland vegetation and the seed bank using NMDS and LME models combined with ANOVA and Tukey contrast tests. Results Encroachment was accompanied by a decrease in plant species diversity and altered microclimatic conditions. There was a lack of sufficient evidence for a difference in effect size between native and non-native woody species on tested vegetation or seed bank parameters. While the effects of fire on vegetation were weak compared to encroachment, burning failed to reduce the cover of woody species sustainably. Grassland vegetation and the seed bank differed significantly in species composition and diversity, indicating a limited potential for restoration from the seed bank alone. Conclusions To halt secondary succession in Transylvanian grassland sustainably, we suggest the establishment of a post-fire management regime including the cutting of woody species and/or re-introduction of grazing and mowing. Grassland restoration from the seed bank may be supported by the introduction of species from surrounding intact grassland.

Is (a) elevation, a proxy for tidal inundation and thus abiotic conditions, limiting the expanse of Elymus. Does sedimentation increase the spread of Elymus by (b) leading to surface elevation change or does it (c) add nitrogen and thereby allows Elymus to grow in lower elevation? Location Salt marsh at Sonke-Nissen-Koog, Wadden Sea National Park Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Methods The experiment was established in 2007 in the high marsh and consisted of four blocks of 12 m x 8 m. The blocks differed in surface elevation change during the experiment. Each block was subdivided into 24 plots of 1 m x 1 m. The original elevation of all plots in relation to the German ordnance datum (NHN) was assessed at the start of the experiment. Plots within the blocks were randomly assigned to one of the three N fertilization treatments. Within each plot we planted five randomly chosen individuals of Elymus. After four years of treatment, the vegetation composition and cover were recorded in all plots and aboveground biomass was collected. Results Original elevation was found to be a main driver of succession favouring Elymus and other late-successional plants. There was no effect of N fertilization, but a positive effect of surface elevation change on Elymus cover was detected. Conclusions We can conclude that the positive effect of surface elevation change on Elymus is based on the resulting higher elevation and more favourable abiotic conditions caused by sedimentation, but not by the addition of nitrogen with the freshly deposited sediment. This case, therefore, is an example for an ecosystem in which encroachment is driven by a natural factor, rather than anthropogenic eutrophication.

Here, we used large-scale, long-term fish movement to study and identify anthropogenic barriers to movements in the Lake Winnipeg basin including the Red, Winnipeg, and Assiniboine rivers. In the frame of the project, 80 Bigmouth Buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) and 161 Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were tagged with acoustic transmitters. Individual fish were detected with an acoustic telemetry network. Movements were subsequently analyzed using a continuous-time Markov model (CTMM). The study demonstrated large home ranges in the Lake Winnipeg basin and evidence of frequent transborder movements between Canada and the United States. The study also highlighted successful downstream fish passage at some barriers, whereas some barriers limited or completely blocked upstream movement. This biological knowledge on fish movements in the Lake Winnipeg basin highlights the need for fish passage solutions at different obstructions.

Traditionally, it has been grown and used extensively as a food source in Hawaii, but in the past decades, it has been neglected, underutilized, and supplanted by imported staple foods. Revitalization of breadfruit is central for reducing dependency on food imports and increasing food resiliency and self-sufficiency in Hawaii. Such a process could potentially be strengthened by the development of novel value-added products. This empirical study investigates consumer acceptance and willingness to pay in two scenarios: with and without detailed product information about breadfruit and its cultural significance, nutritional benefits and potential contribution to increase local food security. A total of 440 consumers participated in the study. Participants receiving descriptive information had a higher level of acceptance and were willing to pay a higher price compared with participants who were not informed that the product was made from breadfruit: 1.33 +/- 0.15 acceptance on the hedonic scale and 1.26 +/- 0.23 USD (both p < 0.0001). In conclusion, repeated exposure and building a positive narrative around breadfruit products may increase consumer acceptability.

We have classified the conservation units by their irreplaceability in terms of their role in the protection of mammalian species. Most irreplaceable conservation units are concentrated in the southern and southeastern regions of Brazil, mainly in the states of Rio de Janeiro, SAo Paulo and Parana. Our data show that over and above the area of the conservation unit or its type of use, protection of its surroundings appears to be of most consequence. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective mosaic governance mechanisms that include protected areas and different types of land use. However, it is also necessary to establish common ground that allows the coexistence of human economic demands and wildlife preservation.

It has been widely used for ecological studies thanks to its free availability and global coverage. This study aims to evaluate the quality of WorldClim data by quantifying any discrepancies by comparison with an independent dataset of measured temperature and precipitation records across Europe. BIO1 (mean annual temperature, MAT) and BIO12 (mean total annual precipitation, MAP) were used as proxies to evaluate the spatial accuracy of the WorldClim grids. While good representativeness was detected for MAT, the study demonstrated a bias with respect to MAP. The average difference between WorldClim predictions and climate observations was around +0.2 degrees C for MAT and -48.7 mm for MAP, with large variability. The regression analysis revealed a good correlation and adequate proportion of explained variance for MAT (adjusted R-2 = 0.856) but results for MAP were poor, with just 64% of the variance explained (adjusted R-2 = 0.642). Moreover no spatial structure was found across Europe, nor any statistical relationship with elevation, latitude, or longitude, the environmental predictors used to generate climate surfaces. A detectable spatial autocorrelation was only detectable for the two most thoroughly sampled countries (Germany and Sweden). Although further adjustments might be evaluated by means of geostatistical methods (i.e., kriging), the huge environmental variability of the European environment deeply stressed the WorldClim database. Overall, these results show the importance of an adequate spatial structure of meteorological stations as fundamental to improve the reliability of climate surfaces and derived products of the research (i.e., statistical models, future projections).

Improved Drought Resilience Through Continuous Water Service Monitoring and Specialized InstitutionsA Longitudinal Analysis of Water Service Delivery Across Motorized Boreholes in Northern Kenya	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						water services; remote monitoring; sensors; coupled human and natural systems; Kenya	MICROBIAL RISK-ASSESSMENT; COUPLED HUMAN; RAINFALL; SYSTEMS; HEALTH	Increasing frequency and severity of drought is driving increased use of groundwater resources in arid regions of Northern Kenya, where approximately 2.5 million people depend on groundwater for personal use, livestock, and limited irrigation. As part of a broader effort to provide more sustainable water, sanitation, and hygiene services in the region, we have collected data related to site functionality and use for approximately 120 motorized boreholes across five counties. Using a multilevel model to account for geospatial and temporal clustering, we found that borehole sites, which counties had identified as strategic assets during drought, ran on average about 1.31 h less per day compared to non-strategic borehole sites. As this finding was contrary to our hypothesis that strategic boreholes would exhibit greater use on average compared to non-strategic boreholes, we consider possible explanations for this discrepancy. We also use a coupled human and natural systems framework to explore how policies and program activities in a complex system depend on consistent and reliable feedback mechanisms.

Climate change induced range shifts in seaweeds distributions in Europe	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Algae; Ecological niche; Global change; Marine ecology; Physiological thresholds; Species distribution models	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SACCORHIZA-POLYSCHIDES; INTERTIDAL MACROALGAE; SARGASSUM-MUTICUM; CHANGE IMPACTS; KELP FORESTS; ASSEMBLAGES; TEMPERATURE; RESPONSES; ACCURACY	There are evidences of how climate change is affecting seaweeds distribution and the ecosystems services they provide. Therefore, it is necessary to consider these impacts when managing marine areas. One of the most applied tools in recent years to deal with this are species distribution models, however there are still some challenges to solve, such as the inclusion of hydrodynamic predictors and the application of effective, transferable and user-oriented methodologies. Five species (Saccorhissa polyschides, Gelidiurn spinosum, Sargassurn muticum, Pelvetia canaliculata and Cystoseira baccata) in Europe and 15 variables were considered. Nine of them were projected to the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the mid-term (2040-2069) and the long term (2070-2099). Algorithms for each species were applied to generate models that were assessed by comparison of probabilities and observations (area under the curve, true skill statistics, Boyce index, sensitivity, correct classification rate), niches overlap (Schoener's D, Hellinger's I), geographical similarity (interquartile range) and ecological realism. Models built demonstrated very good predictive accuracy and sensitivity, without overfitting risk. A medium overlap in the historical and RCPs environmental conditions were obtained, therefore the models can be considered transferable and results accurate because only some isolated points were detected as outliers, corresponding to low probabilities. The areas of S. polyschides and G. spinosum have been identified to be dramatically reduced, meanwhile S. muticum and C. baccata were predicted to expand their range. P. canaliculata was expected to keep its sites of presence but with a decrease in its probability of occurrence. For all species it was remarkable the importance of hydrodynamic variables and parameters representing extreme conditions. Spatially predictions of the potential species and areas at risk are decisive for defining management strategies and resource allocation. The performance and usefulness of the approach applied in this study have been demonstrated for algae with different ecological requirements (from upper littoral to subtidal) and distributional patterns (native and invasive), therefore results can be used by marine planners with different goals: marine protected areas designation, monitoring efforts guiding, invasions risk assessment or aquaculture facilities zonation.

In the present study, we deployed baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) in a portion of Brazilian central coast (i.e., Todos os Santos Bay) to describe fish species-habitat associations along an estuary-bay-continental shelf gradient. Significant variation in the fish assemblage was found among three ecosystems, four depth classes, and eight different types of habitat, confirming that the structure and composition of fish assemblages is mediated by a set of habitat characteristics forming an ecological mosaic. The highest species richness and relative abundance were found in the mangroves and reefs. The data demonstrated that some species, such as Lutjanus joeu, Lutjanus synagris, Carangoides bartholomaei, Eucinostomus argenteus and Eucinostomus melanopterus had clear ontogenetic shifts among habitats and across ecosystems. Some species (Sphoeroides greeley, L. synagris, and Eucinostomus gula) were widespread along the ecosystem-level gradient and were observed in a number of different habitats, reflecting more generalist habitat associations. By contrast, a large number of species (54; e.g., Ptereleotris randall, Decapterus macarellus and Mugu curema) were recorded in a single habitat type, indicating they were habitat specialists. Despite this apparent habitat-related pattern, the size-mediated relationships found in many species indicate cross-migration along the ecosystem gradient. Our findings have implications for the conservation and monitoring of fish assemblages highlighting the role of the connectivity of marine habitats as a conservation priority toward to an ecosystem-based management strategy.

Lower diversity of recruits in coastal reef assemblages are associated with higher sea temperatures in the tropical South Atlantic	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Larval dynamics; Marine invertebrates; Rocky reefs; Ocean-climate changes; Biodiversity	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SETTLEMENT; VARIABILITY; INVERTEBRATES; COMMUNITIES; CALIFORNIA; TRANSPORT; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES; PATTERNS	Climate change will lead to community shifts and increase the vulnerability of coastal marine ecosystems, but there is yet insufficient detail of how early life stages of marine populations are linked to oceanic-climate dynamics. This study aimed to investigate how ocean-climate variability is associated with spatial and temporal changes in benthic larval recruitment of tropical reef assemblages. Recruitment (abundance, richness, and diversity) of benthic invertebrates was monitored for one year on macroalgal beds in four rocky reefs in a marine protected region in the Eastern coast of Brazil, and compared to fluctuations in meteo-oceanographic conditions at multiple temporal scales (days, weeks, and months). Our results revealed that recruitment of benthic invertebrates varies widely (up to 15 orders of magnitude) among sampled reefs and in time, with wave height, wind speed, and sea temperature being significantly related to recruitment variability. We detected strong taxonomic variability in recruitment success and ocean-climate variables, which highlights the complexity of estimating community vulnerability to climate change in benthic communities. Given that macroalgal beds are key to recruitment of some species regionally (4-30 km), the protection of coastal nursery habitats may be critical for marine conservation and species adaptation in a climate change scenario. Considering the projected ocean-climate change in IPCC scenarios, our study suggests that recruitment of marine populations in coastal reefs could be highly sensitive to climate change in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean.

Modelling the rate of successful search of red foxes during population control	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Bayesian state-space model; informative prior; predation mechanics; relative abundance index; searching efficiency	PREDATOR-PREY THEORY; VULPES-VULPES; PRIOR INFORMATION; ABUNDANCE; DESIGN; CATCHABILITY; LANDSCAPE; COUNTS; IMPACT	Context Relative abundance indices of wildlife can be scaled to give estimates of absolute abundance. Choice of scaling parameter depends on the data available and assumptions made about the relationship between the index and absolute abundance. Predation-mechanics theory suggests that a parameterisation involving the rate of successful search, s, will be useful where the area searched is unknown. An example arises during fox culling on shooting estates in Britain, where detection and cull data from gamekeepers using a spotlight and rifle are available, and can potentially be used to understand the population dynamics of the local population. Aims We aimed to develop an informative prior for s for use within a Bayesian framework to fit a fox population-dynamics model to detection data. Methods We developed a mechanistic model with a rate of successful search parameter for the gamekeeper-fox system. We established a mechanistic prior for s, using Monte Carlo simulation to combine relevant information on its component factors (detection probability, observer field of view and speed of travel). We obtained empirical estimates of s from a distance-sampling study of fox populations using similar survey methods, and used these as data in a Bayesian model to develop a mechanistic-empirical prior. We then applied this informative prior within a state-space model to estimate fox density from fox-detection rate on four estates. Key results The mechanistic-empirical prior for the rate of successful search was lognormally distributed with a median of 2.01 km(2) h(-1) (CV = 0.56). Underlying assumptions of the parameterisation were met. Local fox-density estimates obtained using informative priors closely reflected regional density. Conclusions A mechanistic understanding of the search process leading to fox detections by gamekeepers, and the use of Bayesian models, allowed the use of diverse sources of information to develop an informative prior for s that was useful in estimating fox density from detection data. Implications Careful use of prior knowledge within a Bayesian modelling framework can reduce uncertainty in population estimates derived from index data, and lead to improved management decisions. The mechanistic approach we have used will have parallel applications in many other contexts.

GPS tracking allows finer-scale interpretation of animal responses by measuring movement patterns; however, the true behaviour of the animal during the period of observation is seldom known. Aims The aim of our research was to draw behavioural inferences for a lioness with a hidden Markov model and to validate the predicted latent-state sequence with field observations of the lion pride. Methods We used hidden Markov models to model the movement of a lioness in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. A three-state log-normal model was selected as the most suitable model. The model outputs are related to collected data by using an observational model, such as, for example, a distribution for the average movement rate and/or direction of movement that depends on the underlying model states that are taken to represent behavioural states of the animal. These inferred behavioural states are validated against direct observation of the pride's behaviour. Key results Average movement rate provided a useful alternative for the application of hidden Markov models to irregularly spaced GPS locations. The movement model predicted resting as the dominant activity throughout the day, with a peak in the afternoon. The local-movement state occurred consistently throughout the day, with a decreased proportion during the afternoon, when more resting takes place, and an increase towards the early evening. The relocating state had three peaks, namely, during mid-morning, early evening and about midnight. Because of the differences in timing of the direct observations and the GPS locations, we had to compare point observations of the true behaviour with an interval prediction of the modelled behavioural state. In 75% of the cases, the model-predicted behaviour and the field-observed behaviour overlapped. Conclusions Our data suggest that the hidden Markov modelling approach is successful at predicting a realistic behaviour of lions on the basis of the GPS location coordinates and the average movement rate between locations. The present study provided a unique opportunity to uncover the hidden states and compare the true behaviour with the inferred behaviour from the predicted state sequence. Implications Our results illustrated the potential of using hidden Markov models with movement rate as an input to understand carnivore behavioural patterns that could inform conservation management practices.

Aims The present study reports the results of an industry-wide survey to benchmark bird diversity in native vegetation on cotton farms spanning a 1260-km north-south subcontinental gradient from Central Queensland (Qld) to Southern New South Wales (NSW). Methods Between September and November 2014, birds were sampled twice on separate days in 2-ha quadrats (20 min per census) in eight remnant vegetation types as well as in native revegetation at 197 sites on 60 cotton farms spread across the principal cotton-growing zones (Central Qld, Border Rivers, Macquarie and Southern NSW) in inland eastern Australia. Key results We recorded 185 bird species in remnant and planted native vegetation on cotton farms. Species richness of bird communities declined from north to south. Bird community composition was similar in the three southern zones, differing somewhat in the north. The most frequent species were large (>60 g), readily detected landbirds common in agricultural districts, but 26 of the 53 extant species of conservation concern in the study region were also recorded, including 16 species of declining woodland birds. Bird composition, abundance, richness and diversity differed among the nine native vegetation types, with maximal and minimal bird abundance and diversity metrics recorded in river red gum-dominated riparian vegetation and grassland respectively. Conclusions Each remnant vegetation community had a generally distinct bird assemblage, indicating that all vegetation types contribute to regional biodiversity in cotton-growing zones in inland eastern Australia. Appropriate on-farm management of all remnant and planted native vegetation will assist regional biodiversity conservation. Implications For the Australian cotton industry to meet its stated environmental responsibilities, growers should be encouraged to prioritise the conservation management of remnant, riparian and planted native vegetation on cotton farms and the monitoring of bird species as an indicator of regional biodiversity response.

Contraception of prepubertal young can increase cost effectiveness of management of overabundant koala populations	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						female fertility control; levonorgestrel implants; management; marsupial; Phascolarctos cinereus; pouch development; sexual maturation	DESLORELIN IMPLANTS; FERTILITY-CONTROL; TAMMAR WALLABIES; POUCH LIFE; LEVONORGESTREL	Context With limited resources for wildlife management and conservation, it is vital that the effectiveness of management programs is maximised and costs reduced. Koala populations need to be reduced in locations where they are locally overabundant and over-browsing their food trees. Subcutaneous contraceptive implants containing levonorgestrel are currently used to control koala fertility to assist in reducing population densities. Dependent young are caught with their mothers, so are also available for contraception. Aims The overall aim was to investigate whether the effectiveness of koala contraception programs can be improved by administering levonorgestrel implants to female young along with their mothers. This was achieved by: (1) determining if implanting females before sexual maturation affects their fertility, growth and pouch development; and (2) developing a stage-structured population growth model to compare two management scenarios. Methods Juvenile female koalas (11-17 months old) were treated with either a control (n = 5) or 70 mg levonorgestrel implant (n = 5). Koalas were caught every 4 to 6 weeks for 15 months, then every 3 to 12 months for 5 years. Koalas were weighed and head length measured. Pouches were checked for young. Pouch development was assessed as a proxy for sexual maturation. A stage-based population model simulating koala population growth was developed to compare different management scenarios: no treatment; treatment of adults only; and treatment of adults plus their dependent young. Key results Levonorgestrel implants prevented births with no effect on growth, survival or timing of sexual maturation. Population growth simulations indicate that treating dependent young with their mothers results in earlier population reduction. Conclusions The treatment of prepubertal female koalas with levonorgestrel implants is a safe and effective method that increases the effectiveness of koala contraception programs. Implications Development of novel strategies may provide opportunities to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of management programs with constrained resources.

Males from populations with higher competitive mating success produce sons with lower fitness	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						insects; sexual selection & conflicts; trade-offs	INTRALOCUS SEXUAL CONFLICT; MATE CHOICE; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR; OFFSPRING QUALITY; FRUIT-FLIES; GOOD GENES; BODY-SIZE; SELECTION	Female mate choice can result in direct benefits to the female or indirect benefits through her offspring. Females can increase their fitness by mating with males whose genes encode increased survivorship and reproductive output. Alternatively, male investment in enhanced mating success may come at the cost of reduced investment in offspring fitness. Here, we measure male mating success in a mating arena that allows for male-male, male-female and female-female interactions in Drosophila melanogaster. We then use isofemale line population measurements to correlate male mating success with sperm competitive ability, the number of offspring produced and the indirect benefits of the number of offspring produced by daughters and sons. We find that males from populations that gain more copulations do not increase female fitness through increased offspring production, nor do these males fare better in sperm competition. Instead, we find that these populations have a reduced reproductive output of sons, indicating a potential reproductive trade-off between male mating success and offspring quality.	[Nguyen, Trinh T.

The presence of rival males has been shown to affect ejaculate and sperm traits in a wide range of taxa. However, male physiological conditions may not only affect sperm phenotypic traits but also their genetic and epigenetic signatures, affecting the fitness of the resulting offspring. We investigated the effects of male-male competition on sperm quality using TUNEL assays and geometric morphometrics in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. We found that the sperm produced by males exposed to high male-male competition had smaller heads but larger midpiece and flagellum than sperm produced by males under low competition. Head and flagella also appeared less sensitive to the osmotic stress induced by activation with water. In addition, more sperm showed signals of DNA damage in ejaculates of males under high competition. These findings suggest that the presence of a rival male may have positive effects on sperm phenotypic traits but negative effects on sperm DNA integrity. Overall, males facing the presence of rival males may produce faster swimming and more competitive sperm but this may come at a cost for the next generation.	[Silva, Willian T. A.

Na+/K+-ATPase gene duplications in clitellate annelids are associated with freshwater colonization	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						adaptation; genomics; molecular evolution; phylogenetics	PHYLOGENETIC POSITION; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTIONARY FATE; GLOBAL DIVERSITY; ORYZIAS-LATIPES; EXPRESSION; PRESERVATION; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATION; ERROR	Major habitat transitions, such as those from marine to freshwater habitats or from aquatic to terrestrial habitats, have occurred infrequently in animal evolution and may represent a barrier to diversification. Identifying genomic events associated with these transitions can help us better understand mechanisms that allow animals to cross these barriers and diversify in new habitats. Study of the Capitella telata and Helobdella robusta genomes allows examination of one such habitat transition (marine to freshwater) in Annelida. Initial examination of these genomes indicated that the freshwater leech H. robusta contains many more copies (12) of the sodium-potassium pump alpha-subunit (Na+/K+-ATPase) gene than does the marine polychaete C. telata (2). The sodium-potassium pump plays a key role in maintenance of cellular ionic balance and osmoregulation, and Na+/K+-ATPase duplications may have helped annelids invade and diversify in freshwater habitats. To assess whether the timing of Na+/K+-ATPase duplications coincided with the marine-to-freshwater transition in Clitellata, we used transcriptomic data from 18 annelid taxa, along with the two genomes, to infer a species phylogeny and identified Na+/K+-ATPase gene transcripts in order to infer the timing of gene duplication events using tree-based methods. The inferred timing of Na+/K+-ATPase duplication events is consistent with the timing of the initial marine-to-freshwater transition early in the history of clitellate annelids, supporting the hypothesis that gene duplications may have played a role in the annelid diversification into freshwater habitats.

Monitoring the use of so-called stopover and staging sites provides insights into (a) the timing of migration and (b) the importance of a site for migratory bird populations. A recently developed Bayesian superpopulation model that integrates mark-recapture data and ring density data enabled the estimation of stopover timing, duration, and population size. Yet, this model did not account for heterogeneity in encounter (p) and staying (phi) probabilities. Here we extended the integrated superpopulation model by implementing finite mixtures to account for heterogeneity in p and phi. We used simulations and real data (from 2009-2016) on red knots Calidris canutus, mostly of the subspecies piersmai, staging in Bohai Bay, China, during spring migration to (a) show the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in encounter and staying probabilities to get unbiased estimates of stopover timing, duration, and numbers of migratory birds at staging sites and (b) get accurate stopover parameter estimates for a migratory bird species at a key staging site that is threatened by habitat destruction. Our simulations confirmed that heterogeneity in p affected stopover parameter estimates more than heterogeneity in phi, especially when most birds had low p. Bias was particularly severe when most birds had both low phi and p. Bias was largest for population size, intermediate for stopover duration and negligible for stopover timing. A total of 50,000-100,000 red knots were estimated to annually stop for 5-9 days in Bohai Bay between 10 and 30 May. This shows the key importance of this staging site for this declining species. There were no clear changes in stopover parameters over time, although stopover population size was substantially lower in 2016 than in preceding years. Our study shows the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in both encounter and staying probabilities for accurately estimating stopover duration and population size and provides an appropriate modeling framework.

However, recent studies on captive populations failed to detect this cost. Theoretically, this lack of survival/reproduction trade-off is expected when resources are not limiting, but these studies may have failed to detect the cost, as they may not have fully accounted for potential confounding effects, in particular interindividual heterogeneity. Here, we investigated the effects of current and past reproductive effort on later survival in captive females of a small primate, the gray mouse lemur. Survival analyses showed no cost of reproduction in females; and the pattern was even in the opposite direction: the higher the reproductive effort, the higher the chances of survival until the next reproductive event. These conclusions hold even while accounting for interindividual heterogeneity. In agreement with aforementioned studies on captive vertebrates, these results remind us that reproduction is expected to be traded against body maintenance and the survival prospect only when resources are so limiting that they induce an allocation trade-off. Thus, the cost of reproduction has a major extrinsic component driven by environmental conditions.

Plant invasion alters trait composition and diversity across habitats	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						functional diversity; functional traits; habitat filtering; invasion impact; plant invasion	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; ALIEN PLANTS; HOMOGENIZATION; INVASIVENESS; GROWTH	Increased globalization has accelerated the movement of species around the world. Many of these nonnative species have the potential to profoundly alter ecosystems. The mechanisms underpinning this impact are often poorly understood, and traits are often overlooked when trying to understand and predict the impacts of species invasions on communities. We conducted an observational field experiment in Canada's first National Urban Park, where we collected trait data for seven different functional traits (height, stem width, specific leaf area, leaf percent nitrogen, and leaf percent carbon) across an abundance gradient of the invasive Vincetoxicum rossicum in open meadow and understory habitats. We assessed invasion impacts on communities, and associated mechanisms, by examining three complementary functional trait measures: community-weighted mean, range of trait values, and species' distances to the invader in trait space. We found that V. rossicum invasion significantly altered the functional structure of herbaceous plant communities. In both habitats V. rossicum changed the community-weighted means, causing invaded communities to become increasingly similar in their functional structure. In addition, V. rossicum also reduced the trait ranges for a majority of traits indicating that species are being deterministically excluded in invaded communities. Further, we observed different trends in the meadow and understory habitats: In the understory, resident species that were more similar to V. rossicum in multivariate trait space were excluded more, however this was not the case in the meadow habitat. This suggests that V. rossicum alters communities uniquely in each habitat, in part by creating a filter in which only certain resident species are able to persist. This filtering process causes a nonrandom reduction in species' abundances, which in turn would be expected to alter how the invaded ecosystems function. Using trait-based frameworks leads to better understanding and prediction of invasion impacts. This novel framework can also be used in restoration practices to understand how invasion impacts communities and to reassemble communities after invasive species management.

Invasive species removal increases species and phylogenetic diversity of wetland plant communities	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						biological invasions; ecological restoration; Great Lakes; Typha; wetlands	WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; LAKES COASTAL WETLANDS; GREAT-LAKES; VEGETATION CHANGE; GLAUCA; RICHNESS; IMPACTS; CATTAIL; RESTORATION; GERMINATION	Plant invasions result in biodiversity losses and altered ecological functions, though quantifying loss of multiple ecosystem functions presents a research challenge. Plant phylogenetic diversity correlates with a range of ecosystem functions and can be used as a proxy for ecosystem multifunctionality. Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands are ideal systems for testing invasive species management effects because they support diverse biological communities, provide numerous ecosystem services, and are increasingly dominated by invasive macrophytes. Invasive cattails are among the most widespread and abundant of these taxa. We conducted a three-year study in two Great Lakes wetlands, testing the effects of a gradient of cattail removal intensities (mowing, harvest, complete biomass removal) within two vegetation zones (emergent marsh and wet meadow) on plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. To evaluate native plant recovery potential, we paired this with a seed bank emergence study that quantified diversity metrics in each zone under experimentally manipulated hydroperiods. Pretreatment, we found that wetland zones had distinct plant community composition. Wet meadow seed banks had greater taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity than emergent marsh seed banks, and high-water treatments tended to inhibit diversity by reducing germination. Aboveground harvesting of cattails and their litter increased phylogenetic diversity and species richness in both zones, more than doubling richness compared to unmanipulated controls. In the wet meadow, harvesting shifted the community toward an early successional state, favoring seed bank germination from early seral species, whereas emergent marsh complete removal treatments shifted the community toward an aquatic condition, favoring floating-leaved plants. Removing cattails and their litter increased taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity across water levels, a key environmental gradient, thereby potentially increasing the multifunctionality of these ecosystems. Killing invasive wetland macrophytes but leaving their biomass in situ does not address their underlying mechanism of dominance and is less effective than more intensive treatments that also remove their litter.

Mucuna macrocarpa (Fabaceae) is pollinated by squirrels, flying foxes, and macaques in subtropical and temperate islands. In this study, the pollination system of M. macrocarpa was identified in tropical Asia, where the genus originally diversified. This species requires "explosive opening" of the flower, where the wing petals must be pressed down and the banner petal pushed upward to fully expose the stamens and pistil. A bagging experiment showed that fruits did not develop in inflorescences (n = 66) with unopened flowers, whereas fruits developed in 68.7% of inflorescences (n = 131) with opened flowers. This indicated that the explosive opening is needed for the species to reproduce. Four potential pollinator mammals were identified by a video camera-trap survey, and 78.3% and 60.1% of monitored inflorescences (n = 138) were opened by gray-bellied squirrels (Callosciurus caniceps) and Finlayson's squirrels (C. finlaysonii), respectively, even though more than 10 mammal species visited flowers. Nectar was surrounded by the calyx, and the volume and sugar concentration of secreted nectar did not change during the day. This nectar secretion pattern is similar to those reported by previous studies in other regions. These results showed that the main pollinators of M. macrocarpa in the tropics are squirrels. However, the species' nectar secretion pattern is not specifically adapted to this particular pollinator. Pollinators of M. macrocarpa differ throughout the distribution range based on the fauna present, but there might not have been no distinctive changes in the attractive traits that accompanied these changes in pollinators.

In animals, inducible defenses may manifest as changes in behavior, morphology, physiology, or life history, and prey species can adjust their defensive responses based on the dangerousness of predators. Analogously, prey may also change the composition and quantity of defensive chemicals when they coexist with different predators, but such predator-induced plasticity in chemical defenses remains elusive in vertebrates. In this study, we investigated whether tadpoles of the common toad (Bufo bufo) adjust their chemical defenses to predation risk in general and specifically to the presence of different predator species; furthermore, we assessed the adaptive value of the induced defense. We reared tadpoles in the presence or absence of one of four caged predator species in a mesocosm experiment, analyzed the composition and quantity of their bufadienolide toxins, and exposed them to free-ranging predators. We found that toad tadpoles did not respond to predation risk by upregulating their bufadienolide synthesis. Fishes and newts consumed only a small percentage of toad tadpoles, suggesting that bufadienolides provided protection against vertebrate predators, irrespective of the rearing environment. Backswimmers consumed toad tadpoles regardless of treatment. Dragonfly larvae were the most voracious predators and consumed more predator-naive toad tadpoles than tadpoles raised in the presence of dragonfly cues. These results suggest that tadpoles in our experiment had high enough toxin levels for an effective defense against vertebrate predators even in the absence of predator cues. The lack of predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in bufadienolide synthesis may be due to local adaptation for constantly high chemical defense against fishes in the study population and/or due to the high density of conspecifics.

However, it is uncertain whether these lost ecological functions are consistently maintained throughout continuous forests, and so the importance of these functions in continuous forests remains unknown. Point counts were used to assess both the taxonomic and functional diversity of specialist and generalist birds from sampling in a continuous primary forest compared with forest fragments in order to investigate the responses of these groups to forest fragmentation. We also measured alpha and beta diversity. The responses of specialists and generalists were similar when we assessed all bird species but were different when only passerines were considered. When examining passerines we found lower total taxonomic beta diversity for specialists than for generalists in the continuous forest, while taxonomic beta diversity was higher in the fragmented forest and similar between bird groups. However, total functional beta-diversity values indicated clearly higher trait regularity in continuous forest for specialists and higher trait regularity in fragments for generalists. Specialists showed significantly higher functional alpha diversity in comparison with generalists in the continuous forest, while both groups showed similar values in fragments. In passerines, species richness and alpha functional diversity of both specialist and generalist were explained by forest connectivity; but, only fragment size explained those parameters for specialist passerines. We suggest that considering subsets of the community with high similarity among species, as passerines, provides a better tool for understanding responses to forest fragmentation. Due to the regularity of specialists in continuous forest, their lost could highly affect functionality in forest fragments.

Diverse ecological factors can influence larval resource acquisition, but little is known about how these factors in the larval environment interact to modulate larval development and adult traits. Here, we addressed this gap by considering how key ecological factors of larval density, diet nutritional composition, and microbial growth interact to modulate pupal and adult traits in a polyphagous tephritid fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (aka "Queensland fruit fly"). Larvae were allowed to develop at two larval densities (low and high), on diets that were protein-rich, standard, or sugar-rich and prepared with or without preservatives to inhibit or encourage microbial growth, respectively. Percentage of adult emergence and adult sex ratio were not affected by the interaction between diet composition, larval density, and preservative treatments, although low preservative content increased adult emergence in sugar-rich diets but decreased adult emergence in protein-rich and standard diets. Pupal weight, male and female adult dry weight, and female (but not male) body energetic reserves were affected by a strong three-way interaction between diet composition, larval density, and preservative treatment, whereby in general, low preservative content increased pupal weight and female lipid storage in sugar-rich diets particularly at low-larval density and differentially modulated the decrease in adult body weight caused by larval density across diets. Our findings provide insights into the ecological factors modulating larval development of a polyphagous fly species and shed light into the ecological complexity of the larval developmental environment in frugivorous insects.

However, due to human activities and natural factors, the habitat of Poyang Lake has been seriously degraded, resulting in a decline in macrozoobenthos biodiversity. Here, we analyzed the effect of human activity and environmental elements change on the diversity of macrozoobenthos based on a systematic investigation of Poyang Lake Basin in 2016-2017. The current species richness, density, and biomass of macrozoobenthos were lower than those in the historical period. At the same time, the community structure of the macrozoobenthos assemblage exhibits significant temporal and spatial differences. In addition, the spatial turnover component was the main contribution to beta diversity, which indicated that a number of protected areas would be necessary to conserve the biodiversity of macrozoobenthos. Water depth, dissolved oxygen, water velocity, and chlorophyll-a were significantly correlated with macrozoobenthos distributions and assemblage structure based on RDA. These results indicated that human activities have seriously destroyed the macrozoobenthos habitat and led to the decline in macrozoobenthos diversity. Therefore, habitat restoration and the conservation of macrozoobenthos have become urgent in Poyang Lake Basin, and an integrated management plan should be developed and effectively implemented.

Here, age- and sex-related telomere lengths in male and female captive Siamese cobras (Naja kaouthia) were investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction based on cross-sectional data. A negative correlation was shown between telomere length and body size in males but not in females. Age-related sex differences were also recorded. Juvenile female snakes have shorter telomeres relative to males at up to 5 years of age, while body size also rapidly increases during this period. This suggests that an accelerated increase in telomere length of female cobra results from sex hormone stimulation to telomerase activity, reflecting sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits. This might also result from amplification of telomeric repeats on sex chromosomes. By contrast, female Siamese cobras older than 5 years had longer telomeres than males. Diverse sex hormone levels and oxidative stress parameters between sexes may affect telomere length.

Non-trophic impacts from white sharks complicate population recovery for sea otters	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						community structure; complex interactions; nonconsumptive effects; prey mistargeting; protected species	CARCHARODON-CARCHARIAS; KELP FORESTS; CONSERVATION; MORTALITY; MIGRATION; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH; RESILIENCE; ABUNDANCE; ISLAND	Complex interactions between protected populations may challenge the recovery of whole ecosystems. In California, white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) mistargeting southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) are an emergent impact to sea otter recovery, inhibiting the broader ecosystem restoration sea otters might provide. Here, we integrate and analyze tracking and stranding data to compare the phenology of interactions between white sharks and their targeted prey (elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris) with those of mistargeted prey (sea otters, humans). Pronounced seasonal peaks in shark bites to otters and humans overlap in the late boreal summer, immediately before the annual adult white shark migration to elephant seal rookeries. From 1997 to 2017, the seasonal period when sharks bite otters expanded from 2 to 8 months of the year and occurred primarily in regions where kelp cover declined. Immature and male otters, demographics most associated with range expansion, were disproportionately impacted. While sea otters are understood to play a keystone role in kelp forests, recent ecosystem shifts are revealing unprecedented bottom-up and top-down interactions. Such shifts challenge ecosystem management programs that rely on static models of species interactions.

Invertebrate biodiversity in cold groundwater fissures in Iceland	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						biofilm; macrozoobenthos; species assemblages; spring; substrate	WATER; COMMUNITIES; SPRINGS; ECOSYSTEMS; DISCHARGE; FAUNA; LAKES	Iceland has an abundance of fissures that are parallel to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where bedrock cracks as a result of continental rifting. Some fissures penetrate the aquifer and expose the groundwater within the bedrock, becoming springs. As such, groundwater fissures have uniform and constant physical and chemical environment but they can differ greatly in morphology. In addition, there is often great variation in depth within fissures and substrate types contrast between vertical rock wall and more heterogenous horizontal bottom. The variation in morphological environment may create dissimilar habitats with unique characteristics and/or influence distribution of resources. Our objective was to study macrozoobenthos communities in cold groundwater fissures in Iceland in relation to physical habitat by comparing invertebrate diversity and density both between fissures with different morphological characteristics as well as between substrate types and depths within fissures. Samples were collected in two fissures in SW Iceland, Silfra and Flosagja. Assemblages were similar between fissures except for higher densities of cladocerans in Flosagja fissure. Within fissures, there was significant difference in Shannon diversity between substrate types in Flosagja, and ostracods were found in significantly higher densities on the bottom. The distribution of all other taxa groups was homogenous in both fissures regardless of depth gradient and substrate. Invertebrates were found to be living within and around a biofilm that covered the entire substrate. These biofilm mats are made from Cyanobacteria and benthic diatoms, which are successful under low light conditions and may minimize any effect of the heterogeneous habitat creating a uniform and suitable microhabitat for invertebrates regardless of depth and substrate type.

Replanting of first-cycle oil palm results in a second wave of biodiversity loss	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						agriculture; belowground; ecosystem function; invertebrate; Macrofauna; soil; sustainability	SOIL BIODIVERSITY; LAND-USE; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; HETEROGENEITY; ABUNDANCE; EROSION; FOREST; BIOTA; AGRICULTURE	Conversion of forest to oil palm plantations results in a significant loss of biodiversity. Despite this, first-cycle oil palm plantations can sustain relatively high biodiversity compared to other crops. However, the long-term effects of oil palm agriculture on flora and fauna are unknown. Oil palm has a 25-year commercial lifespan before it must be replanted, due to reduced productivity and difficulty of harvesting. Loss of the complex vegetation structure of oil palm plantations during the replanting process will likely have impacts on the ecosystem at a local and landscape scale. However, the effect of replanting on biodiversity is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of replanting oil palm on soil macrofauna communities. We assessed ordinal richness, abundance, and community composition of soil macrofauna in first- (25- to 27-year-old) and second-cycle oil palm (freshly cleared, 1-year-old, 3-year-old, and 7-year-old mature). Macrofauna abundance and richness drastically declined immediately after replanting. Macrofauna richness showed some recovery 7 years after replanting, but was still 19% lower than first-cycle oil palm. Macrofauna abundance recovered to similar levels to that of first-cycle oil palm plantations, 1 year after replanting. This was mainly due to high ant abundance, possibly due to the increased understory vegetation as herbicides are not used at this age. However, there were subsequent declines in macrofauna abundance 3 and 7 years after replanting, resulting in a 59% drop in macrofauna abundance compared to first-cycle levels. Furthermore, soil macrofauna community composition in all ages of second-cycle oil palm was different to first-cycle plantations, with decomposers suffering particular declines. After considerable biodiversity loss due to forest conversion for oil palm, belowground invertebrate communities suffer a second wave of biodiversity loss due to replanting. This is likely to have serious implications for soil invertebrate diversity and agricultural sustainability in oil palm landscapes, due to the vital ecosystem functions that soil macrofauna provide.

However, little is known about the strength and direction of fisheries-induced selection acting on multiple traits in the wild. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to directly monitor individual behavior and fate in an intensively harvested species, the European lobster (Homarus gammarus, n = 100), in southern Norway. Overall, 24% of the tracked lobsters survived the two-month harvest season within the study area. Our results indicated that local survival was not random with respect to phenotype. We found no clear support for fisheries-induced selection acting directly on body size. However, lobsters with large crusher claws relative to their body size, typical of socially dominant individuals, appeared at higher risk of being captured in the conventional trap fishery. We also detected a fine-scale spatial gradient in survival. After accounting for this gradient, individuals displaying larger home ranges were more likely to survive the harvest season. Finally, we found significant repeatabilities for lobster behavior on a monthly timescale, indicating that individual behavioral attributes tended to persist and may reflect personality. Our study therefore provides empirical support for the need to consider an evolutionary enlightened approach to fisheries management that considers the influence of harvest on multiple traits of target species.

Location Denmark, Senegal and Ghana. Methods We use radio tracking to study spatial behavior and habitat use in three morphologically and ecologically similar and closely related Phylloscopus species on their widely separated breeding and wintering distributions. During wintering and breeding, willow warblers P. trochilus (winter: n = 9, breeding: n = 13), chiffchaffs P. collybita (n = 11, n = 7), and wood warblers P. sibilatrix (n = 17, n = 14) were tracked. Results Willow warblers P. trochilus increased home range sizes in winter, whereas it was similar in chiffchaffs P. collybita and wood warblers P. sibilatrix, in both seasons. Home ranges overlapped more in winter than in the breeding season. In winter, home range overlap was similar among species but larger overlap during breeding was indicated for willow warblers. Tree cover was unrelated to home range size but significantly higher in breeding than in winter in all species. However, whereas willow warblers and wood warblers maintained some degree of tall tree cover inside their home ranges in winter, chiffchaffs changed from more than 80% to <1% tree cover, indicating a niche shift. Main conclusions Individuals of all three species showed changes between breeding and wintering areas in spatial behavior and habitat availability, with larger overlap in winter. The differences in patterns were potentially related to being generalist (willow warbler) or specialist (chiffchaff and wood warbler). These ecological relationships are important for the conservation of migrants and for understanding the link between breeding and wintering distributions and ecology.

A general prediction is that pre-/postmeiotic aging processes will lead to a decline in the pre- and postcopulatory abilities of both males and females. However, in as much the sexes have different strategies to optimize their fitness, the decline of reproductive success late in life can be modulated by social context, such as sex ratio, in a sex-specific manner. In this study, we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether sex ratio at mating modulates age effects on male and female reproductive success. As expected, male and female age caused a decrease in reproductive success across male-biased and female-biased social contexts but, contrary to previous findings, social context did not modulate age-related fitness decline in either of the two sexes. We discuss these results in the light of how sex ratio might modulate pre-/postcopulatory abilities and the opportunity for inter- and intrasexual competition in D. melanogaster, and generally suggest that social context effects on these processes are likely to be species specific.

I used 1,375 surveys of insects killed on car windscreens as a measure of insect abundance during 1997-2017 at two transects in Denmark. I cross-validated this method against three other methods for sampling insect abundance, and I investigated the effects of this measure of insect abundance on the abundance of breeding insectivorous birds. The abundance of flying insects was quantified using a windscreen resulting in reductions of 80% and 97% at two transects of 1.2 km and 25 km, respectively, according to general additive mixed model. Insect abundance increased with time of day, temperature, and June date, but decreased with wind resulting in a reduction by 54%. The abundance of insects killed on a car windscreen was strongly positively correlated with the abundance of insects caught in sweep nets and on sticky plates in the same study areas and at the same time as when insects were sampled using windscreens. The decline in abundance of insects on windscreens predicted the rate at which barn swallows Hirundo rustica fed their nestlings, even when controlling statistically for time of day, weather, and age and number of nestlings. The abundance of breeding pairs of three species of aerially insectivorous birds was positively correlated with the abundance of insects killed on windscreens at the same time in the same study area. This suggests a link between two trophic levels as affected by the temporal reduction in the abundance of flying insects. These findings are consistent with recent dramatic declines in insect abundance in Europe and North America with consequences for the rate of food provisioning of barn swallow offspring, the abundance of aerially insectivorous birds and bottom-up trophic cascades.

Environmental factors affect the distribution of two Epichloe fungal endophyte species inhabiting a common host grove bluegrass (Poa alsodes)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						ecological factors; endophyte distributions; endophyte-host compatibility; grass populations; host plant growth; infection benefits; southeastern North America	LOLIUM-PERENNE GENOTYPES; NATIVE GRASS; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; MEADOW FESCUE; TALL FESCUE; COOL-SEASON; SYMBIOSIS; INFECTION; HYBRID; TRANSMISSION	Aim The endophyte Epichloe alsodes, with known insecticidal properties, is found in a majority of Poa alsodes populations across a latitudinal gradient from North Carolina to New York. A second endophyte, E. schardlii var. pennsylvanica, with known insect-deterring effects, is limited to a few populations in Pennsylvania. We explored whether such disparate differences in distributions could be explained by selection from biotic and abiotic environmental factors. Location Along the Appalachian Mountains from North Carolina to New York, USA. Taxon Fungi. Methods Studied correlations of infection frequencies with abiotic and biotic environmental factors. Checked endophyte vertical transmission rates and effects on overwintering survival. With artificial inoculations for two host populations with two isolates per endophyte species, tested endophyte-host compatibility. Studied effects of isolates on host performances in greenhouse experiment with four water-nutrients treatments. Results Correlation analysis revealed positive associations of E. alsodes frequency with July Max temperatures, July precipitation, and soil nitrogen and phosphorous and negative associations with insect damage and soil magnesium and potassium. Plants infected with E. alsodes had increased overwintering survival compared to plants infected with E. schardlii or uninfected (E-) plants. Artificial inoculations indicated that E. alsodes had better compatibility with a variety of host genotypes than did E. schardlii. The experiment with reciprocally inoculated plants grown under different treatments revealed a complexity of interactions among hosts, endophyte species, isolate within species, host plant origin, and environmental factors. Neither of the endophyte species increased plant biomass, but some of the isolates within each species had other effects on plant growth such as increased root:shoot ratio, number of tillers, and changes in plant height that might affect host fitness. Main conclusion In the absence of clear and consistent effects of the endophytes on host growth, the differences in endophyte-mediated protection against herbivores may be the key factor determining distribution differences of the two endophyte species.

The consequent loss of natural and seminatural orchid habitats leads to the appreciation of small anthropogenic habitats, such as cemeteries and roadside verges. Colonization of cemeteries and roadside verges by orchids has long been known, but no study to date compared the suitability of these two anthropogenic habitats for orchids. Therefore, in this paper our aim was to survey cemeteries and roadside verges and to compare these two habitats regarding their role in conserving Mediterranean terrestrial orchids. We conducted field surveys in three Mediterranean islands, Cyprus, Crete, and Lesbos, where both cemeteries and roadside verges were sampled on a geographically representative scale. We found a total of almost 7,000 orchid individuals, belonging to 77 species in the two anthropogenic habitat types. Roadside verges hosted significantly more individuals than cemeteries in Crete and Lesbos, and significantly more species across all three islands. Our results suggest that although cemeteries have a great potential conservation value in other parts of the world, intensive maintenance practices that characterized cemeteries in these three islands renders them unable to sustain valuable plant communities. On the other hand, roadside verges play a prominent role in the conservation of Mediterranean orchids in Cyprus and Greece. The pioneer status of roadside verges facilitates their fast colonization, while roads serve as ecological corridors in fragmented landscapes.

In this study, we evaluated the genetic consequences of large-scale translocation of cleaner wrasses that has become a common practice within the salmon aquaculture industry in northern Europe to combat sea lice infestation. A major concern with this practice is the potential for hybridization of escaped organisms with the local, recipient wrasse population, and thus potentially introduce exogenous alleles and breaking down coadapted gene complexes in local populations. We investigated the potential threat for such genetic introgressions in a large seminatural mesocosm basin. The experimental setting represented a simulated translocation of corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) that occurs on a large scale in the Norwegian salmon industry. Parentage assignment analysis of mesocosm's offspring revealed 30% (195 out of 651 offspring) interbreeding between the two populations, despite their being genetically (F-ST = 0.094, p < 0.05) and phenotypically differentiated. Moreover, our results suggest that reproductive fitness of the translocated western population doubled that of the local southern population. Our results confirm that human translocations may overcome the impediments imposed by natural habitat discontinuities and urge for immediate action to manage the genetic resources of these small benthic wrasses.

Fungi constitute an important component of soil microorganism communities. They play an important role in biodiversity maintenance, community assembly, and ecosystem functioning, and differ from many macroorganisms in many traits. Here, we examined soil fungal communities in Chinese temperate, subtropical, and tropic forests using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region. The relative effect of late Quaternary climate change and contemporary environment (plant, soil, current climate, and geographic distance) on the soil fungal community was analyzed. The richness of the total fungal community, along with saprotrophic, ectomycorrhizal (EM), and pathogenic fungal communities, was influenced primarily by the contemporary environment (plant and/or soil) but not by late Quaternary climate change. Late Quaternary climate change acted in concert with the contemporary environment to shape total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal community compositions and with a stronger effect in temperate forest than in tropic-subtropical forest ecosystems. Some contemporary environmental factors influencing total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungal communities in temperate and tropic-subtropical forests were different. We demonstrate that late Quaternary climate change can help to explain current soil fungal community composition and argue that climatic legacies can help to predict soil fungal responses to climate change.

However, most data are derived from antibiotic-treated or germ-free laboratory mammals. Furthermore, few studies have explored how microbial colonization during critical windows influences a suite of other fitness-related traits in wild animals. This study tested whether hatching constitutes a critical developmental window for gut microbiome colonization in wild-caught amphibians and whether perturbations to gut microbiota at hatching shape fitness-related traits of larval growth, metabolism, metamorphosis and disease susceptibility. We sterilized wood frog eggs and then inoculated them with microbes from differing sources, including from another species (bullfrogs) that differ in disease resistance and life history. We measured development, growth and metabolic rates through metamorphosis among individuals from each microbial treatment. A separate group was exposed to an LD50 dose of ranavirus-an emerging disease-to test for microbiome effects on disease susceptibility. We also quantified rates of deformities to test for microbial treatment effects on overall health. Manipulation of microbiota on eggs altered the trajectory of gut microbiome communities across larval ontogeny, though disruption appeared to be transitory. While microbiome structure converged among the treatments by metamorphosis, the effects of disruption on host phenotypes persisted. Larvae inoculated with the bullfrog gut microbiota exhibited accelerated growth and development rates compared to controls. By contrast, sterilized larvae maintained in sterile water for several days after hatching exhibited greater disruption to their gut microbiota across ontogeny, as well as altered metabolism, more tail deformities, and were more likely to die when exposed to an LD50 dose of ranavirus compared to the other treatments. These results suggest perturbations to the microbiota during critical developmental windows can alter the trajectory of the gut microbiome, and have long-term effects on fitness-related traits in larval amphibians. These results suggest that explicit tests of how changes in the composition and abundance of the microbial community shape phenotypes across ontogeny in amphibians could shed light on host-microbe interactions in wildlife, as well as inform conservation efforts to mitigate emerging diseases.

Thus, ecologists are often interested in estimating correlations between entire suites of correlated traits, or biomarkers, but sample size limitations often do not allow us to do this properly when large numbers of traits or biomarkers are considered. Latent variables are a powerful tool to overcome this complexity. Recent statistical advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models-multivariate hierarchical modelling (MHM) with latent variables-which allow to statistically estimate unstructured covariances/correlations among traits with reduced constraints on the number of degrees of freedom to account in the model. It is thus possible to highlight correlated structures in potentially very large numbers of traits. Here, we apply MHM to evaluate the relative importance of individual differences and environmental effects on milk composition and identify the drivers of this variation. We ask whether variation in bighorn sheep milk affects offspring fitness. We evaluate whether mothers show repeatable individual differences in the concentrations of 11 markers of milk composition, and we investigate the relative importance of annual variability, maternal identity and morphological traits in structuring milk composition. We then use variance estimates to investigate how a subset of repeatable milk markers influence lamb summer survival. Repeatability of milk markers ranged from 0.05 to 0.64 after accounting for year-to-year variations. Milk composition was weakly but significantly associated with maternal mass in June and September, summer mass gain and winter mass loss. Variation explained by year-to-year fluctuations ranged from 0.07 to 0.91 suggesting a strong influence of environmental variability on milk composition. Milk composition did not affect lamb survival to weaning. Using joint models in ecological, physiological or behavioural contexts has the major advantage of decomposing a (co)variance/correlation matrix while being estimated with fewer parameters than in a "traditional" mixed-effects model. The joint models presented here complement a growing list of tools to analyse correlations at different hierarchical levels separately and may thus represent a partial solution to the conundrum of physiological complexity.

Effects of increasing aridity and chronic anthropogenic disturbance on seed dispersal by ants in Brazilian Caatinga	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						ant-plant mutualism; biotic interactions; climate change; human disturbance; seasonally dry tropical forest	BODY-SIZE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL CHANGE; RAIN-FOREST; PLANT; REMOVAL; PREFERENCES; PATTERNS; SPECIALIZATION; MYRMECOCHORY	Anthropogenic disturbance and climate change are the main drivers of biodiversity loss and ecological services around the globe. There is concern that climate change will exacerbate the impacts of disturbance and thereby promote biotic homogenization, but its consequences for ecological services are unknown. We investigated the individual and interactive effects of increasing chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) and aridity on seed dispersal services provided by ants in Caatinga vegetation of north-eastern Brazil. The study was conducted in Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, Brazil. Within an area of 214 km(2), we established nineteen 50 x 20 m plots that encompassed gradients of both CAD and aridity. We offered diaspores of six plant species, three myrmecochorous diaspores and three fleshy fruits that are secondarily dispersed by ants. We then quantified the number of interactions, seed removal rate and dispersal distances, and noted the identities of interacting ant species. Finally, we used pitfall trap data to quantify the abundances of ant disperser species in each plot. Our results show that overall composition of ant disperser species varied along the gradients of CAD and aridity, but the composition of high-quality dispersers varied only with aridity. The total number of interactions, rates of removal and mean distance of removal all declined with increasing aridity, but they were not related to CAD. These same patterns were found when considering only high-quality disperser species, driven by the responses of the dominant disperser Dinoponera quadriceps. We found little evidence of interactive effects of CAD and aridity on seed dispersal services by ants. Our study indicates that CAD and aridity act independently on ant-mediated seed dispersal services in Caatinga, such that the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance are unlikely to change under the forecast climate of increased aridity. However, our findings highlight the vulnerability of seed dispersal services provided by ants in Caatinga under an increasingly arid climate due to low functional redundancy in high-quality disperser species. Given the large number of plant species dependent on ants for seed dispersal, this has important implications for future plant recruitment and, consequently, for the composition of Caatinga plant communities.

Extinctions typically occur after a certain delay, and understanding the mechanisms causing delays is a key challenge for both fundamental and applied perspectives. Here, we make use of natural experiments, the isolation of lakes by land uplift in Northern Scandinavia, to examine how yearly extinction rates are affected by time since isolation and a range of abiotic and biotic factors. In this aim, we adapted a model of delayed species loss within isolated communities to test the effects of time since isolation, area, pH, depth and the presence/absence of piscivores on extinction rates. As expected, we found that small and/or young lakes experience a higher annual rate of extinctions per species than larger and/or older ones. Compared to previous studies that were conducted for either young (few thousand years ago) or very old (>10,000 years ago) isolates, we demonstrated over a large and continuous temporal scales (50-5,000 years), similar relationship between extinction rates and age. We also show that extinction rates are modified by local environmental factors such as a strong negative effect of increasing pH. Our results urge for the need to consider the time since critical environmental changes occurred when studying extinction rates. In a wider perspective, our study demonstrates the need to consider extinction debts when modelling future effects of climate change, land-use changes or biological invasions on biodiversity.

The influence of logging on vertebrate responses to mast fruiting	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Borneo; camera trap; dipterocarp; logging; mast fruiting; plant-animal interactions; resource pulse; tropical forest	SEED PREDATION; PULSED RESOURCES; FOREST STRUCTURE; TROPICAL FOREST; TREE DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; SABAH	Periods of extreme food abundance, such as irregular masting events, can dramatically affect animal populations and communities, but the extent to which anthropogenic disturbances alter animal responses to mast events is not clear. In South-East Asia, dipterocarp trees reproduce in mast fruiting events every 2-10 years in some of the largest masting events on the planet. These trees, however, are targeted for selective logging, reducing the intensity of fruit production and potentially affecting multiple trophic levels. Moreover, animal responses to resource pulse events have largely been studied in systems where the major mast consumers have been extirpated. We sought to evaluate the influence of human-induced habitat disturbance on animal responses to masting in a system where key mast consumers remain extant. We used motion-triggered camera traps to quantify terrestrial mammal and bird occurrences in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, relative to variation in fruit biomass from 69 plant families during a major (2014) and minor (2015) masting event and a non-mast year (2013), in both logged and unlogged forests. Bearded pigs (Sus barbatus) showed the clearest responses to masting and occurrence rates were highest in unlogged forest in the year following the major mast, suggesting that the pulse in fruit availability increased immigration or reproduction. We also detected local-scale spatial tracking of dipterocarp fruits in bearded pigs in unlogged forest, while this was equivocal in other species. In contrast, pigs and other vertebrate taxa in our study showed limited response to spatial or temporal variation in fruit availability in logged forest. Our findings suggest that vertebrates, namely bearded pigs, may respond to masting via movement and increased reproduction, but that these responses may be attenuated by habitat disturbance.

Despite management actions, many populations show a limited capacity to recover. This may be attributed to reversal of predator-prey roles, yet empirical evidence to that effect remains scarce. Here, we combine field and laboratory studies to investigate the interaction between pike (Esox lucius), a large keystone top predatory fish, and the small-bodied mesopredatory threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in the Baltic Sea where pike populations have declined. Our data suggest that stickleback predation on pike larvae depletes a large proportion of the recruitment and influences the size distribution through size-selective predation, which is corroborated by a gape-limitation experiment and diet analysis of wild-captured sticklebacks. The effects of stickleback predation are present across several populations and years, and our data suggest that early arrival of sticklebacks has stronger effects on juvenile pike survival. Finally, we use data on pike gape-limitation and the size distribution of sticklebacks to illustrate the process of role reversal. These findings suggest that mesopredator behaviour can reduce recruitment of a top predator species and impair the capacity of populations to recover. This emphasizes predator-prey role reversal as an important ecological and evolutionary driver that influences the outcome of restoration and management actions.

Identification of critical habitats, such as foraging grounds in highly human-impacted areas, is essential to species conservation. Therefore, understanding the variables that influence a species' foraging behaviour is important for their conservation, especially for long-lived mammals such as cetaceans. The aims of this study were (a) to identify and quantify the environmental and anthropogenic drivers of wild bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) foraging behaviour, and (b) to investigate whether the shellfish farming industry influences the behaviour of this species. Behavioural observations were conducted along the north-western coast of Spain, an area affected by intensive human activities, particularly the shellfish aquaculture industry. A multi-modelling approach highlighted the importance of shellfish farm areas as a foraging ground for bottlenose dolphins. Dolphins were predicted to be more likely found foraging inside shellfish farm areas than outside (57% vs. 43%). Variability in bottlenose dolphin behaviour is likely a result of the interactions of environmental and anthropogenic drivers with prey availability and the physiological needs of the dolphins. Although shellfish farm areas provide high prey density for dolphins, they can also pose threats in a number of ways (i.e. collisions with vessels, entanglement with ropes, habitat loss, noise and water pollution). From a conservation perspective, aquaculture management should consider the presence of dolphins foraging and minimize the associated risks that this industry may pose to these coastal cetaceans.

Aquatic turtles that are heavily dependent on basking in sunlight to maintain an optimal body temperature may abandon basking perches because they perceive humans as potential predators. The impact of boat traffic, the availability of basking structures, and various environmental factors on the basking behaviour of the ringed sawback turtle (Graptemys oculifera) was assessed at two sites on the Pearl River, Mississippi, USA. This information was used to model the likely effects of human disturbance on the body temperature of large female turtles. Both the duration of basking and the percentage of turtles in a basking group that abandoned their basking perch were influenced by the availability of alternative basking sites, frequency of boat traffic, boat speed enforcement zones ('wake' or 'no wake'), boat type, air temperature, weather conditions, and Julian day. A simulation model of anthropogenically disturbed and undisturbed adult female ringed sawbacks showed that disturbance probably decreases the mean daily body temperature, especially at higher disturbance probabilities and in May, when the air temperature is low. Management recommendations are provided that minimize the adverse effects of unintentional human disturbance of the ringed sawback to enable more effective conservation of this endangered, endemic species. Such methods are likely to be useful elsewhere as recreational disturbance becomes a greater conservation issue worldwide.

Provenance of drinking water revealed through compliance sampling	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS			English	Article							TAP WATER; NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS; PHOSPHORUS; CHEMISTRY; QUALITY; ENGLAND; TRENDS; THMS	Understanding drinking water hydrochemistry is essential for maintaining safe drinking water supplies. Whilst targeted research surveys have characterised drinking water hydrochemistry, vast compliance datasets are routinely collected but are not interrogated amidst concerns regarding the impact of mixed water sources, treatment, the distribution network and customer pipework. In this paper, we examine whether compliance samples retain hydrochemical signatures of their provenance. We first created and subsequently undertook the first hydrochemical analysis of a novel national database of publically available drinking water compliance analyses (n = 3 873 941) reported for 2015 across England and Wales. k-means cluster analysis revealed three spatially coherent clusters. Cluster 1 is dominated by groundwater sources, with high nitrate concentrations and mineralisation, and lower organic carbon, residual chlorine and THM formation. Cluster 2 was dominated by surface water sources and characterised by low mineralisation (low conductivity and major ion concentrations), low nitrate and high organic carbon concentrations (and hence residual chlorine and THM formation). Cluster 3 shows a mixture of groundwater overlain by confining layers and superficial deposits (resulting in higher trace metal concentrations and mineralisation) and surface water sources. These analyses demonstrate that, despite extensive processing of drinking water, at the national scale signatures of the provenance of drinking water remain. Analysis of compliance samples is therefore likely to be a helpful tool in the characterisation of processes that may affect drinking water chemistry. The methodology used is generic and can be applied in any area where drinking water chemistry samples are taken.

Methods: We undertook theoretical analysis of the problem in the context of a continuous response caused by cumulative exposure, when duration and intensity of exposure follow log-normal distributions, such that analysis by linear regression is natural. We present a Bayesian method to adjust duration-only analysis to incorporate partial knowledge about the relationship between duration and intensity of exposure and illustrate this method in the context of association of smoking and lung function. Results: We derive equations that (a) describe under what circumstances bias arises when duration of exposure is used as a proxy of cumulative exposure, (b) quantify the degree of such bias and loss of precision, and (c) describe how knowledge about relationship of duration and intensity of exposure can be used to recover an estimate of the effect of cumulative exposure when only duration was observed on every subject. Conclusions: Under our assumptions, when duration and intensity of exposure are either independent or positively correlated, we can be more confident in qualitatively interpreting the direction of effects that arise from use of duration of exposure per se. We can use external information on the relationship between duration and intensity of exposure (namely: correlation and variance of intensity), even if intensity of exposure is not available at the individual level, to make reliable inferences about the magnitude of effect of cumulative exposure on the outcome.

The study covered a group of 40 handball players (age: 24.02 +/- 3.99), while 50 non-training men (age: 22.90 +/- 1.13) formed the control group. Studies were performed using Test2Drive computer tests. The following four tests were used for measuring psychomotor fitness: simple reaction time test, choice reaction time test, hand-eye coordination test and spatial anticipation test. An analysis revealed that handball players had better reaction times and movement times than the control group. The league, position on the court, training seniority and the dominant upper limb were analysed for their impact on the reaction time and movement time in handball players. An analysis of psychomotor abilities of handball players with regard to the league revealed that in the majority of tests the Superliga players had a shorter reaction time than players in lower leagues.

Methods: National death records from 1993 to 2016 of the Korea National Statistical Office (KNSO) were used. Suicidal death was taken from Korean Classification of Disease codes as intentional self-harm (X60-X84) and sequelae of intentional self-harm (Y870). Occupational groups were categorized into Manager, Officer, Service-Trade, Agricultural-Fishery-Forestry (AFF), Skilled Manual, and Unskilled Manual. Direct standardized mortality (DSM) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. Overall, suicide rates increased during economic downturns, especially among lower socio-economic occupation classes. Both DSM and SMR were highest in AFF, followed by Unskilled Manual, Service-Trade, Officer, Skilled Manual, and Manager categories among men, whereas women showed the highest DSM and SMR in AFF, followed by Service-Trade, Officer, Unskilled Manual, Manager, and Skilled Manual categories. The age-stratified analysis showed that age groups with increasing trends in suicide differed according to occupation and gender. In certain occupational groups, the time-point prevalence fluctuated with socio-economic background in suicidal mortality and differed by age and gender.

Concentrations of potential respiratory electron acceptors were highest in surface water and riverbed porewater and sequentially depleted in porewaters along the inferred flowpath (O-2, then NO3-, then SO42-). Correspondingly, cultivable nitrate reducers/denitrifiers were most abundant in surface water and riverbed porewater, despite oxic conditions. Cultivable sulfate reducers were overall most abundant in surface water. Prokaryotic community reconstruction from 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that the surface water community was less diverse than that of porewater and supports a shift in metabolic strategy, from aerobic heterotrophy in surface water (e.g., Comamonadaceae and Sporichthyaceae) to chemolithotrophy and anaerobic metabolisms (e.g., Hydrogenophaga spp., Ferribacterium spp., Methanobacterium spp.) along the hyporheic flow path. These data indicate that prokaryotic communities within the MRCB are phylogenetically and metabolically diverse and contribute to biogeochemical cycling in this common yet relatively understudied habitat.

Jointly estimating survival and mortality: integrating recapture and recovery data from complex multiple predator systems	ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Capture-recapture-recovery; Hierarchical Bayesian; Population dynamics; State-space models	INDIVIDUAL FISH CHARACTERISTICS; COLUMBIA RIVER ESTUARY; JUVENILE SALMONIDS; AVIAN PREDATION; CHINOOK SALMON; LOWER SNAKE; TRANSPONDERS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; VULNERABILITY; STEELHEAD	Identifying where, when, and how many animals live and die over time is principal to understanding factors that influence population dynamics. Capture-recapture-recovery (CRR) models are widely used to estimate animal survival and, in many cases, quantify specific causes of mortality (e.g., harvest, predation, starvation). However, the restrictive CRR framework can inhibit the consideration and inclusion of some types of recovery data. We developed an extension to the CRR framework to allow for the incorporation of recoveries from indeterminate temporal or spatial origin. This model jointly estimates cause-specific mortality and survival probabilities across multiple spatial and temporal scales, while accounting for differences in mortality-specific reporting and recovery rates. We fitted the model to data on a group of juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) marked with passive integrated transponder tags in the Columbia River basin, USA. Following tagging and release, fish were detected alive at up to six downstream locations and/or recovered dead on one of nine bird colonies during seaward migration. We estimated that, in aggregate, avian predators consumed 31% of juvenile steelhead during outmigration to the ocean (95% CRI: [27, 36]). Colony-specific predation rates ranged from<1 to 14% among river reaches, with avian predation accounting for>95% of all steelhead mortality within some reaches. This integrated modelling approach provides a flexible framework to integrate multiple recapture and recovery data sources, providing a more holistic understanding of animal life history, including direct comparisons of cause-specific mortality factors and the cumulative impact of multiple mortality factors across time or space.

The proposed model is a combination of the Lomax and generalized Weibull distributions based on an exponent odd function. Main properties of the distribution are obtained, such as shapes of the probability density and hazard rate functions, quantile function, asymptotic distribution, information matrix and characterization via hazard rate function. Parameters are estimated via the maximum likelihood estimation method. Four data sets are used to compare the proposed model with a number of well-known hydrologic models. The proposed model is found to be suitable and representative for heavy-tailed hydrological data sets, with least loss of information attitude and a realistic return period.

Propidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMA-qPCR) is one of the promising methods for timely detection of VBNC pathogens in environmental samples. We developed and used a method for the first time to detection of VBNC P. aeruginosa in swimming pool water samples using a membrane filter (MF). Moreover, the dominant model of the distribution of colonies on the MF and the effect of the culture medium and MF type on colony recovery by MF were evaluated. Swimming pool samples were subjected to conventional culture-based, qPCR and PMA-qPCR methods and the results were compared for the presence of VBNC P. aeruginosa in the samples. The positivity rate was 21% and 75% for P. aeruginosa in water samples as confirmed by standard culture-based and qPCR methods, respectively. Furthermore, of 24 samples, 9 (37.5%) were positive for VBNC P. aeruginosa. The developed qPCR/PMA-qPCR assay can detect the VBNC bacteria directly from aquatic samples and may result in better monitoring of recreational waters.

We found that both within and across Atlantic Forest bird species, populations are more sensitive to deforestation when near their range edge. In fact, the negative effects of deforestation on bird occurrences switched to positive in the range core (>829 km), in line with Ellenberg's rule. We show that the proportion of populations at their range core and edge varies across Brazil, suggesting deforestation effects on communities, and hence the most appropriate conservation action, also vary geographically.

Effects of warming climate and competition in the ocean for life-histories of Pacific salmon	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							SOCKEYE-SALMON; PINK SALMON; ONCORHYNCHUS SPP.; RAPID EVOLUTION; GROWTH; IMPACTS; ZOOPLANKTON; MATURATION; MANAGEMENT; STRESSORS	The life-histories of exploited fish species, such as Pacific salmon, are vulnerable to a wide variety of anthropogenic stressors including climate change, selective exploitation and competition with hatchery releases for finite foraging resources. However, these stressors may generate unexpected changes in life-histories due to developmental linkages when species complete their migratory life cycle in different habitats. We used multivariate time-series models to quantify changes in the prevalence of different life-history strategies of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska, over the past half-century-specifically, how they partition their lives between freshwater habitats and the ocean. Climate warming has decreased the time spent by salmon in their natal freshwater habitat, as climate-enhanced growth opportunities have enabled earlier migration to the ocean. Migration from freshwater at a younger age, and increasing competition from wild and hatchery-released salmon, have tended to delay maturation toward the salmon spending an additional year feeding in the ocean. Models evaluating the effects of size-selective fishing on these patterns had only small support. These stressors combine to reduce the size-at-age of fish vulnerable to commercial fisheries and have increasingly favoured a single-age class, potentially affecting the age class complexity that stabilizes this highly reliable resource.

Genetic information from extinct hominins allows us to study historical interactions with modern humans and discover adaptive functions of gene flow. Here, we investigate whole genomes from bonobo and chimpanzee populations for signatures of gene flow from unknown archaic populations, finding evidence for an ancient admixture event between bonobos and a divergent lineage. This result reveals a complex population history in our closest living relatives, probably several hundred thousand years ago. We reconstruct up to 4.8% of the genome of this 'ghost' ape, which represents genomic data of an extinct great ape population. Genes contained in archaic fragments might confer functional consequences for the immunity, behaviour and physiology of bonobos. Finally, comparing the landscapes of introgressed regions in humans and bonobos, we find that a recurrent depletion of introgression is rare, suggesting that genomic incompatibilities arose seldom in these lineages.

Forecast models are used annually to predict bloom intensity for the whole Western lake Erie Basin, but do not necessarily reflect nearshore conditions or regional variations, which are important for local stakeholders. In this study we: 1) developed relationships between observed whole basin and nearshore bloom sizes, and 2) updated and extended a Bayesian seasonal bloom forecast model to provide new regional predictions. The western basin was subdivided into 5 km near-shore regions, and bloom start date, size, and intensity were quantified with MODIS-derived images of chlorophyll concentrations for July-October 2002-2016 for each subdivision and for the entire basin. While bloom severity within each subdivision is temporally and spatially unique, it increased over the study period in each subdivision. The models for the 5 km subdivisions explained between 83 and 95% of variability between regional sizes and whole bloom size for US subdivisions and 51% for the Canadian subdivision. By linking predictive basin-wide models to regional regression estimates, we are now able to better predict potential bloom impacts at scales and in specific areas that are vital to the economic well-being of the region and allow for better management responses.

Trophic interactions and abiotic factors drive functional and phylogenetic structure of vertebrate herbivore communities across the Arctic tundra biome	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article						Arctic; community structure; functional diversity; herbivory; phylogenetic diversity; trophic interactions	SPECIES RICHNESS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; SPATIAL PHYLOGENETICS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY	Communities are assembled from species that evolve or colonise a given geographic region, and persist in the face of abiotic conditions and interactions with other species. The evolutionary and colonisation histories of communities are characterised by phylogenetic diversity, while functional diversity is indicative of abiotic and biotic conditions. The relationship between functional and phylogenetic diversity infers whether species functional traits are divergent (differing between related species) or convergent (similar among distantly related species). Biotic interactions and abiotic conditions are known to influence macroecological patterns in species richness, but how functional and phylogenetic diversity of guilds vary with biotic factors, and the relative importance of biotic drivers in relation to geographic and abiotic drivers is unknown. In this study, we test whether geographic, abiotic or biotic factors drive biome-scale spatial patterns of functional and phylogenetic diversity and functional convergence in vertebrate herbivores across the Arctic tundra biome. We found that functional and phylogenetic diversity both peaked in the western North American Arctic, and that spatial patterns in both were best predicted by trophic interactions, namely vegetation productivity and predator diversity, as well as climatic severity. Our results show that both bottom-up and top-down trophic interactions, as well as winter temperatures, drive the functional and phylogenetic structure of Arctic vertebrate herbivore assemblages. This has implications for changing Arctic ecosystems; under future warming and northward movement of predators potential increases in phylogenetic and functional diversity in vertebrate herbivores may occur. Our study thus demonstrates that trophic interactions can determine large-scale functional and phylogenetic diversity just as strongly as abiotic conditions.	[Speed, James D.

Sphagnum fibers are greatly desired by international markets, resulting in an increase in their extraction, thus causing environmental deterioration through overexploitation, especially in Patagonian peatlands. Given this environmental problem, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the application of two fertilizers (NH4NO3 and NaH2PO4) on the regeneration and growth rate of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum falcatulum. An ex situ experiment was carried out in micro- and mesocosms extracted from three localities in Isla Grande de Chiloe, Los Lagos Region, Chile. The results reported that fertilization affects the development of Sphagnum moss, showing positive results on growth in height, while having a very limited effect on regeneration. Our data show a positive impact of some concentrations under natural climatic conditions. After three months, mesocosms with 10g/m(2) of NH4NO3 (3.5gN/m(2)) for S. falcatulum, and 5g/m(2) of NaH2PO4 (1.3g P/m(2)) for S. magellanicum, demonstrated statistically significant differences with respect to the control, with a mean growth of 15.2mm and 5.6mm respectively. According to the data, we can show that these treatments may be considered for the propagation of moss ex situ followed by reintroduction into the field. Field experiments are required to better understand the dynamics of nitrogen in Patagonian peatlands; nevertheless, these data suggest that attention be paid to nonpoint pollution of surface waters with nitrogen, because excessive inputs may have important effects on the growth of this natural resource.

Passerine and secretive marsh bird responses to cattail management in temperate wetlands	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Distance sampling; Fire and grazing wetland management; Hybrid cattail management; Secretive marsh birds; Wetland bird community composition	BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; TYPHA SPP.; ABUNDANCE; COMMUNITIES; NORTH; VEGETATION; LAKE; WATERBIRDS; LANDSCAPE	Hybrid cattails (Typha x glauca) are an invasive, emergent aquatic plant that often form monodominant stands, which can alter wetland vegetation structure and negatively affect wildlife populations. Wetland managers often apply prescribed burning, grazing, and herbicide treatments to reduce cattail density but how these management actions influence wetland wildlife is largely unknown. Our objectives were to investigate the effect of hybrid cattail control methods on secretive marsh bird and wetland passerine abundance in central Minnesota, USA. Specifically, we assessed how environmental variables and cattail treatments (e.g., burning, grazing, and herbicide) influenced bird densities and community composition. We used the North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol to assess wetland bird communities across sixteen wetlands comprised of eight treatments with a full-factorial design. Species-specific density estimates and community-wide ordination offered little evidence for a substantial effect of treatments on marsh birds and passerines. However, gradients in vegetation height and mean biomass did have a significant relationship with both passerine and marsh bird community composition, which suggests changes in the bird community following cattail management might require time to develop. To support diverse wetland bird communities, treatments must create contrast among wetland habitats with high and low vegetative biomass. Because secretive marsh birds are under-surveyed, our baseline population estimates are valuable for future local and regional management and for gaining preliminary understanding of the effect of invasive species management on wetland birds in the Upper Midwest.

Effects of the surrounding landscape on waterbird populations in estuarine ecosystems of central Chile	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bioindicators; Estuaries; Landscape attributes; Waterbirds	WETLAND CONNECTIVITY; INDICATORS; MOVEMENTS; SHOREBIRDS; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; BIRDS; NDVI	Waterbirds have high potential as bioindicators of the status and functioning of estuarine ecosystems, because they respond to multiple stress factors in a wide range of spatial scales. The objective of this study was to analyze the dependence of the population size of waterbird species with different degrees of association with waterbodies (High: HAW, Low: LAW) on attributes of the surrounding landscape. This was accomplished by long-term monitoring (2006-2015) of the populations of waterbirds in three estuaries of central Chile; the Itata, Mataquito, and Reloca Rivers. We acquired data on the composition and structure of the landscape for each site from satellite sensors (Landsat TM5, ETM+7 and OLI 8), specifically the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI). We also obtained the covers of grassland and crops, bare soil and shrubland annually (summer) using a supervised classification. Using point-count data (2013-2015) from the landscape surrounding the Itata estuary, we compared the proportion of the population of different species present within and outside the wetland. The negative temporal correlation (p<0.05) between the number of Yellow-billed pintails (Anas georgica) inside and outside the estuary strongly suggests the movement of individuals between these two habitats. We found that the abundance of many species in in the estuaries was affected by the variation of some landscape attributes. However, that proportion of LAW and HAW species showing such relationships did not differ significantly. The most important attributes of the landscape for waterbird populations were moisture (flooded sites) and vegetation photosynthetic vigor, shrubland cover. The growing use of waterbird population data as an environmental monitoring tool requires a deep understanding of the factors that drive the changes in both population numbers but also in the data describing the latter. This study highlights the importance of incorporating into waterbird population assessments information from both inside the waterbodies and from their surrounding landscapes.

Effects of flood inundation, invasion by Phalaris arundinacea, and nitrogen enrichment on extracellular enzyme activity in an Upper Mississippi River floodplain forest	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Extracellular enzyme activity; Fertilization; Flood pulse; Invasion; Nitrogen	MICROBIAL RESPONSES; SEDGE MEADOW; N ADDITION; DEPOSITION; VEGETATION; SOILS; DECOMPOSITION; ESTABLISHMENT; ECOSYSTEMS; HERBIVORY	The community structures and ecosystem functions of floodplains are primarily driven by variation in flood inundation. However, global changes, such as invasive species and nutrient enrichment, may alter the effects of flooding in these systems. We added nitrogen (N) to correspond with twice the annual atmospheric deposition rate of the south-west Wisconsin, USA region within mature floodplain forest plots and patches of an invasive grass (reed canarygrass, Phalaris arundinacea) along a floodplain elevation gradient in an Upper Mississippi River floodplain forest. We measured soil physicochemical properties and the activity of six extracellular enzymes during 3 months that varied in flooding conditions. Multivariate analyses (distance-based redundancy analysis) revealed that floodplain elevation, month of sampling, and vegetation type were all significant predictors of variation in soil physicochemical properties, while elevation and month were significant predictors of multivariate extracellular enzyme activity (EEA). The best model for predicting EEA consisted of nitrogen availability, soil porosity, and water filled pore space. Although the categorical fertilization and invasion treatments were not significant predictors of EEA, our results suggest that their effects depend on the degree to which they modify N availability and soil moisture. In this system, spatial and temporal patterns in flooding appear to be the main driver of these properties, but N enrichment and invasion may have the potential to further modify them.

While designating more land as PAs is important, concerns about the degree to which existing PAs are effective in meeting conservation goals are growing. Unfortunately, conservation effectiveness of PAs and its underlying determinants are often unclear across large spatial scales. Using PAs in China as an example, we evaluated the effectiveness of 472 PAs established before 2000 in reducing deforestation between 2000 and 2015. Our results show that the majority (71%) of the PAs were effective in reducing deforestation. Without their establishment, deforestation within the PAs would have increased by about 50% (581km(2)), with about 1271 megaton of carbon per year not being sequestered. We also found some attributes of PAs, including surrounding deforestation level, roughness of terrain, and travel time to the nearest city, are significantly related to their effectiveness in reducing deforestation. Our findings highlight the need of systematically evaluating the effectiveness of PAs and incorporating this effectiveness into conservation planning and management to more fully realize the goals of PAs not only in China but also around the world.

The importance of productivity and seasonality for structuring small rodent diversity across a tropical elevation gradient	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Productivity-diversity relationship; Feeding guild; Mexico; NDVI; Small mammal communities	SMALL MAMMAL DIVERSITY; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; VOLANT SMALL MAMMALS; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; BETA DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; FOREST; ABUNDANCE; DESERT	Photosynthetic productivity is a key determinant of the abundance and distribution of biodiversity around the world. The effect of this productivity on the distribution patterns of mammals is frequently invoked; however, it is seldom measured directly. In this study, we used Sherman live traps set in dry and rainy seasons across a 2300-m elevation gradient in southwestern Mexico to assess small rodent species distributions, and to relate these patterns to habitat structure, climate, and a well-accepted measure of photosynthetic productivity: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). While habitat structure and climate helped explain some of the patterns observed, NDVI proved to be the most important contributing variable for most of the distribution models. We also found that partitioning the gradient-distribution model by trapping season revealed strong differences in terms of the effect of NDVI and the other explanatory variables. For example, lower elevations were associated with seasonal and year-round reductions in rodent diversity and were composed almost exclusively of granivore-based species assemblages. By contrast, the middle and upper elevations were more species rich, less affected by seasonality, and characterized by omnivorous species. Our results suggest that the positive productivity-diversity relationship found may be due, at least in part, to increased food resources and niche opportunities at more productive elevations. Increased diversity at the higher elevations may also be partially due to reductions in competition that result from productivity increases, as well as from the broader spectrum of feeding guild representation that it and the lack of seasonality allow.

If facilitation occurs because benefactors ameliorate stress, such balance may be driven by seed mass because stress tolerance and competitive ability of plants, particularly seedlings, are positively correlated with seed mass. Thus, small-seeded, stress-intolerant species may require facilitation, but not large-seeded ones. This would equalise the magnitudes of opposite-signed interactions because in small-seeded species, positive effects of facilitators and negative effects of competitors should be strong, while both effects should be weak in large-seeded species. To test this idea, we assessed the effects of interactions with four associated species on different components of the performance of ten focal species. As expected, the largest facilitative and competitive effects were recorded in small-seeded species, and positive interactions had similar magnitudes to negative ones for any given seed mass, especially when performance was integrated into lifelong fitness. Furthermore, the fact that small-seeded species seem to be strongly facilitated may explain why they are not outcompeted by large-seeded species. This is an alternative to other hypotheses explaining the coexistence of plants with different-sized seeds. The close balance between opposite-signed interactions in the presence of stress may also explain why interactions have strong effects on individuals (that interact with only a few species), but seemingly weaker effects on populations, where interactions between many species would cancel out.

However, greater risk of infection in colonial birds might be compensated by specific immune adaptations. Here, we predicted that nestlings raised in larger colonies should invest more in their immune function. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated colony size and conduced cross-fostering experiment in a colonial waterbird, the common tern Sterna hirundo. Establishment of different size colonies under uniform environmental conditions was induced by providing large and small patches of attractive nesting area for terns (floating rafts). Then, pairs of clutches were swapped between large and small tern colonies, and skin-swelling response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was assessed for nestlings from experimental and control broods. Contrary to our expectations, we found a negative effect of foster colony size on nestling PHA response (nestlings raised in the larger colony had lower PHA response). In addition, nestling PHA response correlated negatively with heterophil/lymphocyte ratio used as a measure of physiological stress. This suggested that low PHA response of nestlings raised in the larger colony could be mediated by an elevated level of social stress. We suggest that depression of immune function via social stress may constitute a strong selective pressure against large colony size in the common tern, and possibly in other colonial species. We also recommend that this largely overlooked cost of sociality should be considered in the further studies on the evolution and ecology of avian coloniality.

Enhanced ambient UVB radiation affects post-mating, but not pre-mating sexual traits in a fish	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Ultraviolet light; Breeding colouration; Sperm movement; Sperm morphology; Sexual selection	STICKLEBACK GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS; ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION; BREAM PAGRUS-MAJOR; 3-SPINED STICKLEBACK; SPERM COMPETITION; FERTILIZATION SUCCESS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; COLOR PATTERNS; DAMAGES SPERM; MATE CHOICE	Organisms inhabiting shallow aquatic habitats currently experience increasing levels of solar ultraviolet B radiation (UVB). UVB causes damage on cellular and molecular levels and can affect associated life-history traits either through direct exposure or indirectly through oxidative stress generation. We examined UVB effects on pre- and post-mating sexual traits in three-spined stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Adult, reproductively non-active males were assigned to two exposure treatments under semi-natural conditions in an outdoor experiment; one group received natural radiation (UVBnormal) whilst the other group received additional UVB (UVBenhanced). After two months, colour metrics were used to quantify male breeding colouration as pre-mating trait. At the post-mating stage, sperm morphology, number and movement as well as testes mass were determined. Males did not significantly differ in sexual ornamentation between treatments, but UVBenhanced fish had smaller testes as well as fewer and shorter sperm than UVBnormal fish. Sperm movement was not significantly different between treatments. However, in UVBenhanced males, linear and progressive movement of sperm was positively correlated with sperm morphology (head-to-tail length ratio), whereas in UVBnormal males this relationship was negative (but not significant). Additionally, there was a significant treatment by body condition interaction concerning head-to-tail length ratio, i.e. head-to-tail length ratio increased with condition in UVBnormal males whereas there was no relationship in UVBenhanced fish. Our findings reveal that increased UVB levels influence post-mating fitness-relevant traits in males whilst having no significant impact on pre-mating sexual traits, suggesting selectiveUVB-effects at the gamete level with consequences for reproductive performance.

Top predators induce habitat shifts in prey within marine protected areas	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Marine reserves; Behaviorally mediated interactions; Reef sharks; Risk effects; Stingrays	STINGRAY DASYATIS-AMERICANA; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; MEDIATED TROPHIC CASCADE; LANDSCAPE-LEVEL TEST; ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE; SHARK DECLINES; HUNTING MODE; RISK; WOLVES; ASPEN	Emerging conservation efforts for the world's large predators may, if successful, restore natural predator-prey interactions. Marine reserves, where large predators tend to be relatively common, offer an experimental manipulation to investigate interactions between large-bodied marine predators and their prey. We hypothesized that southern stingrayslarge, long-lived and highly interactive mesopredatorswould invest in anti-predator behavior in marine reserves where predatory large sharks, the primary predator of stingrays, are more abundant. Specifically, we predicted southern stingrays in marine reserves would reduce the use of deep forereef habitats in the favor of shallow flats where the risk of shark encounters is lower. Baited remote underwater video was used to survey stingrays and reef sharks in flats and forereef habitats of two reserves and two fished sites in Belize. The interaction between protection status and habitat was the most important factor determining stingray presence. As predicted, southern stingrays spent more time interacting with baited remote underwater videos in the safer flats habitats, were more likely to have predator-inflicted damage inside reserves, and were less abundant in marine reserves but only in the forereef habitat. These results are consistent with a predation-sensitive habitat shift rather than southern stingray populations being reduced by direct predation from reef sharks. Our study provides evidence that roving predators can induce pronounced habitat shifts in prey that rely on crypsis and refuging, rather than active escape, in high-visibility, heterogeneous marine habitats. Given documented impacts of stingrays on benthic communities it is possible restoration of reef shark populations with reserves could induce reef ecosystem changes through behavior-mediated trophic cascades.

Environment can be current or past, which complicates the distinction between environmental and heritable effects on the phenotype in wild animals. We studied genome-environment interactions on phenotype and life history traits by transplanting bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from northern and southern populations, originating from low or high population cycle phases, to common garden conditions in large outdoor enclosures. The first experiment focused on the persistence of body traits in autumn-captured overwintering populations. The second experiment focused on population growth and body traits in spring-captured founder voles and F1 generation. This experiment lasted the breeding season and subsequent winter. We verified phase-dependent differences in body size at capture. In the common environment, adult voles kept their original body size differences both over winter and during the breeding season. In addition, the first generation born in the common environment kept the size distribution of their parent population. The increase phase population maintained a more rapid growth potential, while populations from the decline phase of the cycle grew slower. After winter, the F1 generation of the increasing northern population matured later than the F1 of the southern declining ones. Our results suggest a strong role of heredity or early life conditions, greater than that of current juvenile and adult environmental conditions. Environmental conditions experienced by the parents in their early life can have inter-generational effects that manifest in offspring performance.

Understanding of drivers of their landscape distribution could provide a valuable insight into their decline. Our objectives were to develop models predicting distribution of selected orchid speciesfour co-occurring forest orchid species, Cephalanthera rubra, Epipactis atrorubens, E. helleborine, and Neottia nidus-avisat a landscape scale using a wide range of habitat characteristics. Subsequently, we compared the model predictions with species occurrence and the results of the field germination experiment while considering two germination stagesasymbiotic (early stage) and symbiotic. And finally, we attempted to identify possible drivers of species' landscape distribution (i.e., dispersal, availability of habitat patches, or fungal associates). We have discovered that different habitat characteristics determined the distribution of different orchids. The species also differed in terms of availability of suitable habitat patches and patch occupancy (the highest being E. atrorubens with 80%). Landscape distribution of the species was primarily restricted by the availability of fungal associates (the most important factor for C. rubra) and by the availability of suitable habitat patches (the most important in case of N. nidus-avis). Despite expected easy dispersal of spores, orchid distribution seems to be limited by the availability of fungal associates in the landscape. In contrast, the availability of orchid seeds does not seem to limit their distribution. These results can provide useful guidelines for conservation of the studied species.

Different trophic groups of arboreal ants show differential responses to resource supplementation in a neotropical savanna	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Cerrado; Community structure; Formicidae; Ecological stoichiometry; Nutritional ecology	EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES; FOREST CANOPY; AMINO-ACIDS; COMMUNITY; ECOLOGY; CONDITIONALITY; STOICHIOMETRY; ASSEMBLAGES; PREFERENCES; HYMENOPTERA	Resource-ratio theory predicts that consumers should achieve optimal ratios of complementary nutrients. Accordingly, different trophic groups are expected to vary in their N-limitation depending on the extent to which they feed primarily on carbohydrate (CHO) or protein. Among arboreal ants, N-limitation ranges from high (for trophobiont tenders), intermediate (leaf foragers) and low (predators). We report results from a manipulative field experiment in a Brazilian savanna that tests the differential attractiveness of nitrogen and CHO to arboreal ants, as well as experimentally examines changes in broader ant foraging patterns in response to protein and CHO supplementation. Every tree within 32 20x20m plots were supplemented with either protein, CHO; protein+CHO or a water control (n=8 in each case) for a 7-day period in each of the wet and dry seasons. As predicted, different trophic groups responded differentially to supplementation treatment according to the extent of their N-limitation. The richness and abundance of the most N-limited group (trophobiont tenders) was highest at protein supplements, whereas less N-limited trophic groups showed highest species richness (leaf foragers) or abundance (predators) at CHO supplements. Protein supplementation markedly increased the general foraging abundance of trophobiont tenders, but decreased the abundance of leaf foragers. We attribute the latter to increased competition from behaviorally dominant trophobiont tenders. Our study provides experimental evidence that nutrient availability is a major factor influencing arboreal ant communities, both directly through the provision of different resources, and indirectly through increased competitive pressure.

Here, we assessed changes in diversity patterns of herbaceous and woody communities along a water table gradient in a fire-excluded Neotropical savanna. We found that increased waterlogging of soils was associated with declines in both herbaceous and woody species richness. Woody species richness decreased once the water table depth is less than 4m and no woody species occurred once water table depth was less than 23cm. Herbaceous communities remained species rich until the shallowest water table depth, where there is flooding at some point in the year, and even there, over a dozen species occurred. Woody species that occurred in areas with shallower water tables were a nested subset of those in areas with deeper water tables. In contrast, herbaceous communities showed turnover over the hydrological gradient, with distinct species specialized for different water table levels. However, we found that those specialists are restricted to few evolutionary lineages, evidenced by increased phylogenetic clustering over the water table gradient in herbaceous communities. We suggest that evolutionarily conserved hydrological niches define the herbaceous layer over the hydrological gradient, whereas only generalist woody species persist under high water tables. Our findings show that the effect of soil waterlogging differs between the herbaceous and woody layer of savannas, indicating that these communities will respond differently to shifts in the hydrological regime under future environmental change.

For example, the ENSO can profoundly influence the development and survival of pelagic species, but the extent to which the ENSO affects offspring of terrestrial species is less well known. We used piecewise structural equation modeling to investigate the direct and indirect relationship between the ENSO and offspring development and survival in a terrestrial tropical passerine, the lance-tailed manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata). The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), a measure of the ENSO, was negatively related to individual growth rate, maximum number of lesion developed by nestlings, and hatching day-of-year; which in turn mediated indirect effects on fledging success and recruitment. Further the ONI was a better predictor of nestling development compared to local temperature and rainfall. Our study establishes a link between the ENSO and the development and survival of young of a terrestrial species and underscores the need to better understand how offspring cope with global climate variation.

Even when it has been argued that agriculture is the main cause of its increase in the atmosphere, natural ecosystems are also an important source of N2O. However, the impacts of human activities on N2O emissions through biodiversity loss or primary productivity changes in natural ecosystems have rarely been assessed. Here, we analyzed the effects of vegetation attributes such as plant diversity and production, as drivers of N2O emission rates, in addition to environmental factors. We measured N2O emissions monthly during 1year in 12 sites covering a large portion of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, Argentina, and related these emissions with climate, soil and vegetation attributes. We performed spatial and temporal models of N2O emissions separately, to evaluate which drivers control N2O in space and over time independently. Our results showed that in the spatial model, N2O emissions decreased with increments in plant species richness, with concomitant reductions in soil NO3-, whereas N2O emissions increased with primary productivity. By contrast, in the temporal model, monthly precipitation and monthly temperature were the main drivers of N2O emissions, with positive correlations, showing important differences with the spatial model. Overall, our results show that biological drivers may exert substantial control of N2O emissions at large spatial scales, together with climate and soil variables. Our results suggest that biodiversity conservation of natural grasslands may reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions, besides maintaining other important ecosystem services.

Approximately 1000 neotropical plants produce floral perfumes as the only reward for pollinators, i.e. male euglossine bees. The chiral compound carvone epoxide is a key component of the scent bouquet of many perfume-rewarding plants that are pollinated by males of Eulaema. Here, we tested the biological activity of the four carvone epoxide stereoisomers to four Eulaema species occurring in the Atlantic Rainforest of NE-Brazil. We determined the stereochemistry of carvone epoxide in the floral scent of several Catasetum species, tested whether the antennae of bees respond differentially to these stereoisomers and investigated if there is a behavioural preference for any of the stereoisomers. We found that 1) Catasetum species emit only the (-)-trans-stereoisomer of carvone epoxide, 2) for E. atleticana and E. niveofasciata antennal responses to the (-)-trans-carvone epoxide were significantly stronger than those to (-)-cis-carvone epoxide, 3) the strength and pattern of antennal responses to all 4 stereoisomers (separately tested) did not differ among Eulaema species, and 4) there were significant differences in attractiveness of the four stereoisomers to the bees species with the (-)-trans-stereoisomer being particularly attractive. We assume (-)-trans-carvone epoxide to be the dominant isomer in perfume-rewarding plants pollinated by Eulaema. The universal occurrence of carvone epoxide in Catasetum species pollinated by Eulaema, suggests that this compound has evolved in perfume-rewarding as a specific attractant for Eulaema bees as pollinators.

However, information on ant assemblages on artificial food and their food removal rates in different habitat types is lacking, and the relationship between ant assemblage and removal rate is poorly understood. We assessed assemblages of ants on experimentally placed foods (potato chips, cookies and ham) and their food removal rates on three land cover types (woodlands, lawns and pavements) at 90 sites in 10 urban and suburban parks of Tokyo. Then, we examined the relationship between ant assemblage and food removal rate. In total, 11 trophic generalist ants were associated with food removal. Species composition differed significantly between land cover types, and the mean number of species was higher in woodlands than on lawns and pavements, while not significantly different between urban and suburban parks. The ants removed, on average, 6.3 g of 18-g food in fresh weight (or 5.3 g of 13.9-g food in dry weight) per site in 24 h. There were both negative and positive associations between ant species presence and food removal rate, but no significant associations between species number and food removal rate. Food removal rate was highest on lawns, and that in woodlands was not significantly different from that on lawns and pavements. Therefore, our study suggests that ants on lawns and pavements, despite lower number of species and altered species composition, have a comparable or higher ability to redistribute nutrients from artificial foods as compared with woodland ants. This indicates that such highly artificial land cover types should also be included in studies on urban ecosystem services. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Although higher water availability and lower grazing pressure usually increase seedling recruitment in the beginning, higher competition may reduce seedling survival. In our study, we analysed this trade-off for the dominant species of Western Mediterranean steppes Brachypodium retusum which hardly recolonises restoration sites degraded by soil disturbance such as arable use. A split-plot experiment was set up on an ex-arable site in the "La Crau" steppe in order to test the effects of initial watering and sheep grazing on seedling recruitment, survival and early growth during two years. The watering treatment was applied in the fist autumn and spring doubling the usual precipitation during this period and grazing was tested using exclosures. Survival and growth of seedlings established from field-sown seeds were compared to those of transplanted seedlings pre-grown in a growth chamber. Watering did not affect germination whereas the grazing effect was negative. Initial watering had a positive effect on survival only in grazed plots suggesting a compensatory effect under grazing disturbance. Significant main effects of watering on early growth disappeared in the second season. Grazing significantly reduced most measured growth traits whereas the effect on survival was only marginally significant. Planted seedlings (49%) survived better than seedlings emerged from field-sown seeds (36%). In conclusion, initial fencing increases establishment success of B. retusum in ecological restoration. Initial watering may help to mitigate negative grazing effects when fencing is not possible. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

"Top-down" pest control by natural enemies has not been considered in most plant breeding strategies and, in many cases, beneficial interactions of crops with the third trophic level have been reduced through breeding processes. Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are plant structures that provide indirect defences to plants through nectar rewards attracting arthropods that may act as predators of pests. Recent studies have demonstrated that EFNs may play an important role in herbivore suppression in agricultural systems. The main objectives of this study were to quantify the leaf extrafloral nectar production of cotton plants, to identify natural enemies of crop pests visiting these EFNs, and to assess the biological control and occurrence of various cotton pests. To address these objectives, we performed both greenhouse and field experiments in which we compared three wild varieties of cotton plants with EFNs, two cultivated varieties with EFNs and two nectariless varieties. Results showed that wild cotton varieties produced greater quantity of nectar per leaf than cultivated varieties. In addition, wild varieties bearing EFNs enhanced the diversity of natural enemies (especially ants) which could, in turn, increase biological control under certain conditions. However, the association between the community of insects visiting EFNs and pest suppression was not clear and depended on the pest species. Indirect defences associated to EFN need to be better explored to enhance selection of pest-resistant cotton cultivars. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fiir Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

To quantify the contributions of island attributes to the species richness (SR) of different bryophyte groups on continental islands, we investigated the species number of fifteen bryophyte groups and seven island attributes (area, elevation, isolation degree, human disturbance intensity, rainfall, vegetation coverage and island shape) on 66 continental islands of the Zhoushan Archipelago in the East China Sea. By using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), we found that all the focal environmental variables exerted effects on bryophyte SR to different extents. According to the marginal R-2 and the ratios of marginal R-2 to conditional R-2 of the GLMMs, area (0.776/0.956) and elevation (0.741/0.981) were the two most important determinants of bryophyte SR, followed by disturbance intensity (0.497/0.755), vegetation coverage (0.478/0.708) and isolation (0.234/0.311). Island shape irregularity (0.049/0.068) and rainfall (0.045/0.06) exerted weak but positive effects on bryophyte SR. The effects of island attributes on bryophyte SR were different, with positive effects on the SR of all or most of the focal bryophyte groups for island area, elevation, rainfall and shape irregularity, and a negative effect for isolation degree. The relationships of bryophyte SR with disturbance intensity and vegetation coverage followed unimodal models for most of the focal bryophyte groups. The responses of different bryophyte groups to a given environmental variable are taxon-specific. With the increase of island area and elevation, SR increased faster in mosses than liverworts, and faster in pleurocarpous mosses than in acrocarpous mosses. With the increase of island shape irregularity, SR increased for most of the focal bryophyte groups, but decreased for pleurocarpous mosses. Our results imply that a forest reserve for conservation of bryophyte diversity should be designated with a large area and a higher elevation, moderate disturbance to produce irregularly-shaped fragments with different types of vegetation.

Drought supersedes warming in determining volatile and tissue defenses of pinon pine (Pinus edulis)	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						drought; heat stress; monoterpenes; Pinus edulis; plant defense; secondary metabolites; volatile organic compounds	ORGANIC-COMPOUND EMISSIONS; MONOTERPENE EMISSIONS; PONDEROSA PINE; QUERCUS-ILEX; JUNIPER WOODLANDS; TREE MORTALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BARK BEETLES; RESIN DUCTS; HERBIVORY	Trees are suffering mortality across the globe as a result of drought, warming, and biotic attacks. The combined effects of warming and drought on in situ tree chemical defenses against herbivory have not been studied to date. To address this, we transplanted mature pinon pine trees-a well-studied species that has undergone extensive drought and herbivore-related mortality-within their native woodland habitat and also to a hotter-drier habitat and measured monoterpene emissions and concentrations across the growing season. We hypothesized that greater needle temperatures in the hotter-drier site would increase monoterpene emission rates and consequently lower needle monoterpene concentrations, and that this temperature effect would dominate the seasonal pattern of monoterpene concentrations regardless of drought. In support of our hypothesis, needle monoterpene concentrations were lower across all seasons in trees transplanted to the hotter-drier site. Contrary to our hypothesis, basal emission rates (emission rates normalized to 30 degrees C and a radiative flux of 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) did not differ between sites. This is because an increase in emissions at the hotter-drier site from a 1.5 degrees C average temperature increase was offset by decreased emissions from greater plant water stress. High emission rates were frequently observed during June, which were not related to plant physiological or environmental factors but did not occur below pre-dawn leaf water potentials of -2 MPa, the approximate zero carbon assimilation point in pinon pine. Emission rates were also not under environmental or plant physiological control when pre-dawn leaf water potential was less than -2 MPa. Our results suggest that drought may override the effects of temperature on monoterpene emissions and tissue concentrations, and that the influence of drought may occur through metabolic processes sensitive to the overall needle carbon balance.

Are Lek Disturbance Buffers Equitable for All Gunnison Sage-Grouse Populations?	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Gunnison sage grouse; GPS; lek disturbance buffer	ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; CENTROCERCUS; MOVEMENTS	Lek disturbance buffers can be used to identify areas that provide important seasonal habitat for Gunnison sage grouse Centrocercus minimus (hereafter GUSG), a species with declining or vulnerable populations across their range. Lek disturbance buffers define areas around leks where anthropogenic disturbance is not permitted and have been considered for potential conservation strategies across GUSG habitat. Currently there is minimal information available on the effectiveness of the size of defined lek disturbance buffers. This study focused on two GUSG populations, the smaller Crawford population and a segment of the larger Gunnison Basin population. We utilized global positioning system location data on GUSG to evaluate seasonal use within three lek disturbance buffers, then compared and contrasted results between the two populations. The Crawford GUSG population showed increased movements from breeding season to late brood-rearing season and in winter returned to a usage pattern similar to the breeding season. Comparatively, the western Gunnison Basin GUSG population showed considerable movement throughout the entire year. In addition to these differences, we noted remarkable differences in distance between active leks, home range size, and total daily distance traveled between Crawford and western Gunnison Basin populations. Lek disturbance buffers created using the standard protocol provided varying protection depending on the distance between leks and number of leks. In small populations, the disturbance buffers overlapped each other, thus producing a smaller total lek disturbance buffer area. In addition to adding to the general body of knowledge of a little-studied species, our study had two important findings: 1) the use of empirical cumulative distribution demonstrated considerable differences in lek disturbance buffer use between the Crawford and the western Gunnison Basin populations, and 2) lek disturbance buffers did not provide equal protection for all populations on the basis of their current definition and derivation. We anticipate that land managers will find our results useful and informative when developing land management plans for the conservation of GUSG. Our analysis showed that the variability between populations and species is important for managers to consider when developing conservation strategies, especially for small populations.

Selection of Calf Bedding Sites by Female Elk in the Central Appalachian Mountains	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						elk; calving habitat; habitat selection; neonate elk; Pennsylvania; Central Appalachian Mountains	TAILED DEER; BLACK-HILLS; SURVIVAL; LANDSCAPE; HABITAT; MORTALITY; PREDATION; CALVES; BIRTH	Across eastern North America, Rocky Mountain elk Cervus canadensis nelsoni have been reintroduced to 11 states and provinces that were previously occupied by the extinct eastern elk C. canadensis canadensis. Outside of Kentucky, these elk reintroductions have resulted in small populations, typically numbering fewer than 1,000 elk per state. Limited information is available about the demographics and habitat selection within these small eastern populations. The availability of high-quality habitat during the first weeks of life is important for promoting annual recruitment and the identification of these characteristics should aid in management efforts. We characterized habitat at two spatial scales surrounding the bedding sites of 83 elk calves (<= 7 d old) in the Pennsylvania Elk Management Area during the annual calving seasons of 2005-2008. A concurrent study found that calves in this area experienced high survival (92%) during the first 4 mo of life, despite occupying an area with high predator densities. At a local scale, bedding sites used by calves were closer to ecotones, had less leaf litter, and had greater density of vegetation below 1 m compared to random sites (n = 82). At a landscape scale, calf habitat surrounding bedding sites had greater density of edges between forest and open vegetation and less coniferous forest compared to random areas. The selected habitats appear to balance the high energetic needs of lactating females at the landscape scale and the need for cover to conceal calves and reduce predation risk at a local scale. Conclusions drawn from our models suggest future habitat management include enhancements of transitional vegetation along ecotones between forest and herbaceous openings that address the needs of both lactating females and recently born calves. We recommend that managers periodically evaluate the availability of calf habitat and calf survival rates. These monitoring activities will provide insight necessary to adaptively manage elk and the habitats driving their population growth to maintain their viability in the central Appalachian Mountains.

Invasive Species Removal Promotes Habitat Restoration but Does Not Immediately Improve the Condition of a Threatened Plant Subspecies	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						competition; Fallopia japonica; habitat management; invasive species; rare species; restoration; Rhodiola integrifolia	ESTABLISHMENT; LIMITATIONS; COMMUNITIES	Impacts of invasive species on rare species are relevant to conservation. We studied the response of Leedy's roseroot Rhodiola integrifolia subsp. leedyi, a subspecies listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, to removal of the invasive species Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica. Japanese knotweed has invaded the largest known population of Leedy's roseroot, affecting about 10% of all Leedy's roseroot in the world. Japanese knotweed shaded Leedy's roseroot, but the two did not share belowground resources because of their position on cliffs. To study this interaction and, ultimately, to restore Leedy's roseroot habitat to an open, high-light condition, we removed Japanese knotweed in a three-treatment block design. We measured Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, and reproduction in treatment blocks and in uninvaded areas before and after treatment. Compared with uninvaded areas, Japanese knotweed invasion negatively affected Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, and reproduction. Light interception by Japanese knotweed degraded the habitat for Leedy's roseroot. Herbicide removal of Japanese knotweed resulted in increased light and temperature compared with untreated invaded plots but did not affect Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, or reproduction over the 2 y of our study. These results show that invasive species removal is conducive to restoring Leedy's roseroot habitat, but recovery in the subspecies may lag behind restoration of the habitat, suggesting that additional action or time may be required to restore preinvasion performance of Leedy's roseroot. Results of this study may inform restoration efforts for other systems and contribute to the literature on interspecific interactions.

Anadromy Redux? Genetic Analysis to Inform Development of an Indigenous American River Steelhead Broodstock	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						steelhead; genetics; anadromy; fish passage; rainbow trout; evolution; adaptation	ADAPTIVE GENOMIC VARIATION; TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; RAINBOW-TROUT; LIFE-HISTORY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; PHYLOGENETIC TREES; RAPID EVOLUTION; CONSERVATION; ANCESTRY; SMOLTIFICATION	The construction of dams and water diversions has severely limited access to spawning habitat for anadromous fishes. To mitigate for these impacts, hatchery programs rear and release millions of juvenile salmonids, including steelhead, the anadromous ecotype of the species Oncorhynchus mykiss. These programs sometimes use nonindigenous broodstock sources that may have negative effects on wild populations. In California, however, only one anadromous fish hatchery program currently uses nonnative broodstock: the steelhead program at Nimbus Fish Hatchery on the American River, a tributary of the Sacramento River in the California Central Valley. The goal of this study was to determine if potentially appropriate sources to replace the broodstock for the Nimbus Hatchery steelhead program exist in the Upper American River, above Nimbus and Folsom dams. We show that all Upper American River O. mykiss sampled share ancestry with other populations in the Central Valley steelhead distinct population segment, with limited introgression from out-of-basin sources in some areas. Furthermore, some Upper American River populations retain adaptive genomic variation associated with a migratory life history, supporting the hypothesis that these populations display adfluvial migratory behavior. Together, these results provide insights into the evolution of trout populations above barrier dams. We conclude that some Upper American River O. mykiss populations represent genetically appropriate sources from which fisheries managers could potentially develop a new broodstock for the Nimbus Hatchery steelhead program to reestablish a native anadromous population in the Lower American River and contribute to recovery of the threatened Central Valley steelhead distinct population segment.

Understanding seasonal and hourly activity patterns of migratory bat species may help to reduce fatalities at wind-energy facilities and provide guidance for the development of best management practices for bats. To examine hourly migratory bat activity patterns in the fall and spring in Virginia in an exploratory fashion with a suite of general temporal, environmental, and weather variables, we acoustically monitored bat activity on five ridgelines and side slopes from early September through mid-November 2015 and 2016 and from early March through late April 2016 and 2017. On ridges, bat activity decreased through the autumn sample period, but was more variable through the spring sample period. In autumn, migratory bat activity had largely ceased by mid-November. Activity patterns were species specific in both autumn and spring sample periods. Generally, migratory bat activity was negatively associated with hourly wind speeds but positively associated with ambient temperatures. These data provide further evidence that operational mitigation strategies at wind-energy facilities could help protect migratory bat species in the Appalachians; substantially slowing or locking wind turbine blade spin during periods of low wind speeds, often below where electricity is generated, and warm ambient temperatures may minimize mortality during periods of high bat activity.

Effectiveness of Acoustic Lures for Increasing Indiana Bat Captures in Mist-Nets	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						acoustic lure; bats; capture techniques; Chiroptera; Indiana bat; Myotis sodalis	INTERSPECIFIC RESPONSES; DISTRESS CALLS; SOCIAL CALLS; ECHOLOCATION; PATTERNS	As bat (Chiroptera) populations continue to decline in the eastern United States due to threats such as white-nose syndrome and interactions with wind facilities, capturing already rare species such as the federally endangered Indiana bat Myotis sodalis to assess health and demographics has become increasingly difficult. Mist-nets are a standard method for capturing and studying bats, but bats have the ability to escape from or avoid mist-nets. Past research has shown that the use of acoustic lures may increase mist-net capture success. Using prerecorded Indiana bat social calls, we tested the effectiveness of acoustic lures on capture rates across 24 nights at 37 sites in summers 2013 and 2014 in north-central Kentucky. Each site consisted of two nets (treatment and control) placed >35 m apart: we placed an acoustic lure set 1 m in front of the treatment net, whereas the control net received no lure. At the species level, we recorded significantly more captures in treatment nets (n = 262) than in control nets [n = 128; t(36) = 5.08, P < 0.001]. However, although we found a trend toward higher Indiana bat captures, the only species' with significant positive responses were evening bats Nycticeius humeralis [t(15) = 6.25, P < 0.001] and eastern red bats Lasiurus borealis [t(36) = 3.60, P < 0.001]. Further study is required to determine whether modifications to lure settings or call types result in increased Indiana bat captures.

Natal Dispersal Distance of Golden Eagles in the Southwestern United States	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Aquila chrysaetos; golden eagle; natal dispersal distance; sex-biased dispersal; southwestern United States	BALD	Data on natal dispersal distances (NDDs) of golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos in North America are needed to define local area populations and inform decisions authorizing take (i.e., injury, death, or disturbance) of the species via federal permit. Sixteen golden eagles (6 males, 10 females) tagged with satellite transmitters as similar to 8-wk-old nestlings in the southwestern United States during 2010-2013 dispersed a mean of 55.3 km (SD = 29.7, median = 64.5), either 1) between their natal nest sites and nests where they first bred (n = 3 females, all subadults, i.e., in their fourth year of life), or 2) between natal sites and where they permanently settled as adults at least in their fifth year of life, but did not necessarily breed (i.e., exhibiting only gross natal dispersal). On average, females dispersed about 50% farther than males; mean NDD of males and females was 41.2 km (90% credible interval = 11.1-75.2) and 63.8 km (44.8-82.6), respectively. Median NDD of males and females was 41.5 and 65.8 km, respectively; in a Bayesian framework, the estimated difference in posterior median distributions of male and female NDDs was 22.2 km (-15.7 to 57.3; P not equal 0 = 0.89), tentatively indicating that NDD of golden eagles in our study area may be female biased. Although our findings are based on a relatively small data set including both effective and gross natal dispersal records, they represent the first comparison of NDD between sexes of golden eagle in North America and the first published records on the continent of the species' NDD based on telemetry methods. More work is needed to validate whether golden eagle NDD in at least some regions of North America is female biased, which could have important implications for authorizing take of the species.

Baseline Alligator Nesting Data in Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge to Inform Monitoring	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Everglades; sampling design; protocols	POWER	Monitoring key ecological attributes helps land managers understand the current state of the resource and decide if management action is necessary. Baseline data on spatial and temporal variability of attributes to be monitored is important for development of successful monitoring programs. In this study, I collected data from 2000 to 2004 on American alligator Alligator mississippiensis nesting in the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge to determine feasibility of conducting alligator nest surveys and collect baseline data on alligator nesting status and variability. I used nest data to provide examples of potential monitoring strategies for tracking trends over time or understanding the effects of different hydrologic conditions on alligator nesting. Conducting ground surveys with airboats in Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge proved to be an effective method of finding alligator nests. Number of nests per 1.6 km x 1.6 km (256-ha) plot ranged from 1 to 12, and by year from 28 to 53. Overall, average number of nests per hour ranged from 1.8 +/- 0.26 (SE) in 2000 to a low of 0.84 +/- 0.08 in 2004. Using data from this study for the six plots sampled each year, and assuming no change in variability, power analysis shows that 10 y of sampling would allow for detection of an annual 10% change in number of nests per hour, with power and level of certainty set equal at 90% (beta and alpha both 0.10). Additionally, 15 y of data would allow for a detection of a 5% change per year. Thirty-seven plots per area would be necessary to assess a 40% difference in number of alligator nests per hour in areas with different hydrologic conditions with power and level of certainty at 90%. Land managers can use these data and analyses, along with examples of monitoring strategies, to guide development of more specific monitoring protocols that address restoration objectives and management actions throughout the Florida Everglades.

Carbon stocks and biodiversity of coastal lowland forests in South Africa: implications for aligning sustainable development and carbon mitigation initiatives	CARBON MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						sequestration; REDD; biomass; allometric equations; conservation	GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; EASTERN-CAPE; TREE ALLOMETRY; COMANAGEMENT; BALANCE; BIOMASS	Indigenous forests represent South Africa's smallest biome, yet they are critical spaces for aligning sustainable development goals with carbon mitigation activities and conservation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the productivity and biodiversity of coastal lowland forests in the Dwesa Cwebe nature reserve in the Eastern Cape Province and characterize how estimates differed among alternative allometric equations. Using a complete tree census across six plots in the reserve, a total of 1489 trees were inventoried in 2011 and again in 2016. Aboveground tree carbon averaged 99.8 Mg C ha(-1) (range 77.2-126.9 Mg C ha(-1)) using locally derived equations and 214.6 Mg C ha(-1) using generalized equations. Tree aboveground net primary productivity averaged 1041.8 g C m(-2) y(-1). Forty-eight tree species were identified, including many species important to the livelihoods of local communities for medicinal, ceremonial, and other provisioning services. Overall, this study shows that current conservation activities are concomitant with high tree productivity and high levels of C stocks and biodiversity, including species of local and regional significance. Sustaining forest productivity and biodiversity in the future will be critical for maintaining ecosystem services and enhancing stewardship of forest resources in the region.	[Smithwick, Erica A.

Drivers of support: The case of species reintroductions with an ill-informed public	HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE			English	Article; Early Access						Grizzly bear; cognitive hierarchy; public opinion; reintroduction; wildlife management	VALUE ORIENTATIONS; BIASED ASSIMILATION; ATTITUDES; KNOWLEDGE; WILDLIFE; VALUES; MODEL; BEARS; CONSERVATION; PERCEPTIONS	Successful rewilding of large carnivores depends on public acceptance, but the public frequently has little awareness about wildlife and specific reintroduction proposals. This article evaluated the determinants of public support for grizzly bear reintroduction in California to understand how value orientations, political ideology, and demographics predict attitudes when the public has little species-specific knowledge. We surveyed 980 Californians, showing that value orientations, awareness, and perceptions of costs and benefits shaped attitudes toward grizzly reintroduction, even when only one-quarter of the respondents knew that grizzly bears were extirpated from California. Almost two-thirds of respondents were supportive of reintroduction, rationalizing their support with assessments of societal and ecological costs and benefits. Lack of public awareness, perceptions of personal threats, and willingness to rationalize stated preferences provide cautionary notes to managers. Our results suggest that managers should offer early articulation of costs, benefits, and threats before reintroductions become politicized and opposition becomes entrenched.	[Hiroyasu, Elizabeth H.

Increased sensitivity of subantarctic marine invertebrates to copper under a changing climate - Effects of salinity and temperature	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Multiple stressors; Macquarie island; Toxicity; Temperature; Salinity; Copper	URCHIN STERECHINUS-NEUMAYERI; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; METAL ACCUMULATION; MACQUARIE ISLAND; TOXICITY; CONTAMINANTS; STRESSORS; COPEPOD; ECOSYSTEMS	Stressors associated with climate change and contaminants, resulting from the activities of humans, are affecting organisms and ecosystems globally. Previous studies suggest that the unique characteristics of polar biota, such as slower metabolisms and growth, and the generally stable conditions in their natural environment, cause higher susceptibility to contamination and climate change than those in temperate and tropical areas. We investigated the effects of increased temperature and decreased salinity on copper toxicity in four subantarctic marine invertebrates using realistic projected conditions under a future climatic change scenario for this region. We hypothesised that these relatively subtle shifts in environmental stressors would impact the sensitivity of cold-adapted species to copper. The four test species were: a copepod Harpacticus sp.; isopod Limnoria stephenseni; flatworm Obrimoposthia ohlini; and bivalve Gaimardia trapesina. These species occupy a range of ecological niches, spanning intertidal and subtidal nearshore zones. We predicted that species would differ in their tolerance to stressors, depending on where they occurred within this ecological gradient. Organisms were exposed to the multiple stressors in a factorial design in laboratory based toxicity tests. Sensitivity estimates for copper (LC50) were calculated using a novel statistical approach which directly assessed the impacts of the multiple stressors. In three of the four species tested, sensitivity to copper was amplified by small increases in temperature (2-4 degrees C). The effects of salinity were more variable but a decrease of as little as 2 ppt caused a significant effect in one species. This study provides some of the first evidence that high latitude species may be at increased risk from contaminants under projected future climate conditions. This interaction, between contaminants and the abiotic environment, highlights a potential pathway to biodiversity loss under a changing climate. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we focus on the case of the Mandt's Black guillemot (Cepphus grylle mandril) breeding at Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (79.00 degrees N, 11.66 degrees E) and investigate exposure to legacy and emerging contaminants in relation to individual physiological status, i.e. body condition, oxidative stress and relative telomere length. Despite its benthic-inshore foraging strategy, the Black guillemot displayed overall similar contaminant concentrations in blood during incubation (Sigma PCB11(15.7 ng/g w.w.) > Sigma PFAS(5) (9.9 ng/g w.w.)> Sigma Pesticides(9) (6.7 ng/g w.w.) > Sigma PBDE4 (2.7 ng/g w.w.), and Hg (0.3 mu g/g d.w.) compared to an Arctic migratory seabird in which several contaminant-related stress responses have been observed. Black guillemots in poorer condition tended to display higher levels of contaminants, higher levels of reactive oxygen metabolites, lower plasmatic antioxidant capacity, and shorter telomere lengths; however the low sample size restrict any strong conclusions. Nevertheless, our data suggests that nonlinear relationships with a threshold may exist between accumulated contaminant concentrations and physiological status of the birds. These findings were used to build a hypothesis to be applied in future modelling for describing how chronic exposure to contaminants may be linked to telomere dynamics.

These herbicides are sold as formulations containing adjuvants. Other tank-mixing adjuvants (most often surfactants) are commonly added to these formulations prior to application. According to the manufacturers of agrochemicals, such tank mixes (as these are known in agronomic and horticultural practice) have modified properties and perform better than do the herbicides as used alone. The effects of these tank mixes on the environment and on beneficial arthropods are almost unknown. Therefore, we studied whether a herbicide formulation mixed with adjuvant has modified effects on one of the most common genera of ground-dwelling wolf spiders vis-a-vis the herbicide formulation and adjuvants themselves. Specifically, we studied the synergistic effect in the laboratory on the predatory activity (represented by the number of killed flies) of wolf spiders in the genus Pardosa after direct treatment using the glyphosate-based herbicide formulation Roundup klasik Pro (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Wetcit (R), Roundup klasik Pro (R) in a mixture with the surfactant Agrovital (R), and the surfactants alone. We found that pure surfactants as well as herbicide-and-surfactants tank mixes significantly decrease the predatory activity of Pardosa spiders in the short term even as Roundup klasik Pro (R) did not itself have any such effect. Our results support the hypothesis that plant protection tank mixes may have modified effect on beneficial arthropods as compared to herbicide formulations alone. Therefore, testing of pesticide tank mixes is highly important, because it is these tank mixes that are actually applied to the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They enter the ocean in a variety of sizes and shapes, with plastic microfiber being the prevalent form in seawater and in the guts of biota. Most of the laboratory experiments on microplastics has been performed with spheres, so knowledge on the interactions of microfibers and marine organisms is limited. In this study we examined the ingestion of microfibers by the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida using three different types of polymers: nylon, polyester and polypropylene. The polymers were offered to both symbiotic (with algal symbionts) and bleached (without algal symbionts) anemones. The polymers were introduced either alone or mixed with brine shrimp homogenate. We observed a higher percentage of nylon ingestion compared to the other polymers when plastic was offered in the absence of shrimp. In contrast, we observed over 80% of the anemones taking up all types of polymers when the plastics were offered in the presence of shrimp. Retention time differed significantly between symbiotic and bleached anemones with faster egestion in symbiotic anemones. Our results suggest that ingestion of microfibers by sea anemones is dependent both on the type of polymers and on the presence of chemical cues of prey in seawater. The decreased ability of bleached anemones to reject plastic microfiber indicates that the susceptibility of anthozoans to plastic pollution is exacerbated by previous exposure to other stressors. This is particularly concerning given that coral reef ecosystems are facing increases in the frequency and intensity of bleaching events due to ocean warming. (C) 2019 The Authors.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						selective logging; Amazonia; tropical forestry; ecosystem recovery; disturbance; macroecology	TROPICAL FORESTS; DEFORESTATION; BIOMASS; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION; PERFORMANCE; DISTURBANCE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; SERVICES	Around 30 Mm(3) of sawlogs are extracted annually by selective logging of natural production forests in Amazonia, Earth's most extensive tropical forest. Decisions concerning the management of these production forests will be of major importance for Amazonian forests' fate. To date, no regional assessment of selective logging sustainability supports decision-making. Based on data from 3500 ha of forest inventory plots, our modelling results show that the average periodic harvests of 20 m(3) ha(-1) will not recover by the end of a standard 30 year cutting cycle. Timber recovery within a cutting cycle is enhanced by commercial acceptance of more species and with the adoption of longer cutting cycles and lower logging intensities. Recovery rates are faster in Western Amazonia than on the Guiana Shield. Our simulations suggest that regardless of cutting cycle duration and logging intensities, selectively logged forests are unlikely to meet timber demands over the long term as timber stocks are predicted to steadily decline. There is thus an urgent need to develop an integrated forest resource management policy that combines active management of production forests with the restoration of degraded and secondary forests for timber production. Without better management, reduced timber harvests and continued timber production declines are unavoidable.

Although some studies have demonstrated incongruence in diversity-disturbance relationships (hereafter DDRs) between aboveground vegetation and soil seedbank, the process that causes the difference remains unclear. This incongruence between the two DDRs could result in the decrease in the source of recovery of aboveground vegetation following disturbances being overlooked when only aboveground vegetation is surveyed. Here, we verified a process that species turnover across the disturbance gradient causes the incongruence. Based on a vegetation and seedbank survey, we examined DDRs and species turnover of aboveground vegetation and seedbank along disturbance duration (i.e., excluding years of ungulate grazing). The degree of species turnover was considerably greater in aboveground vegetation than in seedbank; thus, the degree of species turnover along a disturbance gradient caused the difference in DDR between aboveground vegetation and seedbank.

These models take many forms and employ a variety of predictor measures; however, it is frequently unclear which models produce the most accurate predictions. Here, I asked how model accuracy differed among model functions and predictor measures for estimating plant aboveground biomass and whether there were general trends associated with the amount of variability in the predictor measures. In a sagebrush-rabbitbrush meadow in Colorado, USA, I measured the aboveground biomass and corresponding predictor measures (height, cover, and volume) of 50 forb and shrub species representing 19 plant families. I applied four model functions (simple linear, second-degree polynomial, exponential, and power) to each predictor measure for every species, calculated the accuracy of predicted values using cross-validation, and then compared accuracy across model functions and predictors. I found that choice of predictor measure and model function had an interactive effect on model accuracy. Plant cover and volume were more accurate predictors than height and had high accuracy when fitted with simple linear, polynomial, or power regression, but not an exponential function. Cover and height were more accurate predictors when there was greater variability in these measures. This study indicates that accurate predictive models of forb and shrub biomass can frequently be easily obtained using simple linear regression and cover or volume data. Curvilinear functions can have greater predictive accuracy for some species, but not as many as may be expected based on the prevalence of allometric models in the literature.

This study investigated the influence of (i) altered predatory arthropod abundance and community composition (top-down-effects); and (ii) altered leaf nitrogen and phosphorus levels (bottom-up-effects) as possible causes of fluctuations in herbivore abundance and herbivory on the native tree Brabejum stellatifolium in riparian sites that differ in invasion status (near pristine, heavily invaded by Acacia mearnsii, and restored). Species richness, abundance and composition of herbivorous and predatory arthropods were compared between categories. Herbivore and predator abundance, species richness and assemblage composition were significantly influenced by invasion status. As expected, herbivore abundance was significantly and positively correlated to levels of leaf damage. Leaf nitrogen levels were the highest at restored sites where herbivorous arthropods were also most abundant and the abundance of predators was intermediate. These results suggest that altered leaf nitrogen content is likely a key influence for the increased herbivore pressure on B. stellatifolium at sites under pressure from invasive A. mearnsii and its status. Bottom-up influences therefore may be more important than top-down effects on controlling herbivore abundances in these altered riparian environments.

More than iso/anisohydry: Hydroscapes integrate plant water use and drought tolerance traits in 10 eucalypt species from contrasting climates	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate-of-origin; drought tolerance; embolism resistance; isohydricity; stomatal regulation; water relations	LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; STOMATAL SENSITIVITY; HYDRAULIC FAILURE; XYLEM CAVITATION; VULNERABILITY; EMBOLISM; RESISTANCE; RESPONSES; PRESSURE	The iso/anisohydric continuum describes how plants regulate leaf water potential and is commonly used to classify species drought response strategies. However, drought response strategies comprise more than just this continuum, incorporating a suite of stomatal and hydraulic traits. Using a common garden experiment, we compared and contrasted four metrics commonly used to describe water use strategy during drought in 10 eucalyptus species comprising four major ecosystems in eastern Australia. We examined the degree to which these metrics were aligned with key stomatal and hydraulic traits related to plant water use and drought tolerance. Species rankings of water use strategy were inconsistent across four metrics. A newer metric (Hydroscape) was strongly linked to various plant traits, including the leaf turgor loss (TLP), water potential at stomatal closure (P-gs90), leaf and stem hydraulic vulnerability to embolism (P-L50 and P-x50), safety margin of hydraulic segmentation (HSMHS), maximum stomatal conductance (g(smax)) and Huber value (HV). In addition, Hydroscape was correlated with climatic variables representing the water availability at the seed source site. Along the continuum of water regulation strategy, species with narrow Hydroscapes tended to occupy mesic regions and exhibit high TLP, P-L50 and P-x50 values and narrow HSMHS. High g(smax) recorded in species with broad hydroscapes was also associated with high HV. Despite a fourfold difference in Hydroscape area, all species closed their stomata prior to the onset of hydraulic dysfunction, suggesting a common stomatal response across species that minimizes embolism risk during drought. Hydroscape area is useful in bridging stomatal regulation, hydraulic architecture and species drought tolerance, thus providing insight into species water use strategies.

While factors corresponding to transmission via exposure to infectious stages and susceptibility to contracting infections upon contact are relatively well understood, both aspects are rarely investigated simultaneously. Here, we assessed the influence of exposure and susceptibility measures on strongyle nematode reinfection after experimental deworming of Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) (n = 57). We investigated impacts of behaviour (social bonds, grooming and ground use) and physiology (faecal glucocorticoids, urinary C-Peptides, urinary neopterin, gastrointestinal [GI] helminth coinfection) on the likelihood of reinfection, using patch occupancy modelling and information theoretic model selection to determine the best models predicting reinfection patterns. Coinfection was the most consistent risk factor, spending time on presumably contaminated soil, interacting with many partners and forming strong same-sex bonds also tended to increase infection risk. In contrast, strong social bonds with opposite-sex partners had a consistently protective effect. Our results indicate that coinfections could serve as an integrative measure of individual disease susceptibility. Furthermore, we show that social contact contributes to both exposure and susceptibility to environmentally transmitted parasites, with the outcome depending on specific interaction patterns.

Upwelling as the major source of nitrogen for shallow and deep reef-building corals across an oceanic atoll system	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						coral reef exposure; coral trophic strategy; Indian Ocean; Island Mass Effect; isotopic niche ecology; Maldives; particulate organic matter; upwelling	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; GALAXEA-FASCICULARIS; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; MADRACIS-MIRABILIS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; RED-SEA; CARBON; GROWTH	Oceanographic processes shape coral reefs worldwide by redistributing inorganic nutrients and particulate resources over depth. Deep-water upwelling occurs frequently in coral reef ecosystems, but its impact on coral nutrition remains unclear. This study investigated the influence of upwelling on the trophic ecology of three common reef-building corals (Galaxea fascicularis, Pachyseris speciosa and Pocillopora verrucosa) from different reef depths (shallow reef, 10 m, vs. deep reef, 30 m) and reef exposures (oceanic rim vs. Inner Sea) across > 250 km of the Maldives archipelago, Indian Ocean. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of coral hosts, their symbionts and particulate organic matter (POM) were used to characterize coral trophic strategies. Across the Maldives, consistent mean delta N-15 values were recorded in hosts (5.5 parts per thousand) and symbionts (5.2 parts per thousand) of the three coral species from shallow and deep reefs of oceanic and Inner Sea reef exposures. Coral hosts, symbionts and POM from both depths had delta N-15 values that were consistent with the isotopic signature of a deep-water nitrate source transported to surface waters via upwelling. In contrast, a wide range of delta C-13 values (similar to 10 parts per thousand) revealed different trophic strategies and isotopic niches among the coral species. Different mean delta C-13 values of G. fascicularis indicated greater symbiont autotrophy in corals from shallow (-15.5 parts per thousand) compared to deep reefs (-17.6 parts per thousand). Conversely, the mean delta C-13 values of P. speciosa (-15.1 parts per thousand) and P. verrucosa (-17.7 parts per thousand) were not affected by reef depth. These corals maintained consistent trophic strategies over depth, with P. speciosa relying more on autotrophy compared to P. verrucosa. Despite different reef exposure to oceanic waters, coral host and POM delta N-15 and delta C-13 values did not differ between oceanic and Inner Sea reef exposures. Nutritional resources appear to be homogenous in the central Maldives due to atoll-wide water circulation. However, species-specific trophic strategies resulted in diverse patterns of delta C-13 values over depth. Because heterotrophic feeding has been linked to coral host survival through coral bleaching events, understanding the trophic ecology of corals within the reef assemblage can provide insight into species resilience under ocean warming conditions. As a member of the typically competitive Pocilloporidae family, the dependence of P. verrucosa on heterotrophy may help this coral be a future "winner" under sustained ocean warming.

Patchy delivery of functions undermines functional redundancy in a high diversity system	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						animal tracking; coral reef fishes; functional diversity; functional group; grazing pressure; herbivory; spatial resilience; structure-from-motion photogrammetry	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CORAL-REEFS; SPATIAL RESILIENCE; PHASE-SHIFTS; PARROTFISHES; FISHES; COMPETITION; HERBIVORY; SOFTWARE; DYNAMICS	Globally, many ecosystems are being challenged and transformed by anthropogenic climate change. Future ecosystem configurations will be heavily influenced by the critical ecological functions that affect resilience. Robust measures of these functions will thus be essential for understanding and responding to ecological change. Coral reefs are experiencing unprecedented ecological change due to global mass coral bleaching. After bleaching events and other disturbances, herbivorous fishes provide functions that are critical for reef resilience by controlling harmful proliferation of algae. Identifying functional diversity amongst herbivorous fishes has been a mainstay of reef fish research, but it has remained unclear how, and to what extent, functional diversity translates to functional impacts on reefs. Rather than assessing the functional potential of the herbivorous fish community, we explicitly considered the delivery of herbivory to the reef by quantifying, in unprecedented detail, the spatial extent and overlap of feeding areas across different functional groups. Core feeding areas were highly concentrated and consistently covered just 14% of available reef space. Overlap across functional groups was limited, showing high spatial complementarity as functional groups tended to feed next to one another. Thus, the delivery of critical ecosystem processes was patchy, effectively reducing functional redundancy, even in the presence of a diverse fish assemblage. Our findings caution against assumptions of spatial homogeneity in the delivery of critical ecosystem functions. The functional impact of local herbivorous fish assemblages in current approaches may be overestimated, potentially leading to skewed assessments of reef resilience. Our results highlight the need to incorporate collective animal behaviour and spatio-temporal scales into future assessments of ecosystem functions and ultimately ecological resilience.

The potential for mass ratio and trait divergence effects to explain idiosyncratic impacts of non-native invasive plants on carbon mineralization of decomposing leaf litter	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon mineralization; context dependent; idiosyncratic; impact; litter decomposition; non-additivity; non-native; prediction	BACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; LONICERA-MAACKII; SPECIES TRAITS; SOIL; FOREST; RATES; DYNAMICS; AVAILABILITY; FRAMEWORK	Invasive plant effects on litter decomposition tend to be idiosyncratic among species and ecosystems, which may arise from variation in the invader's relative abundance (mass ratio effect), from its relative functional difference to other species (trait divergence effect) and/or from species' litter mixing that causes non-additive decomposition rates relative to single-species decomposition. We use experimental microcosms to quantify the potential for mass ratio and trait divergence to explain effects of invasive litters on carbon mineralization rates of decomposing litter mixtures and to generate non-additive dynamics in two distinct forest litter types. The relative strength and direction of the mass ratio and trait divergence effects on carbon mineralization values were moderated by interactions between each effect and the canopy litter mixture. In both maple-poplar and oak-hickory litter mixtures, we found that the strength of the trait divergence effect increased with increasing proportions (mass ratio) of understorey litter in the litter mixtures, suggesting that interactions between these two mechanisms are important for moderating the influence of understorey invasions. Similarly, the addition of understorey litter always caused synergistic, non-additive impacts on carbon mineralization, increasing carbon mineralization on average by 34%. For both litter mixtures, non-additivity increased with increasing trait divergence between understorey and canopy litter. Our findings show the potential for pronounced context-dependency in the impact of non-native invasive species that arise via multiple mechanism and their interactions. As such, they suggest the necessity of accounting for frequently theorized but infrequently tested mechanisms relating to mass ratio and trait divergence. Accounting should improve understanding of when mass ratio and trait divergence affect ecosystem process rates, and hence build confidence in mechanistic projections of invader impacts.

Trophic consistency of supraspecific taxa in below-ground invertebrate communities: Comparison across lineages and taxonomic ranks	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arthropoda; niche conservatism; phylogenetic signal; soil food web; stable isotopes; taxonomic resolution; taxonomic sufficiency; trophic niche	STABLE-ISOTOPE; NICHE DIFFERENTIATION; MITES ACARI; FOOD WEBS; COLLEMBOLA; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; TRAITS; GUILDS	Animals that have similar morphological traits are expected to share similar ecological niches. This statement applies to individual animals within a species and thus species often serve as the functional units in ecological studies. Species are further grouped into higher-ranked taxonomic units based on their morphological similarity and thus are also expected to be ecologically similar. On the other hand, theory predicts that strong competition between closely related species may result in differentiation of ecological niches. Due to high diversity and limited taxonomic expertise, soil food webs are often resolved using supraspecific taxa such as families, orders or even classes as functional units. Here, we tested the trophic differentiation and consistency of supraspecific taxa across major lineages of temperate forest soil invertebrates: Annelida, Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea and Hexapoda. Published data on stable isotope compositions of carbon and nitrogen were used to infer basal resources and trophic level, and explore the relationship between taxonomic and trophic dissimilarity of local populations. Genera and families had normal and unimodal distributions of isotopic niches, suggesting that supraspecific taxa are trophically consistent. The isotopic niche of local populations varied considerably resulting in large overlap of niches among species. Within the same genus, the effect of species identity on stable isotope composition of populations was not significant in 92% of cases. More than 50% of the variability in Delta N-15 values (trophic level) across lineages was explained by classes and orders, while the variability in Delta C-13 values (basal resources) was explained mostly by families and genera. The variability in stable isotope composition in Chelicerata and Hexapoda was explained by lower taxonomic ranks than in Myriapoda. We compiled a comprehensive list of mean Delta C-13 and Delta N-15 values of invertebrate taxa from temperate forest soils allowing to refine soil food web models when measurements of trophic niches of local populations are not feasible. Supraspecific taxa are meaningful as trophic nodes in food web studies, but the consistency varies among taxa and the choice of taxonomic resolution depends on the research question; generally, identification of taxa should be more detailed in more diverse taxonomic groups.

Implementing conservation measures for the North Atlantic right whale: considering the behavioral ontogeny of mother-calf pairs	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						behavioral ontogeny; activity budget; call rate; passive acoustic monitoring; North Atlantic right whale; vessel collision; marine mammal	EUBALAENA-GLACIALIS; SOUND PRODUCTION; SEA; ABUNDANCE; ECOLOGY; STATE	Understanding the behavioral ecology of a species is fundamental to effective conservation and management efforts. This study quantifies the behavioral ontogeny of North Atlantic right whale mother-calf pairs from birth to weaning spanning three critical habitat areas off the eastern coast of the United States and Canada. Data from 55 focal follows of 34 mother-calf pairs were collected from 2011 to 2015. Resting behaviors dominated the activity budgets for both mother and calf during the first 5 months, putting them at increased risk of vessel collisions. There was an increase in the proportion of active behaviors (travel, foraging, social activity) in both mother and calf as the calf matured. Importantly, the type of active behaviors, in particular surface skim feeding and surface active social behavior, meant that the risk of vessel collision to the pair did not decrease as the calf matured. Mother-calf right whale pairs showed very low calling rates on the calving grounds, suggesting that passive acoustic monitoring may not be an effective mitigation tool during the early months. However, calling rates increase once the pair leave the calving areas with both calf age and activity levels increasing, at which point passive acoustic monitoring becomes valuable. Protective measures need to take these rapid developmental changes throughout calf growth into account to improve the efficacy of protection measures for the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other species where behavioral ecology changes rapidly during maturation.

Relative vulnerability to hurricane disturbance for endangered mammals in Mexico: a call for adaptation strategies under uncertainty	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						hurricane disturbance; mammals; population decline; species traits; vulnerability assessment; extreme climatic events; Mexico; extinction risk	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; DIE-OFFS; CLIMATE; EVENTS; IMPACT; ASSESSMENTS; MANAGEMENT; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; EXPOSURE	Most climate change vulnerability assessments of species focus on characterizing the degree to which species are likely to be affected by changes in mean climatic conditions. Yet, there has been little progress in the explicit assessment of species vulnerability to extreme climatic events (ECEs) which have the potential to cause substantial environmental disturbance and potentially catastrophic declines of wildlife populations. Using a trait-based approach, we assessed the relative vulnerability of populations of wild animal species to hurricanes, focusing on 25 terrestrial mammals at high risk of extinction in Mexico. Our assessment uses biological traits associated with heightened sensitivity (low vagility and territoriality) and low adaptive capacity (restricted diet and habitat specialization) in relation to their predicted exposure to hurricanes, based on records of occurrence of hurricanes in their geographical range over the past 45 years. We found that territoriality was present in most of the species assessed (n = 20) followed by habitat specialization (n = 6), low vagility (n = 6) and diet specialization (n = 3). Two subspecies of spider monkeys Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus and A. g. yucatanensis, two howler monkeys Alouatta pigra and Alouatta palliata mexicana and the silky anteater Cyclopes didactylus all emerged from this assessment as highly vulnerable to population declines from exposure to hurricanes. In the absence of any robust predictive framework for assessing risk to species from ECEs we suggest that the integration of data on hurricane exposure and species' intrinsic biology, as presented here, represents a coherent and informative basis for risk evaluation and the design of possible mitigation strategies.

Evolutionary distinctiveness and conservation priorities in a large radiation of songbirds	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						evolutionary distinctiveness; EDGE metric; IUCN Red List; phylogenetics; Emberizoidea; conservation priorities; threatened species	DARWINS FINCHES; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; DIVERSITY; HOTSPOTS; DIVERSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; BLACKBIRDS; ABUNDANCE; TANAGERS; IMPACTS	Human-induced impacts such as climate change and habitat alterations, coupled with limits on funding, have forced conservation actions into a mode of triage. Although no current method has been agreed upon as the best approach to select species for conservation, many studies have demonstrated the utility of incorporating phylogenetic diversity into these decisions. In many cases, degree of phylogenetic relatedness is thought to provide a measure of functional diversity, and greater phylogenetic distinctiveness is likely linked to ecosystem stability. Despite recent debate over the validity of this notion, phylogenetic information remains an important factor to consider in evaluating species and regions for conservation attention. Emberizoidea is a large radiation of 830 species, representing roughly 17% of all songbirds and 8% of all birds. Species in this clade are found throughout the Americas and occur in all terrestrial biomes in the region. The large distribution of this clade, coupled with its morphological and ecological diversity, makes it an important radiation to study from an evolutionary and conservation perspective. This study provides conservation priorities for all species in Emberizoidea using evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) and Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) values from a pseudoposterior distribution of time-calibrated supertrees. We found that threat level is not correlated with degree of ED, indicating that the most threatened species do not represent a disproportionate amount of ED. In addition, threatened species are slightly clustered across the phylogeny, indicating similar threats may be affecting groups of closely related species such as island radiations or geographically restricted radiations in highly disturbed regions.

Short-term movements and behaviour govern the use of road mitigation measures by a protected amphibian	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						connectivity; dispersal; Triturus cristatus; individual behaviour; migration; underpasses	NEWTS TRITURUS-CRISTATUS; POSTBREEDING MIGRATIONS; CROSSING STRUCTURES; TERRESTRIAL; ECOLOGY; HABITAT; CONNECTIVITY; ORIENTATION; POPULATIONS; MORTALITY	Road mitigation infrastructure for pond-breeding amphibians aims to provide a safe and sustainable passage for individuals between critical habitat patches. However, relatively little is known about how amphibians interact with mitigation systems because of the challenges of documenting movements at sufficiently large sample sizes. The effect of real or perceived barriers to short-term movement could ultimately determine the success or failure of road mitigation schemes. We quantified behavioural responses of the protected great crested newt Triturus cristatus in a complex road mitigation system in the UK. We used fluorescent paint to mark individuals in order to measure distance travelled and trajectory orientation over two seasons (spring when adults migrate to breeding ponds and autumn when newts disperse) and in three components of the mitigation system (fences, tunnel entrances and inside the tunnels). A total of 250 juveniles and 137 adult great crested newts were marked and tracked during 38 survey nights. Adults were individually identified using belly-pattern recognition. There was substantially greater activity along the fences during autumn (82% of newt captures) compared to spring. Triturus cristatus typically moved short distances each night (3.21 m per night in spring and 6.72 m per night in autumn), with a maximum of 25.6 m travelled inside a tunnel. Adult recapture rates were low (9.7%) and only 3% of the newts found along the fences reached the tunnel entrances. Movements were straighter in spring and inside the tunnels and newts had higher crossing rates in autumn compared to spring. Overall, behaviour and seasonal movement patterns significantly influenced the use of the mitigation system, in a way that could impact landscape connectivity for T. cristatus over the long-term. Adequate incorporation of fine-scale movement dynamics could help develop new behavioural models, inform our understanding of amphibian ecology and substantially improve future road mitigation projects.

Here we investigated the underlying biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the relationships between soil C concentration and decomposition rates. We incubated a soil/sand mixture with increasing amounts of finely ground plant residue in the laboratory at constant temperature and moisture for 63days. The plant residues were rye (Secale cereale, C/N ratio of 23) and wheat straw (Triticum spp., C/N ratio of 109) at seven soil C concentrations ranging from 0.38 to 2.99%. We measured soil respiration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, microbial biomass, and potential enzyme activities over the course of the incubation. Rye, which had higher N and DOC contents, lost 6 to 8 times more C as CO2 compared to wheat residue. Under rye and wheat amendment, absolute C losses as CO2 (calculated per g dry soil) increased linearly with C concentration while relative C losses as CO2 (expressed as percent of initial C) increased with C concentration following a quadratic function. In low C concentration treatments (0.38-0.79% OC), DOC decreased gradually from day 3 to day 63, microbial C increased towards the end in the rye treatment or decreased only slightly with straw amendment, and microbes invested in general enzymes such as proteases and oxidative enzymes. At increasing C levels, enzyme activity shifted to degrading cellulose after 15days and degrading microbial necromass (e.g. chitin) after 63days. At the highest C concentrations (2.99% OC), microbial biomass peaked early in the incubation and remained high in the rye treatment and decreased only slightly in the wheat treatment. While wheat lost C as CO2 constantly at all C concentrations, respiration dynamics in the rye treatment strongly depended on C concentration. Our results indicate that litter quality and C concentration regulate enzyme activities, DOC concentrations, and microbial respiration. The potential for non-linear relationships between soil C concentration and decomposition may need to be considered in soil C models and soil C sequestration management approaches.

Watershed urban development controls on urban streamwater chemistry variability	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Configuration; Connectivity; Non-point source; Specific conductance; Streamwater chemistry; Structural equation model; Urban stream syndrome	LAND-COVER DATABASE; STORMWATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN FLUXES; UNITED-STATES; URBANIZATION; CARBON; PATTERNS; RUNOFF; IMPACTS; INFRASTRUCTURE	Watershed urbanization increases the concentrations of major ions in downstream freshwater ecosystems. Non-point source ions from human activities and thechemical weathering of infrastructure are efficiently transported by stormwater runoff through subsurface pipes directly into streams. While the increase in mean streamwater solute concentrations in urban watersheds because of non-point source loading is a commonly documented phenomenon, the temporal dynamics of urban streamwater solute chemistry and its relationship to development patterns is less well understood. We continuously monitored streamflow, temperature, and conductivity as well as bimonthly variation in the solute chemistry of 24 watershed outlets in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan area in North Carolina, USA fortwoyears. Watersheds were selected to have similar proportions of development (10-36% development) while spanning the full measured range in road and stormwater pipe density for urban watersheds in this metropolitan area. We found remarkable temporal variation in the chemical regimes of the urban streams draining this set of watersheds, despite their similar proportion of development. For multiple major ions (SO42-, Cl-, NO3-), bimonthly concentrations varied tenfold across the study streams and temporal variation in streamwater chemical composition increased across watershed road and stormwater pipe density gradients. Total temporal variation in baseflow and stormflow dissolved ions, as measured by the coefficient of variation of specific conductance, was highly correlated with road density after accounting for underlying geology (R-2>0.60). Using structural equation modeling, we found that subsurface piping mediates the relationship between roads and stream chemistry. In watersheds with high stormwater pipe density, streamwater ionic strength was low at baseflow while high and highly variable during event flow. This flashy' chemical signal in those watersheds,mirrors their more responsive hydrographs. In contrast, in our urban watersheds with the lowest pipe density, baseflow ionic strengths were higher, and event flow ionic strengths were lower and less variable. These results suggest that the extent to which pavement is drained by pipes creates a tradeoff between routing urban salts directly to streams via pipes versus indirectly to streams via loading to groundwater. Results of this study demonstrate the importance of considering altered temporal chemical variability, not just elevated solute concentrations, as a key feature of the impact of urbanization on streams. Future urban development design which minimizes the extent of roads and stormwater pipes in watersheds through denser development may be an effective strategy to abate impacts on downstream water quality.

Surveys to estimate reproductive success for large mammals are typically done by visual observations on the ground or from the air and are time consuming, expensive and labor intensive particularly when conducted in remote locations. An alternative to visual verification is remote monitoring of animal movement and locations which can identify and link movement behavior to different types of life history events, such as parturition. We used GPS locations of a large ungulate (moose) to identify a specific behavioral change in the movement pattern that would indicate a calving event. From these data we applied three methods, one of which is a novel technique, to search for localized movement patterns that characterize a calving event for female moose in Sweden (n = 60 moose-years, ground observations) and Alaska (n = 49 moose-years, aerial observations). The three methods include a computerized visual method using Tracking Analyst (R) (TA), a rolling window minimum convex polygon (rMCP), and behavioral change point analysis (BCPA), all of which provided nearly identical results. BCPA confirmed lack of a parturition date for 100% of the animals that were never observed with a calf, whereas the rMCP method yielded 1 false positive. For Sweden, parturition dates inferred using rMCP agreed exactly or +/- 1 day with the dates inferred using BCPA for 98% moose-years whereas TA vs BCPA and rMCP agreed 98% and 100% respectively; for Alaska parturition dates estimated from rMCP and BCPA agreed equally at 94%. In this study we showed that evaluation of wildlife movement patterns from remote monitoring can lead to increased precision and understanding of parturition with minimal bias from neonatal mortality, in addition to understanding spatiotemporal distribution, resource selection, and other behaviors.

Ecological status monitoring and assessment in Greek rivers: Do macroinvertebrate and diatom indices indicate same responses to anthropogenic pressures?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Water pollution; Metrics; Water Framework Directive; Mediterranean; Ecological quality	WATER-QUALITY; BIOTIC INDEXES; RUNNING WATERS; MACROPHYTES; STREAMS; FISH; EUTROPHICATION; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; INFORMATION	Biotic indices based on macroinvertebrates and diatoms are regularly used for ecological status assessment in freshwaters, showing variable responses to anthropogenic pressures. In this work, we investigate the response of each biological quality element (BQE) index (i.e. diatoms and macroinvertebrates) to multiple stressors and compare their responses during ecological status assessments of seasonally variable river ecosystems. A total of 421 samples, collected during a four-year survey for the Greek National Water Monitoring Programme from 195 stream sites throughout Greece, were used. The correlation between macroinvertebrate (HESY2), diatom (IPS) and physicochemical (Ph) indices was tested and the environmental parameters affecting biotic indices were examined. All indices were positively intercorrelated, with IPS showing the highest correlation with the Ph index, confirmed by the fact that IPS was also driven by nutrient concentration and dissolved oxygen. HESY2 was driven by PO4, the extent of agriculture and urbanization, river typology, as well as sediment type and water temperature. The two BQEs, hence biological assemblages, respond differently to local and larger scale pressures; diatoms responded to reach-scale variations of water quality driven by large-scale drivers, such as land uses, to which macroinvertebrates responded. Moreover, macroinvertebrates depended on seasonality, whereas diatoms were independent of seasonality. Subsequently, when macroinvertebrates are absent, or haven't yet recolonize a stream after drought, diatoms can reflect disturbance as they respond to water quality, rather than seasonality. Thus, in Mediterranean rivers, where flow variability is pronounced, the complementary use of both BQEs, although important for ecological status assessment, it could rely solely on the use of diatoms when macroinvertebrates are absent.

Gentoo penguins as sentinels of climate change at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Archipelago, Southern Ocean	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Pygoscelis papua; Long term diet; Stomach content analysis; Western Indian ocean; Oceanography variability	SHRIMP NAUTICARIS-MARIONIS; PYGOSCELIS-PAPUA; PHALACROCORAX-ATRICEPS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; FORAGING ECOLOGY; BREEDING GENTOO; DIET; ISLAND; POPULATION; DYNAMICS	Some upper trophic level predators, such as marine mammals, seabirds and large predatory fish have been shown to be useful sentinels for marine ecosystems. Through their demography, diet and foraging behaviour, ecosystem changes associated with climate change can be monitored. The local marine ecosystem at the Prince Edward Archipelago in the Southern Indian Ocean is heavily influenced by the position of the dynamic sub-Antarctic front (SAF) that varies inter-annually in terms of its influence on the local environment. If the SAF migrates southwards, as climate change models have predicted, the abundance of autochthonous and allochthonous prey found within the vicinity of the archipelago will decrease and increase, respectively. We investigated the diet of an inshore forager at the archipelago, the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, as a possible sentinel to the expected changes in the prey assemblages in local waters, due to the southward migration of the SAF. We collected stomach content samples from gentoo penguins, using the water off-loading technique, monthly over three years (1994-1996) and then annually during 2012, 2014 and 2015. Prey assemblages within the diet was found to coincide with the proximity of the SAF to the Prince Edward Archipelago as well as the annual life cycles of prey. Due to the plasticity these penguins exhibit in their diet and foraging behaviour, we suggest that they are important sentinel species for the local marine ecosystem of the Prince Edward Archipelago. Regular sample collection from these birds, albeit stomach content samples and/or tissues for stable isotope analysis, should be collected so that variability in the ecosystem can be easily monitored.

The devil is in the detail: Metabarcoding of arthropods provides a sensitive measure of biodiversity response to forest stand composition compared with surrogate measures of biodiversity	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						DNA metabarcoding; Malaise traps; Surrogate measures of biodiversity; Biodiversity indicators; Forest management; Tree identity	POTENTIAL BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; INDICATORS; PLANTATION; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; EFFICIENCY; TEMPERATE; TAXON	Gauging trends in forest biodiversity and relating these to forest management practice and environmental change requires effective monitoring and assessment of spatio-temporal trends in forest biodiversity. Taxa- and habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity, or 'biodiversity indicators', are commonly used to convey information about the state of the biological community since they can be assessed relatively quickly and cheaply by non-experts. Direct measures of a component of biodiversity are also increasingly feasible using DNA metabarcoding; 'Next Generation Sequencing' has facilitated the rapid characterisation of combined multiple species samples by sequencing their DNA barcodes in parallel, simultaneously reducing the need for taxonomic expertise and the time and cost required to obtain biodiversity data across a wide range of taxonomic groups. We investigated whether biodiversity information obtained from DNA metabarcoding of mass-trapped arthropods and from a range of taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. carabid beetles, vascular plants) provide: 1) similar estimates of alpha and beta diversity and 2) provide similar forest management related conclusions. We also explored how well habitat-based surrogate measures of biodiversity (e.g. stand structure, volume of deadwood) predict observed biodiversity patterns. The study was conducted in Thetford Forest, UK within 15 forest plantation stands (5 Scots pine-oak mixtures, 4 Scots pine and 6 oak monocultures). Our results demonstrated a high level of congruence between the metabarcoding and taxa-based surrogate measures of biodiversity. The wider range of taxonomic groups identified using a metabarcoding approach offered the potential to identify taxa sensitive to the environmental variable that was being manipulated experimentally (i.e. the composition of forest stands). Most habitat-based measures of biodiversity failed to predict species assemblage differences between stands.

In this study, we assess the performance of eight macroinvertebrate groups (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata, Trichoptera, Plecoptera, Ephemeroptera, Crustacea, and Mollusca) as surrogates of the whole aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage in 49 localities from Northern Africa (Tunisia). Specifically, we aimed to test i) the congruence of the patterns of species richness and composition among these eight groups (at species level) in order to propose which groups could be accurate as indicators of diversity of the whole community, and ii) if higher-taxon levels (genera or families) are suitable for predicting overall species richness and composition in these ecosystems. In total, we found 72 families, 157 genera and 280 species. Our results show a high congruence between the patterns of species richness and composition of Ephemeroptera, Coleoptera (even at higher taxonomic levels, especially genus) and the whole community. Thus, we recommend the use of these two groups as surrogates of macroinvertebrate diversity in inland aquatic ecosystem in the study area. They can be used for both i) the rapid and inexpensive monitoring of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems and ii) conservational studies in order to identify areas with the highest values of freshwater biodiversity in Mediterranean areas. Finally, high values of congruence among taxonomic levels were found suggesting that, in general, higher taxa can be used as biodiversity surrogates for cost-effective practical survey in Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems from Northern Africa.

Most longicorn species are data deficient, and many are considered at risk. Longicorn beetle monitoring often relies on lethal methods and are time and cost intensive. In this study we investigated the use of generic pheromones in conjunction with species- and Bayesian community-level hierarchical modeling that accounts for imperfect detection, as a rapid tool for monitoring longicorn beetle diversity. Using 50 flight-intercept traps deployed for one month at two sites in a traditionally-maintained landscape in SW Romania, we implemented non-lethal surveys to evaluate the longicorn species abundance and estimate beetle occupancy. We captured and identified 2370 longicorn beetles of 28 species; two species, Phymatodes testaceus and Plagionotus detritus accounted for more than 1/2 of the captures, and nine species were only captured once. However the most abundant species estimated in our area was Mesosa nebulosa (36-60 individuals per trap location). Using co-occurrence of high and low detection species, as well as habitat associations, we estimated that 39 species (30-57 95% posterior interval) were present at any given site, suggesting that our survey did not capture the full longicorn diversity. Beetle diversity, occurrence and abundance were associated with higher tree density, volume of dead wood and number of stumps, and lower canopy cover. Our methods allowed to discriminate between common species with low detection, and rare species, and are a promising tool for the rapid assessment of longicorn beetle diversity, as well as the conservation status of listed and non-listed species.

However, there is no simple and rapid method to assess the pollination services over large areas. Here, we introduce two new indices to measure pollination services and its temporal stability in farmland, the Pollination Services Index and the index of Temporal Variation in Pollination Services, that only require readily available data, namely crop yield and crop pollinator dependence. The philosophy of these indices is to compare at a given site the standardized yield, or the temporal variation in yield, among crops that have different levels of dependence on animal pollinators for their production. We expect that where there is a shortage of pollinators, standardized crop yields should decrease, and temporal variation in crop yields should increase, with increasing dependence on pollinators. The Pollination Services Index in a given area is thus defined as the slope of the linear regression between standardized crop yield and crop pollinator dependence; the Temporal Variation in Pollination Services is defined as the slope of the linear regression between the inter-annual coefficient of variation of crop yield and crop pollinator dependence. We calculated these two indices in France, where we show extensive spatial variation in the estimated pollination services. We further show that this variation in the Pollination Services Index is negatively correlated with the index of Temporal Variation in Pollination Services, and positively correlated with habitat quality for pollinators. At a spatial resolution of administrative departments (ca. 5,800 km(2)), the results show that intensive farming is positively correlated with higher Temporal Variation in Pollination Services but is not significantly associated with the Pollination Services Index, probably due to multicollinearity issues. Despite some limitations that deserve further attention, these indices may constitute promising, cost-effective tools to highlight regions of pollination deficit over large areas.

Here we analyze the long-term impacts of extirpations and invasions on both phylogenetic and taxonomic alpha and beta diversity of fish assemblages in Chinese isolated lakes. Data of fish assemblages in 15 lakes were grouped into three periods spanning the last 75 years: historical, intermediate and current periods. We partitioned phylogenetic beta diversity into turnover and nestedness component, and examined how introductions and extirpations led to temporal changes in alpha and beta diversity using linear regression and multiple regression models on distance matrices, respectively. Introductions and extirpations caused an increase of phylogenetic diversity (Delta(+)) and phylogenetic unevenness (Lambda(+)) within the lakes, but the phylogenetic dissimilarity between lakes declined. Such trend, resulting from 60 years introductions and extirpations, was mainly due to a decline of the phylogenetic turnover, indicating that the replacement of native endemic species by widespread exotic species was the main driver of the observed phylogenetic homogenization. Temporal changes in phylogenetic and taxonomic dissimilarities were positively correlated, and taxonomic homogenization causes phylogenetic homogenization in ca. 60% of the lake pairs. Nevertheless, taxonomic homogenization turns to phylogenetic differentiation in one third of lake pairs due to the extirpation of the closely-related species and the introduction of distinct exotic species belonging to different lineages among lakes. Therefore, measuring phylogenetic diversity changes provides complementary information to taxonomy, and gives support to the Darwin's naturalization hypothesis stipulating that species distantly related to natives easily establish in their introduction range. Our results demonstrate that half a century of anthropogenic disturbance was sufficient to blur the phylogenetic distinctiveness among lakes that resulted from the last 5 million years evolutionary history of the Yun-Gui plateau.

The objective of the present study was to identify the factors that influence interannual variations in the somatic growth rate of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Baltic Sea. This work covers otolith samples collected from commercial catches and during scientific surveys from 1951 to 2017 in the Polish zone of the southern part of the Baltic. Otolith increment widths, which represent changes in fish growth, were analyzed with linear mixed models to investigate different intrinsic and extrinsic sources of fish growth variation. The stock biomass of pelagic species (herring and sprat Sprattus sprattus), sea surface temperature, Baltic Sea Index and land precipitation over the catchment area were considered potential predictors of herring growth. Methods to identify the optimal time window for environmental factors were incorporated in the modeling. Moreover, a wavelet coherence analysis, tests for identification of regime shifts in fish growth and a spatial correlation analysis were applied to the data. The developed multidecadal otolith-based biochronology showed that the growth of Baltic herring is under the strong influence of interspecific competition between herring and sprat, but the biochronology also indicated a high correlation with precipitation patterns over the runoff area and hydrological conditions within the Baltic Sea. A detailed investigation revealed that the relationships between herring growth and abiotic conditions or other ecosystem components can vary over time. The recognized complex ecological effects on herring growth necessitate the application of holistic ecosystem-based approaches for sustainable management and exploitation of small pelagic fish resources.

The length and angle of vectors defined by ratios of enzyme activities (BG/(NAG + LAP) vs. BG/AP) were used to indicate relative microbial investments in C- (length), and N- and P- (angle) acquiring enzymes. Our results showed that N addition significantly increased AP activity by 176%, 116%, 220% and 268%, decreased LAP activity by 39%, 70%, 67% and 99%, but increased NAG activity by 185%, 137%, 164% and 118% in non-degraded, moderately degraded, severely degraded and extremely degraded grassland, respectively. Decreasing enzyme N: P and C: P ratios and increasing vector angle with the increasing levels of degradation suggested that temperate grassland could transform into P-limitation (angles > 45 degrees) from N-limitation (angles< 45 degrees). N addition significantly decreased the enzyme N: P ratio and increased the vector angle (angles > 45 degrees), indicating that N addition further aggravated P limitation. Our findings highlight that grassland degradation would affect the responses of soil EEAs to N addition and cause nutrient limitation transformation. Soil ES might be a sensitive indicator mediated by soil microorganisms to the relative resource limitation in temperate grasslands.

Phytoplankton assemblage composition as an environmental indicator in routine lentic monitoring: Taxonomic versus functional groups	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Functional group; Phytoplankton; Monitoring; Reservoirs	CYANOBACTERIAL DOMINANCE; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; SEASONAL-VARIATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; ATLANTIC FOREST; LAKE; GROWTH; LIGHT; ECOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION	Phytoplankton community assessment using functional groups is a powerful tool for lake and reservoir biomonitoring, but its efficiency has only been tested in intersite, low-frequency datasets. Here, we took advantage of a gradient of spatially close, but environmentally contrasting, meso-to hypereutrophic reservoirs in Southeast Brazil, to compare the efficiency of morphology-based functional classification (MBFC), phylum-level, and species-level classification for high-frequency, i. e. monthly, biomonitoring. Monitoring of water physical and chemical characteristics revealed the presence of two independent environmental gradients, with the first being related to total phosphorus and suspended solids concentrations, as well as Secchi depth, and the second related to dissolved inorganic nitrogen, water temperature and pH. The species approach had the highest power to explain environmental variation in assemblage structure (21% vs 16% and 17%, in the phylum and MBFC approaches). Although both simplified classifications showed similar explanatory power, MBFC allowed a better differentiation of reservoir assemblages. As the MBFC approach is also the least resource intensive, it may be preferable for routine biomonitoring, or to process large sample numbers. Nonetheless, species-level classification provided the most detailed information on assemblage dynamics and is therefore an important option for scientific studies.

Temporal variability in stream fish assemblage metrics and implications for long-term monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Fish; Acid deposition; Temporal variability; Monitoring; Streams	NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; BROOK TROUT POPULATIONS; NEW-YORK; SINGLE-PASS; ACIDIC DEPOSITION; EPISODIC ACIDIFICATION; ADIRONDACK MOUNTAINS; STATISTICAL POWER; RECOVERY; TRENDS	High natural variability in the condition of fish communities in headwater streams complicates detection of long-term responses to changes in water quality. As a result, little is known about the impacts and recovery of fishes from acid deposition in streams of New York. Twenty-one fish metrics from annual electrofishing surveys at 13 streams sites in the Catskill and Adirondack mountains were assessed to quantify temporal variability and identify effective monitoring strategies for detecting change in headwater stream fish assemblages. Metrics included the density and biomass of Brook Trout populations and entire fish communities using length-, area-, and effort-based standardization techniques. Linear mixed models were used to estimate changes in coefficients of variation (CV) for different classes of metrics and standardization techniques, and a simulation-based power analysis was conducted to assess differences in statistical power for each metric with various sampling designs. Metric CV varied significantly as a result of standardization technique and whether metrics were calculated for the entire community or Brook Trout only. The sampling effort necessary to detect a 30% change with power of 0.80 was strongly correlated with CV (R-2 = 0.77). The number of sampling events at the 13 sites needed to detect this change ranged from 1 to > 60, suggesting metric selection can strongly affect statistical power and the resources necessary to detect change. Thus, metric selection is a complex decision that must consider study objectives and biological relevance, in addition to natural variability and statistical power. However, adequate statistical power was achieved at relatively small sample sizes using certain metrics, indicating that fish communities in headwater streams can be a valuable component of long-term assessments of acidification impacts and recovery.

Using landscape composition and configuration metrics as indicators of woody vegetation attributes in tropical pastures	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Agricultural landscapes; Isolated trees; Landscape matrix; Remote sensing; Silvopastoral systems; Woody plant species composition	SPECIES RICHNESS; HABITAT SELECTION; SCATTERED TREES; PLANT DIVERSITY; RAIN-FOREST; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; ASSEMBLAGES	Seasonally dry tropical forests in the Neotropics are typically transformed into pasture-dominated landscapes that represent a major threat to habitat biodiversity. Developing alternative management strategies that minimize the loss of native biota in agricultural landscapes is crucial. In a fragmented landscape in Veracruz, Mexico, we analyzed the community attributes of woody vegetation present in pastures in which different types of arboreal elements are common. We hypothesized that different landscape patterns, distinguishable using GIS land-cover maps, would be linked to woody plant diversity and its spatial variation. We created a detailed map of our study area distinguishing six forest cover types. We sampled the woody vegetation within 16 circular plots (100 m radius) each centered on an isolated fig tree and that varied in the amount of arboreal cover and proximity to remnant forest. We used a multimodel-inference approach to assess the relationship between different landscape metrics and woody vegetation response variables. Forest cover within each plot ranged from 3% to 44%. A total of 1777 woody plants (density = 35.4 plants ha(-1)), belonging to 88 species were recorded. Landscape composition and configuration metrics, particularly the type and amount of arboreal cover, were strong indicators of woody plant richness and abundance, while landscape structural heterogeneity was strongly related to floristic composition. In contrast proximity metrics were weak explanatory variables. Tall canopy forest fragments and isolated trees explained most of the variation in richness and abundance. Results suggest that maintaining 20-40% woody cover within pastures and maximizing the heterogeneity of arboreal elements promotes the conservation of biodiversity in rural landscapes dedicated to livestock. Further, easily obtained landscape metrics can be used as a tool to enhance vegetation assessment and help in the development of more convenient management practices that seek to increase native species richness, while improving landscape connectivity and resilience.

However, few studies examined comprehensively how biodiversity is distributed within and among protected, agricultural and urban land use types in streams. We studied environmental characteristics of streams and patterns of species richness and other community attributes of stream fish communities in these three characteristic land use types in the catchment of the Danube River, Hungary. Land use separated streams to some degree based on their environmental characteristics. However, both between stream environmental and fish community variability were high in most types, and comparable to land use type level differences in case of many streams. A variety of environmental gradients influenced fish community structure rather independently of land use type, which was also influenced by spatial drivers. Non-native fishes modified the structure of native fish communities, especially in agricultural streams, although their modification effect varied more among individual streams than among land use types. In conclusion, land use type proved to be a poor predictor of fish communities in this human modified landscape. We found that even intensively managed areas (i.e. agricultural and urban) can contribute to the maintenance of fish diversity in this biogeographic region, or at least their potential can be comparable to those streams which flow in protected areas. Thus, conservation management should focus on maintaining streams in more natural condition in protected areas and/or use the potential of non-protected agricultural and urban streams in maintaining fish diversity in human modified landscapes.

Species indicators for naturally-regenerating and old calcareous grassland in southern England	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Calcareous grassland; Dispersal limitation; Establishment limitation; Indicator species analysis; Management continuity; Natural regeneration; Passive restoration	LAND-USE CHANGE; EX-ARABLE LAND; SEMINATURAL GRASSLAND; PLANT DIVERSITY; RICH GRASSLANDS; ONE CENTURY; VEGETATION; DISPERSAL; RESTORATION; LANDSCAPE	Habitat restoration requires realistic goals. To naturally regenerate European lowland calcareous grassland, whose extent has severely declined, over a century may be required for vegetation to become indistinguishable from that of old calcareous grassland. Progress of natural regeneration can be characterized using member species of the reference vegetation as indicators of favourable site condition. Chronosequence studies have suggested that calcareous-grassland species differ predictably in their ability to colonize ex-arable land, with some usually colonizing early on, and others in later stages. If such patterns are affected by gradually-attenuating establishment limitation, this would have important implications for restoration practice and indication of progress. Particularly, late-colonizing species might be better indicators of favourable site conditions than early colonizers. To explore these aspects, we have reanalysed chronosequence data previously used to investigate causal mechanisms affecting calcareous-grassland restoration progress. We carried out an indicator species analysis to determine which species are indicative of particular stages of natural regeneration. Using correlation analyses, we tested whether species colonization patterns matched those found by previous chronosequence studies that were geographically more limited or relied on more informal approaches to determine species order of colonization. Correlation analyses were also used to test whether order of colonization could be explained by establishment limitation or by dispersal limitation, or by established plant strategies that underlie such limitations. We identified 30 species as indicative of particular stages of natural regeneration, including nine that specifically indicate old calcareous grassland. Correlation results confirmed high congruence with species order of colonization in previous chronosequence studies, and indicated that establishment limitation plays a role in shaping species order of colonization, potentially mediated through differential stress tolerance. We failed to demonstrate a role of dispersal limitation in shaping order of colonization. Based on our results, we derived three categories of indicator species for passively-restored calcareous grassland, mirroring the regeneration stage during which these species usually colonize. This includes a category labelled by us as 'old-grassland indicators' that achieve notable abundance only in old grassland. We conclude by discussing how such a categorization can benefit the measurement of restoration progress, the tentative identification of old grassland and its conservation, e.g. through linking agri-environment payments to the occurrence of old-grassland indicators, thus fostering positive change in farmer attitudes towards old grassland.

By adopting evolutionary history to guide the search for these suitable surrogates, it is possible to use lineage differences as predictors of biological processes promoting overall diversity. Tropical cave ecosystems are among the least known terrestrial ecosystems, and yet harbour a diverse array of organisms, among which obligate subterranean dwellers (troglobites) stand out as primary targets for conservation. In the present study, we take advantage of a bio-speleological database of iron caves located in south-eastern Amazonia to examine regional patterns of community concordance among the taxonomic and ecological grouping of troglobitic species. Relying on species incidence data and a phylogenetic classification of these species, we estimate the evolutionary distinctiveness weighted by the extinction risk for each of them and relate this measure to community composition, identifying the best taxonomic surrogates of troglobite diversity. We evaluated similarity patterns of community composition based on a Procruste's methodological approach, and then tested the resulting concordance patterns for scale and sampling biases. We also evaluated selected concordance results across spatial and environmental gradients, using a distance-based redundancy analysis. Our results reveal that the ordination of rare species was poorly correlated to the ordination of the evolutionary classification of species, whereas Entognatha and Arachnida together presented high values of concordance. Furthermore, the concordance patterns we depict scale up to the geomorphological features that characterize the region, suggesting their importance in shaping biodiversity patterns in this system. Our findings have important conservation implications, as they show that the current focus on rare species does not guarantee the conservation of evolutionary uniqueness in iron cave ecosystems.

'Ancient forest species' (AFS, i.e. a group of forest vascular plant species that rely on forest continuity) were previously noted as possible indicators of biodiversity hotspots. However, different aspects of the forest continuity may be important for different taxa. Using data from two multi-taxa surveys of central European forests, we examined spatial congruence between the richness of AFS and other forest-dwelling groups in stands that differed in various aspects of forest continuity. We provide evidence for a general positive relationship between the richness of AFS and other forest-dwelling taxa (bryophytes, macrofungi, lichens, beetles, moths and some groups of edaphic organisms) in temperate European forests. The ability of AFS to indicate hotspots of forest biodiversity is not seriously affected by forest management even in the case of long-term intensive and specific management practices such as coppicing. Any easily observable characteristics of the forest environment, excepting the richness of AFS, are unlikely to track exactly the complex effects of forest continuity, habitat quality and the delay in the rise and fall of species diversity of forest communities. Some other perennial plant species associated with beech forests are similar to AFS and regularly occupied the refuges of threatened species. The stands with outstanding biodiversity within the area of deciduous temperate forests can be easily revealed via AFS richness and eventually other similar beech-associated species in the case of beech forests. The retention of all small, mutually isolated refuges of endangered species interspersed within large areas of managed forests may be crucial for the mitigation of biodiversity decline in temperate European forests.

Therefore, land change scientists have called for the development of methods to evaluate various aspects of modelling applications. This article answers the call by giving novel methods to compare three types of land change: 1) reference change during the calibration time interval, 2) simulation change during the validation time interval, and 3) reference change during the validation time interval. We compare these changes by using Intensity Analysis' three levels and the Figure of Merit's four components: Misses, Hits, Wrong Hits and False Alarms. We illustrate the concepts by applying a Cellular Automata - Markov land change model to a case study in northeast Hungary. We used reference maps of five land categories to calibrate the model during 2000-2006, then to validate the simulation during 2006-2012. Intensity Analysis' time interval level shows that the simulation change and the reference change decelerated from 2000-2006 to 2006-2012. Intensity Analysis' category level shows that the simulation losses were less than what a pure Markov chain would have dictated. Intensity Analysis' transition level shows that the model's Markov algorithm simulated correctly that the gain of Forest targeted Agriculture and Wetland. The Figure of Merit's components reveals more allocation error than quantity error. Our collection of metrics show that more error derived from the Cellular Automata algorithm than from the Markov algorithm. We recommend that scientists use Intensity Analysis and the Figure of Merit's components to reveal various fundamental aspects of modelling applications.

The phenological effects of climate change on living organisms have often been tested using first occurrence dates, which may be uninformative and biased. More rarely investigated is how different phases of a phenological sequence (e.g. beginning, central tendency and end) or its duration have changed over time. This type of analysis requires continuous observation throughout the phenological event over multiple years, and such data sets are rare. In this study we examined the impact of temperature on long-term change of passage timing and duration of the spring migration period in birds, and which species' traits explain species-specific variation. Data used covered 195 species from 21 European and Canadian bird observatories from which systematic daily sampling protocols were available. Migration dates were negatively associated with early spring temperature and timings had in general advanced in 57 years. Short-distance migrants advanced the beginning of their migration more than long-distance migrants when corrected for phylogenic relatedness, but such a difference was not found in other phases of migration. The advancement of migration has generally been greater for the beginning and median phases of migration relative to the end, leading to extended spring migration seasons. Duration of the migration season increased with increasing temperature. Phenological changes have also been less noticeable in Canada even when corrected for rate of change in temperature. To visualize long-term changes in phenology, we constructed the first multi-species spring migration phenology indicator to describe general changes in median migration dates in the northern hemisphere. The indicator showed an average advancement of one week during five decades across the continents (period 1959-2015). The indicator is easy to update with new data and we therefore encourage future research to investigate whether the trend towards longer periods of occurrence or emergence in spring is also evident in other migratory populations. Such phenological changes may influence detectability in monitoring schemes, and may have broader implications on population and community dynamics.

Assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on the ecological quality of arid Mediterranean ecosystems (case study from the northwestern coast of Egypt)	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Floristic quality assessment index; Ecological monitoring; Biological indicators; Anthropogenic disturbance index	PLANT-SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FLORISTIC QUALITY; LAND-USE; FORESTED WETLANDS; ASSESSMENT INDEX; VEGETATION; HABITAT; DISTURBANCE; DESERT; ENVIRONMENT	Northwestern coastal desert of Egypt is under pressure of human-induced changes due urban sprawl and agricultural practices leading to negative impacts on existing natural habitats. Assessing the impact of land-use changes on the ecological integrity is crucial for management and conservation efforts in the region. Floristic quality (FQ) assessment indices are important bioassessment tools that can be used to evaluate how anthropogenic changes may influence vegetation quality, species composition and environmental integrity. The approach is primarily stationed on floristic composition and disturbance tolerance at study sites. The objectives of this study were to: 1) study how anthropogenic disturbances due to land use/cover changes in the northwestern coastal desert affected its ecological quality as indicated by FQ indices; and 2) to evaluate the use of FQ indices as tools for characterizing anthropogenic disturbance among the habitats of Mediterranean desert ecosystem. Stands representing the main habitats were surveyed during 2011 through 2015 and data were compared to historic data collected before the developmental activities. The study revealed a trend of decline with time in the floristic quality of the study area as was indicated by floristic quality measures used (mean coefficient of conservatism, FQAI, and adjusted FQAI). Similar trend of decline in native and perennial species richness, and increase in non-native and annual species richness was observed for the period investigated from 1980s to time. At the habitat level, similar trend of decline in the floristic quality was observed, with the current time attaining the least values of FQ indices for all the habitats. The anthropogenic disturbance index (ADI) was developed in the current study as a quantitative measure of the level of disturbance and as an indicator to evaluate site's ecological condition. The ADI exhibited significant negative relationship with the FQ indices, revealing that it can be recognized as useful index of anthropogenic disturbance that would complement the use of FQ indices in evaluating site ecological condition. The high association between ADI and the adjusted FQAI compared to the FQAI, confirms that the former signals the level of disturbance better than later. Although the adjusted FQAI has been developed and used in assessing vegetation quality of wetland, the current study revealed that it can be employed successfully for assessing and monitoring changes in vegetation quality and ecological integrity of deserts and arid ecosystems. For full and comprehensive evaluation of site's ecological condition, the use of multiple bioindicators is recommended.

While the spring migration phenology of birds has been widely studied, our understanding about the mechanisms underlying autumn migration is limited. Frost is an indicator of cold weather, food scarcity, and water unavailability, but how frost drives the autumn departure of migratory birds has not yet been quantified. In this study we propose the 'frost wave hypothesis', which posits that the autumn departure of waterfowl is driven by a successive wave of the onset of frost. Using bird satellite tracking data and generalized linear mixed models, we analyze how the departure probability of two waterfowl species during autumn migration is affected by frost, accumulated temperature, food, snow, ice, short-term weather conditions (i.e., wind, temperature and precipitation), remaining migration distances, relative stopover duration, and flight distances between stopover sites. We find that bird autumn departure probability sharply increases after the first frost spell when the accumulated temperature reaches 0 degrees C, facilitated by surface meridional wind and longer remaining migration distances. We underline the dominant effect of frost on autumn departure, as birds tend to leave even under head wind if the time lag since the onset of frost is large. Time constraints that trigger southward departure are likely to be stronger when migrating birds are still far from their wintering site. By riding the frost wave, birds manage to maximize stopover site utilization while escaping harsh environmental conditions. Our findings improve the understanding of annual avian migration and help quantify the impact of global climate change on migratory waterfowl.

A new null model approach to quantify performance and significance for ecological niche models of species distributions	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						AUC; discriminatory ability; effect size; Maxent; Myiopsitta monachus; null models; omission error rate; overfitting; significance; species distribution modelling	SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; CROSS-VALIDATION; CLIMATE ENVELOPE; ASSOCIATIONS; COMPLEXITY; MAXENT; CHALLENGES; INSIGHTS	Aim Ecological niche modelling requires robust estimation of model performance and significance, but common evaluation approaches often yield biased estimates. Null models provide a solution but are rarely used in this field. We implemented an important modification to existing null model tests, evaluating null models with the same withheld records that were used to evaluate the real model. We built and evaluated models across a range of modelling scenarios and for various performance measures using the algorithm Maxent and the monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus). Location Native range in Southern America and global invasions predominantly in North/Central America and Europe. Methods We tested the ability of models built under 15 scenarios (five sets of calibration records and three settings that varied the level of model complexity) to predict spatially independent evaluation data in the invaded range (in effect, testing the models under spatial transfer). We quantified performance with measures of discriminatory ability and overfitting based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the omission error rate. We estimated null distributions of these measures and calculated effect size and significance. We determined how these estimates varied across modelling scenarios, comparing with two tests existing in the literature. Results Performance varied starkly across modelling scenarios. As expected, the measures of overfitting agreed with each other and provided different information than that of discriminatory ability. However, high performance per se did not show strong association with high effect size and significance. Main Conclusions Ecological niche models should be assessed with measures of effect size and significance based on appropriate null distributions, in contrast to several approaches existing in the literature. The proposed approach using independent evaluation data, implemented with our accompanying code and R package, allows such estimates for either the same or a different region/time period, and it merits use and continued development.

Yet numerous phylogeographical studies of EBLF plants have inferred glacial refugia north of this area. Here, we aim to further elucidate the Quaternary dynamics of EBLFs using the widespread shrub Lindera aggregata as model. Location Subtropical China. Taxon Lindera aggregata (Sims) Kosterm (angiosperms). Methods Four chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments and 15 low-copy nuclear genes (LCGs) were sequenced in 19 populations. The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) was estimated using secondary calibrations. Bayesian algorithms were used to infer population clustering, phylogeny and divergence time. Historical gene flow was estimated using a maximum-likelihood algorithm. Potential habitats at present and during the LGM were predicted using ecological niche modelling. Results The TMRCA estimate was 1.78 Myr. We observed a shallow cpDNA network organized around one dominant haplotype. The LCGs revealed three distinct genetic clusters that reflected contrasting historical population dynamics. The most ancient cluster was located south of the Nanling and Wuyi Mountains and indicated long-term population persistence in multiple refugia. The area further north was occupied by two disjunct clusters that dated back to the LGM and showed signatures of a rapid northward expansion from two refugia. We detected noteworthy pollen-mediated secondary admixture between all three clusters including somewhat preferential southward gene flow. Main conclusions Lindera aggregata represents a rare example of extensive post-glacial range expansion across the EBLF biome (expansion-contraction model) that contrasts with its generalized long-term population stability in the southernmost range parts. Our findings also provide rare evidence for noteworthy post-glacial gene flow into long-term refugial populations. They correspond relatively well with palaeo-biome reconstructions and support the hypothesis that the EBLF has undergone extensive post-glacial community reshuffling.

This study investigates the effects of disturbances such as fire, fragmentation and climate on modern-day genetic patterns and clonal structures of trembling aspen at the transcontinental scale. Location North American boreal zone. Taxon Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Methods One thousand two hundred individuals in a 30-site network (40 trees per location) were genotyped with neutral genetic markers and studied in relation to regional differences in climate and surrounding site conditions (aridity, fire cycle, fragmentation). Multiple linear regression models and variance analysis were used to test relationships between genetic indices, structural parameters and the surrounding site factors. Results Overall, a high percentage of single ramet clones (SRC) and clonal diversity was detected and assumed to be the consequence of multiple sexual reproduction events that took place at all sites, together with suckering, which shapes the clonal structure of populations. Neutral genetic diversity and clonal structure suggested no substantial differences among sites, which were categorized into climate moisture index (CMI) classes; aspen stands across Canada were highly similar from a genetic point of view. Allelic richness (AR) and the average number of alleles (N-a) varied significantly among clonal organization groups, and landscape fragmentation and a higher frequency of fires showed a negative influence on the levels of genetic diversity. Main conclusions Our results are inconsistent with the idea that the genotypic diversity of trembling aspen is related to the intensity of disturbance within the boreal forest. It appears that species-specific disturbance responses and post-fire recruitment mechanisms are more important than dominant ecological factors, such as climate and fire regimes, in shaping distribution-wide patterns of neutral genetic variation and clonal structure.

This fact is used to identify the origin of timber by means of dendroprovenancing. Yet, dendroprovenancing attempts are commonly only based on ring-width measurements, and largely neglect additional tree-ring variables. We explore the potential of using wood anatomy as a dendroprovenancing tool, and investigate whether it increases the precision of identifying the origin of oak wood. Since different tree-ring variables hold different information on environmental conditions prevailing at specific times of the growing season-which vary between source regions-we hypothesize that their inclusion allows more precise dendroprovenancing. Location Europe, Spain. Taxon Quercus robur L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl., Quercus faginea Lam., Quercus pyrenaica Willd. Methods We sampled four oak species across Northern Spain, i.e. from the Basque country and Cantabria and-in the Basque country-from low to high elevation (topographic/latitudinal gradient). We measured multiple tree-ring variables to (a) extract complementary variables; (b) present statistical relations among them; (c) analyse region-specific variation in their patterns based on time-series of individual trees; and (d) determine underlying climate-growth relationships. Leave-one-out analysis was used to test whether a combination of selected variables allowed dendroprovenancing of a randomly selected tree within the area. Results A combination of latewood width (LW) and earlywood vessel size was used to pinpoint the origin of oak wood with higher precision than ring width or LW only. Variation in LW pinpointed the wood to east and west areas, whereas variation in vessels assigned wood to locations along a latitudinal/topographic gradient. The climatic triggers behind these gradients are respectively an east-west gradient in June-July temperature and a north-south gradient in winter/spring temperatures. The leave-one-out analyses supported the robustness of these results. Main conclusions Integration of multiple wood-xylem anatomical variables analysed with multivariate techniques leads to higher precision in the dendroprovenancing of ring-porous oak species.

Multiple colonizations, hybridization and uneven diversification in Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) lineages on Hawai'i Island	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						ancestral area estimation; community assembly; Hawaii; inter-island colonization; island biogeography; molecular dating; species radiations	LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; SANDALWOODS SANTALUM; MODEL SELECTION; HYBRID ORIGIN; EVOLUTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; INFERENCE; RADIATION; FOUNDER	Aim The diversity and composition of species pools within oceanic archipelagos is determined by a combination of colonization, abiotic tolerance, in situ diversification, biotic interactions and extinction. The signature of biogeographic events and evolutionary processes, however, may be masked by recent coalescence and hybridization between closely related species. We used the species-rich plant genus Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) to investigate the roles of colonization and hybridization in shaping community assemblages on the geologically young Hawai'i Island. Location Hawaiian Islands. Taxon Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae). Methods We sampled 29 Cyrtandra taxa and putative hybrids across the main Hawaiian Islands and generated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from nine single-copy nuclear genes. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, divergence times were estimated using secondary calibrations and island ages, and ancestral area estimation was done using likelihood models. Lastly, we used a Bayesian population assignment test and principal components analysis to infer population genetic structure. Results Cyrtandra colonization of the main Hawaiian Islands appears to have followed the progression rule, whereby the oldest high Hawaiian Islands (Kaua'i and O'ahu) were colonized first, followed by colonization of the younger islands as habitat became available. Hawai'i Island was colonized four times, with two dispersal events from O'ahu and two from Maui Nui. The different colonization events gave rise to significantly uneven numbers of species, and hybridization among the incipient lineages was detected in the form of intermediate genotypes. Main conclusions Our investigation into community assembly in a species-rich plant genus on a geologically young oceanic island revealed a history of multiple colonizations and hybridization among colonizing lineages. The rapid diversification (3.5 species/My) of one of four Cyrtandra lineages on Hawai'i Island may be the result of hybridization between genetically diverse lineages that stem from independent colonization events. Multiple colonization events followed by a merging of lineages may be particularly common during early-stage community assembly on islands and, through the generation of genetic variation, may be especially important for species diversification.

Here, we test taxon cycle predictions within a large avian island radiation, the core Campephagidae and explicitly integrate the concepts of 'supertramps', 'great speciators' and relictualization. Location The Indo-Pacific, Australia, Asia and Africa. Taxon Corvoid passerine birds. Methods We constructed a new time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of the core Campephagidae (cuckooshrikes, cicadabirds and trillers) using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. Ancestral range estimation methods and diversification rate analyses were used to explore the dispersal and diversification history of the group. We used an extensive dataset on wing morphology and range distributions to test for correlations between evolutionary age of species and dispersal capacity, diversification and distribution, while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence. Results The core Campephagidae represents an ecologically homogeneous radiation distributed across the Indo-Pacific, Australia, Southeast Asia and Africa. Its members represent a continuum of dispersal abilities; some species are widespread and undifferentiated ('supertramps') or show strong differentiation of local populations ('great speciators'), and a few are endemic to single islands (relicts). We show that older species relative to younger species inhabit fewer and larger islands at higher elevations. The level of intraspecific variation measured as the number of subspecies also decreases with species age, and is highest in 'great speciators' with intermediate levels of dispersal abilities (as per hand-wing index). Main conclusions Based on trait correlations with species age, we infer phases of range expansion and contraction over millions of years (taxon cycles), within a single monophyletic group of birds. These observations demonstrate reconciliation of the concepts of 'supertramps', 'great speciators' and relictual palaeoendemics within the temporal stages of the taxon cycle.

The contributions of these three functions to species accumulation and their changes through time remain unknown for glacial refugia. Additionally, our understanding of the role these functions played during pre-glacial periods is limited. We test for changes in contributions of functions through time leading to the current diversity patterns using a model refugium and taxon. Location Anatolia, Western Palaearctic. Taxon Freshwater neritid snails (genus Theodoxus). Methods Assessments were made to define molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) for Theodoxus and reaffirm the genus as a suitable model taxon with elevated interspecific diversity in noted glacial refugia. Thereafter, we constructed a time-calibrated multilocus Bayesian phylogeny of mtDNA and nDNA by using both fossil data and published substitution rates. Ancestral area estimation was performed on the phylogeny to define the contribution of the functions through time. Results Accumulation of Theodoxus diversity in Anatolia over the Miocene-Pliocene transition is attributed to the museum function, but its contribution was small as only few divergence events occurred. The cradle function dominated during the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene, when most interspecific diversity built up and extant lineages in Anatolia were established. The sink function acted from the Middle Pleistocene to present-day, but with only a small contribution to the total extant Anatolian interspecific diversity. Main conclusion Our results do not entirely mitigate the role glacial cycles played in species accumulation, but highlight Ice Ages may have been less effective in forcing temperate aquatic interspecific diversity into more opportune areas. The elevated diversity in refugia may rather be the result of earlier in situ diversification. Elevated interspecific diversity attributed to the legacy of glacially forced retreats may need to be re-evaluated in cases where refugia have long and complex geological histories such as Anatolia. These results highlight the importance of considering species accumulation through a temporal perspective to adequately explain present-day biodiversity patterns.

New records of invasive mammals from the sub-Antarctic Cape Horn Archipelago	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Assisted dispersal; Conservation; Free-ranging domestic animals; Islands; Monitoring; Range expansion; Vertebrates	TIERRA-DEL-FUEGO; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; AMERICAN MINK; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; BIOSPHERE RESERVE; DOG-POPULATIONS; CITIZEN SCIENCE; SOUTHERN END; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT	The southernmost archipelago of the Americas is dominated by invasive mammals that outnumber their native counterparts. Despite the relatively low ability of most invasive mammals to cross cold sea water channels, invaders are apparently colonizing new islands. Our objective was to provide an assessment of the expansion of invasive mammals within these sub-Antarctic ecosystems, determine whether human-mediated movement of invasive species is a plausible dispersal mechanism, and identify areas likely to be colonized in the near future. We report a decade of fieldwork (2006-2017) in 44 sites on 13 islands within the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve including opportunistic and systematic camera trapping, carnivore diet, questionnaires, small mammal trapping, and walks/transects. We found new records of invasive mammals on seven islands, particularly for American mink (Neovison vison) and American beaver (Castor canadensis). Interviews with fishermen showed that mink, dogs (Canis familiaris), and small rodents are likely passengers in vessels. Finally, species distribution models revealed that the putative invasive-free Cape Horn National Park (55 degrees S) is suitable for several invasive species, suggesting a high risk of invasion if species are introduced. We conclude that it is urgent to implement barriers to dispersal to prevent further invasion. In the case of dogs and cats (Felis catus), the first step should be control actions that target pet owners. Finally, we highlight the need of systematic, long-term biodiversity monitoring and citizen science in the Cape Horn Archipelago and common conservation guidelines for the terrestrial sub-Antarcticecosystems.

Characterization of drought-induced rapid cold-hardening in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Antarctic Peninsula; Cross tolerance; Drought; Freeze tolerance; Rapid cold-hardening	GOLDENROD GALL FLY; EUROSTA-SOLIDAGINIS; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; FREEZE-TOLERANCE; CRYOPROTECTIVE DEHYDRATION; DESICCATION; LARVAE; MECHANISMS; DIPTERA; STRESS	Survival of the terrestrial midge, Belgica antarctica, on the Antarctic Peninsula is promoted, not only by their adaptations to prolonged exposures to seasonal stresses, but also by their ability to respond to unpredictable changes in their environments. Rapid cold-hardening (RCH) is an extremely swift acclimatory response of insects that occurs within minutes to hours. While the RCH response is most commonly induced by a brief exposure to mildly low temperatures, a similar rapid acclimatory response can also be elicited by exposure to drought. In this study, we characterized this drought-induced RCH in larvae of B. antarctica. Compared to fully hydrated larvae, those desiccated at various relative humidity (R.H.) conditions between 0 and 99% R.H. for 2h had a significantly greater survival (50%) to freezing at-14 degrees C. The amount of water loss varied between 4 and 16% depending on R.H. conditions; however, all treatments were equally effective in eliciting the protective response against freezing stress, and its induction was evident within 30min of desiccation. Lack of substantial changes in body-fluid osmolality or levels of major cryoprotectants suggest that accumulation of these protective solutes is not a primary mechanism of this response. Interestingly, the RCH protection induced by desiccation persisted after larvae were allowed to recover a significant portion of the lost water. Our results indicate that larval midges are highly sensitive to desiccation, capable of swiftly initiating physiological changes in response to a small reduction in their body water content.

Identification assisted by molecular markers of larval parasites in two limpet species (Patellogastropoda: Nacella) inhabiting Antarctic and Magellan coastal systems	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Nacella concinna; Nacella deaurata; Digenean parasites; Molecular markers; Southern Ocean	LIFE-CYCLES; GYMNOPHALLID TREMATODES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NORTH-SEA; ECOLOGY; FELLODISTOMIDAE; EVOLUTION; SEQUENCE; DIGENEA; HOSTS	In the Southern Ocean, many parasites of vertebrates (mainly helminth groups) have been recognized as endemic species, but parasites of marine invertebrates remain almost unknown. It is reasonable to assume that digenean larvae will parasitize gastropods, bivalves, amphipods, and annelids, the usual first and second intermediate hosts for those parasites. Here, using an identification assisted by molecular markers, we report the Digenea species parasitizing the most abundant limpet species inhabiting ice-free rocky intertidal and subtidal zones of the Southern Ocean, viz. Nacella concinna from the Antarctic and Nacella deaurata from the Magellan region. The limpets harbored larval Digenea (two metacercariae and one sporocyst). Phylogenetic analysis based on the multilocus tree supported the hypothesis that N.concinna is parasitized by a species of Gymnophallidae, whereas the limpet N.deaurata is parasitized by Gymnophalloides nacellae and a species of Renicolidae. In addition, differences in prevalence and intensity were also recorded between the two compared host species and also from other congeneric species. This new knowledge in parasite species in marine invertebrates from the Southern Ocean reveals the presence of a particular parasite fauna and confirms the utility of molecular tools to identify biodiversity still scarcely known.

Energy depletion of embryos and yolk-sac feeding larvae of the liparid snailfish Careproctus pallidus (Vaillant 1888)	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Energy content; Snailfish; Ontogeny; Beagle channel	FISH; ENERGETICS; ALLOCATION; DENSITY; LIFE	The snailfish, Careproctus pallidus, is a liparid fish that spawns within the branchial chambers of the king crab Lithodes santolla and develops its embryonic stages inside the chambers until it forms a well-developed free-living yolk-sac feeding larvae hatch. The aim of this work was to explore the decrease in energy content of C. pallidus during its early development. Five egg masses with embryos in cleavage stage were extracted from the branchial chambers of five different king crabs and kept in aquaria through hatching until complete absorption of the yolk-sac. To monitor energy content during development, subsamples of eggs (in cleavage, tail-bud, and late embryo stages) and larvae [1, 13, 20-22 and 24-26days post-hatch (DPH)] were removed. Each stage of development (eggs and larvae) was weighed (wet weight), counted (N) and dried at 60 degrees C. Both energy density (ED) and energy content (EC) per individual (egg or larva) were measured. Significant differences in ED and ECi were observed among the early stages of C. pallidus, although pairwise comparisons differed. From the earliest developmental stage (cleavage) to a larva of 24-26 DPH, the ED of C. pallidus decreased by approximately 40% and the ECi by 87%. Compared with other marine fish species, C. pallidus seems to begin life with lower energy if size of egg, incubation period, and degree of development until it reached the hatching stage are considered. Thus, the energy allocation during the early development of this liparid fish with a particular reproductive strategy is discussed.

Because interactions between communities above and below the ground drive key ecosystem processes, they can profoundly influence ecological succession trajectories. However, relatively little empirical information is available for plant-microbial diversity linkages during ecological restoration. Here, using the Illumina platform for bacterial and fungal sequencing, we investigated linkages between soil microbial and plant diversity across a 30-year chronosequence of restored grasslands on the Loess Plateau in Northwestern China. The results showed that plant, bacterial, and fungal species richness all increased with increased years of grassland restoration, during which their community compositions shifted among six different habitats. The microbial community assembly data were integrated into a co-occurrence network analysis, revealing greater network complexity in the late restoration stage (25 and 30 years). The alpha and beta diversities of both the bacterial and fungal communities were significantly and positively correlated with plant communities. Bacterial community composition was governed primarily by soil edaphic factors and deterministic processes, whereas fungal community composition was structured mainly by plant community composition and both deterministic and stochastic processes. This evidence strongly suggests that different ecological processes shaped bacterial and fungal communities during ecological restoration of the grasslands. Our results provide insight into the aboveground-belowground associations of restored habitats, which may have implications for ecological restoration practices and biodiversity maintenance in arid and semiarid grassland ecosystems.

FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CONSERVATION	Conservation organizations are increasingly aware of the need to motivate pro-environmental behavior by connecting people with nature. However, to maximize the effectiveness of the limited resources available, there needs to be a better understanding of the variability in people's connection to nature shown at different ages. We examined connection to nature among people aged 5-75 years, using two popular measures, in a cross-sectional UK sample, based on the hypothesis that there would be clear, age-related patterns in people's connection to nature, with specific "breakpoints" associated with differences in feelings of connection. Data were collected across a variety of locations. Analysis of generalized additive models revealed similar age-related patterns for both measures, with connection declining from childhood to an overall low in the mid-teens, followed by a rise to the early 20s and reaching a plateau that lasts to the end of the lifetime. Both measures also showed that females generally had higher connection scores than males. These findings have implications for conservation action.

Contrasting human influences and macro-environmental factors on fire activity inside and outside protected areas of North America	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						human footprint; MaxEnt; land use; altered fire regimes; adaptive fire management; wilderness	SIERRA-NEVADA; REGIME SHIFTS; CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; WILDFIRE; FOREST; LAND; CONSERVATION; IMPACTS; AFRICAN	Human activities threaten the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) in achieving their conservation goals across the globe. In this study, we contrast the influence of human and macro-environmental factors driving fire activity inside and outside PAs. Using area burned between 1984 and 2014 for 11 ecoregions in Canada and the United States, we built and compared statistical models of fire likelihood using the MaxEnt software and a set of 11 key anthropogenic, climatic, and physical variables. Overall, the full model (i.e. including all variables) performed better (adjusted area under the curve ranging from 0.71 to 0.95 for individual ecoregions) than the model that excluded anthropogenic variables. Both model types (with and without anthropogenic variables) generally performed better inside than outside the PAs. Climatic variables were usually of foremost importance in explaining fire activity inside and outside PAs, with anthropogenic variables being the second most important predictors, even inside PAs. While the individual contributions of anthropogenic variables indicate that fire activity decreased as of function of increasing human footprint, the anthropogenic effects were often substantially greater than those of physical features and were comparable to or even greater than climatic effects in some densely developed ecoregions, both outside and within PAs (e.g. Mediterranean California, Eastern Temperate Forest, and Tropical Wet Forests). Together, these results show the pervasive impact of humans on fire regimes inside PAs, as well as outside PAs. Given the increasing attractiveness of PAs, the implications for adaptive fire management beyond the concept of naturalness in the PAs are discussed. Our assessment of human-altered fire activity could serve as an indicator of human pressure in PAs; however, we suggest that further analysis is needed to understand specific interactions among fire, human pressures, and the environmental conditions at the scale of PAs.

However, in many cases, predictors are measured at a finer resolution than the ecological response. We therefore require data aggregation methods that avoid loss of information on fine-grain heterogeneity. We present a data aggregation method that, unlike current approaches, reduces the loss of information on fine-grain spatial structure in environmental heterogeneity for use with coarse-grain ecological datasets. Our method contains three steps: (a) define analysis scales (predictor grain, response grain, scale-of-effect); (b) use a moving window to calculate a measure of variability in environment (predictor grain) at the process-relevant scale (scale-of-effect); and (c) aggregate the moving window calculations to the coarsest resolution (response grain). We show the theoretical basis for our method using simulated landscapes and the practical utility with a case study. Our method is available as the grainchanger r package. The simulations show that information about spatial structure is captured that would have been lost using a direct aggregation approach, and that our method is particularly useful in landscapes with spatial autocorrelation in the environmental predictor variable (e.g. fragmented landscapes) and when the scale-of-effect is small relative to the response grain. We use our data aggregation method to find the appropriate scale-of-effect of land cover diversity on Eurasian jay Garrulus glandarius abundance in the UK. We then model the interactive effect of land cover heterogeneity and temperature on G. glandarius abundance. Our method enables us quantify this interaction despite the different scales at which these factors influence G. glandarius abundance. Our data aggregation method allows us to integrate variables that act at varying scales into one model with limited loss of information, which has wide applicability for spatial analyses beyond the specific ecological context considered here. Key ecological applications include being able to estimate the interactive effect of drivers that vary at different scales (such as climate and land cover), and to systematically examine the scale dependence of the effects of environmental heterogeneity in combination with the effects of climate change on biodiversity.

Despite the growing demand for digital environmental maps, scarcity of environmental field samples to be used as input data often constrains the accuracy of such maps, especially for soils. We developed and tested a method that combines information on species-environment associations and the spatial distribution of indicator species (as retrieved from repositories such as GBIF) to improve mapping accuracy of environmental variables. Our approach includes: (a) Compile field data on the environmental variable of interest (direct environmental data) and documented occurrences of the species to be used as indicators; (b) define species optima for the environmental variable; (c) use georeferenced records of the indicator species to calculate species-based environmental values (indirect environmental data); (d) generate maps using direct and indirect environmental data as input data for interpolation; (e) validate the maps. We applied the method to map the concentration of exchangeable base cations in Amazonian soils using fern and lycophyte species as indicators. Including soil values that had been indirectly estimated using indicator species represented a 12-fold increase in the number of input data points used for mapping. At the same time, map accuracy improved considerably: the correlation between mapped soil cation concentration estimates and field-measured values from an independent validation dataset increased from r = 0.48 to r = 0.71. Knowledge on species-environment relationships can be useful for modelling ecologically relevant environmental variables in areas where species occurrence data are more readily available than direct environmental measurements. The method works even with haphazard species occurrence points obtained from public repositories such as GBIF and can be applied to other environmental variables and other indicator groups, provided that the environmental variable of interest is relevant as a determinant of species occurrences in the indicator group. The Amazonian soil cation concentration maps produced (available at ) can be used as digital layers in species distribution and habitat modelling, and to guide conservation actions in Amazonia.

Here, we present the RZooRoH R-package that implements an efficient and accurate model-based approach to identify HBD segments. The underlying hidden Markov model partitions the genome-wide individual autozygosity into different age-related HBD classes while accounting for genotyping errors and genetic map information. The RZooRoH package is user-friendly and versatile, accepting either genotyping or sequencing (including low-coverage) data in various formats. Through numerical maximization and parallelization, computational performances were improved compared to our initial Fortran implementation of the model. The package allows to evaluate and compare various models defined by their number of HBD classes and it also provides several graphical functions that help interpretation of the results. RZooRoH is an efficient tool that proves particularly suited for sub-optimal datasets (e.g. low marker density, individual low-coverage sequencing, uneven marker spacing) and for individuals from populations with complex demographic histories.

As interest in the community structure of aquatic life is growing, there is need for more standardized and replicable methods for acquiring underwater census data. Here, we propose a novel approach, Point-Combination Transect (PCT), which makes use of automated image recording by small digital cameras to eliminate observer and identification biases associated with available UVC methods. We conducted a pilot study at Lake Tanganyika, demonstrating the applicability of PCT on a taxonomically and phenotypically highly diverse assemblage of fishes, the Tanganyikan cichlid species-flock. We conducted 17 PCTs consisting of five GoPro cameras each and identified 22,867 individual cichlids belonging to 61 species on the recorded images. These data were then used to evaluate our method and to compare it to traditional line transect studies conducted in close proximity to our study site at Lake Tanganyika. We show that the analysis of the second hour of PCT image recordings (equivalent to 360 images per camera) leads to reliable estimates of the benthic cichlid community composition in Lake Tanganyika according to species accumulation curves, while minimizing the effect of disturbance of the fish through SCUBA divers. We further show that PCT is robust against observer biases and outperforms traditional line transect methods.

Suspended PM signatures, including enrichment factors (ratios of PM concentrations to ubiquitous metals such as aluminum), lead isotopes, color, and particle size, were used to tie layers in a San Juan River sediment core to upstream tributary sources. Tributary PM concentrations and loads were compared to Lower San Juan River suspended PM loads to estimate the relative contribution of tributary PM (both mining and non-mining sourced) directly upstream of Lake Powell. Results suggest elevated enrichment factors of lead, cadmium, copper, and zinc in deposited sediment were sourced from mined tributaries, whereas elevated manganese in deposited sediment was sourced from unmined tributaries. Sediment Pb isotope ratios reflected the depleted signature of the mineralized vein (present in the headwaters of mined tributaries), the enriched signature of the Chinle Sandstone (predominant underlying geology of unmined tributaries), or a mixture of these two endmembers. These independent lines of evidence were used to link probable tributary source and runoff category to sediment layers, where similar to 10% and 5% of the overall PM deposited in the sediment core was attributed to mining versus non-mining sources, respectively. Because traditional dating methods were not possible, runoff category signatures were used to estimate that the 3.37m San Juan River Delta core was deposited over similar to 1.3years.

Nationally representative urinary bisphenol A (BPA) data are now available for Canada, the United States and Korea. Here we address the following questions: Are urinary BPA data from these countries comparable? What can be discerned regarding geographic and/or temporal similarities or differences? Are there generalizable lessons to be learned regarding comparison of biomonitoring results from different countries? Methods: We examined underlying methods and resultant urinary BPA data from national surveys of three countries: Canada (Canadian Health Measures Survey, CHMS, 2009-2015); United States (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES, 2009-2014); and Korea (Korean National Environmental Health Survey, KoNEHS, 2009-2014). We estimated BPA daily intakes on both a volume- and creatinine-adjusted basis. Results: The three countries use similar methods for analyzing urine samples for BPA and participate in external proficiency testing with acceptable results. Field blanks are only used in the CHMS program. There were program-specific differences in fasting times of participants. Median urinary BPA levels in Canada remained relatively constant over the three cycles (1.1-1.2 ng/ml), while US levels decreased (from 1.9 to 1.3 ng/ml) and Korean levels increased (from 0.7 to 1.1 ng/ml) over similar time periods. The most recent survey year data indicate that levels do not differ substantially across countries. Canadian urinary BPA levels have been stable; the subtle, non-significant decrease in intakes may be due to higher body weight in the more recent Canadian surveys. In contrast, the decrease in intakes in the US appears to be due to decreases in urinary BPA as body weights in the US have been stable. Estimated 95th percentile intakes are over an order of magnitude below current health-based guidance values. Discussion: Our assessment of urinary BPA data from Canada, the US and Korea indicates that methodological differences, methods for dilution adjustment, and population characteristics should be carefully considered when interpreting biomonitoring data. Despite the plethora of publications describing issues with use of creatinine levels for urinary dilution adjustment, there have been no major methodological advances that would assist in interpreting urinary chemical data. A combination of biomonitoring and traditional exposure assessment approaches may be needed to fully assess human exposures to BPA and other chemicals. Conclusions: National biomonitoring surveys provide important information on population levels of chemicals such as BPA and can assist in understanding temporal and geographic similarities, differences, and trends. However, caution must be exercised when using these data to draw anything but broad conclusions, due to both intercountry methodological differences and factors affecting urinary chemical levels that are still poorly understood. While the issues raised in this paper do not appear to be a major concern specifically for the national-scale monitoring of SPA described here, they must be considered when comparing data for other chemicals measured as part of both national and smaller-scale biomonitoring-based research as well as for BPA data from other studies.

Estimating personal ambient temperature in moderately cold environments for occupationally exposed populations	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Personal ambient temperature; Occupational health; Cold exposure; Wearable sensors	AFFECT MORTALITY; HEAT EXPOSURE; WEATHER; MODELS; CITIES; RESPONSES; EVENTS; URBAN; WAVES	Despite high mortality and morbidity rates in the winter season, few studies have investigated the health effects from working in moderately cold environments, especially among vulnerable outdoor worker populations in the southeastern US. Yet recent research has shown that the mortality risk from cold events is greatest in southern cities compared to other US locations. We performed repeated personal cold exposure measurements in outdoor grounds management workers in the southeastern US using consumer-based sensors. We recruited outdoor workers from two locations (Raleigh, NC and Boone, NC) each characterized by climatological differences in cold temperature to participate in a 3-week data collection period at the peak of the winter (Jan/Feb 2018). Lower personal ambient temperatures were observed among participants who worked in a warmer climate (Raleigh, NC). The relative risk for cold symptomatology was higher in moderately cold personal ambient temperatures (0 degrees C to 20 degrees C) than extremely cold personal ambient temperatures (less than 0 degrees C). A weak significant relationship was observed between personal ambient temperatures and weather station measurements highlighting that epidemiological researchers should be cautious when investigating the health effects of ambient temperatures based on fixed site measurements. As mobile technology progresses, real-time temperature health monitoring and analysis of environmental conditions at the individual level across multiple occupational-settings will become more feasible and ultimately, we believe, a digitally enhanced workforce will become standard practice in the field.

Previous research in the region shows that suppression of dingoes initiates trophic cascades between dingoes-red foxes-small mammals and woody shrubs and between dingoes-kangaroos and grasses. Results show that terrestrial insectivores were more abundant and the rate of insectivory indexed as the rate of consumption of experimentally provisioned meal-worms was greater where dingoes were common. Overall abundance, diversity and taxon richness of arthropods was unaffected by dingo status. However, there were distinct differences in the composition of arthropod assemblages across the DBF. Scolopendridae, Acrididae and Lepismatidae were more abundant where dingoes were rare, while Tenebrionidae and Blattidae were more abundant where dingoes were common. Our results lend support to the idea that suppression of dingo populations can trigger >= 4 link trophic cascades that extend to arthropod assemblages. We hypothesize that dingo suppression engenders shifts in arthropod assemblages due to a decrease in the intensity of insectivory, changes in habitat structure and alteration of the predatory and competitive interactions between arthropod taxa.

We quantified the impacts of this land-use change on the concentrations and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nutrients and soil fertility in NE Namibia and SW Zambia. In total, we selected 11 sampling clusters, each cluster containing up to three sampling plots in agricultural fields (field age ranged from 2 to 26 years) and one reference plot in woodland. The conversion from woodland to low-input agriculture affected the concentrations of SOC, total N and exchangeable Mg in the soil. These changes were also apparent in the cumulative losses of stocks of exchangeable Mg to 40 cm and of SOC and N to 100 cm depth. Likewise maize yields predicted by the QUEFTS model declined by similar to 15% in old agricultural fields, indicating a decrease in soil fertility. The impacts of land-use change were most evident in the Namibian area, where the mean SOC losses up to 100 cm depth in old agricultural fields were 9.6 Mg C ha(-1), which corresponds to 20% of the original stocks in woodland. The losses of soil fertility indicate that current agricultural management is not sustainable.

We measured nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes at two ongoing long-term experimental sites (Tiogo and Dinderesso), each included three fire-exclusion plots and four annually burnt plots (0.24-0.25 ha plot size). We measured soil trace gas fluxes using chamber methods before and after fire during the dry season and at the start of and during the wet season. There was considerable volatilization of aboveground biomass C and N during fire, but soil N2O, NO, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were not significantly influenced following fire events. Instead, soil moisture dynamics were more important in regulating soil CO2 and N2O emissions. The onset of the wet season induced a short-term pulse of N2O emissions, when water-filled pore space exceeded 60%. We also detected a short-term pulse of NO emissions, lasting only four hours, following fire. The low soil N-oxide fluxes reflected the sites' extremely low inorganic N levels in the soil.

Maternal exposure to fine particulate matter from a coal mine fire and birth outcomes in Victoria, Australia	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; PREGNANCY; WEIGHT; ASSOCIATION; QUALITY	Introduction: The Hazelwood coal mine fire was an unprecedented event in Australian history that resulted in the surrounding towns in regional Victoria being covered in plumes of smoke and ash for six weeks in 2014. Evidence concerning adverse reproductive impacts associated with maternal exposure to ambient air pollution is expanding. Gaps remain regarding the relative impact of acute changes in outdoor air quality lasting days to months, such as that resulting from coal mine fires. Methods: Routinely collected perinatal data was used to define a complete cohort of singleton babies born within the affected region. Maternal average, and peak, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was assigned to residential address at time of delivery using a chemical transport model. Maternal, infant, meteorological and temporal variables were adjusted for in final linear and log-binomial regression models. Results: There were a total of 3591 singleton livebirths during the study period; 763 of which were in utero during the coal mine fire. Average PM2.5 exposure was 4.4 mu g/m(3) (median 1.9; IQR 2.1 mu g/m(3)) and peak was 45.0 mu g/m(3) (median 30.4; IQR 35.1 mu g/m(3)). There was no association between coal mine fire-attributable PM2.5 and fetal growth or gestational maturity outcomes. However, there was weak evidence that gestational diabetes mellitus was an effect modifier in the relationship between maternal PM2.5 exposure and birth weight. Babies born to exposed gestational diabetic mothers were 97 g heavier per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in average PM2.5 exposure (95% CI 74, 120 g). No association was observed among mothers without gestational diabetes. Conclusion: Maternal exposure to fine particulate matter resulting from the 2014 Hazelwood coal mine fire did not appear to adversely effect fetal maturity. However, there was weak evidence of a trophic response among babies born to exposed mothers with gestational diabetes, a possible susceptibility that requires further exploration.

The aim of this study was to assess the phthalate exposure and its determinants among children at age of 7 years from the Polish Mother and Child Cohort Study (REPRO_PL). 250 urine samples collected in 2014-2015 were analysed for 21 metabolites of 11 parent phthalates using on-line high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). This represents the most extensive set of phthalate metabolites ever determined for Poland. Ten metabolites were quantifiable in 100% of the samples, another eight in > 90%. The highest median concentrations were found for the primary monoester metabolites of di-iso-butyl (MiBP, 72.4 mu g/l), di-n-butyl (MnBP, 56.3 mu g/l) and diethyl (MEP, 42.0 mu g/l) phthalate, followed by the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl (Sigma DEHP, 89.3 mu g/l) and di-iso-nonyl (Sigma DiNP, 21.9 mu g/l) phthalate metabolites. Metabolite concentrations were higher in children at 7 years than in the same children at age 2 or in their mothers during pregnancy. Generally, phthalate exposures in this study were much higher than exposures reported in other European populations. Multivariate regression models showed that body mass index, place of residence, breastfeeding duration, socio-economic status and parental education were associated with the metabolite levels in the 7-year old children. Daily intake and hazard index calculations revealed that a small percentage of children (around 3-10%) exceeded the tolerable daily intakes established by international institutions such as EFSA and U.S. EPA indicating that these children might be at risk of anti-androgenic effects from the individual and cumulative exposure to phthalates. Thus, further monitoring of this population, by educational programs and follow-up interventions, is required.

Emerging evidence indicates that Traffic Related Air Pollution (TRAP), as opposed to ambient air pollution, leads to the onset of childhood asthma. We estimated the number of incident asthma cases among children attributable to TRAP in the contiguous US, for the years 2000 and 2010. Methods: The number of incident childhood asthma cases and percentage due to TRAP were estimated using standard burden of disease assessment methods. We combined children (< 18 years) counts and pollutant exposures at populated US census blocks with a national asthma incidence rate and meta-analysis derived concentration response functions (CRF). NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 were used as surrogates of TRAP exposures, with NO2 being most specific. Annual average concentrations were obtained from previously validated land-use regression (LUR) models. Asthma incidence rate and a CRF for each pollutant were obtained from the literature. Estimates were stratified by urban or rural living and by median household income. We also estimated the number of preventable cases among blocks that exceeded the limit for two counterfactual scenarios. The first scenario used the recommended air quality annual averages from the World Health Organization (WHO) as a limit. The second scenario used the minimum modeled concentration for each pollutant, in either year, as a limit. Results: Average concentrations in 2000 and 2010, respectively, were 20.6 and 13.2 mu g/m(3) for NO2, 12.1 and 9 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 and 21.5 and 17.9 mu g/m(3) for PM10. Attributable number of cases ranged between 209,100-331,200 for the year 2000 and 141,900-286,500 for 2010, depending on the pollutant. Asthma incident cases due to TRAP represented 27%-42% of all cases in 2000 and 18%-36% in 2010. Percentage of cases due to TRAP were higher (1) in urban areas than rural areas, and (2) in block groups with lowest median household income. Online open-access interactive maps and tables summarizing findings at the county level and 498 major US cities, are available at [https://carteehdata.org/l/s/TRAP-burden-of-childhood-asthma]. Assuming that pollutants did not exceed WHO air quality recommendations, the number of incident cases that could have been prevented ranged between 300 and 53,400, depending on the pollutant and year. Assuming that pollutant levels were limited to the minimum modeled concentration, the number of childhood asthma incident cases that could have been prevented ranged between 127,700 and 317,600, depending on the pollutant and year. Conclusion: This is the first study to estimate the burden of incident childhood asthma attributable to TRAP at a national scale in the US. The attributable burden of childhood asthma dropped by 33% between 2000 and 2010. However, a significant proportion of cases can be prevented.

A key requirement for evolutionary stability of these predator-deterrent signals is that they convey honest information on the prey's fighting or fleeing performance. In this study, we investigate the enigmatic distress call' of the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus, and test whether it conveys reliable information on an individual's body size, and bite and sprint performance. Our acoustic analyses revealed a complex spectral structure in the vocalization of P. algirus, showing a wide frequency bandwidth, multiple harmonics, and a marked frequency modulation. This spectral design may allow such calls to be perceived by multiple potential predators, as it was assessed by a literature search comparing the call frequency range with the hearing ranges of P. algirus' top predators. In addition, we found considerable inter-individual variation in the call design of lizards (call signatures'), which was linked with inter-individual variation in body size and maximum bite force, but not with sprint speed (a proxy of escape performance). As a whole, our study supports the hypothesis that the vocalizations of P. algirus lizards have the potential to serve as honest calls to deter predators. Further research on the behavioural response of predators towards lizard calls is essential in order to unravel the true predator deterrence potential of these calls.Significance statementWhen eye-to-eye with a predator, prey animals may signal their ability to fight or flee to convince the predator not to attack or pursue them. Reptiles typically use visual displays to deter predators, but fascinatingly, Psammodromus algirus lizards have been observed to vocalize when encountered by predators. Here, we explored the acoustic properties of these calls and examined whether they convey honest information on a lizard's fighting and fleeing performance. Our recordings indicate that the acoustic profile of the calls fall within the hearing sensitivity of the lizard's top predators. Moreover, our experiments show a significant link between the acoustic profile of lizard calls and lizard fighting ability, but not with fleeing ability. Together, our results imply that these lizard calls have predator deterrence potential. Additionally, this study provides the first evidence of honest acoustic signalling of performance in a reptile.

Allomaternal care, brains and fertility in mammals: who cares matters	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Allomaternal care; Paternal care; Cooperative breeding; Brain size; Fertility; Reproduction	INFANT-CARRYING BEHAVIOR; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; ANTHROPOID PRIMATES; RELATIVE BRAIN; GROUP-SIZE; NONREPRODUCTIVE HELPERS; ALLOPARENTAL CARE; METABOLIC COSTS; LIFE-HISTORIES; TRADE-OFF	The expensive brain hypothesis predicts that the lowest stable level of energy input sets the upper limit to a species' brain size. This prediction receives comparative support from the effects of experienced seasonality (including hibernation) and diet quality on mammalian brain size. Here, we test another prediction, which concerns the temporal stability of energy inputs. Allomaternal care in mammals can be provided by breeding males or other helpers (usually earlier offspring). Male care should be stable and reliable since otherwise no breeding would occur. Care by others, in contrast, should fluctuate, as the availability of helpers often varies. One would therefore predict, other things being equal, that the presence of male care in addition to maternal care should show positive correlated evolution with brain size, whereas care by others would not. However, because females can readily respond through litter size adjustments to variable amounts of energy inputs, helper inputs may be used to increase fertility. A detailed comparative analysis of a large sample of mammals (N=478 species) showed that male help is correlated with the evolution of larger brains, whereas alloparental help is correlated with higher fertility, but only in species where male care is also present (as in cooperative breeders). Humans evolved an unusual form of multi-family cooperative breeding, which involves stable and reliable care by both fathers and alloparents. This combination helps to explain why humans differ from the other apes in having both an extremely large brain and a relatively high reproductive output.Significance statementAllomaternal care provides breeding females with energy, directly or indirectly, and so would be expected to affect fertility and/or brain size. Which path evolution actually took remains controversial, partly because previous studies did not separate between care provided by the breeding male (paternal care) and care by non-breeding helpers (alloparental care). We distinguish between them because we expect that selection only favours increased brain size if the increase in energy available to the female is predictable and constant. Using a sample of 478 mammals, we show that paternal care, which is both reliable and stable, shows correlated evolution with brain size, whereas alloparental care, which fluctuates with varying availability of helpers, is correlated with higher fertility. Thus, constraints on brain size, imposed by its high-energy costs, may predict brain size better than the fitness benefits of improved cognitive abilities per se.

Transitivity and structural balance in marmot social networks	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Social networks; Structural balance; Network transitivity; Triad analysis; Yellow-bellied marmots	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; DOMINANCE; DYNAMICS; COOPERATION; POPULATION; AGGRESSION; EVOLUTION; KNOWLEDGE; CONFLICT; PATTERNS	Social relationships are composed of both positive (affiliative) and negative (agonistic) interactions, representing opposing effects. Social network theory predicts that positive relationships should be transitive; thus, the friend of a friend is more likely to be a friend. Further, when considering both positive and negative relationships jointly, structural balance theory predicts that certain configurations of positive and negative relationships in a triad are inherently less stable (unbalanced) and should tend to be eliminated. However, structural balance has been rarely examined in nonhuman social systems. We tested for transitivity and structural balance in social networks of socially flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked if group size, network density, or group composition affected the degree of structural balance. We found a consistent pattern of significant transitivity in positive interactions, some transitivity in negative interactions, and some evidence of structural balance. In particular, a weak definition of structural balance is probably more common than strong structural balance, which used a stricter definition of balance. Network size limited the ability to detect these social processes, and smaller networks were less likely to show significant transitivity or structural balance. The proportion of adult females in a group affected the level of transitivity but did not affect the degree of structural balance. Our study suggests that there are intriguing similarities in social processes across diverse animal societies and that studying triads and network motifs may help identify basic social mechanisms linking local to global structure.Significance statementSocial network theory predicts that basic social mechanisms should lead to similar structural properties across different societies. For example, positive relationships should be transitive (a friend of a friend is a friend), and certain combinations of positive and negative relationships represent conflict and should be unstable over time (e.g., a friend of a friend being an enemy is an unstable state). This latter theory, called structural balance, has rarely been examined in nonhuman societies; hence, we tested for transitivity and structural balance in groups of free-living yellow-bellied marmots. Positive interactions were generally transitive, but evidence for structural balance was inconsistent. Furthermore, group composition could affect network transitivity, and small network size (associated with few interactions) limits ability to detect significant patterns. Our results suggest that transitivity is fundamental in structuring positive relationships, while some forms of structural balance are present but not widespread.

Spatial and seasonal variation in occupation and abundance of common vole burrows in highly disturbed agricultural ecosystems	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Agricultural pest; Microtus arvalis; Multi-scale approach; Small mammal; Soil perturbation	MICROTUS-ARVALIS POPULATIONS; SMALL-MAMMAL ABUNDANCE; FARMING PRACTICES; LANDSCAPE; RODENTS; SYSTEM; PREFERENCES; MANAGEMENT; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Understanding how species respond to disturbance in human-modified ecosytems is critical for management and conservation of biodiversity in the Anthropocene. In agroecosystems, human disturbances severely modify the habitat of species, particularly for those that live in burrows. The common vole Microtus arvalis (Pallas, 1778) is a semi-fossorial microtine, which often exhibits large abundance fluctuations, becoming an agricultural pest in peak years. We evaluated how both agrarian disturbances (via types of crop and their management) and landscape heterogeneity influenced the abundance of common vole burrow systems along a yearly cycle, at the field and landscape scales. We seasonally recorded the number of burrows and their recent occupation in circular plots of 200-m radius including different types of crops in intensified agrarian landscapes in NW Spain. Our results showed a marked seasonal and spatial pattern in both total abundance and abundance of occupied burrows. After a population peak year, only 31% of burrows were occupied across the year (from 41% in spring-summer to 12% in autumn). The crop type and its management in relation to soil disturbance were the main factors driving seasonal and spatial dynamics of burrow abundance at the field and landscape scale. Alfalfa fields held the highest abundance of both total and occupied burrow systems across the year, while fields of traditional-tilled cereal retained the lowest. As a result, at the landscape scale, plots with a greater surface devoted to traditional cereal crops maintained a lower relative number of burrow systems. Regarding the landscape structural heterogeneity, plots with longer length of field margins and lower area of watercourses maintained higher abundance of burrow systems. An adequate landscape-scale planning of crop types, agricultural practices, and distribution of non-crop habitats could be a promising sustainable method to reduce the risk of crop-damaging vole plagues.

Seasonal, geographical, and habitat effects on the diet of a recovering predator population: the European pine marten (Martes martes) in Ireland	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Pine marten; Diet; Scat analyses; Spatial effects; Seasonal variation; Habitat effects; Environmental resilience	BIALOWIEZA NATIONAL-PARK; PREY PREFERENCES; FOREST; FOOD; IDENTIFICATION; CARNIVORES; RESOURCES; ABUNDANCE; SQUIRREL; DYNAMICS	Human activity is increasingly altering the natural world. Yet the natural adaptability of most mammal species remains unknown. Seasonal and spatial influences on the diet of temperate carnivores tending towards omnivory are, particularly, poorly understood. The pine marten is one such species which in Ireland and Britain is of additional interest due to the recent recovery in its range and abundance from near collapse. We investigated diet of the pine marten on regional, national, and continental scales and with regard to seasonal and habitat variation. Habitat effects on diet were examined with regard to samples from deciduous woodland, coniferous forestry plantations, heath-coniferous matrices, and mixed habitats. Finally, we discuss the implications of dietary variation in the ecological role of the European pine marten in Ireland and elsewhere and consider how these may be affected by further environmental change. The diet of the pine marten differed significantly amongst all studies across its range, although it maintains the same approximate trophic niche breadth throughout. This plasticity may explain its recovery in an environment where resources are scarce, and underscores its status as an opportunistic species which is likely to be robust to environmental and habitat changes in the future.

However, implementing this established conservation management strategy in large or access-restricted areas is often not possible. We investigated grazing by wild and free-ranging red deer Cervus elaphus as an alternative conservation management approach on an active military training area in Germany. In grasslands and heathlands protected under the EU Habitats Directive, we quantified above-ground net primary productivity, forage quality and forage removal by red deer over three successive years. To assess synergistic effects between wildlife grazing and additional grassland management measures removing vegetation biomass (i.e. burning, mowing), we conducted our grazing experiment in burnt, mown and untreated grasslands. Annual forage removal by red deer amounted to 35%, 44%, 48% and 59% of the above-ground net primary productivity in burnt, mown and untreated grasslands, and untreated heathlands, respectively. Theoretically, a similar annual biomass removal could be obtained by livestock grazing with 0.54 animal units ha(-1) in grasslands and 0.45 animal units ha(-1) in heathlands. In grasslands, daily rates of forage removal peaked in spring and early summer, whereas in heathlands, forage removal rates were only significant in winter. Forage removal rates in grasslands increased with productivity and forage quality, which were both enhanced in mown grasslands. This suggests mowing can increase grassland attractiveness to red deer. Forage removal rates in heathlands did not relate to productivity or forage quality but to standing biomass. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that the quantity of forage removed by wild red deer can be comparable to that of livestock in common conservation grazing systems. The seasonal patterns of forage removal by red deer in grasslands and heathlands coincided with the different grazing requirements of these habitats. Especially in large areas of conservation interest, we therefore encourage attempts to modify current wildlife management strategies to allow red deer to forage in open landscapes, which can contribute to the conservation of semi-natural open habitats and also help to reduce damage in forest stands.

Divergent fire management leads to multiple beneficial outcomes for butterfly conservation in a production mosaic	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						butterfly; fire management; fire-prone ecosystem; fragmented landscape; grassland succession; indigenous forest; timber plantation; woody encroachment	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SOUTH-AFRICA; FOREST; LANDSCAPE; DIVERSITY; ENCROACHMENT; GRASSHOPPER; ASSEMBLAGES; ABANDONMENT; RESPONSES	Fire is an intrinsic component of many natural ecosystems. In human-modified landscapes that occur in fire-driven ecosystems, it can be difficult to make fire management decisions, as there must be a trade-off between ideal conservation management and the practicalities of management in an altered landscape. We assess how biodiversity is influenced by differences in fire regime in a landscape fragmented by timber production. Here, optimal fire management for maintaining grassland integrity is not always possible, due to logistical constraints and fire risk to plantations. We investigate thicket establishment arising from reduced fire frequency, and how this affects butterfly diversity, assemblage structure, indicator species and species associations to larval host plants with different growth forms. Butterflies were sampled along a gradient of woodiness in large-scale conservation corridors that separate timber compartments. The two extreme stages along the successional gradient, recently burned grassland and natural forests, supported relatively diverse and complementary butterfly assemblages. Grassland corridors without fire for 2 years were as high in butterfly diversity and similar in composition to recently burned grasslands. However, corridors without fire for >5 years were encroached by thicket and supported lower butterfly diversity. Thicket, with its intermediate vegetation character, was poor habitat for species adapted to either open grassland or to forests. Also, thicket-encroached areas carry high fire risk to plantations. Synthesis and applications. In this fragmented, fire-driven ecosystem, there is more than one burning strategy for achieving positive biodiversity outcomes. We recommend a divergent management approach that covers both extremes of the fire frequency continuum, with the choice depending on the stage of succession and management logistics for each site: (a) frequent burning to prevent woody encroachment in less-encroached, logistically easier sites or (b) letting succession run its course through thicket to forest by excluding fire in heavily encroached, logistically challenging sites. Both options are practicable and maintain biotopes that have high value for butterfly conservation and low fire risk to plantations. This divergent management approach is a flexible strategy that benefits both conservation and commercial interests across fire-prone plantation mosaics.

Although intensive grassland management with high manure inputs generally promotes earthworm abundance, it may reduce the effective food availability for meadow birds through desiccation of the topsoil, which causes earthworms to remain deeper in the soil. We studied the response of Red Worm Lumbricus rubellus, a detritivore, and Grey Worm Aporrectodea caliginosa, a geophage, to soil moisture profiles in the field and under experimental conditions. Surfacing earthworms were counted weekly in eight intensively managed grasslands (treated with high inputs of slurry by slit injection) with variable groundwater tables in the Netherlands. At each count, soil penetration resistance, soil moisture tension and groundwater level were measured, while air temperature and humidity were obtained from a nearby weather station. The response to variation in the vertical distribution of soil moisture was also experimentally studied in the two earthworm species. In the field, earthworms' surfacing activity at night was negatively associated with soil moisture tension and positively by relative air humidity. Surprisingly, there was no effect of groundwater level; an important management variable in meadow bird conservation. Under experimental conditions, both L. rubellus and A. caliginosa moved to deeper soil layers (>20 cm) in drier soil moisture treatments, avoiding the upper layer when moisture levels dropped below 30%. Synthesis and applications. We propose that in intensively managed grasslands with slurry application, topsoil desiccation reduces earthworm availability for meadow birds. This can be counteracted by keeping soil moisture tensions of the top soil above -15 kPa. We suggest that the late raising of groundwater tables in spring and the disturbance of the soil by slit injection of slurry increase topsoil desiccation. This decreases earthworm availability when it matters most for breeding meadow birds. Meadow bird conservation will benefit from revised manure application strategies that promote earthworm activity near or at the soil surface.

Compounding human stressors cause major regeneration debt in over half of eastern US forests	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						anthropogenic stressors; forest adaptive capacity; forest inventory and analysis; mesophication; regeneration debt; temperate forests; tree migration; tree regeneration	WHITE-TAILED DEER; UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; MIGRATION; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; PENNSYLVANIA; INDICATOR; TURNOVER	The future of temperate forests in the face of global change and anthropogenic stressors remains uncertain. The regeneration stage, which is a critical bottleneck for many organisms, is a key indicator of forest health, future canopy composition and forest adaptive capacity. In trees, seemingly healthy forests can be at long-term risk due to insufficient juveniles to replace them (regeneration failure), or compositional differences between juveniles and adults (regeneration mismatch). We propose 'regeneration debt' to collectively describe regeneration failure and mismatch in analogy to extinction debt. To demonstrate this concept, we conducted a macroecological analysis of regeneration debt and anthropogenic stressors in eastern US forests. Using U.S. Forest Service-Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we quantified regeneration debt in 18 states from Maine to South Carolina, and evaluated the influence of site, anthropogenic stressors and climate drivers in the most affected regions. We identified three distinct regions, with little debt in the north, moderate debt in the south and severe regeneration debt in the central, mid-Atlantic region. In this region, multiple anthropogenic stressors (invasive plants, deer overabundance and land use) were associated with both low-regeneration abundance and the prevalence of disease-prone and/or suboptimal species. Synthesis and applications. Without management intervention, the severe regeneration debt in the mid-Atlantic region will likely lead to long-term declines in forest cover, with cascading negative effects on forest-dependent taxa and ecosystem services. Moreover, the location of the regeneration debt, which is at the northern edge of and involves many of the tree species that are predicted to gain suitable habitat in the Northeastern US, has consequences that extend far beyond its current geographic extent. In fact, this regeneration debt may already be functioning as a barrier to poleward tree migration. Our results demonstrate the value of regeneration debt as an indicator of ecosystem health and forest adaptive capacity.

One group of organisms adversely affected by clear-cutting is ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, as they are associated with the roots of living trees. Retention forestry is a way of reducing logging impacts and enhancing biodiversity conservation. Increasing the proportion of trees retained at harvest may improve ECM fungal diversity. We investigated the potential for lifeboating of ECM fungi through the harvesting phase in an experimental field study in a 190-year-old Scots pine forest in northern Sweden. The experiment comprised four levels of tree retention-unlogged forest, plots with 60% or 30% of evenly distributed trees retained and clear-cuts without retained trees. We sampled soils and determined identities, frequencies and relative abundances of ECM fungal species during 3 years following logging through the use of high-throughput sequencing of amplified ITS2 markers. We identified 149 ECM fungal species, with the five most abundant species accounting for 50% of the total ECM fungal amplicons. Three years after harvesting, the proportion of ECM sequences in the total amplicon pool had decreased proportionally to the extent of tree removal. In clear-cuts, ECM fungal relative abundance had decreased by 95%, while ECM fungal species richness had declined by 75%, compared to unlogged plots. Tree retention enabled the maintenance of the most frequent ECM species, while more lowly abundant species were progressively lost at random with increasing level of tree removal. Five of the most frequent ECM fungal species remained present after clear-cutting, probably associated with pine seedlings. Synthesis and applications. Tree retention can moderate short-term and potentially also long-term logging impacts on ECM fungi. Local ECM fungal diversity is preserved in proportion to the amount of retained trees. Abundant species may be largely maintained, even by low levels of tree retention and on naturally established seedlings. However, conservation of more infrequent species requires higher levels of tree retention, and our results suggest that around 75% of the ECM species are lost with the forest certification standard of 5% retention trees left at logging.

However, the impact of disturbances on range limits and their interactions with climatic and biotic effects is not well understood, despite their potential to alter competitive relationships between species or override climatic effects. Disturbance might have differential effects at contrasting range limits, based on Darwin's theory that biotic interactions set abiotically benign range limits and abiotic factors set abiotically stressful range limits. We predicted that plants at lower elevation (abiotically benign) range limits experience a net positive effect of disturbance, whereas those at higher elevation (abiotically stressful) range limits experience a net neutral effect. We examined plant populations along elevational gradients in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, in order to quantify the effects of human trampling disturbance at lower and upper elevational range limits of the common alpine cushion plants Silene acaulis and Minuartia obtusiloba. Our results are consistent with Darwin's theory. A disturbance-mediated reduction of competitive effects increases the performance of cushion plants at lower elevations, suggesting a range limit set by biotic factors. At higher elevations, where biotic interactions are minimal, disturbance has neutral or negative effects on cushion plants. Synthesis and applications. Human trampling disturbance exerts differential effects on alpine cushion plant populations at contrasting range limits, emphasizing the need to account for the effects of climate change into the management and conservation of disturbed areas. Disturbance can diminish plant-plant competitive interactions at lower elevational range limits, and thus possibly stabilize alpine species populations susceptible to climate change-mediated encroachment by lower elevation species. Conservation and management approaches should therefore particularly account for the differential effects of disturbance across climatic gradients.

However, it is pollen nutritional quality that enables proper larval development of bees, affecting their populations. Not all plants produce pollen that satisfies the nutritional requirements of bee larvae, and we lack an understanding of how different plant pollens impact bee nutritional demands. This study examined whether nutritionally desirable key plant species may promote wild bee larval development, which is essential if the population is to thrive. The generalist solitary mason bee Osmia bicornis L. was used as a model species to examine differences between bee larva nutritional demand and host plant nutrient supply; an ecological stoichiometry framework was applied. The stoichiometric ratios of 12 elements were investigated in bee bodies and cocoons (reflecting nutritional demand) and in the pollen supplied by the mother (nutritional supply; N = 15 x 2 sexes). Similarly, the stoichiometry of 62 pollen taxa, including native, alien, and garden plants and crops, was compared with the bee demand based on the literature. Compared to males, females had higher demands for P, Cu and Zn and were supplied with pollen richer in these elements. Therefore, when collecting pollen for their progeny, Osmia provides daughters and sons with different pollen mixtures, reflecting sex-specific nutritional demand. Bees may be limited by the availability of P, Na, Mn, Mg, K, Fe, Ca, Zn and Cu, with high taxonomic variability in their concentrations in pollen. Female fitness may be particularly related to a high proportion of P in the diet. Synthesis and applications. Access to key plant species that allow nutritionally balanced larval diets may be essential for bee development, whether food is gathered intentionally or randomly. Such plant species-and not only those rich in nectar and pollen-should be promoted in wild bee conservation efforts, including planting flower strips and hedgerows. Bee-friendly plants should not be defined and planted solely based on the quantities of food they produce and on the visitation rates of adult insects foraging for energy.

The calculation of generation time requires age-specific data on survival and fecundity rates and knowledge of population growth rates. These data are generally lacking for threatened species, so approximations including only partial demographic information need to be used. This leads to potential errors in generation time estimates. To quantify the magnitude of potential errors in generation time estimates, we compared seven approximations with exact generation time measures, calculated either from complete life tables available for 58 mammalian species or from simulated data. We tested the influence of these errors on conservation assessments conducting mock assessments for ten species. We also tested the commonly used prediction of generation time based on the allometric relationship with body mass using phylogenetic generalized least squares. Root mean square errors were largest in measures assuming constant fecundity with age, some of which are currently used in Red List assessments. We found that the measure of generation time that only ignores population growth rates performed relatively well, but tended to underestimate the generation time for decreasing populations, and over-estimate it for increasing populations. In the mock assessment, we found that we underestimated the threat level in 10% to 90% of the species depending on the generation time approximation we used. The predictive metric of generation time based on body mass is inaccurate. We propose an alternative predictive metric based on body mass, age at first reproduction, and reproductive life span. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate potential errors that occur when estimating generation time in the absence of key demographic information. We offer practical recommendations for extinction risk assessments including more rigorous mathematical formulations of generation time, such as the measure of generation time that includes population growth rates and the appropriate age-specific vital rates. Furthermore, we recommend alerting risk assessors of the uncertainties in proxy measures, such as the underestimation of generation time resulting from the assumption of constant fecundity in future Red List assessments.

Multi-species duck harvesting using dynamic programming and multi-criteria decision analysis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						ducks; dynamic programming; harvest; hunting season; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; multi-criteria decision analysis; population modelling	BAND REPORTING PROBABILITIES; UNITED-STATES; SMALL-GAME; MANAGEMENT; WATERFOWL; MALLARDS; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; POPULATIONS; REDUCTION	Multiple species are often exposed to a common hunting season, but harvest and population objectives may not be fully achieved if harvest potential varies among species and/or species abundances are not correlated through time. Our goal was to develop an approach for setting a common hunting season that would recognize heterogeneity in species productivity and would select annual hunting seasons conditioned on the status of individual species. We first used stochastic dynamic programming to generate optimal, state-dependent harvest strategies for 18 candidate regulatory scenarios. We simulated the performance of these strategies, and then used multi-criteria decision analysis to identify preferred regulatory scenarios for duck hunting seasons in the Atlantic Flyway of the U.S. Generally, estimates of annual population size were not correlated among species. Mallards had the highest estimated intrinsic rate of growth, green-winged teal, wood ducks, and ring-necked ducks had intermediate values, and goldeneyes were the least productive. Estimated carrying capacity was highest for mallards and lowest for green-winged teal. Managers had greatest interest in maximizing season length (33%) and aggregate duck abundance (28%), and less interest in maximizing aggregate harvest (19%) and the number of years between a change in hunting season regulations (19%). Several regulatory scenarios provided acceptable trade-offs among these objectives. Synthesis and applications. Separate hunting seasons for various species of game may be untenable, either due to the added cost and regulatory complexity, or because selective harvesting of stocks may be difficult due to problems in species identification. Rather than averaging species-specific productivities, or basing hunting seasons on the least (or most) productive species, we describe an approach in which productivity and annual population status are considered explicitly for each species. By combining stochastic dynamic programming with multi-criteria decision analysis, we can identify a regulatory strategy that can address a diverse set of objectives and explicitly recognize the trade-offs among them. To meet the Atlantic Flyway's objectives as identified by waterfowl managers, our results suggest a regulatory strategy in which the harvest is targeted at 98% of aggregate maximum sustainable yield, most emphasis is placed on accumulating harvests of mallards and wood ducks, and by using a set of regulatory options that are more conservative than those currently in use.

FoxNet: An individual-based model framework to support management of an invasive predator, the red fox	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity conservation; carnivore; individual-based model; invasive species; population dynamics; predator control; red fox; spatially explicit population model	VULPES-VULPES; RANGELAND AREA; HOME-RANGE; LONG-TERM; POPULATION; RESPONSES; DENSITY; PATTERN; SCALE; VACCINATION	Invasive predators are a key driver of biodiversity decline, and effective predator management is an important conservation issue globally. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) poses a significant threat to wildlife, livestock and human health across Eurasia, North America and Australia. Despite worldwide investment in red fox management, decision makers still lack flexible tools for predicting control efficacy. We have developed FoxNet, a spatially explicit, individual-based model (IBM) framework that can be customised to predict red fox population dynamics, including responses to control and landscape productivity. High-resolution models can be run across northern and southern hemisphere landscapes. We present four case-study models to verify FoxNet outputs, explore key sensitivities and demonstrate the framework's utility as a management planning tool. FoxNet models were largely successful in reproducing the demographic structure of two red fox populations in highly contrasting landscapes. They also accurately generated the relationship between home-range size and fox-family density for home-range sizes between 1.0 and 9.6 km(2), and captured the rapid decline and seasonally driven recovery of a red fox population following poison-baiting. An exploration of alternative poison-baiting scenarios for a conservation reserve predicted that current management suppresses red fox density by similar to 70% and showed that frequent baiting is required to combat recolonisation. Baiting at higher densities or establishing a baited buffer would further reduce red fox density. Predictions were sensitive to home-range and litter size assumptions, illustrating the value of region-specific data on red fox movement and biology. Synthesis and applications. We have developed a versatile individual-based model framework to guide management of the red fox, a globally significant invasive predator. Our framework, FoxNet, can be customised to generate realistic predictions of red fox population dynamics in diverse landscapes, making it immediately applicable to the design and optimisation of predator control programmes at scales relevant to management. Future extensions could explore competitor and prey responses to red fox control and the effects of habitat disturbance on predator population dynamics.

Between 1984 and 1991, funnel traps were used to cull similar to 35 metric tons of Arctic charr, reducing charr density by similar to 80%. As charr densities decreased, tapeworm prevalence and then intensity also declined over the following three decades, with D. dendriticus (formerly dendriticum) responding faster than D. ditremus (formerly ditremum). The two main hypotheses for how culling a host can decrease parasitism are reductions in parasite transmission due to reduced host density and reductions in parasite survival through increases in host mortality rates. We found little evidence that charr density was the main driver for reduced parasite transmission. Instead, decreased survivorship in charr, initially, through fishing-induced changes in charr age structure, and later through increased predation rates by brown trout, led to increased parasite mortality. Although brown trout, which increased significantly after fish culling, are also hosts, they are often too big for the final host birds to eat, thus becoming parasite sinks. Synthesis and applications. Fish populations with heavy parasite burdens constitute a management problem. Our results show how fish culling can indirectly reduce transmitted parasites through increased parasite mortality. Managing overcrowded fish populations by culling can produce two desirable outcomes: an increase in fish growth rates and reduced parasite burdens.

Effects of 2 Neonicotinoid Insecticides on Blood Cell Profiles and Corticosterone Concentrations of Wood Frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus)	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Neonicotinoid; Amphibians; Leukocytes; Corticosterone; Pesticides; Ecotoxicology	TOAD RHINELLA-ARENARUM; RANA-PIPIENS; SURFACE WATERS; LEOPARD FROGS; IN-SITU; STRESS; EXPOSURE; RESISTANCE; AMPHIBIANS; INFECTION	Neonicotinoids are widely used insecticides that are detectable in agricultural waterways. These insecticides are of concern due to their potential impacts on nontarget organisms. Pesticides can affect development of amphibians and suppress the immune system, which could impact disease susceptibility and tolerance. No previous studies on amphibians have examined the effects of these insecticides on differential blood cell proportions or concentrations of corticosterone (a general stress hormone). We investigated the effects of chronic exposure to 2 neonicotinoids, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, on immunometrics of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Frogs were exposed to single, chronic treatments of 2.5 or 250 mu g/L of clothianidin or thiamethoxam for 7 wk from Gosner stages 25 to 46. The juvenile frogs were then maintained for 3 wk post metamorphosis without exposure to neonicotinoids. We measured water-borne corticosterone twice: at 6 d and 8 wk after exposure in larval and juvenile frogs, respectively. We assessed differential blood cell profiles from juvenile frogs. Corticosterone was significantly lower in tadpoles exposed to 250 mu g/L of thiamethoxam compared with other tadpole treatments, but no significant differences in corticosterone concentrations were found in treatments using juvenile frogs. Anemia was detected in all treatments compared with controls with the exception of tadpoles exposed to 2.5 mu g/L of clothianidin. Neutrophil-to-leukocyte and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios were elevated in frogs exposed to 250 mu g/L of thiamethoxam. Collectively, these results indicate that chronic exposure to neonicotinoids has varied impacts on blood cell profiles and corticosterone concentrations of developing wood frogs, which are indicative of stress. Future studies should investigate whether exposure to neonicotinoids increases susceptibility to infection by parasites in both larval and adult wood frogs. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1273-1284.

Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films Can Predict the Toxicity of Metal Mixtures to Two Microalgae: Validation for Environmental Monitoring in Antarctic Marine Conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Multiple stressor; Passive sampler; Synergism; Antagonism; Risk assessment; Environmental monitoring	NATURAL-WATERS; TRACE-METALS; SEDIMENTS; CONTAMINANTS; SENSITIVITY; SPECIATION; COPPER; BIOAVAILABILITY; REMEDIATION; PHAEOCYSTIS	Anthropogenic contamination in the Antarctic near-shore marine environment is a challenge for environmental managers because of its isolation, high costs associated with monitoring and remediation activities, and the current lack of Antarctic-specific ecotoxicological data. The present study investigated the application of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) with a Chelex-100 binding resin for metal contaminant assessment in Antarctic marine conditions. Diffusion coefficients for cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), determined at 1 degrees C, ranged between 2.1 and 2.6x10(-6) cm(2)/s and were up to 32% lower than those derived by theoretical calculations. Competition of metals on the DGT binding resin was observed at subsaturation concentrations, reducing the effective capacity for metal uptake by approximately 60%. The lability of the dissolved (0.45 mu m filterable) Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn metal fraction to DGT was generally >90% and unaffected by the presence of the Antarctic marine microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. Both DGT and dissolved metal concentrations gave equivalent mixture toxicity predictions in independent action and concentration addition models to P. antarctica and Cryothecomonas armigera; that is, predictions using DGT-labile concentrations also showed antagonism to P. antarctica, which agrees with previously determined mixture interactivity. The benefits of DGT over traditional sampling techniques (i.e., discrete water sampling) include lower method detection limits (MDLs), in situ assessment, and time-averaged concentrations which capture pulses of contamination typical of the Antarctic near-shore marine environment. The present study provides MDLs and recommended minimum deployment times to guide field deployments in Antarctica. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1323-1333.

This study aimed to evaluate plant preferences for oviposition of gravid females of noctuid stemborers, Busseola fusca and Sesamia calamistis, and the crambid Chilo partellus for uninfested maize plants and plants infested by conspecific or heterospecific larvae. The involvement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by uninfested and maize plants infested by conspecific or heterospecific larvae on moth orientation was studied in Y-tube olfactometer assays and in the field. All gravid female moths significantly preferred VOCs emitted by plants infested by conspecific or heterospecific larvae over those from uninfested plants, and female moths did not systematically prefer VOCs emitted by plants infested by conspecifics. Field trials confirmed these results. Chemical analysis by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that VOCs emitted by larvae-infested plants, regardless of the stemborer species, were compositionally richer than those released by uninfested plants but their emission intensity varied with species involved in the infestation. Busseola fusca larvae induced a compositionally richer VOCs profile than S. calamistis and C. partellus larvae. Eight candidate attractants were associated with larvae-infested plants. These results open new avenues to develop attractants specific to trap female stemborer moths in the field.

The aggregation-sex pheromones of the cerambycid beetles Anaglyptus mysticus and Xylotrechus antilope ssp. antilope: new model species for insect conservation through pheromone-based monitoring	CHEMOECOLOGY			English	Article						Cerambycidae; (R)-3-Hydroxy-2-hexanone; 2-Nonanone; (S)-2-Hydroxy-3-octanone; Semiochemical; Monitoring	COLEOPTERA CERAMBYCIDAE; CHEMICAL ECOLOGY; IDENTIFICATION; COMPONENTS; TRAPS; LURES; RARE	We studied the pheromone chemistry of the cerambycids Anaglyptus mysticus and Xylotrechus antilope ssp. antilope with the goal of identifying attractants that could be used as tools for pheromone-based monitoring of these two species, which are rare and red-listed in parts of northern Europe. Beetles were reared from naturally colonized branches of hazel (Corylus avellana) or oak (Quercusrobur), respectively, and used for headspace sampling. The extracts of volatiles were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Males of A. mysticus consistently produced large quantities of (R)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone and 2-nonanone, minor amounts of 2,3-hexanedione, and trace amounts of six other compounds. The average proportion of 2-nonanone to (R)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone was 70:100. Males of X. antilope produced large quantities of (S)-2-hydroxy-3-octanone, and minor quantities of 2,3-octanedione. None of these compounds were present in the corresponding extracts of females from either species. The attractiveness of the dominant compounds produced by each species was determined in field bioassays. Lures with racemic 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone and 2-nonanone as single compounds were not attractive to A. mysticus. However, the compounds acted synergistically in blends of 100:100 and 160:100 of 2-nonanone to the hydroxyketone's (R)-enantiomer, but not in a 40:100 blend. Similarly (S)-2-hydroxy-3-octanone and its racemate attracted significantly more X. antilope than controls. Males and females of both species were captured in approximately equal numbers. The aggregation-sex pheromones of A. mysticus and X.antilope have high potential to serve as sensitive and efficient tools for detection and monitoring of local populations, and in studies of the species' ecology and conservation requirements.

Habitats shape the cuticular chemical profiles of stingless bees	CHEMOECOLOGY			English	Article						Chemical diversity; Resin; Habitat; Tree richness; Pollinators; Stingless bees	TETRAGONULA-CARBONARIA; HONEY-BEES; RESIN; HYMENOPTERA; TERPENOIDS; MACADAMIA; DISPERSAL; PROPOLIS; BEHAVIOR; APIDAE	Stingless bees are highly social pollinators in tropical ecosystems. Besides floral pollen and nectar, they collect substantial amounts of plant resins, which are used for nest construction/maintenance and defence against antagonists. Moreover, some stingless bees extract chemical compounds from resins and incorporate them in their cuticular chemical profiles, rendering this trait directly dependent on the plant community of the surrounding environment. While previous studies have investigated how variation in the composition and diversity of available resin sources affect resin storages inside hives, subsequent effects on the bees' cuticular chemistry have not been studied. To fill this gap, we investigatedthe number, proportion and composition of compounds in the cuticular chemical profile of an Australian stingless bee using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We analysed whether and (if so) how the cuticular chemistry was affected by habitat (i.e., plantations, forests, and gardens) and tree species richness. We found that overall numbers and proportions of self-produced and resin-derived compounds in the cuticular chemical profiles of Tetragonula carbonaria were similar across habitats, while the composition of all compounds (i.e., both self-produced and resin-derived) and of resin-derived compounds differed between habitats. This indicates that the surrounding tree species community and thus available resin chemistry affected the composition of particularly resin-derived compounds on the bees' cuticle. As the number and composition of resin-derived cuticular compounds were not affected by tree species richness, stingless bees appear to selectively incorporate specific compounds available in the surrounding environment in their cuticular chemical profiles, which mayincrease their defensive properties.

While water temperature controls many physiological processes in fish, knowledge of the effects of this factor on PFAS toxicokinetic is still limited. This study presents experimental results of internal distribution and elimination rates of two perfluorinated acid compounds, namely perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to three temperatures. Dietary exposure experiments were conducted at 7 degrees C, 11 degrees C, and 19 degrees C and liver, blood, muscle, brain, and kidney were sampled for analysis. PFOS concentrations were comparable to or exceeded those of PFHxS, while PFHxS was eliminated faster than PFOS, whatever the temperature. Internal distribution changed significantly for both substances when fish were exposed to a range of temperatures from 7 to 19 degrees C. Indeed, PFOS and PFHxS relative distribution increased in blood, liver, and brain while they decreased in muscle when the water temperature rose. The water temperature variation affected the elimination half-lives, depending on the substances and organs.

However, without rehabilitation, these voids represent a potential environmental risk. The aim of the present work was to assess, for the first time, the water quality, i.e., physicochemical characteristics, metal and metalloid (MM) content, and ecotoxicity of the waters of the El Cobre Blue Lagoon, a pit lake formed in an open-pit copper mine in Cuba. Potential effects of rainy season vs. dry season and spatial location (different depths) on water characteristics were considered. Results revealed that water contained was moderately acidic (pH=4.6 +/- 0.2), with high electrical conductivity (EC=3.02 +/- 0.03mScm(-1)), whatever the season. Dissolved oxygen (DO=9.9 +/- 2.0mgL(-1)), total dissolved solid (TDS=7003 +/- 245mgL(-1)), and sulfate concentration (6556 +/- 1410mgL(-1)) in the El Cobre Blue Lagoon water were above acceptable limits for sources of surface water as recommended by Cuban standard (NC 1021:2014). High copper (43.6 +/- 1.7mgL(-1)) and manganese (24.1 +/- 1.1mgL(-1)) contents were detected. Except for EC, sulfates, chlorides, TDS, nitrates, and phosphates, other physicochemical parameters were stable between dry and rainy seasons (p<0.05). El Cobre Blue Lagoon waters showed an ecotoxicological impact on Vibrio fischeri. No significant differences were detected between all sampling points in the lake for each parameter monitored for a given time. These first results show the spatial homogeneity but poor quality of waters from El Cobre Blue Lagoon. Remediation processes need to be implemented in order to lessen the human and environmental health risk and favor potential water reuse. We suggest the use of constructed wetlands for water treatment. This preliminary research work can serve to alert Cuban local public authorities to the need to rehabilitate such sites.

Schott. & Endl in Benin (West Africa)	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Benin; Cola nitida; Quantitative ethnobotany; Tree demographic structure; Wild edible plant	GARCINIA-KOLA; PLANT USE; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY	Cola nitida is a West African tree, commonly used for pharmaceutical purposes. In Benin, the species is used for many purposes ranging from traditional rituals to domestic consumption. Nowadays, the species, as well as its offspring, are hardly encountered. So far, research on the species focused on a single domain such as ethnobotany and phytochemistry. The current paper used a holistic approach to explain the species scarcity in the natural habitats using (1) the rural knowledge pattern on C. nitida and (2) the tree population structure. Semi-structured interviews (n=170 respondents) were conducted and combined with ecological inventory (n=38 plots) in the phyto-geographical districts of Coast and Pobe in southern Benin. The indices of diversity, equitability, and consensus quantified the range, the evenness, and the relative reliability of rural communities' knowledge. Moreover, the plant part index gave the most used part of the tree. The knowledge on the species was unevenly distributed according to the gender, while the cofactor age did not have a statistically significant effect (P=0.902) on the pattern. In addition, seeds represented the most used plant part (PPI=0.59). C. nitida tree demographic structure showed a low density of seedling and sapling (1.05 +/- 0.47 treesha(-1)). Diameter size fitted with a two-parameter Weibull distribution indicated a threat of species extinction. The multiple uses of C. nitida seeds do not allow natural regeneration of the species. The domestication of C. nitida tree and the establishment of Cola garden/orchard in the surveyed districts are suggested for sustainable use of the species.

Among these is the utilization of fauna for therapeutic purposes, which is a fairly widespread practice in Brazil and an important alternative to the use of pharmaceutical medicines. Mammalian species play a prominent role in zootherapy and are widely used for this activity in the semiarid areas of Northeastern Brazil. This study aims to survey the main species of mammals used for zootherapeutic practices in the municipality of Sume, state of Paraiba, Brazil, and to identify the conditions and diseases treated with mammals species or their body parts. This is the first study that accesses zootherapeutic resources from information of local hunters, who are responsible for capturing these resources and represent the initial link in the chain of animal use for medicinal purposes. Fifty-one informants were interviewed; most of them male. The informants reported 19 species of mammals used for the treatment of diseases, of which 13 were wild animals found on the endangered species list. The study recorded at least 20 animal products or by-products commonly utilized in the administration and preparation of medicines for the treatment of 14 categories of diseases, with diseases related to problems of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue being the most often mentioned. This study revealed a wide variety of mammal species being used in folk medicine for the treatment of numerous diseases, as well as various animal products and by-products being employed in zootherapeutic practices. This type of research plays an important role in understanding the impact of zootherapeutic activities on faunal resources and assists in the implementation of techniques for the management and conservation of mammals.

Regression models provide an easy estimation of aboveground biomass at large spatial and temporal scales. Yet, only few prediction models are available for aboveground biomass in rangelands, as compared with forests. In addition to the development of prediction models, we tested whether such prediction models vary with plant growth forms and life spans, and with the inclusion of site and/or quadrat-specific factors. We collected dataset of aboveground biomass from destructive harvesting of 8088 individual plants belonging to 79 species in 735 quadrats across 35 sites in semi-steppe rangelands in Iran. A logarithmic transformation of the power-law model was used to develop simple prediction models for the easy estimation of aboveground biomass using plant coverage and vegetation density as predictors for the species-specific model, multispecies and plants of different growth forms and life spans. In addition, additive and multiplicative linear regression models were developed by using plant coverage and one categorical variable from the site and/or quadrat-specific factors. The log-transformed power-law model based on plant coverage precisely predicted aboveground biomass across the whole dataset for either most of the species-specific model, multispecies or plants of the same growth forms (shrubs, forbs or graminoids) and life spans (annuals, biennials or perennials). The addition of vegetation density as a single or in a compound predictor variable had relatively poor performance compared with the model having plant coverage only. Although generalizing at the levels of plant group forms and/or life spans did not substantially enhance the model-fit and validation of the plant coverage-based multispecies model, the inclusion of plant growth forms or life spans as a categorical predictor variable had performed well. Generalized models in this study will greatly contribute to the accurate and easy prediction of aboveground biomass in the studied rangelands and will be also useful to rangeland practitioners and ecological modellers interested in the global relationship between biodiversity and aboveground biomass productivity across space and time in natural rangelands.

However, the performance of this technique for plot-based vegetation datasets has not been rigorously tested. We assess the estimation accuracy of the WA approach by comparing results, mainly the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of WA regressions for six different vegetation datasets (total species, high-frequency species and low-frequency species as both abundance and incidence) each from two sites. Vegetation-inferred environment (plot elevation) calibrated over time is used to quantify the elevational shift in species assemblages. Accuracy of the calibrations is assessed by comparing the linear regression models developed for estimating elevational shifts. The datasets were also used for the backward predictions to check the robustness of the forward predictions. WA regression has a fairly high estimation accuracy, especially with species incidence datasets. However, estimation bias at the extremes of the environmental gradient is evident with all datasets. Out of eight sets (each set with a model for total species, low-frequency species and high-frequency species) of WA regression models, the lowest RMSEPs are produced in the four models based on the total species datasets and in three models based on the high-frequency species only. The inferred environment mirrored the estimation precision of the WA regressions, i.e. precise WA regression models produced more accurate calibrated environmental estimates, which, in turn, resulted in regression models with a higher adjusted r(2) for estimating the elevational shift in the species assemblages. Reliable environmental estimates for plot-based datasets can be achieved by WA regression and calibration, although the edge effect may be evident if species turnover is high along an extensive environmental gradient. Species incidence (0/1) data may improve the estimation accuracy by minimizing any potential census and field estimation errors that are more likely to occur in species abundance datasets. Species data processing cannot guarantee the most reliable WA regression models. Instead, generally optimal estimations can be achieved by using all the species with a consistent taxonomy in the training and reconstruction datasets.

Do tropical plants have smaller genomes? Correlation between genome size and climatic variables in the Caesalpinia Group (Caesalpinioideae, Leguminosae)	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						Climate variables; Genome evolution; Genome size; Succulent Biome	NUCLEAR-DNA CONTENT; TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGENY; PATTERNS; DIVERSIFICATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ORGANIZATION; ANGIOSPERMS	While a number of studies have suggested that temperate plants typically have larger genome sizes (GS) than tropical ones, recent analyses have not convincingly confirmed this. We have selected the widely distributed Caesalpinia Group (Leguminosae) to test this hypothesis. We used flow cytometry to estimate the amount of DNA in the haploid genome (C-values) of 40 species of the Caesalpinia Group, aiming to explore the relationship between GS and latitude as well as a range of climatic variables. These comparisons were made using Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (PCM) in a spatio-temporal context. 2C-values varied 7.73-fold, ranging from 0.92 pg (in Cenostigma bracteosum) to 7.11 pg (in Pomaria lactea). By analyzing the data within a statistical framework that took into account phylogenetic relationships, we observed a positive correlation between GS and latitude as well as additional correlations with various temperature variables. While the genetic mechanism(s) underpinning the increase or decrease of genome size in a latitudinal gradient is unclear, we hypothesize that after the origin of the group (c. 55.9 Mya), fragmentation of the Succulent Biome led to the formation of small populations (island-like) which were subject to genetic drift. This in turn led to drastic and rapid changes in the repetitive DNA fractions of the genome correlated with temperature variables. Thus, we suggest that the environment has played a role in contributing to the diversity of genome sizes reported here for the Caesalpinia Group.

Species within assemblages vary largely in body size, abundance, seed treatment and places of seed deposition, with possible delayed consequences for seed dispersal and plant regeneration. The variable outputs of the interaction may be magnified when considering different habitats and diplochoric plants that include more than one agent in subsequent steps of dispersal. Here we compared the contribution of birds and ants to the seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) of two species of Etythroxylum shrubs that grow in Atlantic forest and Cerrado savannas in Brazil. We compared the number of seeds dispersed by each one of 16 bird and 30 ant species and their delayed consequences for seed germination and seedling survival combining experimental and modeling approaches. We observed shifts in the role of different dispersal agents between habitats, with birds being more important in the forest while ants are highlighted in the savanna. Quantity and quality components of SDE were not correlated, but large body size emerged as an important trait driving the quantity (birds) and quality (ants) components of SDE. A high diversified assemblage of dispersal agents does not always result in redundant effects for SDE, with some species consistently providing better dispersal than others and several opportunities for complementary effects. Therefore, even in diversified assemblages operating in diplochoric dispersal systems, there is the opportunity for ecological specialization.	[Camargo, Paulo H. S.

While some users appear to have adopted this language and terminology, there are concerns that the complexities associated with the concept make it inaccessible and, rather than providing stakeholders with a tool to explain complex relationships, the language and terminology itself may disengage. Through surveying UK-based coastal and marine stakeholders (n = 158), this study examines stakeholder's perceptions of the concept of ecosystem services and its role and usefulness within the marine and coastal science-policy-practice interface. Overall, stakeholders provided favourable opinions, with findings similar across respondents with the exception of industry; which used it less, was less confident with it and believed it to be less important. The results provide an evidenced argument for the benefits of the ecosystem services approach, including communication, supporting management and linking environment to humans. The analysis also details the required advancements to ensure effective future use, including improved terminology, pluralistic valuation and shared learning. Finally, the paper highlights challenges and benefits relating to the term, creating links to ongoing discussions about effective scientific communication for marine and coastal management.

While the supply of ES bundles was biophysically assessed, there has been little research about the perception of ES bundles, neither in terms of their supply, nor of their demand. This research investigates how various stakeholders perceive the delivery of ES supply bundles across different landscapes and how this differs from the ES demand bundles they request. A questionnaire survey (n = 858) was carried out on the basis of landscape photographs with local farmers, local inhabitants, and visitors in the region of South Tyrol in the Central Alps. The results show that the different stakeholder groups identify identical ES supply bundles (i.e. experiential service, life maintenance service, agroservice bundle) and associate each with a similar set of landscape types. Stakeholders, however, differ in terms of their expressed demand for ES bundles. These findings suggest that stakeholders experience different (spatial) mismatches between the supply and demand of ES, potentially leading to stakeholder conflicts in landscape management. This study concludes by discussing these potential conflicts across different landscapes and in the context of future land use and management decisions.

During competition, a superior species may exclude the competitor from parts of its fundamental niche or make it go extinct. Determining the potential competition between two sympatric species including an endangered one has important implications for conservation management. We evaluated potential food competition between the wild boar and the giant panda in a key national nature reserve established primarily for the giant panda protection. We monitored foraging plots for 9 years, conducted food macronutrient analysis, and combined our analysis with long-term population monitoring results for two species. The wild boar population increased dramatically in the past 18 years, benefiting from conservation policies of the Chinese government, whereas the giant panda population decreased. We found evidence for competition for bamboo shoots, an important seasonally limiting resource. The wild boar had a higher utilization rate at foraging plots than giant panda, which also avoided plots used by wild boar. This study indicates key seasonal food competition may exist between wild boar and giant panda. This competition for a key food resource may have negative impacts on giant panda populations, particularly under the substantial increase of the wild boar, yet this possibility has not figured prominently in conservation planning and policy for panda reserves. We suggest long-term monitoring of this competitive relationship across reserves to determine when and where management intervention is needed. And, we might need more flexible policies instead of the current "one size fits all" one.

Validating the performance of occupancy models for estimating habitat use and predicting the distribution of highly-mobile species: A case study using the American black bear	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Habitat use; Model validation; Occupancy modeling; Species distribution; Ursus americanus	ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; RESOURCE SELECTION; URSUS-AMERICANUS; MOVEMENT BEHAVIOR; POPULATION; RANGE; FOREST; PARAMETERS; REGRESSION; VEGETATION	Occupancy models have become a valuable tool for estimating wildlife-habitat relationships and for predicting species distributions. Highly-mobile species often violate the assumption that sampling units are geographically closed shifting the probability of occupancy to be interpreted as the probability of use. We used occupancy models, in conjunction with noninvasive sampling, to estimate habitat use and predict the distribution of a highly-mobile carnivore, the American black bear (Ursus americanus) in New Mexico, USA. The top model indicated that black bears use areas with higher primary productivity and fewer roads. The predictive performance of such models is rarely validated with independent data, so we validated our model predictions with 2-independent datasets. We first assessed the correlation between predicted and observed habitat use for 28 telemetry-collared bears in the Jemez Mountains. Predicted habitat use was positively correlated with observed use for all 3 years (2012: rho = 0.81; 2013: rho = 0.87; 2014: rho = 0.90). We then predicted the probability of use within a cell where a bear mortality was documented using 2043 mortality locations from sport harvest, depredation, and vehicle collisions. The probability of habitat use at a mortality location was also positively correlated with observed use by the species (2012: rho = 0.74; 2013: rho = 0.89; 2014: rho = 0.93). Our validation procedure supports the notion that occupancy models can be an effective tool for estimating habitat use and predicting the distribution of highly-mobile species when the assumption of geographic closure has been violated. Our findings may be of interest to studies that are estimating habitat use for highly-mobile species that are secretive or rare, difficult to capture, or expensive to monitor with other more intensive methods.

As these pesticides exhibit a high risk of secondary poisoning for rodent predators, we examined whether the Reunion harriers were exposed to and potentially poisoned by ARs. The AR concentrations in the livers of 58 harrier carcasses collected from 1999 to 2016 were measured. Both the temporal and spatial trends were analysed, and the influences of individual and landscape characteristics on the liver concentrations and potential poisoning were determined. AR residues were detected in 93% of the harriers. Difenacoum was the most frequently found (73% of positive races), while brodifacoum and bromadiolone showed the highest concentrations. Both the numbers of harriers exposed to ARs and of individuals that were potentially poisoned increased over time. This is particularly alarming as the number of harriers potentially poisoned by brodifacoum increased dramatically beginning in 2014. We also showed that the landscape composition of the townships influenced the AR exposure, as the concentrations increased with the proportion of urban areas and showed a peak at 25% of the township under sugarcane cultivation. We conclude that AR poisoning is likely a main threat for Reunion harrier conservation and propose several actions to limit poisoning.

Loss of endemic fish species drives impacts on functional richness, redundancy and vulnerability in freshwater ecoregions of Sundaland	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Southeast Asia Tropical; Functional diversity; Ecosystem functioning; Extinction; Machine learning; Conservation	ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; EXTINCTION RISK; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; RESILIENCE; EXTRAPOLATION; RAREFACTION	Fishes are a speciose and ecologically important group within severely threatened or impacted freshwater habitats of Sundaland, whose contributions to ecosystem functioning can be inferred from their functional diversity. However, there is limited understanding of the potential impacts of anthropogenic species loss on ichthyofaunal functional diversity in the region. We therefore aimed to characterise the functional diversity of fishes across freshwater ecoregions in Sundaland, and predict potential impacts of anthropogenic species losses on functional diversity, in order to identify priority ecoregions for freshwater fish conservation. To this end, data comprising nine functional traits of 893 Sundaic freshwater fish species were compiled and analysed to compute measures of functional richness, functional redundancy and functional vulnerability. We then modelled the loss of extinction-prone species (identified using a trait-based conditional inference forest approach) within each ecoregion, and quantified the resulting impacts on functional diversity. Both functional richness and functional redundancy scale positively with species richness across ecoregions, but functional vulnerability is widespread. Functional entities comprising moderate- to large-sized omnivores or higher carnivores are particularly vulnerable, and the same is true for fishes with superiorly-oriented and toothed mouthparts. Removal of susceptible endemic species in each ecoregion resulted in the erosion of functional redundancy and exacerbation of functional vulnerability, but functional richness was relatively less impacted. Overall, our findings suggest a trajectory of accelerating impacts on functional diversity (and by extension, ecosystem function) if species losses continue unabated. From these results, we identify the Malay Peninsula Eastern Slope ecoregion as a potential conservation priority.	[Chua, Kenny W. J.; Yeo, Darren C.

Here, we evaluated the consequences of delaying conservation actions to protect ES in the Brazilian Cerrado, the most diverse tropical savanna in the world, which is threatened by rapid expansion of agriculture. We generated land use maps for the present and two future periods (2025 and 2050), using a comprehensive land use model. Based on these maps, we modeled the provision of six ES: water yield, sediment retention, nutrient retention, carbon storage, net primary productivity and wild food provision. We identified priority areas for safeguarding ES to meet four conservation targets (i.e. 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of each ES). We found that expected land use changes tended to diminish ES provision over time and modify their spatial distribution. Priority areas in the region also tended to differ spatially between present and future. Moreover, priority areas identified for the future will encompass more extensive altered environments than those for present day landscapes. Our study highlights the importance of avoiding delays in conservation actions, as this may exacerbate conflicts between conservation and development. Arguments based on ES could create new incentives to simultaneously conserve both ES and the biodiversity associated with them in the region.

Over a century of data reveal more than 80% decline in butterflies in the Netherlands	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Distribution; JAGS; List length analysis; Living Planet Index; Monitoring	SPECIES RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; BIODIVERSITY; TRENDS; INDEX; LIST	Opportunistic butterfly records from 1890 to 2017 were analysed to quantitatively estimate the overall long-term change in occurrence of butterfly species in the Netherlands. For 71 species, we assessed trends in the number of occupied 5 km x 5 km sites by applying a modified List Length method, which takes into account changes in observation effort. We summarised the species trends in a Multi-Species Indicator (MSI) by taking the geometric mean of the species indices. Between 1890-1930 and 1981-1990, the MSI decreased by 67%; downward trends were detected for 42 species, many of which have disappeared completely from the Netherlands. Monitoring count data available from 1992 showed a further 50% decline in MSI. Combined, this yields an estimated decline of 84% in 1890-2017. We argue that in reality the loss is likely even higher. We also assessed separate MSIs for three major butterfly habitat types in the Netherlands: grassland, woodland and heathland. Butterflies strongly declined in all three habitats alike. The trend has stabilised over recent decades in grassland and woodland, but the decline continues in heathland.	[van Strien, Arco J.; Poot, Martin J.

Protected area effectiveness in a sea of palm oil: A Sumatran case study	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Deforestation; Elaeis guineensis; Generalized boosted regression models; Statistical matching; Protected areas; Palm oil; Sumatra; Tiger	FOREST LOSS; DEFORESTATION; CONSERVATION; INDONESIA; POPULATION	Despite the establishment of a national protected area system at the beginning of the 20th century to protect some of the world's most biodiverse forests, Indonesia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, due in part to the expansion of the global palm oil industry. The unique ecosystems of Sumatra, Indonesia provide habitat for critically endangered Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae), Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus swnatrensis), and two species of orangutans (Pongo abelii and Pongo tapanuliensis). In this study, we use a matching method with generalized boosted models to determine the effectiveness of three nationally protected areas in preventing deforestation from 2002 to 2016. We also examine leakage - an increase in deforestation directly outside of protected areas relative to the wider landscape - to provide a clearer picture of the effects of agricultural expansion in this landscape. We found that Tesso Nilo National Park, with its lowland rain forest and conditions suitable for oil palm, offered the least protection from deforestation (avoided deforestation rate = 4.18%, p < 0.05 95% CI [1.97% - 6.45%]). Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, which may experience some de facto protection (i.e. protection due to factors independent of policy) with its mountainous terrain and difficult access, had the highest avoided deforestation rate (26.36%, p < 0.05 95% CI [24.17-28.55]), but had relatively high leakage (10.21%, p < 0.05 95% CI [7.51-12.98]). The low avoided deforestation rate in Tesso Nilo could be due to high localized human population and/or other socio-economic factors we were unable to control for in this study. The quantitative evidence of deforestation and effectiveness of protected areas in this heavily modified landscape supports the need for increased enforcement around protected areas locally, and globally in other oil palm production regions. These actions are critical in the preservation of global, tropical endemic flora and fauna.

Conservation of data deficient species under multiple threats: Lessons from an iconic tropical butterfly (Teinopalpus aureus)	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Climate change; Cross-border conservation; Habitat loss; Insect conservation; Southeast Asia; Wildlife trade	DISTRIBUTION MODELS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; PROTECTED AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; EXTINCTION; LANDSCAPE; TRADE; DEFORESTATION	With increasing pressure from wildlife trade, conservation efforts must balance deficiencies in distribution data for species (the Wallacean shortfall) with the risk of increasing accessibility of locality for collectors. The Golden Kaiser-I-Hind (Teinopalpus aureus Mell) is an iconic butterfly restricted to Southeast Asia, popular in trade markets but lacking in ecological and conservation information. We compiled occurrence records and used them to assess multiple threats of T. aureus distribution-wide and at the national level. Results of species distribution models suggest that suitable habitats of T. aureus are montane forests in mid to high elevations in Southern China, Laos and Vietnam. However, habitat networks for the species are poorly connected, with some portions of its distribution experiencing intensive deforestation and threatened by climate change. The trade assessment results showed specimens of T. aureus were available for sale with high prices, indicating potential pressure from trade markets. We also found different conservation statuses and efforts to protect T. aureus across countries; the species is under strict protection in China, moderate protection in Vietnam and has no protection in Laos. Both recorded locations and projected distribution in the three countries were poorly covered by protected areas. These results together demonstrate the importance of distribution data in conservation management of threatened species while highlighting trade-offs inherent in not making location information widely available when trade pressure is present. Finally, we strongly encourage cross-border cooperation in sharing ecological information for consistent conservation management of species under multiple threats from habitat loss, climate change and illegal wildlife trade.

Important areas and conservation sites for a community of globally threatened marine predators of the Southern Indian Ocean	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas; Seabirds; Amsterdam Island; Bio-logging	ENDANGERED AMSTERDAM ALBATROSS; LONGLINE FISHERIES; SEABIRD BYCATCH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESTRICTED SEARCH; POPULATION TRENDS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; 1ST-PASSAGE TIME; HABITAT USE; AT-SEA	In the Southern Ocean, the impact of environmental changes and increasing human encroachment is causing declines in several populations of seabirds. Amsterdam island (77 degrees 33'E; 37 degrees 50'S) hosts some emblematic but globally threatened seabird species with alarming population trends. In 2017, concerns about Amsterdam Island's marine biodiversity led to the extension of a marine reserve to the boundaries of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Nevertheless, it is unknown whether this protected area is sufficiently large to encompass the most important foraging hotspots of the threatened seabirds, particularly during key stages of their life cycle (e.g. breeding period). We analysed movements of four threatened seabird species using a tracking dataset acquired over several breeding seasons from Amsterdam Island: Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis, sooty albatross Phoebetria fusca, Indian yellow-nosed albatross Thalassarche carted and northern rockhopper penguin Eudyptes moseleyi. Our objectives were threefold: (1) characterise the at-sea distribution of the above-mentioned populations and delineate the marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (mIBAs) triggered by them; (2) assess the potential threat at-sea by quantifying the overlap between seabird distribution and longline fishing efforts; (3) evaluate the coverage of identified mIBAs by marine protected areas and suggest complementary conservation actions. The identified important areas fell within the boundaries of the EEZ, but vastly exceeded the former reserve. Thus, our results reinforce the justification of the recent expansion of the reserve to the boundaries of the EEZ. However, overall seabird distributions extended beyond the EEZ (5 to 50% of the locations) and we found substantial overlap with longline fishing in the high seas. Our results provide a spatio-temporal envelope of where and when bycatch mitigation and observer coverage of longline fisheries should be mandated and enforced.

The ongoing recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Germany provides a unique opportunity to test the role of different information sources and trust on people's attitudes towards wolves. We conducted a phone survey (n = 1250) and compared country-wide attitudes towards wolves with attitudes in a specific region where wolves initially recolonized and have been present since 2000. In particular, we investigate the relationship between information sources, trust and people's attitudes while accounting for factors like knowledge, exposure and socio-cultural determinants of respondents. We found significant differences in attitudes and knowledge about wolves as well as in the use and frequency of information sources between the two population samples. Higher knowledge, information from books and films, science-based information, and higher trust in information sources related positively with positive attitudes towards wolves. Comparatively, information from press or TV news was associated with more negative attitudes. Providing science-based information to the public and building trust in information is likely to be one measure, among others, to dampen extreme attitudes and improve people's appreciation of costs and benefits of human-carnivore coexistence. Management of conflictual situations emerging from large carnivore recolonization in Europe and beyond should consider incorporating assessments of people's use of and trust in information in addition to existing tools to pave new ways for constructive human-carnivore coexistence.

Plant Production Responses to Precipitation Differ Along an Elevation Gradient and Are Enhanced Under Extremes	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						biomass; drought; climate change; grassland; net primary production; remote sensing; southwestern USA	CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; DROUGHT; BIOMES	The sensitivity of plant production to precipitation underlies the functioning of ecosystems. Studies that relate long-term mean annual precipitation and production across multiple sites (spatial relationship) or examine interannual linkages within a site (temporal relationship) can reveal biophysical controls over ecosystem function but have limited ability to infer responses to extreme changes in precipitation that may become more common under climate change. To overcome limitations of using a single approach, we integrated satellite- and ground-based estimates of production with a standardized, multi-site precipitation manipulation experiment across a grassland elevation gradient in the southwestern USA. The responsiveness of production to changes in precipitation followed the order: temporal (0.06-0.13gm(-2)mm(-1))<spatial (0.21gm(-2)mm(-1))<experimental relationship (0.25-0.42gm(-2)mm(-1)), suggesting that spatial and temporal relationships determined with satellite- and ground-based estimates cannot be extrapolated to determine the effect of extreme events. A strong production response to differences in mean annual precipitation across sites reinforces a regional control of water availability. Interannual sensitivity to precipitation was strongest at the low elevation grasslands, and the high elevation mixed conifer meadow had a large reduction in production in a drought year. Extreme experimental drought strongly reduced production in low elevation grasslands, but water addition had mixed effects. High elevation meadows were insensitive to both extreme drought and water addition. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for extreme climate regimes and site-level factors when scaling climate change effects up to regional and global scales.

Long-term Nutrient Fertilization Increased Soil Carbon Storage in California Grasslands	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Nutrient Network (NutNet); particulate organic matter (POM); mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM); priming; C; N ratio; Mediterranean climate	ORGANIC-MATTER FRACTIONS; PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; NITROGEN; DYNAMICS; SEQUESTRATION; LITTER; LIGHT; STABILIZATION; DECOMPOSITION; MECHANISMS	Elevated nutrient deposition often increases primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems and thus has the potential to increase the flux of carbon (C) into soils. An important step toward greater understanding of nutrient effects on C storage involves assessing effects on different fractions of the soil C pool across a range of soil types. We quantified the combined effects of 8years of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and micronutrient fertilization on the C storage in bulk soil and in density fractions at four grassland sites in California. When averaged across sites, fertilization increased soil light fraction C by 64% relative to the control in the 0-10cm depth. The increase in light fraction C likely resulted from the fertilization-induced increase in plant C input to soil, as aboveground net primary productivity also consistently increased with fertilization across sites. Effects of fertilization on heavy fraction C were highly site specific, having positive, negative, or no effect at individual sites. The response of heavy fraction C to fertilization appeared to be related to mean annual precipitation and soil bulk density. Overall, bulk soil C concentration showed a marginally significant increase of 6% with fertilization when averaged across sites (P=0.07). Our results indicate that biomass production and soil light fraction are generally sensitive to fertilization across grasslands in California, likely contributing to increases in soil C storage. Responses of heavy fraction C, on the other hand, vary greatly among sites and may depend on climate and soil characteristics.

Observations of agricultural legacies on forest soil properties have been site specific and contrasting. Sites and regions vary along gradients in intrinsic soil characteristics, phosphorus (P) management and nitrogen (N) deposition which could affect the magnitude of soil property responses to past cultivation. A single investigation along these gradients could reconcile contradictions and elucidate context-dependency in agricultural legacies. We analysed soil from 24 paired post-agricultural (established after approx. 1950) and ancient (in existence before 1850) forests in eight European regions. Post-agricultural forest soil had higher pH, higher P-concentration and lower carbon (C) to N ratio compared to ancient forest. Importantly, gradients of soil characteristics, regional P surplus and N deposition affected the magnitude of these legacies. First, we found that three soil groups, characterising inherent soil fertility, determined extractable base cations, pH and concentrations of total N, organic C and total P. Second, regions with greater current P surplus from agriculture correlated with the highest P legacy in post-agricultural forests. Finally, we found that N deposition lowered pH across forests and increased total N and organic C concentrations in post-agricultural forest. These results suggest that (1) legacies from cultivation consistently determine soil properties in post-agricultural forest and (2) these legacies depend on regional and environmental context, including soil characteristics, regional P surplus and N deposition. Identifying gradients that influence the magnitude of agricultural legacies is key to informing how, where and why forest ecosystems respond to contemporary environmental change.

Model inputs consisted of hydrological, bathymetric and chemical data that are easily measurable at the lake and basin scale. Among the model outputs were mean OC loads (5-123gm(-2)y(-1)), exports (1.10(-3)-108gm(-2)y(-1)), mineralization (3-12gm(-2)y(-1)), and sedimentation (2-6gm(-2)y(-1)). Active lake-catchment systems received and emitted the largest amounts of allochthonous OC, whereas lakes depending mostly on atmospheric inputs exhibited much more modest OC fluxes. Simulated organic carbon retention varied accordingly from 12% in some drainage lakes to 99% in seepage lakes. Lake allochthonous OC loads and exports were strongly correlated to drainage ratio (catchment area/lake area, R-2: 0.89 and 0.92, respectively) and to forest ratio (catchment forested area/lake area, R-2: 0.86 and 0.89), but not to wetland ratio. The simplicity of the model makes it easily transposable to a large variety of lakes. For a better insight into carbon processing, we suggest to follow a more integrative approach accounting for interactions between lake hydrology and catchment land cover. [GRAPHICS] .

Studies of the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for northern latitudes indicate recent changes in plant productivity. These detected greening and browning trends are often attributed to a lengthening of the growing season from warming temperatures. Yet, disturbance-recovery dynamics are strong drivers of productivity and can mask direct effects of climate change. Here, we analyze 1-km resolution NDVI data from 1989 to 2014 for the northern latitude forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for changes in plant productivity to address the following questions: (1) To what degree has greening taken place in the GYE over the past three decades? and (2) What is the relative importance of disturbance and climate in explaining NDVI trends? We found that the spatial extents of statistically significant productivity trends were limited to local greening and browning areas. Disturbance history, predominately fire disturbance, was a major driver of these detected NDVI trends. After accounting for fire-, insect-, and human-caused disturbances, increasing productivity trends remained. Productivity of northern latitude forests is generally considered temperature-limited; yet, we found that precipitation was a key driver of greening in the GYE.

Litter Decomposition in Yellowstone Grasslands: The Roles of Large Herbivores, Litter Quality, and Climate	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						litter decomposition; litter quality; nutrient cycling; climate; grassland; herbivores; grazing; Yellowstone National Park	SOIL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; LEAF-LITTER; TEMPERATE GRASSLAND; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; LIGNIN CONTROL; PLANT; NITROGEN; ECOSYSTEM; RESPONSES; RATES	Plant litter decomposition is a key process that influences carbon and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Litter decomposition is controlled by a number of factors such as temperature, moisture, litter quality, and the composition of soil microbial communities. Large herbivores can affect litter decomposition by modifying each of these factors. The goal of this study was to examine the contribution of herbivores in determining decomposition rates across an ecosystem with a steep climatic gradient. We examined the effect of migratory grazing ungulates (primarily elk) on litter decomposition by comparing rates of mass loss over 1.5years inside and outside fenced exclosures at 10 grassland sites that spanned gradients of temperature, precipitation, plant community composition, and grazing intensity in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Based on previous studies indicating positive feedbacks of herbivory on soil carbon and nutrient processes in grazed YNP grasslands, we predicted that YNP grazers should also improve litter quality and stimulate litter decomposition. Instead, we found that variation in precipitation was the predominant driver of litter decomposition across the ecosystem. Grazing decreased litter lignin:nitrogen ratio (improved quality), but did not affect decomposition rates. Our results suggest that while grazers can influence the quality of litter, climate is a more important driver of litter decomposition across the YNP ecosystem.

As the longest-lived tree in the Hyrcanian forest, English yew, Taxus baccata L., is a rare and endangered species in the forests along the Iranian coasts of the Caspian Sea, which is likely affected by climate change. This paper explores the current and future distribution of this species, using four species distribution models. In order to project the effect of climate change on the distribution of English yew by 2050 and 2070, output from the HadGEM2-ES climate model was used for two RCPs scenarios (2.6 and 8.5). The results showed a good accuracy of all the models for the distribution of this species with a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.92. Using ensemble forecasting as an algorithm for reducing the uncertainty in species distribution modeling shows that the suitable habitats for this species is about 6000km(2) for the current climate conditions in the study area. Range size analysis indicates that in 2050, in the most optimistic scenario (RCP 2.6), only 17% of the habitats will retain their suitability, while in the most pessimistic scenario (RCP 8.5), this amount will decrease to 2%. In 2070, in the most optimistic scenario, only 10% of the currently suitable habitats will retain their suitability, while in the RCP 8.5, no stable suitable habitats will be left. It is strongly recommended that the impacts of climate change on English yew should be considered in the management decisions and conservation plans in the Hyrcanian forests.

Advancing conservation planning for western chimpanzees using IUCN SSC APES-the case of a taxon-specific database	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						species distribution model; Pan troglodytes verus; development corridor; West Africa	BIODIVERSITY; CORRIDORS; DECLINE	Even though information on global biodiversity trends becomes increasingly available, large taxonomic and spatial data gaps persist at the scale relevant to planning conservation interventions. This is because data collectors are hesitant to share data with global repositories due to workload, lack of incentives, and perceived risk of losing intellectual property rights. In contrast, due to greater conceptual and methodological proximity, taxon-specific database initiatives can provide more direct benefits to data collectors through research collaborations and shared authorship. The IUCNSSC Ape Populations, Environments and Surveys (A.P.E.S.) database was created in 2005 as a repository for data on great apes and other primate taxa. It aims to acquire field survey data and make different types of data accessible, and provide up-to-date species status information. To support the current update of the conservation action plan for western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) we compiled field surveys for this taxon from IUCN SSC A.P.E.S., 75% of which were unpublished. We used spatial modeling to infer total population size, range-wide density distribution, population connectivity and landscape-scale metrics. We estimated a total abundance of 52 800 (95% CI 17 577-96 564) western chimpanzees, of which only 17% occurred in national parks. We also found that 10% of chimpanzees live within 25 km of four multi-national 'development corridors' currently planned for West Africa. These large infrastructure projects aim to promote economic integration and agriculture expansion, but are likely to cause further habitat loss and reduce population connectivity. We close by demonstrating the wealth of conservation-relevant information derivable from a taxon-specific database like IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. and propose that a network of many more such databases could be created to provide the essential information to conservation that can neither be supplied by one-off projects nor by global repositories, and thus are highly complementary to existing initiatives.

Here, we present modifications of a spatially-explicit individual-based simulation model (CDMetaPOP) to accommodate a two-species system and simulations involving interspecific hybridization. We first describe how a hybrid (H) index is used to distinguish individuals of interspecific descent from those of either parental species. User-defined thresholds provide flexibility in the degree of admixture tolerated for classifying 'pure' individuals. We then detail relationships further informed by the H index, including individual growth, temperature-based fitness and selection, and mate preference behavior. Empirically derived species- and system-specific information can be incorporated into these relationships, for example, to produce differential growth among hybrids and parental species. Lastly, we demonstrate an application of this simulation framework by exploring the relative effects of temperature-based selection, mate preference behavior, and hybrid fitness on the rate and spatial extent of sympatric hybridization between two native riverine fish species, bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), in the upper Skagit River system (United States and Canada). Results from this demonstration provide guidance for future empirical studies of bull trout, a federally threatened species. Understanding factors that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of hybridization, as well as the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon, is of increasing importance given shifting species ranges due to large-scale landscape modification and a changing global climate. Our framework can be used to study a wide range of hybridization dynamics in any terrestrial or aquatic system, including comparisons of distinct environmental conditions or potential management responses.

By comparing the effect of two organic cosubstrates, the aim of our research is to determine the feasibility of composting as a bioremediation method for the treatment of the solid phase of the hydrocarbon residue. For this purpose, four treatments of the pollutant waste were established in triplicate: waste only; waste with bulking agent (1:2); waste with fish sludge and bulking agent (1:2:6); and waste with municipal sewage sludge and bulking agent (1:2:6). The composting system consisted of 12 reactors with a capacity of 30 L, each equipped with aeration and temperature control. Both at the beginning and the end of the experiment (20 days), we evaluated the physicochemical parameters, the structure of the microbial community through phospholipid fatty acid analysis, and the total petroleum hydrocarbon content (TPH). Treatments with cosubstrates maintained thermophilic temperatures, during 14 and 8 days in fish and municipal sludge respectively, while in the controls mesophilic conditions were maintained. The incorporation of fish sludge decreased TPH present in the initial mixture by 39.5%. The municipal sludge treatment resulted in a lower of temperatures and a TPH decrease close to 23.9%. In the control treatments, there was a slight TPH decrease, mainly due to the forced ventilation. Although, both composting treatments with cosubstrates proved adequate for the bioremediation of residue from hydrocarbon storage tanks, fish sludge presented best bioremediation conditions. Municipal sewage sludge provided a bioaugmentation effect due to its rich diversity and microbial biomass. Fish sludge could have biostimulant and surfactant effect producing an aliphatic mixture of pollutant waste with the nutritional requirements to promote the development of fungal communities.

Sewage and wastewater treatment, therefore, needs to be improved in order to remove pharmaceutical residues from the effluent. One such treatment improvement is effluent ozonation. Even though ozonation has proven to be very efficient in reducing pharmaceutical parent compound concentrations in wastewater effluents, much remains unclear regarding potentially toxic ozonation by-product (OBP) formation. In this study, we sought to elucidate the aquatic toxicity of ozonated pharmaceuticals in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos in a static 144 h post fertilization (hpf) fish embryotoxicity (ZFET) assay. Three pharmaceuticals commonly detected in wastewater effluents, i.e. carbamazepine, diclofenac, and oxazepam, were selected for testing. Toxicity was assessed before and after 1 min ozonation (0.053 mg L-1 peak O-3 concentration) and 10 min ozonation (0.147 mg L-1 peak O-3 concentration). Chemical analysis showed that carbamazepine and diclofenac were largely removed by ozone (90 +/- 11% and 97 +/- 3.8%), whereas oxazepam was removed to a lesser extent (19 +/- 5.7%). The ZFET assay revealed diverging toxicities. Diclofenac embryotoxicity decreased with increasing ozonation. Oxazepam did not cause embryotoxicity in the ZFET assay either pre- or post ozonation, but larvae swimming activity was affected at 144 hpf. Carbamazepine embryotoxicity, on the other hand, increased with increasing ozonation. Chemical analysis showed the formation of two OBPs (carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide and 10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine), possibly explaining the increased embryotoxicity. The results of this study highlight the importance of new chemical and toxicological knowledge regarding the formation of OBPs in post-ozonated effluents. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Nano-sized plastics have a much greater surface area to volume ratio than larger particles, which increases their reactivity in aquatic environment, making them potentially more toxic. Only little information is available about their behavior whereas it crucially influences their toxicity. Here, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to explore the influence of environmental factors (fresh- and saltwater, dissolved organic matter) on the behavior (surface charge and aggregation state) of three different nano polystyrene beads (50 nm), with (i) no surface functionalization (plain), (ii) a carboxylic or (iii) an amine functionalization. Overall, the positive amine particles were very mildly affected by changes in environmental factors with no effect of the salinity gradient (from 0 to 653 mM) and of a range 1-30 mu g.L-1 and 1-10 mu g.L-1 of organic matter in artificial seawater and ultrapure water, respectively. These observations are supposedly linked to a coating specificity leading to repulsive mechanisms. In contrast, the stability of the negatively charged carboxylic and plain nanobeads was lost under an increasing ionic strength, resulting in homo-aggregation (up to 10 mu m). The increase in organic matter content had negligible effect on these two nanobeads. Analysis performed over several days demonstrated that nanoplastics formed evolving dynamic structures detected mainly with an increase of the homo-aggregation level. Thus, surface properties of given polymers/particles are expected to influence their fate in complex and dynamic aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most studies focus on possible climatic limits to species' distributions and have ignored the role of biotic interactions, despite theoretical support for their importance in setting distributional limits. We used field experiments and simulations to estimate contributions of mammalian herbivory to a range boundary in the Californian annual plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. A steep gradient of increasing probability of herbivory occurred across the boundary, and a reanalysis of prior transplant experiments revealed that herbivory drove severalfold declines in lifetime fitness at and beyond the boundary. Simulations showed that populations could potentially persist beyond the range margin in the absence of herbivory. Using data from a narrowly sympatric subspecies, Clarkia xantiana parviflora, we also showed that delayed phenology is strongly associated with C. xantiana ssp. xantiana's susceptibility to herbivory and low fitness beyond its border. Overall, our results provide some of the most comprehensive evidence to date of how the interplay of demography, traits, and spatial gradients in species interactions can produce a geographic range limit, and they lend empirical support to recent developments in range limits theory.

We tested alternative hypotheses of factors potentially driving these phenomena in a population of joint-nesting acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus). During periods of high population density and thus low independent breeding opportunities, acorn woodpecker females formed joint-nesting coalitions with close kin. Coalitions were typically associated with groups with a male bias. We found strong evidence for both inter- and intrasexual conflict, as joint nesting conferred a fitness benefit to some males, a significant fitness cost to females, and no gain in per capita reproductive output for either sex. Such conflict, particularly the cost to females, may be an important reason why joint nesting is rare among cooperatively breeding taxa.

Although selection can favor the ability of organisms to preferentially cooperate with close kin, indiscriminately helping all group mates may yield comparable fitness returns if relatedness within groups is very high. Here, we show that meerkats (Suricata suricatta) are largely indiscriminate altruists who do not alter the amount of help provided to pups or group mates in response to their relatedness to them. We present a model showing that indiscriminate altruism may yield greater fitness payoffs than kin discrimination where most group members are close relatives and errors occur in the estimation of relatedness. The presence of errors in the estimation of relatedness provides a feasible explanation for associations between kin discriminative helping and group relatedness in eusocial and cooperatively breeding animals.

Larval diapause of the parasitoid Nasonia vitripennis is maternally induced following a certain number of days (switch point) of a given critical photoperiod (CPP). Both the switch point and the CPP follow a latitudinal cline in European N. vitripennis populations. We previously showed that allelic frequencies of the clock gene period correlate with this diapause induction cline. Here we report that circadian expression of four clock genes-period (per), cryptochrome-2 (cry-2), clock (clk), and cycle (cyc)-oscillates as a function of photoperiod and latitude of origin in wasps from populations from the extremes of the cline. Expression amplitudes are lower in northern wasps, indicating a weaker, more plastic clock. Northern wasps also have a later onset of activity and longer free-running rhythms under constant conditions. RNA interference of per caused speeding up of the circadian clock, changed the expression of other clock genes, and delayed diapause in both southern and northern wasps. These results point toward adaptive latitudinal clock gene expression differences and to a key role of per in the timing of photoperiodic diapause induction of N. vitripennis.

Recent quantitative methods have been developed to characterize these nutritional trade-offs from performance landscapes on which traits are mapped on a nutrient space defined by two nutrients. This limitation constrains the broad applications of previous methods to more complex data, and a generalized framework is needed. Here, we build on previous methods and introduce a generalized vector-based approach-the vector of position approach-to study nutritional trade-offs in complex multidimensional spaces. The vector of position approach allows the estimate of performance variations across entire landscapes (peaks and valleys) and comparison of these variations between animals. Using landmark published data sets on life span and reproduction landscapes, we illustrate how our approach gives accurate quantifications of nutritional trade-offs in two- and three-dimensional spaces and can bring new insights into the underlying nutritional differences in trait expression between species. The vector of position approach provides a generalized framework for investigating nutritional differences in life-history trait expression within and between species, an essential step for the development of comparative research on the evolution of animal nutritional strategies.

Most of the aforementioned compounds have been classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic and represent a health risk for staff exposed to contaminated objects. A total of 30 compounds were analysed in settled dust, particulate matter and surrounding air collected at several locations in the natural history collections and adjacent rooms of the Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin (MfN, Natural History Museum, Berlin, Germany). Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques were used to quantify dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (2,4-DDT; 4,4-DDT) and their metabolites (2,4-DDE; 4,4-DDE; 2,4-DDD; 4,4-DDD), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 3 isomers of hexachlorocyclohexanes (-HCH, -HCH, -HCH), the degradation product of -HCH with similar toxicological profile, gamma-pentachlorocyclohexene (-PCH) and pentachlorophenol (PCP). Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to analyse arsenic and mercury. In order to assess the pathways of contamination with biocides in dust, formations of particulate matter during individual daily work activities, particle number concentrations (PNCs) were measured. Heavy element concentrations found at the MfN were higher than the organochlorine compounds. The maximum concentration of arsenic and mercury in dust was 3507mg/kg and 32mg/kg, respectively, and in air, 48ng/m(3) and 1.6ng/m(3), respectively. The maximum concentration of the sum of DDTs in dust was 2mg/kg (not detected in air); for PCP, the maximum levels in dust and air were 0.65mg/kg and 10ng/m(3), respectively; for -HCH, 130mg/kg and 320ng/m(3), respectively; and finally, for -PCH, 2.1mg/kg and 230ng/m(3), respectively. Twelve PNC measurements were obtained from seven different collection rooms and the diaries of the participants' activities. PNCs were highly variable between work activities. Higher personal PNCs were associated with activities like opening storage boxes with prepared animals, reading old books or handling objects. This study has shown that taxidermic objects in museum collection may be a cause for arsenic exposure during handling of objects.

The number of multiple-stress experiments in ecotoxicology is growing constantly, but pharmaceuticals have mostly been disregarded. As an omnipresent pharmaceutical in the water cycle, the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (CBZ) was chosen as test substance for our 28-day binary stress experiments with the non biting midge Chironomus riparius. Elevated population densities, food limitation, temperature, and a reduction of organic matter (OM) were chosen as relevant environmental stressors. In five stress intensities, they were combined with the 10% lethal concentration (LC10) of CBZ to investigate the joint effect of stress and CBZ exposure. We were able to demonstrate that the toxicity of CBZ increased with higher larval densities and reduced OM. Mortality of the midges exposed to CBZ increased by a factor of 1.69 with 100 larvae per vessel and by a factor of 2.87 at 0.25% OM compared to the conventional test protocol, while the stressors alone did not reduce survival. Conventional low-stress laboratory tests as conducted for the risk assessment of chemicals would have underestimated the toxicity of CBZ. Even though it is necessary that more than binary stressor combinations are included in future experiments, the present results extend our knowledge about the toxicity of pharmaceuticals, such as CBZ, in stressful environments and emphasize the importance of including pharmaceuticals in multiple stress experiments.

Variable responses of dissolved organic carbon to precipitation events in boreal drinking water lakes	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Lake water quality; Dissolved organic carbon; Drinking water; Climate change; Storm events	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; MATTER; LANDSCAPE; CHEMISTRY; TRENDS; INDICATORS; STREAM; EXPORT; SCALE	In boreal regions, increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) have been linked to extreme wet years; however, less is known about the extent to which precipitation events are altering DOC concentration and quality. We assessed the effects of rain events on a suite of six lakes in Maine, U.S.A., to better understand how events alter DOC quantity and quality. DOC concentrations and DOC quality (measured as DOC-specific absorption coefficients (Specific Ultraviolet Absorbance (SUVA(254) (also a(254)*). a(320)*, and a(380)*)) were quantified 24 h before, and at three time points (24-48 h, 5-7 days, and 3 weeks) after five different precipitation events. Our results revealed three types of responses across the lakes: (1) an initial spike in DOC concentrations of 30-133% and in the three quality metrics of 20-86% compared to pre-storm levels, followed by return to pre-storm concentrations; (2) a sustained increase in DOC concentrations (by 4-23%) and an increase in the three DOC quality metrics (by 1-43%) through the second post-storm sampling, with concentrations falling by the third post-storm sampling compared to pre-storm levels; and (3) no change during all sampling periods. Lake residence time was a key driver of changes in DOC concentration and DOC quality in response to storm events. Our research provides evidence that precipitation events contribute to short-term abrupt changes in DOC quantity and quality that are largely driven by key landscape and lake characteristics. These changes in DOC may have important implications for management of water utilities, including alteration or implementation of treatment strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluating improvements to exposure estimates from fate and transport models by incorporating environmental sampling effort and contaminant use	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Pesticide; Field concentration; Pesticide in water calculator; Pesticide regulation; Pond pollution; Exposure assessment; Exposure characterization; Estimated environmental concentrations	FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; SURFACE WATERS; INSECTICIDE CONCENTRATIONS; PESTICIDES; CHEMICALS; HEALTH	Widespread chemical contamination represents one of the largest threats of the Anthropocene. The Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) is a fate and transport model used by the Environmental Protection Agency and Health Canada to estimate pesticide exposures in lentic freshwater ecosystems and make pesticide registration decisions. Here, we show that maximum measured concentrations of 31% of herbicides and 42% of insecticides exceeded maximum estimated environmental concentrations (EECs) produced by the PWC, suggesting that EECs often do not represent worst-case exposure as they have been purported to do. Based on this observation, we generated statistical models using EECs and over 600,000 field measurements of 31 common insecticides and herbicides to document if the congruence of EECs and maximum field measurements could be improved by accounting for environmental sampling effort (number of times a pesticide is sampled) and contaminant application, factors commonly ignored in most fate and transport models. For lentic systems, variance in pesticide field measurements explained by EECs increased by 50% when sampling effort was included. For lotic systems, variance explained increased by only 4%, most likely because lotic systems are sampled over 4.9 times as much as lentic systems. Including use more than doubled the ability of the EECs to predict maximum pesticides concentrations in lentic systems. Our results suggest that exposure characterization in risk assessment can likely be improved by considering sampling effort and use, thus providing more defensible environmental standards and regulations.

Two views are provided for the analysis: an emission-driven view and a deposition-driven view. Different visualization modules are used to reproduce the global pollution network and identify the biggest sources and sinks of pollution. Visual modelling helps to understand the linkages and interconnections in the transboundary pollution network. Our interactive outputs give the options to bring out the crucial actions of the global sourcereceptor air pollution scheme and highlight the top emitters or receptors of pollution. Ranking of countries in decreasing order of pollution responsibility and/or vulnerability using graph metrics is a main result. Data sources are emissions-depositions (or source-receptor) tables of air pollutants, available online from the data repository of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP) of the Long-Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe. In our computer-based visual analysis, we design custom visualizations by writing code.

Results from this work estimate that in U.S. single-family households with income less than 200% of the federal poverty level, energy efficiency packages tailored to maximize net present value could result in an estimated $13 billion per year in energy cost savings, or $670 per year for an average household, corresponding to about 1 EJ (0.9 quads) of annual primary energy savings. These types of metrics can be estimated for other geographies (regions, states, and counties) and for other ranges of household income. These results can be used by policymakers and program designers to improve the cost-effectiveness of income qualified programs and to improve the equity of non-income-qualified programs. The results can also be used to understand how energy efficiency opportunities differ between urban and rural areas, as well as how energy efficiency can spur economic development in areas that have had high poverty rates for decades.

Putting on partisan glasses: Political identity, quality of life, and oil and gas production in Colorado	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Hydraulic fracturing; Unconventional oil and gas; Quality of life; Mediation; Political identity	TEA-PARTY MOVEMENT; NATURAL-GAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; UNITED-STATES; ECHO CHAMBERS; LAND-USE; ENERGY; RISK; ATTITUDES	Unconventional oil and gas technologies such as hydraulic fracturing have drastically increased the volume of oil and gas produced in the U.S., while simultaneously bringing drilling closer to residential areas. We examine quality of life impacts of unconventional oil and gas production, arguing that how people perceive its local effects is rooted in their political identities. Using survey data from three northern Colorado communities, we employ counterfactual mediation methods to understand relationships between political identity, perceived socio-environmental and community changes from oil and gas development, and self-reported quality of life. We find significant differences in how people perceive local development based upon political identity, whereby Tea Party supporters see little negative impact, and in turn are likely to believe that local development improves their quality of life. At the other extreme, Democrats perceive more negative community changes from oil and gas development and are more apt to believe that it reduces their quality of life. Republicans who do not support the Tea Party and political independents hold more mixed views. Overall, our analysis suggests that people's perceptions of local energy development and how it matters for their quality of life is, to some degree, a function of their political identities.

It would be a mistake, however, to assume that public support for decarbonization can be gained automatically by pointing out threats from climate change, particularly in light of the role coal plays in the local and national economy and in energy security. In this article we search for factors affecting public support for a coal phase-out in media content. According to the theory of agenda setting, the media establishes problems calling for solutions and influences public perceptions of the (un)importance of those problems. We illustrate this case on the example of the Czech Republic. The paper demonstrates that Czech media has cultivated a discursive environment in which coal mining is separated from coal combustion, neglecting the inevitable interconnection of these two processes; coal consumption is not characterized as an environmental problem; and the economic problems of private companies more easily become public problems, making future coal phase-out policies harder to implement.

We use data from 11,279 rural housing transactions in the period 2007-2015 and trace spatial effects of biogas plants on the local property market. Our results show that large biogas plants have a significant negative impact on rural residential property values while farm-scale biogas plants have a significant positive impact. The findings suggest that preferences for or against biogas plants cannot be explained by either a NIMBY or a PIMBY phenomenon and the paper explores potential reasons for the observed disparity in valuation of farm- and large-scale biogas plants. An economic impact assessment of the choice of facility type, based on a concrete case study, indicates that the impact on residential property values may tip the scale in favor of farm-scale biogas plants. Based on these results, policy implications for planning and expansion of biogas production are discussed.

Storm flow water samples were collected from May 2017 to October 2017 across seven SW Ohio watersheds which ranged in urban land cover from 6% to 92% and in agricultural land cover from 4% to 70%. Two watersheds contained water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). Percent agricultural land cover in a watershed and storm magnitude were primary explanatory variables for total suspended solid and total phosphorus concentrations. Total nitrogen, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations were primarily explained by the presence of WRRFs and percent agricultural land cover. Increased dissolved nutrient concentrations in watersheds with WRRFs indicate that WRRFs in the study area are ineffectively removing nitrate and phosphate from effluent. Results suggest that to improve water quality during storm flows, additional management ef- forts need to be focused on agricultural watersheds and WRRFs.

Transformations in an arid landscape caused by alfalfa cropping under pressurized irrigation systems have generated a conflict between farmers and Azara's tuco-tucos (Ctenomys azarae). Mounds produced by this species damage the alfalfa cutting equipment, reduce the lifespan of harvesting machinery, and results in high production costs. The goal of this study was to determine the production variables that influence density and spatial distribution pattern of Azara's tuco-tucos' mounds within the alfalfa plots under center-pivot irrigation. We assessed the frequency and distribution of Azara's tuco-tuco mounds in plots under center-pivot irrigation during two alfalfa crop seasons. Using generalized linear models, we determined that the total number of mounds and the number of active mounds were positively related to alfalfa's stand age and height. However, there are likely other variables that we did not include that should be considered to reduce the number of mounds and, therefore, mitigate damage. Considering the emerging implementation of new agricultural practices and the distribution area of the genus Ctenomys, this unprecedented work in Latin America contributes necessary and important information for better pest control management.

Hydrodynamic Modeling Coupled with Long-term Field Data Provide Evidence for Suppression of Phytoplankton by Invasive Clams and Freshwater Exports in the San Francisco Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Residence time; Particle tracking; Chlorophyll a; Productivity; Potamocorbula amurensis	DELTA CALIFORNIA; BAY; EUTROPHICATION; RIVER; SACRAMENTO; STOICHIOMETRY; VARIABILITY; TRANSPORT; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	The San Francisco Estuary (California, USA) had abundant pelagic fish in the late 1960s, but has few pelagic fish today. A primary cause for this decline in fish is thought to be a trophic cascade, triggered by declining phytoplankton. Here, we describe the changes in pelagic community structure of the San Francisco Estuary. Then, we examine whether changes in hydrodynamics due to freshwater exports, which increased exponentially beginning in 1967, in addition to the 1986 invasion by the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, explain the phytoplankton loss. Hydrodynamic variables were reconstructed back to 1956 using statistical models fit to, and cross-validated against, output from a hydrodynamic model. Then, we regressed mean summer/fall chlorophyll athe season with the largest phytoplankton declineagainst the reconstructed hydrodynamic variables and the presence/absence of P. amurensis for 1969-2014. The regression model, which explained 78% of the interannual variation in chlorophyll a, was then used to quantify the influence of P. amurensis and exports on chlorophyll a. Based on monitoring data, chlorophyll a declined 22-fold from 1969-2014, zooplankton declined 32-fold from 1972-2014, and pelagic fish declined 92-fold from 1968-2014. Averaged over 1990-2014, the chlorophyll a model ascribed an 88% decline in chlorophyll a to P. amurensis, a 74% decline to exports (at minimum), and a 97% decline to the combined influence of P. amurensis and exports (at minimum). Thus, the decline in pelagic productivity in the San Francisco Estuary has occurred largely due to the combined impacts of the P. amurensis invasion and increased freshwater exports.

Climate variability promotes unprecedented cyanobacterial blooms in a remote, oligotrophic Ontario lake: evidence from paleolimnology	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Blue-green algae; Cyanobacteria; Climate change; Primary production; Hypoxia; Akinetes	LAKEWATER CALCIUM DECLINE; CLADOCERAN SUBFOSSILS; ILLUSTRATED GUIDE; ALGAL PRODUCTION; WATER-QUALITY; ARCTIC LAKES; CHIRONOMIDAE; SEDIMENTS; DIPTERA; TRENDS	Dickson Lake, located in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, is a remote, oligotrophic lake, where cyanobacterial blooms of the genus Dolichospermum (Ralfs ex Bornet & Flahault) P. Wacklin, L. Hoffmann and J. Komarek were reported for the first time in the fall of 2014, and subsequently in the late spring of 2015. To investigate the potential environmental triggers of these bloom events, we assessed long-term trends in water quality using a multi-proxy paleolimnological approach, examining sedimentary diatoms, chironomids, cladocerans, spectrally inferred chlorophyll a, and cyanobacterial akinetes preserved in a Pb-210-dated sediment core. Assemblage changes were modest in all biological proxies. A subtle increase in the abundance of warm-water chironomid taxa (T-opt>15 degrees C) commences in the year similar to 2000, with further increases in the most recent years of the sediment record (similar to 2013-2015). End-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations (CI-VWHO), inferred from chironomid remains, reveal a decline in oxygen concentrations over the last two decades coincident with the highest levels of sedimentary chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial akinetes in the sediment record. These paleolimnological findings corroborate observed reports of the onset of cyanobacterial blooms in Dickson Lake in late 2014 and are consistent with increasingly favourable bloom-forming conditions over the past few decades that are related to warmer air temperatures, sharp declines in wind speed, and a lengthening of the ice-free season by 2weeks since 1975. It is plausible that late ice-out and a quick onset to stratification in 2014 may have resulted in incomplete spring mixing, early onset of hypolimnetic anoxia, and increased internal nutrient loading, that, occurring during a period when climate conditions were particularly ideal for cyanobacterial proliferation, may have fueled the unprecedented algal blooms in this remote lake. Collectively, the factors causing algal blooms in remote lakes such as Dickson Lake are not yet fully understood, and it is worrisome that with continued warming the triggering conditions may become a more common feature of Algonquin Park and other minimally impacted Boreal Shield lakes in the coming years.

NIRS quantification of lake sediment composition by multiple regression using end-member spectra	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						NIRS; End-member; Multiple regression; Sediment characteristics; Organic matter; Palaeolimnology	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE; GALLOWAY; SOIL	Here we develop a novel method for quantifying sediment components, e.g. biogenic silica, organic or mineral matter, from near infrared (NIR) spectra based on fitting by multiple regression of measured spectra for end-member materials. We show that with suitable end-members our new open-source multiple regression routine gives excellent simultaneous quantification of the major components of a sediment, the concentrations comparing well with independent methods of quantification. Widely used partial least squares regression approaches rely on large environmental training data sets; our method produces comparable results, but with the advantages of negating the need for a training dataset and with greater simplicity and theoretical robustness. We demonstrate that component NIR spectra are additive, a prerequisite for use of multiple regression to un-mix the compound spectra, and show that a number of environmental materials make suitable end-members for this analysis. We show that spectral mixing is not conservative with respect to mass proportion, but rather to the relative chromatic intensity of contributing sediment components. Concentrations can be calculated using the measured spectra by correction using a chromatic intensity factor, the value of which can be measured independently. We have applied our approach to a postglacial sediment sequence from Loch Grannoch (SW Scotland) and reveal a down-core pattern of varying dominance by biogenic silica, organic and mineral content from the late glacial to present. With isolation and measurement of appropriate end-members this multivariate regression approach to interrogating NIR spectra has utility across a wide range of sedimentary environments and potentially for other spectral analytical methods.

One likely reason for this failure is the limited attention paid to the regional and landscape level ecological characteristics in farmland conservation planning. We demonstrate how to obtain conservation prioritization solutions that would address simultaneously three goals, including two landscape level targets: minimizing local habitat quality loss, maximizing habitat connectivity, and incorporating landscape heterogeneity. As these goals may be contradictory, we investigate the potential trade-offs between them. We used the Zonation prioritization tool to examine how our three goals could be implemented in the agricultural landscapes of southwest Finland. We used measures of (i) biodiversity value of grasslands, (ii) connectivity between grasslands, and (iii) landscape heterogeneity which comprised of (land cover type based) compositional heterogeneity and (field margin based) configurational heterogeneity. Integration of landscape heterogeneity measures and habitat connectivity resulted in some trade-offs with local habitat quality, the most prominent observation being that landscape heterogeneity co-varied with grassland connectivity. Among the two landscape heterogeneity parameters, inclusion of compositional heterogeneity resulted in more clustered prioritization solutions than configurational heterogeneity, which had a spatially more balanced impact. Concordance among landscape scale factors implies high potential for reconstruction of a functioning network of semi-natural grasslands in areas under intensive agricultural use. Broader scale multi-objective planning approaches can thus importantly support targeting biodiversity conservation planning and mediating the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy objectives.

However, biodiversity has multiple dimensions, evolutionary processes have recently been labeled the 'missing component' of conservation strategies, and increasingly more authors are suggesting that the ecological, evolutionary and historical aspects of biodiversity are key components of conservation planning. In this study we develop a prioritization system to design conservation PAs using the wild terrestrial mammals of the Iberian Peninsula as an example. We aim to contribute to the design of more suitable PAs by integrating ecological components of biodiversity (species richness, vulnerability and rarity), evolutionary aspects (accumulated genetic diversification) and historical information relevant to the study area. After selecting a set of biodiversity indicators, we applied a multi-objective technique (extended goal programming) to construct a combined index, where values in the top 90th percentile were then used to select the PAs. According to our most efficient and satisfactory results, some areas highlighted for their conservation are currently categorized as PAs, however, we found that it would be necessary to reconsider their extent, especially in northern Spain, where the historical aspects of biodiversity (the missing component) are more widely present. The need to determine PAs is unquestionable. However, it should also be a priority to move towards a model of sustainable and fair development.

The present study compares forest cover maps and local people's perceptions for evaluating the effectiveness of the Chambok community-based ecotourism (CBET) programme in Cambodia. We assessed forest cover changes from 2000 to 2012 using published global maps and used a covariate matching method to compare forest sites in CBET and non-CBET areas. We also analysed local people's perceptions of forest resource changes by interviewing 174 households. The forest cover maps showed that the Chambok CBET was effective at reducing deforestation, although the outcome was not completely robust to unobserved heterogeneity. Local people's perceptions concurred with the effectiveness observed in the forest cover maps, in that 64% of the people perceived that forest resources increased and 75% thought that the local community could protect its own forest resources. We conclude that the Chambok CBET performed effectively for forest conservation and suggest that mixed-method approaches are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation programmes.

Urbanization Around an Airfield Alters Bird Community Composition, but not the Hazard of Bird-Aircraft Collision	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Bird-aircraft collision; wildlife management; urban ecology; habitat use	IBIS BOSTRYCHIA-HAGEDASH; MANAGING EGYPTIAN GEESE; HADEDA IBIS; AIRPORT; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; STRIKES; ECOLOGY; CAPE	Bird strikes are a considerable hazard to the aviation industry, which has led airports to develop detailed management strategies to identify and reduce the risk of them. These strategies include plans to modify bird habitats in and around airports to limit the establishment of high-risk species. Although airports are generally located on the outskirts of towns and cities, they may be encroached on by urban sprawl. In this study, we examined how an urbanization gradient affects the bird community around an air force base in Cape Town (South Africa) and quantified how this could modify the hazard of bird-aircraft collision. We surveyed the bird community in and around the Air Force Base Ysterplaat across four seasons and categorized species based on their response to increased urbanization (urban avoiders, adapters and exploiters). By combining this with species-specific information on body size, flock size, flight behaviour and abundance, we showed that although urbanization affects bird composition, the overall hazard of bird-aircraft collision is consistent regardless of urban response. However, urbanization complicates mitigation in the matrix surrounding the airport and creates novel challenges for the management of bird hazards. Therefore, new bird hazard management strategies should be integrated within community-driven land-use planning to minimize the negative effects of bird-aircraft collisions.

In southern France, the Rhone channelling led to the construction of dykes to protect the Tricastin industrialized area from floods. Aiming to control plant dynamics for safety reasons and to favour plant biodiversity, mowing or extensive grazing by cattle were recently tested. Monitoring from both permanent plots and aerial photographs shows that three years of extensive grazing and annual mechanical mowing have modified plant composition, significantly increasing plant species richness, evenness and heterogeneity. The increase in evenness and beta-diversity from grazing was significantly higher than from mowing. Only grazing was able to reduce the height and cover of the dominant tussock perennial grass species (Brachypodium phoenicoides), while increasing bare soil cover and thus the contribution of annual species. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained through aerial photographic analyses confirmed the correlation between NDVI, aboveground biomass and plant species richness for the grazed site alone, allowing the results obtained from quadrats to be generalized to the scale of the grazed site. On the Rhone's artificial dykes, extensive grazing appears to be a better management tool than mowing to enhance plant biodiversity and meet safety objectives.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of wood ash application on ECM fungal mycelial production, capacity to retain N, diversity and community composition. In-growth mesh bags were installed in control and treated plots. After 6 months, N-15 labeled ammonium and nitrate were applied into the mesh bags, and 24 h later extra-matrical mycelium (EMM) was extracted and analyzed. Wood ash had no effects on EMM in-growth, N retention capacity, diversity or community composition. In contrast, there were significant seasonal differences in the amount of EMM produced. These results demonstrate that applying up to 6 t ha(-1) of wood ash in this type of plantation forest is a safe management practice that does not increase N leaching or negatively affect ECM fungi.

A basic ecological question is whether interactions are specialized (one to one) or generalized (many to many). Specialization of interactions should ideally be assessed across several populations because species could be specialists at a particular site but generalists when several sites are considered. Mycorrhizal interactions are fundamental for orchid life and distribution, but their level of specialization is still under debate. To understand the extent to which epiphytic orchids are specialists in their mycorrhizal interactions, we studied the richness and phylogenetic structure of mycobionts across different sites, and the similarity in the mycobiont composition between coexisting orchid species. We sequenced the nrDNA ITS2 region and explored the mycobiont communities associated with two epiphytic orchids, Epidendrum marsupiale and Cyrtochilum pardinum, at two elevations within two sites in Ecuador. We found 108 OTUs belonging to Serendipitaceae (66), Ceratobasidiaceae (22), Atractiellales (11) and Tulasnellaceae (9). Orchids at the highest elevations hosted the highest OTU richness. The two orchid species shared a high percentage of mycobionts between all sites. No phylogenetic structure within orchid mycorrhizal communities was found at any sites or elevations. Our results indicate that the studied orchids are generalists and share a broad group of mycobionts (16 OTUs) with no apparent niche segregation within or between sites.

Although the effect of urbanisation on the diversity of terrestrial plants and animals has been well studied, there is a significant gap in our understanding of how urbanisation impacts diversity in protists. Here, we measure the diversity of plasmodial slime moulds (a group of large, macroscopic protists also known as myxomycetes) in inner-city and semi-urban parks. We studied the impact of a range of environmental characteristics (pH, temperature, canopy cover, area of green space and substrate type) on species richness and composition of myxomycetes. We also examined the influence of different degrees of urban development surrounding these parks. Species composition was significantly different between substrate types but not between inner-city and semi-urban parks. Temperature was the only environmental characteristic that affected diversity, having a negative effect on myxomycete presence. Our findings suggest that myxomycete diversity in urban parks is driven by factors at the substrate level, and not by the park's location within the city (inner city or semi-urban).

Our sampling comprised 252 lichen specimens collected in grasslands and forests from different parts of the country, which represented all common Peltigera taxa in the region. The cyanobacteria were grouped according to their tRNA(Leu) (UAA) intron sequences, and mycobiont identities were confirmed using fungal ITS sequences. The studied Peltigera species associated with 34 different "Peltigera-type" Nostoc trnL genotypes. Some Peltigera species associated with one or a few trnL genotypes while others associated with a much wider range of genotypes. Mycobiont identity was the primary factor that determined the presence of the specific Nostoc genotype within the studied Peltigera thalli. However, the species-specific patterns of cyanobiont selectivity did not always reflect phylogenetic relationships among the studied fungal species but correlated instead with habitat preferences. Several taxa from different sections of the genus Peltigera were associated with the same Nostoc genotype or with genotypes in the same habitat, indicating the presence of functional guild structure in the photobiont community. Some Nostoc trnL genotypes were only found in the Peltigera species of moist and mesic forest environments, while another set of Nostoc genotypes was typically found in the Peltigera species of xeric habitats. Some Nostoc trnL genotypes were only found in the Peltigera taxa that are common on alvars and may have specialized to living in this unusual and threatened habitat type.

The effect of aspect on vegetation has been well studied, but virtually nothing is known about how fungal communities are shaped by aspect-driven environmental conditions. I carried out DNA metabarcoding of fungi from soil samples taken in a selected study area of Pannonian forests in northern Hungary to compare richness and community composition of taxonomic and functional groups of fungi between slopes of predominantly southerly vs. northerly aspect. The deep sequence data presented here (i.e. 980 766 quality-filtered sequences) indicate that both niche (environmental filtering) and neutral (stochastic) processes shape fungal community composition at landscape level. Fungal community composition correlated strongly with aspect, with many fungi showing preference for either south-facing or north-facing slopes. Several taxonomic and functional groups showed significant differences in richness between north- and south-facing slopes and strong compositional differences were observed in all functional groups. The effect of aspect on fungal communities likely is mediated through contrasting mesoclimatic conditions, that in turn influence edaphic processes as well as vegetation. The compositional differences observed in fungi are largely consistent with the coenologically described forest types, which indicates the usefulness of these habitat types as a framework to better understand environmental differences that influence fungal community composition at landscape level. Finally, the data presented here provide unprecedented insights into the diversity and landscape-level community dynamics of fungi in the Pannonian forests.

The history of fire disturbances and the season of sampling influenced the composition of myxomycete assemblages. Several species showed substrate preferences different from what is known from fruiting body records. A high abundance of nivicolous species in the majority of the samples suggests that this ecological group constitutes a common element of soil microbial communities in lowland taiga forests. Four species are reported for the Leningrad region for the first time. Our results support the hypothesis that amoebae populations of myxomycetes may have much wider ecological niches than indicated by records of fructifications, and further environmental studies may provide valuable new insights on myxomycete ecology and distribution.

However, since they are restricted to ephemeral habitats, colonizing new patches should benefit from dispersal by animals with similar habitat preferences because the directed, resource-searching movement of animals increases the likelihood of reaching suitable habitats. Here we determine which fungal guilds are carried by wood-inhabiting beetles and what influences beetle-associated fungal communities. High-throughput sequencing identified >1800 fungal taxa from beetle communities that emerged from 64 experimental logs. Beetle-associated fungi included mutualistic, decomposing, pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi; decomposers were the most diverse. Partial-procrustes analysis revealed that the total beetle-associated community and mutualists were correlated (p <= 0.05) with beetle community composition and decomposers were marginally correlated (p <= 0.10) with beetle community composition. All three groups were marginally correlated with the total fungal communities that inhabit the dead wood. Our results show that beetles carry a broad range of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetle-associated fungal communities are determined by environmental factors and the vectoring beetle community and to some degree by the fungal source community. This suggests that wood-inhabiting beetles contribute to fungal dispersal, including directed dispersal, which could affect fungal community assembly and ecosystem processes like wood decomposition.

Three stand ages were selected: 1,11, and 60 y old. Macromycetes were collected from June to October 2016 in 0.1 ha plots per stand age. A total of 106 taxa were recorded, 63 ectomycorrhizal and 43 wood-decay fungi. The highest diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi was in 11-y stands, and 11- and 60-y stands had similar species composition. Wood-decay fungi showed a trend towards higher diversity in the 1- and 11-y stands, and species composition in these sites corresponded. Patterns of diversity and distribution were mainly determined by factors related to substratum availability and vegetation structure. Knowledge about the influence of artificially reforested stands on macrofungal communities is relevant to improve management plans and achieve a more sustainable use of forest timber and non-timber products.

Root endophytic fungi show low levels of interspecific competition in planta	FUNGAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Competition; Endophytes; Fungi; Microbiome; Roots; Symbiosis	DIVERSITY; GROWTH; ASSEMBLAGES	Roots are associated with fungal communities that affect plant growth and health. Individual root-associated fungi have different effects on plant performance, from detrimental to beneficial, but it is barely known how their inter-species interactions determine plant fitness. Here, we evaluate in planta interactions among dominant root-colonizing fungi with different degrees of phylogenetic and trait similarity, and the impact of their co-occurrence on their respective ability to colonize roots and their effects on plant growth. An in vitro bioassay with Arabidopsis thaliana as host plant was used for the co-cultivation with individual or paired combinations of fungal strains. Root colonization by strains was monitored using real-time quantitative PCR, and the effects on their host's growth were estimated by measuring plant biomass. Strains had variable effects on plant growth, although these effects were mostly modest and little affected by the presence of other fungi. Abundance of each fungus in roots responded differently to co-inoculation, but competition between strains was not associated with their similarity in functional traits. Our findings show little competition between dominant fungal root endophytes, which suggests that they occupy complementary root niches and could explain the high fungal diversity colonizing healthy hosts in natural conditions.

However, to date, tropical regions have been poorly sampled for ectomycorrhizal fungi. Here, we investigated ectomycorrhizal fungal community diversity and the role of host plants in shaping this diversity in three main ultramafic rainforests in New Caledonia, an archipelago renowned for its exceptional plant diversity and recognized as a biodiversity hotspot. Sampling of ectomycorrhizal root tips and fruit bodies in Nothofagus aequilateralis-dominated, Arillastrum gummiferum-dominated and mixed rainforests showed high fungal diversity with, in total, 28 lineages and 311 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), of which 95% might be endemic. We also found that host preference and host density influenced ectomycorrhizal community composition and contributed to the high fungal diversity of New Caledonian rainforests. Finally, the/cortinarius lineage dominated the below- and above-ground communities, which suggests that this lineage plays a central role in ultramafic ecosystems functioning.

Pinus sylvestris susceptibility to two congeneric fungal pathogens was compared between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. The ectomycorrhizal fungus was Suillus luteus, while the pathogens were Heterobasidion irregulare and H. annosum. H. irregulare is native to North-America and invasive to Europe, whereas S. luteus and H. annosum are native to Eurasia. Non-mycorrhizal plants were equally susceptible to both pathogens. Mycorrhizal plants were significantly less susceptible to H. annosum than non-mycorrhizal plants, whereas there were no differences when considering H. irregulare. The abundance of ectomycorrhizas was negatively and significantly correlated to the level of host susceptibility only to H. annosum. This study shows that the protective role of ectomycorrhizal fungi may differ when the host is challenged by congeneric fungal pathogens. Results add a further clue to explain and predict the invasiveness of H. irregulare in Europe. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

Recent studies pointed out that invasive populations from Europe harbored reduced bacterial microbiota compared to the native populations. Beside bacteria, mosquitoes also contain fungal communities that have so far been largely ignored. To investigate whether the mosquito invasion process displays a similar impact on fungal diversity, we compared the mycobiota structure of three autochthonous mosquito populations in Vietnam and six populations recently introduced in France and Madagascar. All mosquito populations host a locally structured fungal community and carry a "core mycobiota" dominated by yeasts. However, invasive populations from France and Madagascar harbor a lower fungal diversity compared to Vietnamese populations. These results suggest that similar factors shape the overall composition of the mosquito-associated microbiota during the invasion process as bacterial and fungal communities demonstrate a loss of diversity.

Whether fungi can emit insect pheromones and how volatile chemicals change in response to chemicals the fungi naturally encounter is poorly understood. We analyzed volatiles emitted by Grosmannia clavigera (symbiont of the mountain pine beetle) and Ophiostoma ips (symbiont of the pine engraver beetle) growing in liquid media amended with compounds that the fungi naturally encounter: (-)-alpha-pinene, (+)-alpha-pinene, (-)-trans-verbenol, verbenone, or ipsdienol. Nine volatile compounds were identified among the fungal and amendment treatments. Volatiles qualitatively and quantitatively differed between fungal species and among amendment treatments. The bark beetle anti-aggregation pheromone (-)-verbenone was detected from both fungi growing in (-)-trans-verbenol-amended media. G clavigera and O. ips can emit beetle pheromones and other beetle semiochemicals, suggesting that ophiostomatoid fungi could contribute to the chemical ecology of bark beetles. However, such contributions could be modulated by the presence of other environmental chemicals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

We investigated whether fungal associations occur in the seeds and seedling roots of two epiphytic Aechmea species, and we explored whether substrate and fungal associations contribute to seed germination, and seedling survival and performance after the first month of growth. We found a total of 21 genera and 77 species of endophytic fungi in the seeds and seedlings for both Aechmea species by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The fungal associations in seeds were found in the majority of corresponding seedlings, suggesting that fungi are transmitted vertically. Substrate quality modulated the germination and growth of seedlings, and beneficial endophytic fungi were not particularly crucial for germination but contributed positively to survival and growth. Overall, this study provides the first evidence of an endophytic fungal community in both the seeds and seedlings of two epiphytic bromeliads species that subsequently benefit plant growth.

Host identity and functional traits determine the community composition of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in facultative epiphytic plant species	FUNGAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Facultative epiphytes; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Diversity; SSU rDNA; Semi-arid ecosystems	DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; AMF DIVERSITY; ROOTS; ASSOCIATIONS; FERNS; TERRESTRIAL; ASSEMBLAGES; SPECIFICITY; PREFERENCES; REVEALS	The epiphytic vascular mycobiota is scarce and facultative in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. However, unlike in soil conditions, little is known about the factors driving mycorrhizal communities in epiphytic environments. Here, we investigated the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) harboured by 31 plant species occurring on the trunks of Phoenix dactylifera. We wanted to ascertain if host identity and plant functional traits shape mycorrhizal communities. Specifically, we tested the plant life-cycle (perennial versus annual), the plant life-form (herbaceous versus woody), the plant origin (exotic versus native) and the plant species. The plant affiliation to species strongly influenced the AMF community composition. Plant life-form and plant life-cycle also shaped indicator taxa. The AMF structure differed between annual and perennial species and higher AMF richness was detected in perennial plants. The epiphytic plants associated with AMF irrespective of whether they were native or not, probably because here no functional differences derive from plant origin.

Wood-inhabiting and foliar endophyte communities from multiple tree hosts were sampled at multiple spatial scales across the Fushan forest dynamics plot in northern Taiwan, using culture-free, community DNA amplicon sequencing methods. Fungal endophyte communities were distinct between leaves and wood, but the mycobiomes were highly variable across and within tree species. Despite this, host tree species was an important predictor of mycobiome community-composition. Within a single common tree species, "core" mycobiomes were characterized using co-occurrence analysis. The spatial co-occurrence patterns of these few species of fungal endophytes appear to explain the strong host effect. For wood endophytes, a consistent core mycobiome coexisted with the host across the extent of the study. For leaf endophytes, the core fungi resembled a more dynamic, "gradient" model of the core microbiome, changing across the topography and distance of the study.

The whiff of decay: Linking volatile production and extracellular enzymes to outcomes of fungal interactions at different temperatures	FUNGAL ECOLOGY			English	Article							ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; WOOD-DECAY; INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS; METABOLITES; CLIMATE; DECOMPOSITION; HYDROCARBONS; FEEDBACKS; CULTURES; FOREST	The terrestrial carbon cycle is largely driven by photosynthetic plants and decomposer organisms that process biomass to CO2. In forest ecosystems, the decomposers are predominantly wood decay fungi, and the response of community structure and activity to increasing global temperatures is likely critical to forest biogeochemical processes. Metabolic products can drive community structure and substrate utilisation, and the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as extracellular enzymes, are of particular interest. Pair-wise interactions of a community of basidiomycetes were made under 3 different microclimate conditions that mimic fluctuations in local climate conditions, and the outcome of interactions was assessed in terms of: (1) which fungus won the confrontation or whether it was a draw (deadlock); (2) the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and enzyme activities; and (3) the rate of decomposition. While substrate utilisation and exploitation in terms of decomposition was not affected, community response to changing temperature was underpinned by altered outcomes of interactions and changes to territory occupation, which were reflected by changes in VOC production and extracellular enzyme activity. This study underlines the importance of understanding the impact of community structure on carbon cycling in forest ecosystems under a changing climate. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we explored biogeographic distribution and composition of soil fungal communities associated with 62 tussock grasslands across different regions of Australia. Climatic parameters had only a limited correlation with fungal community structure, while edaphic variables and spatial distance were significantly associated with changes in fungal community composition. We also observed high variations in composition among fungal assemblages from different ecological regions, suggesting some regional endemism in these communities. The discrete distribution of fungi in soil was further confirmed by indicator analysis, which identified distinct indicator operational taxonomic units associated with grasslands from different climatic regions. Finally, fungi with flexible trophic interactions had a central role in the network architecture of both arid and temperate communities. Taken together, the results from our study confirm the prominent role of soil physico-chemical status and geographic location in determining fungal biogeographic patterns over large scales in Australia.

Their effects on host physiology and behaviour as well as their ecology have recently gained wider attention. One aspect that is virtually unknown regarding Laboulbeniales and arthropod-associated fungi in general, is how abiotic factors shape the distribution of these parasites. We used ant- and bat fly-associated Laboulbeniales to study whether climatic elements play a role in the distribution of fungal species. We collected uninfected and Laboulbeniales-infected insects belonging to three species: bat flies Nycteribia schmidlii and Penicillidia conspicua (Diptera: Nycteribiidae) and the ant Myrmica scabrinodis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). We used climatic variables and performed statistical analyses to explain the distribution of Laboulbeniales infection. Our results show a higher likelihood of Laboulbeniales presence in habitats with low annual mean temperature and humidity, suggesting that climatic elements can considerably shape the distribution of Laboulbeniales species.

However, in the absence of specific information, potential risks from Plutonium exposure have always largely been controlled through knowledge of radiation exposure risks in general, much of which comes from external radiation exposures. To try to obtain more direct estimates of potential internal exposure risks, epidemiological studies of Plutonium workers need to be conducted. Such epidemiological analyses require individual Plutonium exposure estimates that are as accurate and unbiased as possible. The UK Sellafield workforce includes one of the world's largest cohorts of Plutonium workers, which constitutes, by some considerable margin, the group of workers most comprehensively monitored for internal exposure to this alpha-particle-emitter. However, for several hundred workers employed at the start of Plutonium work at the facility, during the period from 1952 through to 1963, the historical urinalysis results available cannot provide sufficiently accurate and unbiased exposure assessments needed for use in epidemiological studies. Consequently, these early workers have had to be excluded from epidemiological analyses and this has significantly reduced the power of these studies. A promising quantitative methodology to overcome the issue of missing or deficient exposure data, is to use exposure data from other sources to estimate the average exposure a 'typical worker' would have received, and to collate this information for specific occupations and years. This approach is called a Job-Exposure Matrix (JEM). Work on a pilot study to construct a population-specific quantitative JEM for the early Plutonium workers at Sellafield during 1952-1963, for whom reliable urinalysis results do not exist, has shown the potential for a JEM approach to produce more reliable and useful exposure estimates for epidemiological research.

Such hotspots have traditionally been designated on the basis of species-level metrics (e.g., species richness, endemism and extinction vulnerability). These approaches do not consider phylogenetics explicitly, although phylogenetic relationships reflect the ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical processes by which biodiversity is generated, distributed and maintained. The aim of this study was to identify hotspots of phylogenetic diversity and compare these with hotspots based on species-level metrics and with the existing protected areas network. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds and amphibians) and angiosperms. Methods We used comprehensive phylogenies and distribution maps of terrestrial birds, mammals, amphibians and angiosperms to identify areas with high concentrations of phylogenetic diversity, phylogenetic endemism, and evolutionary distinctiveness and global endangerment. We compared the locations of these areas with those included within the current network of protected areas and concentrations of species-level indices: species richness, species endemism and species threat. Results We found spatial incongruence among the three evolutionary diversity metrics in each taxonomic group. Spatial patterns of diversity and endemism also differed among taxonomic groups, with some differences between vertebrates and angiosperms. Complementarity analyses of phylogenetic diversity identified the minimal area that encapsulates the full branch lengths for each taxonomic group. The current network of protected areas and species-level hotspots largely does not overlap with areas of high phylodiversity. Main conclusion Overall, < 10% of hotspot areas were designated as protected areas. Patterns of diversity, endemism and vulnerability differ among taxonomic groups.

Location Sub-Saharan Africa and continental China. Time period Early 21st century. Taxa studied Terrestrial mammals. Methods We conducted spatial and thematic scaling analyses to generate land cover datasets of different spatial (0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 9.0 km) and thematic (two, three and five classes) resolutions. We calculated landscape metrics based on the resulting land cover maps and examined the power of landscape metrics for explaining species richness patterns, using non-spatial (OLS) and spatial (SAR) linear models and random forest (RF) models. We systematically assessed the resolution dependence of explanatory power for different geographical regions, different scaling approaches and different model types. We also compared the explanatory power of landscape attributes with that of macroclimate. Results Collectively, local landscape attributes generally had strong explanatory power for species richness. For the African system, the largest explanatory power was c. 60% based on the OLS models and random forest models and c. 30% based on the non-spatial components of the SAR models. For the Chinese system, the largest explanatory power was c. 35% based on the OLS models and c. 40% based on the SAR and random forest models. We observed a linear scaling relationship, which is robust to studied systems, scaling approaches and model types. In contrast, the scaling relationship varies substantially among single landscape metrics. At coarse resolutions, the addition of landscape attributes collectively would not improve climate-envelope models significantly, whereas at finer resolutions, landscape attributes collectively have explanatory power that is close to or even exceeds climate. Main conclusions Local landscape attributes play an important role in shaping macroscopic biodiversity patterns. However, their strength is highly sensitive to both spatial and thematic resolutions of land cover data, with stronger explanatory power detected at finer resolutions. Strong sensitivity to spatial and thematic resolutions makes landscape attributes highly plastic determinants, leading to contrasting conclusions if based on greatly different resolutions of land cover data. Scaling analyses are needed to examine such cross-scale effects of macroecological determinants systematically.

In contrast to endotherms, the extent to which biophysical properties of ectotherms scale up into interspecific size gradients at macroecological scales remains elusive. Our aim here is to investigate what latitudinal body size gradients are expected to emerge from first biophysical principles regarding heat and water balances in terrestrial vertebrate ectotherms. Location Nearctic and Western Palaearctic. Time period Theoretical model under current climatic conditions. Major taxa studied Terrestrial vertebrate ectotherms. Methods We developed a biophysical model to derive heat balances and rates of water loss of lizard-like reptiles and anuran-like amphibians from microclimatic variables. We projected geographically model predictions for different size classes to explore how body temperature (T-b) and cutaneous evaporative water loss (EWL) are influenced by body size at macroscales. Results Large-bodied ectotherms (over 100 g) attain a slightly higher T-b and conserve it for longer than small animals (5 g), owing to the lower convective heat dissipation and their greater thermal inertia. While large animals are more at risk of overheating in warm regions, all organisms, irrespective of body size, are constrained by low temperatures experienced at boreal latitudes. Furthermore, because of the nonlinear decrease in EWL with increasing size, larger size allows reduction of water loss of small wet-skinned ectotherms in more evaporative environments. Main conclusions Size differences in heat balance offer a mechanistic explanation for the pattern of increasing body size northwards, as well as for the associated decrease in species richness. Water conservation is also identified as a potential mechanism for larger body sizes in dryer areas in wet-skinned ectotherms such as amphibians. Moreover, our model reveals nonlinear relationships involving size and optimum states of thermal and hydric functions, accounting for complexities that are unnoticeable by traditional, correlative investigations.

Niche conservatism drives a global discrepancy in palm species richness between seasonally dry and moist habitats	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Arecaceae; diversification models; macroevolution; phylogenetic beta diversity; phylogenetic signal; seasonally dry forest; tropical rainforest; tropical savanna	R PACKAGE; PLANT PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; DIVERSIFICATION; PATTERNS; DROUGHT; ORIGIN; FOREST	Aim Rapid global environmental change predicts increasingly seasonal climate in the tropics, causing expansion of seasonally dry habitats and leading to shifts in species distribution and potential extinction. Here, we use a macroevolutionary framework to understand the processes driving palm diversity patterns between moist and seasonally dry tropical habitats. We hypothesize that the discrepancy in species richness between habitats is explained by higher speciation rates in moist habitat and that niche conservatism prevents frequent shifts between habitats. Location Global. Time period Last 100 Ma. Major taxa studied Arecaceae. Methods We used trait-dependent diversification models to test whether different habitats affect palm speciation rates. Furthermore, palm assemblages were divided into three regions (Africa, Australasia and Neotropics) to test for niche conservatism and evaluate phylogenetic dissimilarity. Results We found no relationship between speciation rate and habitat type. We detected phylogenetic signal for habitats at both global and continental scales, indicating that closely related species were more similar than expected by chance. Colonization of seasonally dry habitats occurred c. 60 Ma, yet most clades only diversified after c. 30 Ma. The high phylogenetic dissimilarity between habitat types at both global and continental scales was driven by high lineage turnover, at least for Africa and the Neotropics. Main conclusions We found a lack of differential speciation rates in setting the seasonally dry and moist palm-richness discrepancy. However, over evolutionary history most palm lineages fail to colonize seasonally dry habitats owing to a tendency to retain ancestral habitat. Indeed, seasonally dry palm assemblages are the result of the diversification of particular lineages. Likewise, long-term dry periods appear to induce shifts in taxonomic and functional diversity, and we emphasize that the expansion of dry habitats might also imply a loss of palm clades, hence a reduction in phylogenetic diversity.

Here, using both single and multiple trait-based approaches, we analysed dispersion patterns for alpha (i.e., related to niche partitioning) and beta (i.e., related to environmental tolerance) traits in freshwater fish assemblages and characterized how trait dispersion patterns vary along environmental gradients at large spatial scale. Location Western Palaearctic, 290 river catchments. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Freshwater fish. Methods Based on freshwater fish occurrence records in 290 European river catchments, we computed dispersion indices (mean pairwise distance) using standardized effect sizes for each single trait and multiple traits. We then used linear models including climatic, geo-morphological, biotic and human-related factors to determine the key drivers shaping freshwater fish dispersion patterns across Europe. Results We highlighted spatial variation in trait dispersion, with both underdispersion and overdispersion simultaneously observed for a given trait, but also distinct patterns of trait dispersion, even within beta and alpha traits. We provided evidence that elevation range and current and past climatic conditions mainly structured trait dispersion patterns. Finally, our results revealed that spatial patterns in trait dispersion based on multiple traits were less pronounced than those based on individual traits. Main conclusions Our results highlighted that traits showed different spatial and environmental patterns, reflecting different ecological patterns. This could lead to potential problems when using functional indices computed on multiple traits and challenges their relevance to describe diversity patterns and to infer the assembly processes shaping community structure.

Global raptor research and conservation priorities: Tropical raptors fall prey to knowledge gaps	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						avian biology; biogeography; conservation biology; conservation prioritization; ecology; extinction; ornithology; predator	EXTINCTION RISK; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; BIODIVERSITY; FOREST; DECLINE; CLASSIFICATION; RATIONALE; PREDATORS; BEHAVIOR; IMPACTS	Aim Raptors serve critical ecological functions, are particularly extinction-prone and are often used as environmental indicators and flagship species. Yet, there is no global framework to prioritize research and conservation actions on them. We identify for the first time the factors driving extinction risk and scientific attention on raptors and develop a novel research and conservation priority index (RCPI) to identify global research and conservation priorities. Location Global. Methods We use random forest models based on ecological traits and extrinsic data to identify the drivers of risk and scientific attention in all raptors. We then map global research and conservation priorities. Lastly, we model where priorities fall relative to country-level human social indicators. Results Raptors with small geographic ranges, scavengers, forest-dependent species and those with slow life histories are particularly extinction-prone. Research is extremely biased towards a small fraction of raptor species: 10 species (1.8% of all raptors) account for one-third of all research, while one-fifth of species have no publications. Species with small geographic ranges and those inhabiting less developed countries are greatly understudied. Regions of Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia are identified as particularly high priority for raptor research and conservation. These priorities are highly concentrated in developing countries, indicating a global mismatch between priorities and capacity for research and conservation. Main conclusions A redistribution of scientific attention and conservation efforts towards developing tropical countries and the least-studied, extinction-prone species is critical to conserve raptors and their ecological functions worldwide. We identify clear taxonomic and geographic research and conservation priorities for all raptors, and our methodology can be applied across other taxa to prioritize scientific investment.

Spatiotemporal distribution dynamics of elephants in response to density, rainfall, rivers and fire in Kruger National Park, South Africa	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						African elephant; distribution and abundance; dynamics; Kruger National Park; protected area; space-use intensity; spatiotemporal; spatstat	SEXUAL SEGREGATION; SURFACE-WATER; HETEROGENEITY; NDVI; VEGETATION; MANAGEMENT; VERTEBRATES; DISTURBANCE; PATTERNS	Aim African elephants are ecosystem engineers. As such, their long-term patterns of distribution and abundance (i.e., space-use intensity) will influence ecosystem structure and function. We elucidate these patterns for bull versus herd groups, by analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of an increasing elephant population in relation to key ecological drivers: rainfall, distance to major rivers and time since last fire. Significant changes to the long-term patterns of elephant density and group-type probabilities are identified and explained. Location Kruger National Park, South Africa. Methods Using almost three decades of census records (1985-2012), we applied Multiple Point Process Models to assess the influence of rainfall, rivers and fire in shaping elephant space-use. Significant changes to the long-term patterns of elephant density and group type were also identified using kernel density estimates and the spatially varying probability of encountering either bull or herd group. Results Bull and herd groups are no longer clearly segregated as available empty space becomes more limited. Bull and herd groups have dichotomous resource selection functions, in that bulls concentrate in areas receiving lower rainfall but more frequent fires while herds concentrate in higher rainfall areas experiencing less frequent fires. Both bull and herd groups concentrate closer to major rivers, emphasizing rivers as important spatial drivers. Overall, densities increased most significantly closer to rivers and in areas experiencing fewer fires. Fire was also a strong agent of group-type change, as the probability of finding bulls, contrary to herds, significantly increased as fire return periods shortened. Main conclusions Elephant distribution and abundance patterns have homogenized in response to increased space limitations, with group-specific, fire-driven distribution patterns emerging overtime. Results herein should be used to help manage elephant space-use through the establishment of possible refuge areas and the development of more empirical research into elephant impacts in future.

The rise of an apex predator following deglaciation	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						apex keystone predator; colonization dynamics; dynamic spatio-temporal model; ecological diffusion; glacier retreat; rewilding; sea otters	BAY NATIONAL-PARK; SEA OTTERS; GLACIER BAY; MESOPREDATOR RELEASE; PRIMARY SUCCESSION; MODEL; ALASKA; SPREAD; REINTRODUCTION; CONSERVATION	Aim Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are an apex predator of the nearshore marine community and nearly went extinct at the turn of the 20th century. Reintroductions and legal protection allowed sea otters to re-colonize much of their former range. Our objective was to chronicle the colonization of this apex predator in Glacier Bay, Alaska, to help understand the mechanisms that governed their successful colonization. Location Glacier Bay is a tidewater glacier fjord in southeastern Alaska that was entirely covered by glaciers in the mid-18th century. Since then, it has endured the fastest tidewater glacier retreat in recorded history. Methods We collected and analysed several data sets, spanning 20 years, to document the spatio-temporal dynamics of an apex predator expanding into an area where they were formerly absent. We used novel quantitative tools to model the occupancy, abundance and colonization dynamics of sea otters, while accounting for uncertainty in the data collection process, the ecological process and model parameters. Results Twenty years after sea otters were first observed colonizing Glacier Bay, they became one of the most abundant and widely distributed marine mammal. The population grew exponentially at a rate of 20% per year. They colonized Glacier Bay at a maximum rate of 6 km per year, with faster colonization rates occurring early in the colonization process. During colonization, sea otters selected shallow areas, close to shore, with a steep bottom slope, and a relatively simple shoreline complexity index. Main conclusions The growth and expansion of sea otters in Glacier Bay demonstrate how legal protection and translocation of apex predators can facilitate their successful establishment into a community in which they were formerly absent. The success of sea otters was, in part, a consequence of habitat that was left largely unperturbed by humans for the past 250 years. Further, sea otters and other marine predators, whose distribution is limited by ice, have the potential to expand in distribution and abundance, reshaping future marine communities in the wake of deglaciation and global loss of sea ice.

Forest edges are subject to strong abiotic gradients altering the forest environment and resulting in strong biotic gradients. This has the potential to change the forest's capacity to provide multiple ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and natural pest control. Soil organisms play a key role in this perspective; however, these taxa are rarely considered in forest edge research. Location A latitudinal gradient of 2,000 km across Western Europe. Methods We sampled six dominant taxa of litter-dwelling macro-arthropods (carabid beetles, spiders, harvestmen, centipedes, millipedes and woodlice) in forest edges and interiors of 192 forest fragments in 12 agricultural landscapes. We related their abundance and community composition to distance from the edge and the interaction with forest age, edge orientation and edge contrast (contrast between land use types at either side of the edge). Results Three out of six macro-arthropod taxa have higher activity-density in forest edges compared to forest interiors. The abundance patterns along forest edge-to-interior gradients interacted with forest age. Forest age and edge orientation also influenced within-fragment compositional variation along the forest edge-to-interior gradient. Edge contrast influenced abundance gradients of generalist predators. In general, older forest fragments, south-oriented edges and edges along structurally more continuous land use (lower contrast between forest and adjacent land use) resulted in stronger edge-to-interior gradients while recent forests, north-oriented edges and sharp land use edges induced similarity between forest edge and interior along the forest edge-to-interior gradients in terms of species activity-density and composition. Main conclusions Edge effects on litter-dwelling macro-arthropods are anticipated to feedback on important ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and natural pest control from small forest fragments.

Invasion processes have been extensively studied, but studies on species richness and beta diversity patterns of exotic and native species are rare. We investigate such patterns among exotic and native fish communities in upland and lowland rivers to explore their relationship with environmental drivers. Location Northern Italy. Methods Exotic and native fish beta diversity patterns were investigated separately in lowland and upland sites using Local Contribution to Beta Diversity (LCBD) and Species Contribution to Beta Diversity (SCBD) analyses. To examine the main environmental variables affecting the LCBD, a Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) method was used. Community dispersion among and within stream orders was investigated with the PERMDISP test. Results In lowland sites, exotic species richness was higher than native species richness, especially in large rivers and drainage canals. An opposite trend was found in upland sites, where native species richness was higher than exotic species richness, especially in large rivers. No clear LCBD patterns were found along stream orders in the lowland, whereas higher stream orders in the upland showed the highest LCBD. Its patterns in upland and lowland sites were related to a number of factors, such as total suspended solids and total phosphorus. Community dispersion among stream orders did not show a relationship with environmental heterogeneity. SCBD values were positively correlated with species occupancy in the study area, and native species showed higher SCBD values than exotic species only in the uplands. Main conclusions Large rivers in the uplands are important in maintaining native fish diversity and should be protected against invasive fish. In contrast, most lowland rivers have suffered from biological homogenization. Some rare native species can show low contribution to beta diversity, but still need conservation actions due to their risk of local extinction.

Behavior is the first way in which organisms respond to novel conditions. We investigated differences in habitat use, movement, and social behavior of invasive adult male Cuban brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) in natural and urban areas in Miami, FL. We observed that urban lizards used broader perches and frequented more artificial human-made substrates (e.g. walls) than lizards in a natural forest habitat. Extensive behavioral observations (ca. 1200min) revealed that urban A. sagrei also performed more dewlap displays, changed perches less, and jumped less. Our analysis of the structural environment revealed that urban areas are more open - in other words, have higher visibility at typical lizard perch heights, and have fewer and broader perches than natural areas. An increase in openness may explain why we observed a greater than two-fold increase in the frequency of dewlap displaying - the primary mechanism of visual communication in anoles. Similarly, less perch changes and fewer jumps - a form of locomotion frequently used in perch-perch movement when perches are close - is likely driven by a three-fold decrease in tree density. Understanding how behavior and ecology differ in urban vs. natural ecosystems provides insight into how species persist in urban landscapes, and how such behavioral shifts might facilitate biological invasions.

However, information on the soft bottom macrobenthos within and around these boating facilities in the tropics is limited. Here, we investigated if macrobenthic communities differed among three representative tropical marinas, and whether the communities inhabiting the marinas differed from those outside the marinas. Ekman grab sampling of the soft bottom sediment at three Singapore marinas - Raffles Marina (RM), ONE(o)15 Marina (OMC), Marina at Keppel Bay (MKB) - yielded a total of 73 taxa from eight phyla. Accounting for temporal variations, taxonomic richness did not differ among marinas, while Shannon index (MKB>RM=OMC) and abundance (RM>OMC>MKB) did. Macrobenthic community composition differed among the marinas, with RM dominated by a high proportion of opportunistic species and OMC supporting species that were sensitive to pollution. The surveys also revealed that communities within and outside marinas differed. Unlike RM which is more enclosed, diversity was higher within MKB than outside it, likely because the latter marina had a layout that encouraged flushing which maintained good water quality. The study showed that while Singapore's tropical marinas can support diverse groups of macrobenthic taxa, the presence of high proportions of opportunistic species suggested that pollution within the marinas was still significant. Macrofaunal diversity in tropical marinas, such as those in Singapore, may be promoted by designs that improve water exchange.

The influence of land cover and within-pool characteristics on larval, froglet, and adult wood frogs along a rural to suburban gradient	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Vernal pool; Suburbanization; Latent effects; Locomotor performance; Morphology; Conspecific competition	RANA-SYLVATICA; CANOPY COVER; LITHOBATES-SYLVATICUS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; FOREST CANOPY; FOOD LEVEL; ROAD SALT; SIZE; POPULATION; POND	Urbanization is known to extirpate many species, but far less is known about how suburbanization may affect amphibianpopulations. We studied wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) to test the effects of site characteristics (within-pool conditions and land cover indicative of suburbanization within 1000m) and larval morphology on newly emerged froglets and post-breeding males across a suburbanization gradient in 15 pools in greater Bangor, Maine, USA. We raised field-captured larvae in microcosms and examined froglet morphology and locomotor performance at emergence and one month post-emergence. Larval mass was positively correlated with 50% of froglet responses (survival, size, and locomotor performance) but was negatively associated with adult size. Among site characteristics, egg density had the most salient influence with negative effects on larval survival and morphology as well as on 11 of 14 froglet responses. Vegetation, hydrology, and suburban-associated cover near pools also influenced froglet performance, and hydrology and suburban-associated cover was associated with larger and smaller adult morphology. However the influence of suburban-associated cover on froglet performance and adult morphology was small compared to that of within-pool characteristics. Specifically, our findings support the idea that within-pool conditions experienced by larvae can influence terrestrial stages with potentially life-long consequences. Nevertheless, in suburban landscapes where there is evidence of population declines, it is likely that suburbanization has the greatest impact on populations via direct effects on terrestrial stages. We encourage planners to maintain high-quality habitat for aquatic and terrestrial stage wood frogs in suburbanizing landscapes to avoid extirpation.

Traditional density estimators may be inappropriate in urban areas because of extensive areas of impermeable development but new techniques that include spatial structure could be useful within large urban metropolitan areas. Yet to date, these techniques have largely remained untested. We evaluated whether spatially explicit capture-recapture models (SECR) could provide a reliable density estimate of bobcats (Lynx rufus) in the Dallas Fort-Worth metroplex, Texas, USA. We obtained 1003 photographs of bobcats in an urbanized landscape from June-November 2014, using 41 double camera stations spaced approximately 1.05km apart. We individually identified bobcats from their distinct pelage patterns and used SECR to predict density throughout the study area. The overall density was at least one bobcat per km(2), which calculated to approximately 43 independent-aged bobcats across the entire camera grid, an estimate higher than documented bobcat densities in both rural and peri-urban studies in Texas. Our study revealed a high density of bobcats in an urban landscape despite most assumptions that bobcats require large areas of habitat and are sensitive to fragmentation.

In many urbanized centers, critical habitats of at-risk species have often become degraded and/or fragmented because of human activities. Such is the case for the population of common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in Cootes Paradise Marsh, a highly urbanized ecosystem located at the western tip of Lake Ontario. In addition to these threats, mortality from collisions with cars on a four-lane highway at the western end of the marsh has greatly reduced wildlife populations. Here, we examine long-term changes in critical habitat distribution that has accompanied urbanization of Cootes Paradise Marsh from 1934 to 2010. We delineated potential nesting habitat for snapping turtles in 7 digitized aerial photos, using literature information and 2017 nesting surveys as guides. Between 1934 and 2010, total area of potential nesting habitat decreased by almost 50%. Nesting surveys confirmed that snapping turtles were disproportionately using created nesting mounds and this suggests that availability of natural nesting habitat is limited. We also radio tracked 11 snapping turtles to identify use of overwintering habitat. Temperature loggers monitored in-situ water temperatures at each turtle's location and other unconfirmed habitats. The snapping turtle population overwintered in a wide range of upland terrestrial habitats and we found consistent characteristics regarding water temperature across both confirmed and unconfirmed sites, therefore suggesting overwintering habitat may not be limiting within the marsh.

Urban gardening is a common practice in many industrialised and developing countries. The ability of urban vegetable gardens to support biodiversity, however, has yet to be studied in depth. To investigate the responses of flora and soil fauna to urbanization, we surveyed the taxonomic and functional composition of plant and collembolan communities, in addition to soil parameters, in 15 urban vegetable gardens across three large French cities. The vegetation was identified in six plots of 1x1 m in each urban vegetable garden and collembolan were extracted from one intact soil core sampled in the center of each plot (5cm depth, 6cm diameter). We found contrasting effects of urbanization on plants and Collembola biodiversity. The taxonomic and functional composition of the soil fauna was more similar within cities than among cities, which was driven by similarities in soil parameters. In contrast, plant communities were functionally similar among cities. Understanding the effects of urbanization on soil biodiversity could have implications for the management of urban ecosystems, in particular that of urban soils.

Three diets were used to rear the insects (d1) 10 green bean pods of Phaseolus vulgaris (L.) plus a mixture of soybean [Glycine max (L.)] and sunflower [Helianthus annus (L.)] dry seeds and shelled raw peanuts [Arachis hypogaea (L.)]; (d2) diet 1 plus a bouquet of the native wild plants, Boldea fragans (Pers.), Bidens pilosa (L.), and Macroptilium atropurpureum (DC.) Urban; and (d3) a bouquet of the native plants. There was no significant difference in the nymphs' development time when feeding on d1 or d2; however, the survival of the insects was significantly higher when fed on d2. Nymphs did not survive when fed d3. Female fecundity was higher when insects were fed d2 at both nymph and adult stages than when insects fed on other diet combinations. Survivorship and fecundity were negatively affected when adults were reared on d3, independently of the nymph diet. In terms of nutritional requirements for egg production, nymphs' survival and development, d3 was shown to be the worst food, despite keeping adults alive. We concluded that the native plants evaluated here are associated plants for C. impicticornis. These associated plants in combination with host plants (d1) provide positive effects on some biological parameters relevant to the population dynamics of this stink bug.

Effects of cultivar and leaf traits on the abundance of Pacific spider mites in almond orchards	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Water stress; Population dynamics; Tetranychus pacificus; Nitrogen; Carbon	REGULATED DEFICIT IRRIGATION; WATER-DEFICIT; HULL ROT; TETRANYCHIDAE; ACARI; STRESS; PARAMETERS; NITROGEN; FERTILIZATION; RESISTANCE	A greater understanding of the ecological relationships between Pacific spider mite, Tetranychus pacificus, and its almond host is needed for better management recommendations and reduced need for pesticides. Since populations of T. pacificus are thought to increase with deficit irrigation and fertilization, they may also differ between almond cultivars varying in leaf traits relating to water use and leaf nitrogen (N) content. In the current study, the relationships between T. pacificus populations, almond cultivars and leaf traits were examined at studies in two locations. In the first study, a large-scale cultivar trial with a high level of T. pacificus infestation, spider mite eggs were more common on the cultivar 'Sweetheart' than either 'Nonpareil' or 'Marcona,' and across all cultivars, mites and leaf damage increased with stomatal density, but decreased with stomatal length. Almond cultivars differed in traits, with 'Sweetheart' having the highest leaf N and 'Marcona' the lowest stomatal density. In the second study, a germplasm repository orchard collection with low levels of T. pacificus infestation, spider mites were not detected on the cultivar 'Mission' but were similarly highest on 'Sweetheart.' Mites increased with N across all cultivars, and leaf damage due to spider mites increased with more negative delta C-13, indicating low water use efficiency. Results suggest that monitoring of spider mite populations should include conditions of high nutrient and water availability, especially for susceptible cultivars, and that spider mite populations are not consistently higher with leaf traits indicating water stress.

However, the structure and phenology of such communities are still largely unknown. In order to fill these gaps, we sampled plant galls along the Portuguese coast aiming to (1) characterize the diversity of gall-associated communities (plants, gallers, their parasitoids, and inquilines); (2) evaluate how richness and abundance of gallers are shaped by plant life-form; and (3) explore the phenology (i.e. emergence time) of the different guilds. For 1 year, we collected 31,737 galls from 33 plant species, revealing remarkably diverse communities centred on 49 gallers, 65 parasitoids and 88 inquiline species. The plant families with more galls were Fabaceae, Fagaceae and Cistaceae, while most gallers were Cynipidae and Cecidomyiidae. Regarding parasitoids, Torymidae and Eulophidae were the richest families, and most inquilines belonged to the families Cecidomyiidae, Thripidae, Aphidiidae and Psocoptera. Shrubs hosted a significantly greater abundance and richness of gallers. Overall community composition was highly variable in time, frequently with turnover rates greater than 50% between consecutive months. An asynchrony between life cycles of each guild could be explained by the sequential availability of resources for gallers and parasitoids and by the relaxed physiological constraints between galls and inquilines. This baseline information is vital for revealing a hidden component of biodiversity and shedding light on its community structure and resilience.

In this study, we experimentally evaluated the role of the caterpillars Pandemis sp. as habitat modifiers in the tropical liana Trigonia rotundifolia. Specifically, we examined their effects on the abundance and richness of arthropods that secondarily colonize leaf-rolls (shelters) built by the caterpillars, as well as indirect effects that influence plant herbivory. Two experiments were conducted in the field to evaluate the role of natural and artificial rolls on community structure and plant damage. Plants with artificial leaf-rolls hosted 2.2 times more arthropods than plants without shelters and they had 1.5 times higher richness compared to control plants. Plants with natural shelters exhibited significantly lower arthropod richness than plants with artificial shelters or control plants, but arthropod abundance did not differ among treatments. Although plants with leaf-rolls hosted significantly more arthropods, arthropod species composition did not differ amongst treatments, as Formicidae was the most frequent group in all treatments. Herbivory was almost 3 times higher in plants with leaf-rolls compared to plants with no rolled leaves, indicating that the effect of increased arthropod abundance, and especially herbivore abundance, might influence leaf damage in plants with leaf-rolls. We demonstrate the strong impact of Pandemis as a habitat modifier on community structure as well as on community processes through indirect effects.

ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Bumblebees; Amino acids; Protein; Nutrition; Pollen mixing; Sunflower (Helianthus annuus)	GENERALIST SOLITARY BEES; AMINO-ACID-ANALYSIS; APIS-MELLIFERA; HONEY-BEES; WORKER REPRODUCTION; OVARIAN DEVELOPMENT; COLONY DEVELOPMENT; NUTRITIVE-VALUE; NONHOST POLLEN; L HYMENOPTERA	The high pollen and nectar yield of Asteraceae flowers combined with the abundance and diversity of these plants should make them an important pollen source for both specialist and generalist bees. However, studies have found Asteraceae pollen to be a poor diet for some generalist bees, possibly owing to nutrient deficiencies or the presence of secondary metabolites or digestive barriers that prevent nutrient assimilation. Mixing pollens could allow bees to exploit these unfavourable pollens, if the different pollen sources help to complement nutrient deficiencies or alleviate the effects of toxic secondary metabolites. In our study, we examined how the proportion of sunflower (Helianthus annuus, Asteraceae) pollen in the diet of captive-reared bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) affects the survival of bees in queenless microcolonies. Bees fed on sunflower pollen had significantly shorter lifespans than bees fed on broad bean (Vicia faba, Fabaceae), rapeseed (Brassica napus, Brassicaceae) or Cucurbitaceae pollen. However, survival on mixed pollen diets containing 50% sunflower pollen was as great as that on non-sunflower diets, which suggests that the other pollens were able to compensate for the low nutritive quality of the sunflower pollen. Due to agricultural intensification and a loss of wildflowers, farmland monocultures (e.g. sunflower crops) can be important floral resources for bumblebees. Our study suggests that providing alternative floral resources of high nutritive quality could help mitigate the potential harmful effects of a monofloral sunflower diet on bumblebees.	[McAulay, M.

Interactions in self-assembled microbial communities saturate with diversity	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							SPECIES INTERACTIONS; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; DETERMINES; EVOLUTION; BACTERIA; DATABASE; GROWTH; TOOLS	How the diversity of organisms competing for or sharing resources influences community function is an important question in ecology but has rarely been explored in natural microbial communities. These generally contain large numbers of species making it difficult to disentangle how the effects of different interactions scale with diversity. Here, we show that changing diversity affects measures of community function in relatively simple communities but that increasing richness beyond a threshold has little detectable effect. We generated self-assembled communities with a wide range of diversity by growth of cells from serially diluted seawater on brown algal leachate. We subsequently isolated the most abundant taxa from these communities via dilution-to-extinction in order to compare productivity functions of the entire community to those of individual taxa. To parse the effect of different types of organismal interactions, we defined relative total function (RTF) as an index for positive or negative effects of diversity on community function. Our analysis identified three overall regimes with increasing diversity. At low richness (<12 taxa), positive and negative effects of interactions were both weak, while at moderate richness (12-26 taxa), community resource uptake increased but the carbon use efficiency decreased. Finally, beyond 26 taxa, the effect of interactions on community function saturated and further diversity increases did not affect community function. Although more diverse communities had overall greater access to resources, on average individual taxa within these communities had lower resource availability and reduced carbon use efficiency. Our results thus suggest competition and complementation simultaneously increase with diversity but both saturate at a threshold.

Impacts of microbial assemblage and environmental conditions on the distribution of anatoxin-a producing cyanobacteria within a river network	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							FRESH-WATER CYANOBACTERIA; POLYPHASIC APPROACH; BETA-DIVERSITY; HOMOANATOXIN-A; PHORMIDIUM; MICROCYSTIS; GENOME; MATS; BIOSYNTHESIS; COMMUNITIES	Blooms of planktonic cyanobacteria have long been of concern in lakes, but more recently, harmful impacts of riverine benthic cyanobacterial mats been recognized. As yet, we know little about how various benthic cyanobacteria are distributed in river networks, or how environmental conditions or other associated microbes in their consortia affect their biosynthetic capacities. We performed metagenomic sequencing for 22 Oscillatoriales-dominated (Cyanobacteria) microbial mats collected across the Eel River network in Northern California and investigated factors associated with anatoxin-a producing cyanobacteria. All microbial communities were dominated by one or two cyanobacterial species, so the key mat metabolisms involve oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon oxidation. Only a few metabolisms fueled the growth of the mat communities, with little evidence for anaerobic metabolic pathways. We genomically defined four cyanobacterial species, all which shared <96% average nucleotide identity with reference Oscillatoriales genomes and are potentially novel species in the genus Microcoleus. One of the Microcoleus species contained the anatoxin-a biosynthesis genes, and we describe the first anatoxin-a gene cluster from the Microcoleus clade within Oscillatoriales. Occurrence of these four Microcoleus species in the watershed was correlated with total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, and the species that contains the anatoxin-a gene cluster was found in sites with higher nitrogen concentrations. Microbial assemblages in mat samples with the anatoxin-a gene cluster consistently had a lower abundance of Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria) species than did mats without the anatoxin-producing genes. The associations of water nutrient concentrations and certain co-occurring microbes with anatoxin-a producing Microcoleus motivate further exploration for their roles as potential controls on the distributions of toxigenic benthic cyanobacteria in river networks.

Regional flood frequency analysis using L-moments for geographically defined regions: An assessment in Brazil	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						extreme events; extreme value statistics; flood mitigation; statistical methods	PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS; INDEX; BASIN	The devastating effects of floods, combined with scarce data sets, have stimulated the development of hydrological regionalisation techniques. The present study proposed an evaluation of the L-moments based index-flood procedure, coupled with watershed grouping based on geographical convenience for regionalisation of maximum streamflows. A pioneer analysis for South America, addressing the geographical classification method adopted by National Water Agency of Brazil (ANA), was conducted considering over 100 watersheds in southern Brazil. Nonstationary and discordant maximum annual streamflow (MAS) series were removed with the aid of the Mann-Kendall test and discordancy measure, whereas the heterogeneity measure was used to check regional homogeneity. The best regional distribution was identified by the Z(DIST) goodness-of-fit measure. Finally, multiple nonlinear regressions, considering morphological and meteorological watershed characteristics, were performed to obtain better index-flood estimates. It was concluded that: (a) the proposed methodological strategy provided satisfactory estimation of design floods; (b) area, mean slope, stream gradient, and flow length, were the most satisfactory explanatory variables; (c) the fitted equations stand out as a state-of-art alternative for the scarce hydrological monitoring in southern Brazil; and (d) the hydrological boundaries defined by ANA might not be the most adequate approach from a regional point of view.

In the present study, we explored whether the co-occurrence of different grassland communities has any effect on the stability of the network of pollination interactions. We monitored pollination interactions in two co-occurring grassland communities, differing in disturbance history and water and nutrient supply. The monitoring was carried out during the summer season (7 surveys). For each survey we compared the role in the pollination networks (i.e., keystone vs. peripheral species) of habitat-specialist and habitat-generalist plant and pollinator species. We found that plant and pollinator species of the two different grassland communities were highly interconnected, revealing that pollination interactions occur at a level of organization above that of the single community. The co-occurrence of the two grassland communities increased the type, number and frequency of contacts, thereby contributing to networks stability. The role of habitat-specialist and habitat-generalist plant and pollinator species in pollination networks was asymmetric, with habitat-specialist plants and habitat-generalist pollinators being keystone species, while habitat-generalist plants and habitat-specialist pollinators being peripheral in the pollination networks. Our results showed that the stability of the network does stem from the co-occurrence of different species pools having different but complementary roles in the pollination networks. From a conservation perspective, the maintenance of different grassland communities is important not only because they allow the conservation of habitat-specialist species, but specifically because plant species specialized in either grassland community are also keystone for the maintenance of the stability of the pollination networks.

Phenological studies for the Brazilian savannah plants are geographically restricted and long-term variation is still unclear. Thus the use of herbarium data can provide long-term phenological evaluation and it is important to understand the phenology-climate dynamics on broader scales. We used climatic data and 252 herbarium specimens collected between 1961 and 2012 to examine the phenological trends in Leptolobium dasycarpum and L. elegans (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae). We tested the effect of average temperature and rainfall of each specimen's month of flowering and/or fruiting and the three months prior using generalized least squares models. The species presented similar flowering and fruiting seasons, peaking in the wet season. Across this hotspot of biodiversity characterized by extraordinary environmental variations between the wet and dry seasons, L. dasycarpum and L. elegans tend to delay their phenophases with increasing temperature and precipitation. However, we did not find a significant alteration of the phenophase dates over the 52 years. In addition, although the temperature in Cerrado has increased during the period investigated, these two species were not affected by the climatic changes, indicating that additional factors or even the interaction of multiple drivers may have determined their flowering/fruiting control.

Understanding the responses of these hydraulic traits to drought conditions remains a challenge for describing comprehensive plant-water relationships. The ability of an organism to resist and/or tolerate embolism events, which may occur at high negative pressure caused by hydric stress, relies on how well it can sustain a hydraulic system in a dynamic equilibrium. Populus deltoides is a water-saving tree species with a stomatal conductance that declines rapidly with reduced water availability. Under unfavorable conditions, the stomatal control of transpiration is known to be closely coordinated with a loss of plant hydraulic functioning that can ultimately result in hydraulic failure through xylem embolism, notably in leaves. The effects of drought on leaf hydraulics are also related to regulation in water permeases such as the aquaporins. To describe the responses linked to leaf hydraulics under severe drought and rewatering conditions, water-stressed poplars were monitored daily on an ecophysiological and a molecular scale. A structural and expression analysis on a set of aquaporins was carried out in parallel by in situ hybridization analysis and quantitative PCR. In complement, water distribution in water-challenged leaves was investigated using X-ray microtomography. A general depression of leaf hydraulic conductance and relative water content occurred under drought, but was reversed when plants were rewatered. More interestingly, (i) extreme leaf water deficiency led to marked xylem and lamina embolism, but a degree of hydric integrity in the midrib extraxylem territories and the bundle sheath of the minor veins was maintained, and (ii) the sub-tissue water allocation correlated well with an over-accumulation of several PIP and TIP aquaporins. Our multi-facet molecular ecophysiological approach revealed that leaves were able to secure a certain level of hydric status, in particular in cell territories near the "living ribs", which provided rapid hydric adjustment responses once favorable conditions were restored. These findings contribute to an integrated approach to leaf hydraulics, thus favoring a better understanding of the cell mechanisms involved in tree vulnerability to climate changes.

However, it remains uncertain how such trade-offs may vary with changes in resource availability including water and CO2 availability. We conducted a glasshouse experiment with peppermint (Mentha x piperita L.) exposed to four treatments: control (sufficient irrigation and near-ambient CO2), water deficit (50% irrigation and near-ambient CO2), CO2 limitation (sufficient irrigation and below-ambient CO2) and the combination of water and CO2 deficits. Continuous (CO2)-C-13 labelling was used to trace allocation of newly-assimilated C. Concentrations of soluble sugars significantly increased under water deficit but decreased along with aboveground biomass under low CO2, while monoterpene concentrations remained relatively constant, independent of treatments. Under water deficit, there were no differences in allocation of new vs old C to monoterpenes production, structural growth and storage; plants grown under low CO2 even invested proportionally more newly-assimilated C for monoterpenes production, suggesting a preferential allocation to defense at the expense of growth. We concluded that C allocation to monoterpenes is actively regulated in coordination with growth and storage under water and C stresses, consistent with an optimal defense strategy to protect young tissues.

Consequences could be nutritional imbalances that may impair growth of the individual tree. High N input into forests, however, has been observed to stimulate tree growth, but was also accompanied by increasing foliar N/P ratios that imply the beginning of P deficiency. At the long-term perspective, N induced P deficiency will affect the P nutrition of the whole tree, especially P reserves of the bark and wood with the consequence of reduced tree growth. To test this assumption, young poplar plants, which were established in pots with approximately 1 L sand at low N and medium P supply, were subjected to high N load via fertilization. Improved N supply resulted in depleted P pools of older stem sections where mature and senescent leaves were present. Simultaneously, mature leaves showed enhanced rate of CO2 fixation that enables enhanced growth. Obviously, poplars grown at low N were N but not P limited despite N:P ratios indicating P deficiency for mature leaves. To show limitation of P remobilization, poplars which were established at high N and medium P supply were subsequently withhold from continuous phosphate (P-1) fertilization. These poplars showed decreased growth increment and diminished photosynthesis of mature leaves. At the whole plant level, this was accompanied by restricted P remobilization from older stem sections. Nevertheless, P contents of fine roots remained mostly unaffected. In conclusion, if P reserves are present, P compounds can be mobilized from stem bark and wood and can compensate for an enhanced P demand at high N load. However, this compensation is limited upon prolonged excess N load and might lead to P limitation that restricts growth in the long run.

However, very little is known about the number, effect size, and location of the genomic regions influencing the variation of these traits in natural populations. Based on a dense linkage map of the common frog, Rana temporaria, we have localized, for the first time in amphibians, three significant and nine suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for metabolic rate, growth rate, development time, and weight at metamorphosis, explaining 5.6-18.9% of the overall phenotypic variation in each trait. We also found a potential pleiotropic QTL between development time and size at metamorphosis that, if confirmed, might underlie the previously reported genetic correlation between these traits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the genetic variation linked to fitness-related larval traits segregates within Rana temporaria populations. This study provides the first insight into the genomic regions that affect larval life history traits in anurans, providing a valuable resource to delve further into the genomic basis of evolutionary change in amphibians.

Genetic architecture of quantitative flower and leaf traits in a pair of sympatric sister species of Primulina	HEREDITY			English	Article							FLORAL TRAITS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PHENOTYPIC TRAITS; QTL ANALYSIS; LOCI; EVOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY; INTEGRATION; POPULATION; DIVERGENCE	Flowers and leaves each represent suites of functionally interrelated traits that are often involved in species divergence and local adaptation. However, a major unresolved issue is how the individual component traits that make up a complex trait such as a flower evolve in a coordinated fashion to retain a high degree of functionality. We use a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach to elucidate the genetic architecture of divergence in flower and leaf traits between the sister species Primulina depressa and Primulina danxiaensis, which grow sympatrically but in contrasting microhabitats. We found that flower traits were controlled by multiple QTL of small effect, while leaf physiological and morphological traits tended to be controlled by QTL of larger effect. The observed floral integration, manifested by a high degree overlap in both individual trait QTL and QTL for principal component scores (PCA QTL), may have been critical for evolutionary divergence of floral morphology in relation to their pollinators. This overlap suggests that direct selection on only one or a few of the component traits could have caused substantial divergence in other floral traits due to genetic correlations, while the low QTL overlap between floral and vegetative traits suggests that these trait suites are genetically unlinked and can evolve independently in response to different selective pressures corresponding to their distinct functions.

Isolation on a remote island: genetic and morphological differentiation of a cosmopolitan odonate	HEREDITY			English	Article							PANTALA-FLAVESCENS; WING SHAPE; BODY-SIZE; POPULATIONS; DNA; EVOLUTION; MITOCHONDRIAL; DIVERSITY; SOFTWARE; INSECT	Although low levels of genetic structure are expected in highly widespread species, geographical and/or ecological factors can limit species distributions and promote population structure and morphological differentiation. In order to determine the effects of geographical isolation on population genetic structure and wing morphology, 281 individuals of the cosmopolitan odonate Pantala flavescens were collected from four continental (Central and South America) and five insular sites (Polynesian islands and the Maldives). COI sequences and eight microsatellite loci were used to characterize genetic diversity and genetic structure between and within locations. Linear and geometric morphometry were used to evaluate differences in the size and shape of wings. Genetic analysis showed a global genetic difference between the continental and insular sites. American locations did not show genetic structure, even in locations separated by a distance of 5000 km. Easter Island showed the lowest values of genetic diversity (mainly mitochondrial diversity) and the highest values of genetic differences compared to other insular and continental sites. Individuals from Easter Island showed smaller forewings, a different abdomen length to thorax length ratio, and a different configuration of anal loop in the hindwings. Thus, the greater isolation, smaller area, and young geological age seem to have determined the genetic and morphological differences in P. flavescens of Easter Island, where selection could promote a loss of migratory behavior and may improve other life history traits, such as reproduction. This work provides new insight into how microevolutionary processes operate in isolated populations of cosmopolitan species.	[Alvial, I.

Males carrying meiotic drive are expected to suffer reduced fertility due to the loss of sperm and associated harmful side-effects of the mechanisms causing segregation distortion. However, sexual selection should promote adaptive compensation to overcome these deleterious effects. We investigate this using SR, an X-linked meiotic drive system in the stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. Despite sperm destruction caused by drive, we find no evidence that SR males transfer fewer sperm to the female's spermathecae (long-term storage organs). Likewise, migration from the spermathecae to the ventral receptacle for fertilisation is similar for SR and wildtype male sperm, both over short and long time-frames. In addition, sperm number in storage is similar even after males have mated multiple times. Our study challenges conventional assumptions about the deleterious effects of drive on male fertility. This suggests that SR male ejaculate investment per ejaculate has been adjusted to match sperm delivery by wildtype males. We interpret these results in the light of recent theoretical models that predict how ejaculate strategies evolve when males vary in the resources allocated to reproduction or in sperm fertility. Adaptive compensation is likely in species where meiotic drive has persisted over many generations and predicts a higher stable frequency of drive maintained in wild populations. Future research must determine exactly how drive males compensate for failed spermatogenesis, and how such compensation may trade-off with investment in other fitness traits.

In Gironde, the allis shad populations which were the most abundant in Europe are no exception and have dramatically declined since 2000. Failure in reproduction success is one of the proposed explanations for this collapse. In light of this, we studied the reproductive strategy of the allis shad populations in the Gironde watershed. We used an original methodology to define the thermal behavior of allis shad during reproduction using an electivity index for 14years of field monitoring in two rivers, composed of daily reproduction activity and temperature. For the first time, this study deeply explores and defines the thermal preference of a shad species during the reproduction. A temperature preference between 14.5 degrees C and 23 degrees C by spawners during the reproduction was observed. Despite annual fluctuations, an overall similarity of temperature ranges between the two rivers was observed. The thermal preference matched with the thermal tolerance of early stages (16.2 degrees C to 24.8 degrees C) and confirms that allis shad spawners adopt behavioral rules of reproduction in order to maximize the survival of their offspring. The similarity of shad thermal behavior may indicate the phylogenetic basis of thermal preference for fish species.

Wetlands and development influence fish diversity in a species-rich small river	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Duck River; Species richness; Imperiled species; Land use; Species hotspots	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; FRESH-WATER; LAND-USE; STREAM HABITAT; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; LANDSCAPE; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; MODELS	We identified in-stream and off-stream characteristics that influenced various species diversity metrics in reaches of the Duck River Basin, Tennessee, USA. This relatively small basin is home to one of the most diverse freshwater fish faunas in North America. In all, over 325,000 native fish representing 136 native fish species were electrofished in 207 collections across 86 stations. Diversity of native species and of seven taxa and functional guilds, including imperiled species, increased with size of the catchment above a station, an effect that was mediated by altitude. After removing the effects of catchment and altitude, diversity was influenced by in-stream factors and mostly by off-stream land composition such as wetlands within 0.1km from the channel and urban/suburban development within 2.5km. Pastures next to streams unexpectedly increased diversity. Our analyses suggest that there are detectable hotspots associated with off-stream landscape characteristics where conservation efforts may be focused. Our results may encourage conservation planners to apply geospatial analyses to identify diversity hotspots based on land cover distributions and develop recommendations for management of specific stream reaches. Alternatively, geospatial analysis may be used by planners to estimate the impacts of alternative land-use scenarios, thus preemptively conserving species richness.	[Miranda, L.

Salmon egg subsidies and interference competition among stream fishes	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Aggression; Fish community; Resource superabundance; Competitive interactions; Oncorhynchus sp	INTER-SPECIFIC COMPETITION; JUVENILE COHO SALMON; SOCKEYE-SALMON; DOLLY VARDEN; ONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCH; POPULATION-DENSITY; STEELHEAD TROUT; TERRITORY SIZE; FIN DAMAGE; GROWTH	Resource availability may modulate interference interactions among competitors. For example, competition among stream fishes for drifting eggs from salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) spawning events may be influenced by the availability of this energy-rich food source. This study used camera-based techniques to evaluate the effect of varied prey availability (i.e., pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) eggs) on rates of interference competition within natural stream fish communities at 10 sites. Aggressive interactions were quantified across different levels of egg additions, ranging from 6 to 3575 O. gorbuscha eggs, at 10 sites on the Keogh River, British Columbia, Canada. There were fewer aggressive interactions among salmonids (O. kisutch, O. mykiss, and O. clarkii clarkii) when there were more available eggs. Aggressive interaction rates were species-dependent; for example, the number of aggressive acts relative to null expectations based on abundances were highest in juvenile coho (O. kisutch) towards conspecifics. For some interactions, size of fish appeared to be a key factor as well. Thus, higher densities of spawning salmon in streams may provide sufficient prey resources in the form of eggs to temporarily decrease interference competition among stream fishes.	[Bailey, C.

Aggression, color signaling, and performance of the male color morphs of a Brazilian lizard (Tropidurus semitaeniatus)	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Behavioral display; Animal coloration; Intrasexual competition; Agonistic behavior; Alternative reproductive tactics; Sprint speed	MALE-MALE COMPETITION; MALE TREE LIZARDS; LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; SOCIAL-DOMINANCE; FENCE LIZARD; SELECTION; POLYMORPHISM; EVOLUTION; DISPLAYS; PATTERNS	Behavior can help to establish dominance in intrasexual interactions, preventing more costly aggressive interactions and improving access to mates. Distinct color morphs often correlate with behavior, driving differential reproductive success between them. The lizard Tropidurus semitaeniatus usually expresses two male color morphs, Yellow or Black. It is likely that morphs play a role in reproduction, which is still unexplored. Here, we test whether there is morph-related dominance during intrasexual interactions. We used ex situ behavioral trials to test whether a particular morph shows dominance, gathering dominance by attributing scores to aggressive/evasive behaviors. We also tested whether winner individuals show higher performance (sprint speed), and whether spectrophotometric measures of body coloration predict winners of male encounters. Morphs showed differences in behaviors suggesting alternative behavioral tactics: Black males behave more aggressively and less evasively while Yellow males show the opposite sets of behavior. Black males also tend to be dominant, but dominants do not show higher sprint speeds than submissive males. Chest coloration, often displayed during encounters, highly predicts winnings (particularly high yellow chroma and low lightness and UV). Our results show that lizards signal competitive condition by behaviorally exposing their chest. Males displaying more head bobs and with darker chests are more likely to win encounters. Our results suggest that Yellow males might undertake a sneaker tactic, preventing aggression costs by evasiveness even though they might perform similarly to Black males. Further studies should address whether female preference is biased in relation to male morphs and its colorations, which would suggest selective processes towards costly signals and morph maintenance.Significance statementIn the struggle for survival and reproduction, often, there is no single best strategy and multiple distinct tactics may evolve. Behavior, color signaling, and performance are frequently correlated with distinct color morphs, which can coexist as alternative mating tactics. However, studies that are able to integrate all these traits are scarce. Here, we test whether different color morphs of the lizard Tropidurus semitaeniatus show different behaviors and dominance patterns. We also test whether these color morphs differ in their performances (sprint speed) and visual signaling (behavioral displays and intensity of coloration). We demonstrate that Black and Yellow-morph males adopt distinct behavioral tactics: an aggressive (Black-morph) and an evasive (Yellow-morph) tactic. We also show that dominance is highly correlated to chest's intensity of dark yellow colorations and that lizards signal theirdominance status through displays of head bob bouts.

Fixed or flexible? Winner/loser effects vary with habitat quality in a parasitoid wasp	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Prior contest experience; Resource availability; Agonistic behavior; Resource value	PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE; CONTEST EXPERIENCE; EUPELMUS-VUILLETI; HOST; EVOLUTION; OWNERSHIP; OOGENESIS; DOMINANCE; FISH; LONG	Prior experience of fighting affects the outcome of subsequent contests, with prior winners being more likely to win and prior losers being more likely to lose a future encounter. These winner and loser effects have been shown in numerous species but have usually been tested in only one set of conditions. However, if such effects are not fixed but context dependent, we can expect their strength to change according to the situation. In particular, their magnitude could covary with other factors, such as those influencing contestants' fighting abilities or the value they place on the contested resource, which in turn are known to influence contest behaviors and outcomes. Here, we tested the effect that prior experience of resource availability had on the expression of winner and loser effects in Eupelmus vuilleti, a parasitoid wasp fighting for hosts on which to lay their eggs. We showed that a loser effect was observable only when females experienced a habitat rich in hosts (hence placed low value on the contested individual host) but not when they were deprived of hosts (leading to individual hosts having high value). Contrary with a prior study, no clear winner effect was observed. These results suggest that the strength of winner and loser effects are context dependent in E. vuilleti, and interactions with other factors can either accentuate or attenuate the effects. Our data further raise the question of whether the intensity of the first encounter, not only its outcome, influences the behavioral decisions of individuals during a subsequent contest.Significance statementA previous victory can increase the chance of winning a subsequent fight, while a prior defeat can increase the chance of losing. Such winner and loser effects have been shown in numerous species but have usually been studied in only one set of conditions. We show that the strength of these effects can be context dependent, such that they are accentuated or attenuated when experience interacts with factors such as habitat quality. Our data further raise the question of whether the intensity of the first encounter (how hard it was to win or lose), not just the outcome, influences behavioral decisions during subsequent contests.

We quantified female-female aggression in the viviparous toad-headed agama, Phrynocephalus vlangalii, and tested the mate limitation and resource competition hypotheses, to explain the driving forces behind heightened female-female aggression. We established populations in outdoor enclosures and separately manipulated mate and food availability while quantifying aggressive interactions between known females. Female mass and offspring quantity and quality were monitored for 2years and used as an index of female fitness. Interestingly, female-female aggression was highest outside the mating season, when females were pregnant. Also, male availability did not significantly influence female-female aggression. Consequently, we found no evidence in support of the mate limitation hypothesis. Female-female aggression, however, was greatest during periods of low-food availability. Greater food availability did have positive fitness consequence for females: high-food treatment females were more likely to gain mass and give birth than females from the low-food treatment, and offspring from high-food treatment females were more likely to survive the first winter. However, we did have an effect of year: female mass was negatively associated with female-female aggression in year 1 but positively associated in year 2, although the association was not significant. The same pattern appeared in the association between offspring sprint speed and female-female aggression: higher levels of female-female aggression in year 1 were associated with slower offspring, while in year 2, higher female-female aggression was associated with faster offspring. Overall, our results demonstrate a link between female-female aggression and competition for resource (food) and highlight the potential importance of female aggressive behavior as a mechanism that influences female fitness.Significance statementMale-male contest competition has been a cornerstone of sexual selection theory for decades because dominant males can control more space and access to females. Conversely, female aggression is poorly understood and sometimes considered a paradox, especially in species lacking parental care. We tested whether female-female aggression in the viviparous lizard P. vlangalii is best explained by competition for males (mate limitation hypothesis) or competition over food (food limitation hypothesis). Interestingly, female aggression peaks after mating, while females are still pregnant. Heightened aggression at this time supports the food limitation hypothesis because any advantage females have in terms of access to resources will benefit offspring born into her home range. Likewise, access to additional food resources may improve female survival and future reproductive investment through greater energy storage.

This study used both temporal and spatial models to investigate the relationship between temperature and crime in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, using an 11-year data set. Results suggested that assault and theft counts were significantly higher in summer than winter (17.8 and 3.7%, respectively), while fraud counts were not significantly different. Using linear and quadratic terms for maximum daily temperature, a linear regression model indicated that daily assault counts significantly increased with rising temperature and the rate of increase slowed as temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. Theft counts significantly increased with rising temperature then declined as temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. Again, there was no evidence of a relationship between temperature and frequency of fraud count. Spatial modelling revealed that 96% of local government areas (LGAs) in NSW had a higher summer assault rate than winter. The findings of this study provide an empirical foundation for understanding crime-temperature relationships in Australia.

In order to check for fine-scale spatial distribution of metazoans on the bottom of the holes, in this study, we analysed three groups of grazing invertebrates as a model: tardigrades, rotifers, and mites. We addressed differences within cryoconite holes comparing the distribution of invertebrates within and between separate holes and between glaciers at a worldwide scale. We divided each cryoconite hole into three sampling zones (established in relation to water flow on a glacier) and collected nine subsamples within cryoconite holes on glaciers in the Arctic (Longyearbreen), Norway (Blaisen), the Alps (Forni) and maritime Antarctic (Ecology Glacier). Generally, we found no consistent difference in sampling zones within cryoconite holes, which suggests homogeneity on the hole floors. However, we did find strong differences and high heterogeneity between subsamples, even within the same zone. Invertebrate densities ranged between 52 and 426 individuals per ml in subsamples collected from the same hole. We found from zero to four trdigrade species in the cryoconite hole on Longyearbreen. Our results show that benthic animals in cryoconite holes in various climatic zones have heterogeneous spatial distribution, even if no preference could be highlighted for upstream versus downstream areas with respect to water flow. The distribution of invertebrates may result from ecosystem disturbance by flushing water and animals' active movement. Cryoconite holes, usually considered to be simple ecosystems, seem to be complex habitats where hidden spatial heterogeneity may affect abundance and diversity of organisms.

This type of data is important for understanding food web functioning as well as for supporting an ecosystem-based fisheries management plan. In this study, we used C-13 and N-15 stable isotope analysis to assess the relative isotopic niche area (i.e., which species has the largest and smallest isotopic niche area within a study site) and core isotopic niche overlap between 299 sharks of 11 co-occurring shark species that vary in size, diet and behavior in three coastal study areas in South Florida. Overall, results show that the relative isotopic niche area and patterns of core isotopic niche overlap between some sympatric shark species varied between sites, suggesting plasticity in resource use and competitive interactions between shark species (e.g., 85% of blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus standard ellipse area overlapped with the blacknose shark C. acronotus ellipse in Biscayne Bay, but there was no overlap between these species' ellipses in nearby Florida Bay). Therefore, patterns of resource use and trophic interactions documented among species from one site may not be applicable to a neighboring location. These findings may have implications for food web models that incorporate trophic data from different areas for a species when local data are unavailable.

Hence, the aim of the present work was to analyse the temperature-related pattern in the early life-history events and characteristics of the common sole, Solea solea, along most of its geographical distribution area, focusing on key nursery areas for this species: Venice lagoon (Italy), Mondego estuary (Portugal), Vilaine estuary (France) and Balgzand (Netherlands). Otolith microstructure from metamorphosed age 0 juveniles was used to estimate age, the pelagic larval and metamorphosis stages duration, and the spawning period. A latitudinal cline was found for the main processes of the early life cycle: spawning started in December in the southernmost areas (Mondego estuary and Venice Lagoon) and in February in the Balgzand population. Hatching started earlier in the Venice lagoon, where warmer water temperatures in the winter led to an earlier development. The longest pelagic stage was observed in the French coast populations, which differed significantly from those of the Mediterranean, while metamorphosis lasted longer in the North Sea (Balgzand), when compared with the Portuguese Atlantic coast (Mondego). Populations further north were characterized by higher growth rates, suggesting an adaptation to local conditions. Despite that several abiotic factors play an important role in flatfish early life history, the observed temperature gradient seems to be one of the most important drivers.

Production and viability of Fraxinus pollen and its relationship with aerobiological data in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula	AEROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Fraxinus angustifolia; Fraxinus excelsior; Pollen; Phenology; Climate change; Allergy	CLIMATE-CHANGE; GERMINATION; TREE; PHENOLOGY; EXCELSIOR; EXPOSURE; OLEACEAE; QUALITY; SENSITIVITY; PATTERN	The efficient evaluation of the potential pollen production of plants can provide preventive measures for the allergic population. For this purpose, a comparative study of three methods was carried out to evaluate pollen production (volumetric method, Neubauer chamber and Coulter cell counts), as well as other three methods to estimate pollen viability (fluorometry, colorimetry and germination) of Fraxinus. Our results indicate that the Neubauer chamber and the colorimetric response to two stains (acetic carmine with glycerol, ACG; 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, TTC) are the most adequate methods to determine, respectively, pollen production and quality, according to criteria of low cost, speed and reliability of the obtained data. Climate change is likely to influence vegetation, with consequent changes in growth and reproductive cycles, and therefore in pollen production. Considering the data obtained during the last two decades (1997-2017), we detected a statistically significant trend toward the increase in the airborne total annual pollen integral of Fraxinus pollen in NW Spain.

Harnessing the potential of integrated systematics for conservation of taxonomically complex, megadiverse plant groups	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						extent of occurrence; extinction risk; georeferenced; herbarium; IUCN Red List; misidentification; monography; taxonomic remodeling	ATLANTIC FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; COLLECTIONS; MYRTACEAE; AULOMYRCIA; ECOLOGISTS; DIVERSITY; HERBARIA; BIASES; TOOLS	The value of natural history collections for conservation science research is increasingly recognized, despite their well-documented limitations in terms of taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage. Specimen-based analyses are particularly important for tropical plant groups for which field observations are scarce and potentially unreliable due to high levels of diversity-amplifying identification challenges. Specimen databases curated by specialists are rich sources of authoritatively identified, georeferenced occurrence data, and such data are urgently needed for large genera. We compared entries in a monographic database for the large Neotropical genus Myrcia in 2007 and 2017. We classified and quantified differences in specimen records over this decade and determined the potential impact of these changes on conservation assessments. We distinguished misidentifications from changes due to taxonomic remodeling and considered the effects of adding specimens and georeferences. We calculated the potential impact of each change on estimates of extent of occurrence (EOO), the most frequently used metric in extinction-risk assessments of tropical plants. We examined whether particular specimen changes were associated with species for which changes in EOO over the decade were large enough to change their conservation category. Corrections to specimens previously misidentified or lacking georeferences were overrepresented in such species, whereas changes associated with taxonomic remodeling (lumping and splitting) were underrepresented. Among species present in both years, transitions to less threatened status outnumbered those to more threatened (8% vs 3%, respectively). Species previously deemed data deficient transitioned to threatened status more often than to not threatened (10% vs 7%, respectively). Conservation scientists risk reaching unreliable conclusions if they use specimen databases that are not actively curated to reflect changing knowledge.	[Lughadha, Eimear M.

Amazonian deforestation and soil biodiversity	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						land-use change; meta-analysis; microorganisms; rainforest; soil fauna	LAND-USE SYSTEM; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; BRAZILIAN AMAZON; RAIN-FOREST; DIVERSITY; MACROFAUNA; PASTURE; FAUNA; BASIN; INVERTEBRATES	Clearance and perturbation of Amazonian forests are one of the greatest threats to tropical biodiversity conservation of our times. A better understanding of how soil communities respond to Amazonian deforestation is crucially needed to inform policy interventions that effectively protect biodiversity and the essential ecosystem services it provides. We assessed the impact of deforestation and ecosystem conversion to arable land on Amazonian soil biodiversity through a meta-analysis. We analyzed 274 pairwise comparisons of soil biodiversity in Amazonian primary forests and sites under different stages of deforestation and land-use conversion: disturbed (wildfire and selective logging) and slash-and-burnt forests, pastures, and cropping systems. Overall, 60% and 51% of responses of soil macrofauna and microbial community attributes (i.e., abundance, biomass, richness, and diversity indexes) to deforestation were negative, respectively. We found few studies on mesofauna (e.g., microarthropods) and microfauna (e.g., protozoa and nematodes), so those groups could not be analyzed. Macrofauna abundance and biomass were more vulnerable to the displacement of forests by pastures than by agricultural fields, whereas microbes showed the opposite pattern. Effects of Amazonian deforestation on macrofauna were more detrimental at sites with mean annual precipitation >1900 mm, and higher losses of microbes occurred in highly acidic soils (pH < 4.5). Limited geographic coverage, omission of meso- and microfauna, and low taxonomic resolution were main factors impairing generalizations from the data set. Few studies assessed the impacts of within-forest disturbance (wildfires and selective logging) on soil species in Amazonia, where logging operations rapidly expand across public lands and more frequent severe dry seasons are increasing the prevalence of wildfires.

Previous reviews of plant reintroductions focused on short-term (e.g., <= 3 years) survival and flowering of founder individuals rather than on benchmarks of intergenerational persistence, such as seedling recruitment. However, short-term metrics may obscure outcomes because the unique demographic properties of reintroductions, including small size and unstable stage structure, could create lags in population growth. We used time-to-event analysis on a database of unusually well-monitored and long-term (4-28 years) reintroductions of 27 rare plant species to test whether life-history traits and population characteristics of reintroductions create time-lagged responses in seedling recruitment (i.e., recruitment time lags [RTLs]), an important benchmark of success and indicator of persistence in reintroduced populations. Recruitment time lags were highly variable among reintroductions, ranging from <1 to 17 years after installation. Recruitment patterns matched predictions from life-history theory with short-lived species (fast species) exhibiting consistently shorter and less variable RTLs than long-lived species (slow species). Long RTLs occurred in long-lived herbs, especially in grasslands, whereas short RTLs occurred in short-lived subtropical woody plants and annual herbs. Across plant life histories, as reproductive adult abundance increased, RTLs decreased. Highly variable RTLs were observed in species with multiple reintroduction events, suggesting local processes are just as important as life-history strategy in determining reintroduction outcomes. Time lags in restoration outcomes highlight the need to scale success benchmarks in reintroduction monitoring programs with plant life-history strategies and the unique demographic properties of restored populations. Drawing conclusions on the long-term success of plant reintroduction programs is premature given that demographic processes in species with slow life-histories take decades to unfold.

Effects of law enforcement and community outreach on mammal diversity in a biodiversity hotspot	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						camera trap; conservation effectiveness; protected area; species richness; Xishuangbanna	PROTECTED AREA MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION ATTITUDES; RAIN-FOREST; PERCEPTIONS; ABUNDANCE; WILDLIFE; CHINA; XISHUANGBANNA; EVALUATE; IMPACTS	Management activities such as law enforcement and community outreach are thought to affect conservation outcomes in protected areas, but their importance relative to intrinsic environmental characteristics of the parks and extrinsic human pressures surrounding the parks have not been explored. Furthermore, it is not clear which is more related to conservation outcomes-the management itself or local people's perceptions of the management. We measured objective (reports by park staff) and subjective (reports by local people) levels of community outreach and law enforcement based on responses to 374 questionnaires. We estimated mammal abundance and diversity of 6 protected areas based on data from 115 camera traps in Xishuangbanna, southwest China, a biodiversity hotspot with high hunting and land-conversion pressures. We then examined correlations among them and found that local people's perception of law enforcement was positively related to the local abundance of 2 large, hunted species, wild boar (Sus scrofa) (beta = 15.22) and muntjac (Muntiacus vaginalis) (beta = 14.82), but not related to the abundance of smaller mammals or to objective levels of enforcement. The subjective frequency of outreach by park staff to local communities (beta = 3.42) and park size (beta = 3.28) were significantly and positively related to mammal species richness, whereas elevation, human population density, and subjective frequency of law enforcement were not. We could not conclude that community outreach and law enforcement were directly causing increased mammal abundance and diversity. Nevertheless, the patterns we detected are some of the first empirical evidence consistent with the idea that biodiversity in protected areas may be more positively and strongly related to local perceptions of the intensity of park management than to either intrinsic (e.g., elevation, park size) or extrinsic (e.g., human population density) environmental factors.

Deterring poaching is a fundamental conservation objective, but its achievement is difficult to identify, especially when the prime source of information comes in the form of the patrols' own records, which inevitably contain biases. The most common metric of deterrence is a plot of illegal activities detected per unit of patrol effort (CPUE) against patrol effort (CPUE-E). We devised a simple, mechanistic model of law breaking and law enforcement in which we simulated deterrence alongside exogenous changes in the frequency of offences under different temporal patterns of enforcement effort. The CPUE-E plots were not reliable indicators of deterrence. However, plots of change in CPUE over change in effort (Delta CPUE-Delta E) reliably identified deterrence, regardless of the temporal distribution of effort or any exogenous change in illegal activity levels as long as the time lag between patrol effort and subsequent behavioral change among offenders was approximately known. The Delta CPUE-Delta E plots offered a robust, simple metric for monitoring patrol effectiveness; were no more conceptually complicated than the basic CPUE-E plots; and required no specialist knowledge or software to produce. Our findings demonstrate the need to account for temporal autocorrelation in patrol data and to consider appropriate (and poaching-activity-specific) intervals for aggregation. They also reveal important gaps in understanding of deterrence in this context, especially the mechanisms by which it occurs. In practical applications, we recommend the use of Delta CPUE-Delta E plots in preference to other basic metrics and advise that deterrence should be suspected only if there is a clear negative slope. Distinct types of illegal activity should not be grouped together for analysis, especially if the signs of their occurrence have different persistence times in the environment.	[Dobson, Andrew D.

Simultaneous-count models to estimate abundance from counts of unmarked individuals with imperfect detection	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian; detectability; dynamics; Gyps; hierarchical model; monitoring; N-mixture model; population; Sarcogyps; vulture	N-MIXTURE MODELS; DETECTION PROBABILITY; INFERENCE	We developed a method to estimate population abundance from simultaneous counts of unmarked individuals over multiple sites. We considered that at each sampling occasion, individuals in a population could be detected at 1 of the survey sites or remain undetected and used either multinomial or binomial simultaneous-count models to estimate abundance, the latter being equivalent to an N-mixture model with one site. We tested model performance with simulations over a range of detection probabilities, population sizes, growth rates, number of years, sampling occasions, and sites. We then applied our method to 3 critically endangered vulture species in Cambodia to demonstrate the real-world applicability of the model and to provide the first abundance estimates for these species in Cambodia. Our new approach works best when existing methods are expected to perform poorly (i.e., few sites and large variation in abundance among sites) and if individuals may move among sites between sampling occasions. The approach performed better when there were >8 sampling occasions and net probability of detection was high (>0.5). We believe our approach will be useful in particular for simultaneous surveys at aggregation sites, such as roosts. The method complements existing approaches for estimating abundance of unmarked individuals and is the first method designed specifically for simultaneous counts.

EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Communication; Sex-specific costs; Sex roles; Predation risk; Mate searching; Crickets	BAT PREDATION; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; PREY; SELECTION; FEMALES; SIZE	In animals that communicate for pair formation, generally one sex invests more effort in mate searching. Differential predation risk of mate searching between the sexes is hypothesised to determine which sex invests more effort in mate searching. Although searching by males is prevalent in most animals, in orthopteran insects and some other taxa females physically move to localise signalling males who are predominantly sedentary. Although the two sexes thus share mate searching effort in orthopterans, their behavioural strategies are different and sexual selection theory predicts that signalling males may be following the riskier strategy and incurring higher costs. However, relative levels of risk posed by the two mate searching strategies remain largely unexplored. Hence, we estimated the relative predation risk experienced in natural populations by signalling males and responding females. We did this by quantifying predation risk as a probability of mortality in the context of acoustic communication in a tree cricket, Oecanthus henryi from its ecologically relevant predator, a lynx spider, Peucetia viridans. Spiders may perceive calling in males and movement in females by their ability to detect both airborne acoustic cues and substrate-borne vibratory cues. Probability of mortality was quantified by partitioning it into three spatial components at which crickets and spiders interact, using a combination of extensive field observations and manipulative experiments in a semi-natural setup. We found no differences in predation risk faced by calling males and responding females, supporting the prediction that similar sex-specific costs can explain shared mate searching responsibilities. Our findings therefore suggest that direct benefits offered by males to females upon pair formation may better explain shared mate searching effort between the sexes in orthopterans.

These polymorphisms tend to occur between, rather than within, populations. Here, we aimed to understand flower colour divergence in this fynbos heath species and its association with post-fire regeneration. We tested for an association between these polymorphisms. We also examined whether yellow-flowered plants lacked anthocyanins and whether the lack of anthocyanins affected the concentration of other flavonoids, both in flowers and shoots. We found a strong association between flower colour, regeneration mode and flowering phenology. We also detected larger anthers and larger pollen in yellow- than in red-flowered plants, consistently for both resprouter and seeder regeneration strategies. Finally, we ascertained that being yellow-flowered is associated with loss in the capacity of synthesizing anthocyanins in both the flower and in the vegetative tissue. Considering that pollinator availability or preferences do probably not constitute a selection pressure, we propose that both enhanced reproductive success of anthocyaninless, yellow-flowered plants and the avoidance of likely negative pleiotropic effects (early senescence) in seeders would be key to understanding the flower colour divergence in E. coccinea subsp. coccinea.

Phenotypic differentiation in a resilient dung beetle species induced by forest conversion into cattle pastures	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Canthon quinquemaculatus; Functional morphology; Habitat loss; Phenotypic variation; Plasticity; Quantitative traits	ONTHOPHAGUS-ACUMINATUS COLEOPTERA; BODY-SIZE; CONTEMPORARY EVOLUTION; ATLANTIC FOREST; CONSERVATION BIOLOGY; BIRD RESPONSES; LAND-USE; COMMUNITY; MORPHOLOGY; ECOLOGY	Forest conversion into lands for different uses is a widespread practice in tropical and subtropical regions. Such anthropogenic disturbance drastically modifies environmental conditions and availability of resources for species (ecological niche). While many species usually disappear or become rare, other (resilient species) persist in the disturbed areas, being subject to new and often stressful conditions (ecological filters). The issue of whether human-driven habitat modifications induce phenotypic changes in resilient organisms at the intraspecific level has been poorly studied thus far. In this study, we used the neotropical dung beetle Canthon quinquemaculatus to test the hypothesis that the conversion of native forest into open cattle pastures can induce phenotypic differentiation in the functional morphology of resilient species. Sexual dimorphism and year of collection were simultaneously evaluated as potential sources of intraspecific variation in the measured morphological traits. We measured several functional traits related to thermal niche, burrowing capacity and food resource manipulation, including body size and shape and the size of the anterior leg and its constitutive parts. We found significant morphological differentiation between habitats (native forest vs. cattle pasture), sexes and years in terms of multi- and single-trait comparisons. Individuals from cattle pastures were smaller and less spherical (because of lower body thickness) compared to individuals from native forest. Males were larger with bigger anterior tibia and femur while females were more spherical. The phenotypic differences observed between individuals from native and converted habitats could be attributed to plasticity and/or contemporary (adaptive) evolution. From an ecological viewpoint, this study shows that habitat disturbance may affect morphological variation and functional diversity at the intraspecific level which may in turn influence ecosystem functions that dung beetles perform (i.e. dung burial).

Here, we studied the relationship between plumage ornaments and physiological state in the Pacific swallow Hirundo tahitica on Amami Oshima Island in 2years with contrasting weather conditions: a once-in-a-century severe winter and a mild winter in the following year. Previous studies have shown that, during the severe winter, many Pacific swallows, particularly those with long tails, died whereas no carcasses were found in the next year, indicating relaxed selection during mild years. Here we showed that after the severe winter, the offspring generation had shorter tails than the parental generation, which could not be explained by age or yearly difference in tail length, indicating the evolution of short tails. Moreover, the relationship between tail length and body condition differed between years: longer-tailed swallows had a better body condition in the mild winter, whereas the reverse tendency was found in the severe winter. A similar relationship was found between plasma corticosterone level, an indicator of physiological stress, and tail length (i.e., swallows with longer tails tended to have lower corticosterone levels during the mild winter while the reverse pattern was found during the severe winter). In contrast, another plumage ornament, pheomelanin pigmentation, was positively linked to body condition during the two study years and had no detectable relationship with the plasma corticosterone levels. Differences in the relationship between specific plumage traits and physiology may help to explain the diversity of tail length and plumage coloration in hirundines.

One explanation is the difficulty of collecting data on costs and benefits of sex-ratio adjustments, which prevents the investigation of underlying assumptions. Some predictions may thus have been tested in species where they should not have been expected. Here, we focus on the cost of reproduction hypothesis, which states that parents with low investment capacity should avoid producing the most expensive sex to minimise the decrease in their residual reproductive value. In the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), sons are energetically more expensive than daughters. Using 10years of data (1172 chicks from 790 broods) from a long-term feeding experiment, we predicted a stronger decrease in the probability of producing a son with deteriorating environmental conditions among Control than among supplementally Fed parents. To test this prediction, we used three proxies of environmental conditions and a recent sliding window approach. We found no support for our prediction. Hence, we investigated between-year sex-ratio variation in relation to feeding status to detect a response to an unmeasured environmental variable. There was no interaction between year and feeding status, nor any effect of feeding status itself. However, the probability of producing a male increased with time, which could be a response to an oceanic regime shift that occurred around our colony, but that our proxies failed to capture. Our study further highlights the difficulty of explaining sex-ratio variation in long-lived species with complex life-histories where multiple selective pressures can occur simultaneously.

We sampled butterflies and 11 environmental factors in 60 randomly selected sites across four 500-m elevation zones, representing seven habitat types. Rural mosaics and riverine vegetation were the habitats with the highest diversity of butterflies. Within habitats, the number of flower heads was the most important factor favouring butterfly species richness and abundance and endemic butterfly richness, while soil humidity had a positive effect on species richness and abundance. Although the Natura 2000 network succeeds in including the majority of butterfly species and all Cyprian endemics, the transects sampled within the network did not support more butterfly species than those outside it, and were significantly poorer in terms of butterfly abundance and endemic butterfly species richness and abundance. We found a similar pattern for the Habitats Directive priority habitats, which held poorer overall and endemic butterfly communities than the other habitats. The effectiveness of existing protected area networks may need to be reassessed in regions such as the South East Mediterranean, to ensure that regionally important components of biological diversity are adequately protected. To this aim, our results suggest that new European and national policies as well as further inclusion of rural mosaics and riverine habitats in protected area networks are needed for effective butterfly conservation in Cyprus.

To conserve narrow endemic and threatened plants, is important to know the factors that drive population dynamics. We investigated the factors affecting the population demography of the narrow endemic and threatened Dianthus morisianus, a psammophilous plant with only one small population in Sardinia. Demographic data was analysed by integral projection models (IPMs), and the analysis of population growth rates, elasticities and life table response experiment (LTRE) was performed. Vital rates models show that ramet volume correlates with growth, survival, flowering probability and fruit output. Our results indicate that Dianthus morisianus can be considered a typical long-lived plant with a population dynamic dominated by large ramets. The population growth rate values were always strongly positive; this indicates that the population could increase in the long term and suggests that this plant could be able to recolonise the dune system. However, this scenario seems to contrast with the high risk of extinction reported for this plant; actually the persistence of the unique population of D. morisianus is negatively affected by several factors related to the ecological conditions of coastal dunes and other external factors such as animal grazing and trampling. Conservation actions for this threatened and narrow endemic plant should be focused to strictly protect and to enhance the number of large ramets; this strategy is the key element to increase the population size and to ensure the population persistence.

Particularly vulnerable habitats are freshwater ecosystems, which are hotspots of biodiversity. The threat to these ecosystems are cyanobacterial blooms, which tend to proliferate in the face of climate changes. Cyanobacteria development and dominance affect the whole food web, especially the zooplankton community. We used three classical biodiversity indexes (species richness, Simpson's Diversity Index and Shannon Diversity Index) and three functional diversity indexes (functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence) to study the impact of cyanobacterial bloom on the zooplankton community. The study was conducted in water bodies with a different period of bloom duration (short-lasting blooms vs. long-lasting blooms) in order to determine the impact of the proliferated blooms on the aquatic ecosystems. Use of functional diversity indexes allowed for identifying changes that can be overlooked by classical biodiversity indexes. We conclude that cyanobacterial bloom involves modifications of functional trait space of studied communities and, in consequence, functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

Life history consequences of developing in anthropogenic noise	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						anthropogenic noise; fitness; life history; reproductive investment; Teleogryllus oceanicus	BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; TRAFFIC NOISE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; URBAN NOISE; EVOLUTION; FREQUENCY; EXPOSURE; CRICKET; PREFERENCES; HABITATS	When environments change rapidly, adaptive phenotypic plasticity can ameliorate negative effects of environmental change on survival and reproduction. Recent evidence suggests, however, that plastic responses to human-induced environmental change are often maladaptive or insufficient to overcome novel selection pressures. Anthropogenic noise is a ubiquitous and expanding disturbance with demonstrated effects on fitness-related traits of animals like stress responses, foraging, vigilance, and pairing success. Elucidating the lifetime fitness effects of noise has been challenging because longer-lived vertebrate systems are typically studied in this context. Here, we follow noise-stressed invertebrates throughout their lives, assessing a comprehensive suite of life history traits, and ultimately, lifetime number of surviving offspring. We reared field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, in masking traffic noise, traffic noise from which we removed frequencies that spectrally overlap with the crickets' mate location song and peak hearing (nonmasking), or silence. We found that exposure to masking noise delayed maturity and reduced adult lifespan; crickets exposed to masking noise spent 23% more time in juvenile stages and 13% less time as reproductive adults than those exposed to no traffic noise. Chronic lifetime exposure to noise, however, did not affect lifetime reproductive output (number of eggs or surviving offspring), perhaps because mating provided females a substantial longevity benefit. Nevertheless, these results are concerning as they highlight multiple ways in which traffic noise may reduce invertebrate fitness. We encourage researchers to consider effects of anthropogenic disturbance on growth, survival, and reproductive traits simultaneously because changes in these traits may amplify or nullify one another.

Spatial and habitat variation in aphid, butterfly, moth and bird phenologies over the last half century	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; first egg day; first flight; generalized additive mixed models; global warming; temporal trends	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; POPULATION DECLINES; SCALE VARIATION; SHIFTS; RESPONSES; TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; LEPIDOPTERA; SENSITIVITY	Global warming has advanced the timing of biological events, potentially leading to disruption across trophic levels. The potential importance of phenological change as a driver of population trends has been suggested. To fully understand the possible impacts, there is a need to quantify the scale of these changes spatially and according to habitat type. We studied the relationship between phenological trends, space and habitat type between 1965 and 2012 using an extensive UK dataset comprising 269 aphid, bird, butterfly and moth species. We modelled phenologies using generalized additive mixed models that included covariates for geographical (latitude, longitude, altitude), temporal (year, season) and habitat terms (woodland, scrub, grassland). Model selection showed that a baseline model with geographical and temporal components explained the variation in phenologies better than either a model in which space and time interacted or a habitat model without spatial terms. This baseline model showed strongly that phenologies shifted progressively earlier over time, that increasing altitude produced later phenologies and that a strong spatial component determined phenological timings, particularly latitude. The seasonal timing of a phenological event, in terms of whether it fell in the first or second half of the year, did not result in substantially different trends for butterflies. For moths, early season phenologies advanced more rapidly than those recorded later. Whilst temporal trends across all habitats resulted in earlier phenologies over time, agricultural habitats produced significantly later phenologies than most other habitats studied, probably because of nonclimatic drivers. A model with a significant habitat-time interaction was the best-fitting model for birds, moths and butterflies, emphasizing that the rates of phenological advance also differ among habitats for these groups. Our results suggest the presence of strong spatial gradients in mean seasonal timing and nonlinear trends towards earlier seasonal timing that varies in form and rate among habitat types.

With climate change, peatland C mineralization is expected to increase, which in turn would accelerate climate change. A particularity of peatlands is the importance of soil aeration, which regulates peatland functioning and likely modulates the responses to warming climate. Our aim is to assess the impacts of warming on a southern boreal and a sub-arctic sedge fen carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange under two plausible water table regimes: wet and moderately dry. We focused this study on minerotrophic treeless sedge fens, as they are common peatland types at boreal and (sub)arctic areas, which are expected to face the highest rates of climate warming. In addition, fens are expected to respond to environmental changes faster than the nutrient poor bogs. Our study confirmed that CO2 exchange is more strongly affected by drying than warming. Experimental water level draw-down (WLD) significantly increased gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. Warming alone had insignificant impacts on the CO2 exchange components, but when combined with WLD it further increased ecosystem respiration. In the southern fen, CO2 uptake decreased due to WLD, which was amplified by warming, while at northern fen it remained stable. As a conclusion, our results suggest that a very small difference in the WLD may be decisive, whether the C sink of a fen decreases, or whether the system is able to adapt within its regime and maintain its functions. Moreover, the water table has a role in determining how much the increased temperature impacts the CO2 exchange.

Hydrocarbon extractive activities pose threats to native marine biodiversity, such as noise, light, and chemical pollution, physical changes to the sea floor, invasive species, and greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we assessed at a global scale the spatial overlap between offshore hydrocarbon activities and marine biodiversity (>25,000 species, nine major ecosystems, and marine protected areas), and quantify the changes over time. We discovered that two-thirds of global offshore hydrocarbon activities occur in areas within the top 10% for species richness, range rarity, and proportional range rarity values globally. Thus, while hydrocarbon activities are undertaken in less than one percent of the ocean's area, they overlap with approximately 85% of all assessed species. Of conservation concern, 4% of species with the largest proportion of their range overlapping hydrocarbon activities are range restricted, potentially increasing their vulnerability to localized threats such as oil spills. While hydrocarbon activities have extended to greater depths since the mid-1990s, we found that the largest overlap is with coastal ecosystems, particularly estuaries, saltmarshes and mangroves. Furthermore, in most countries where offshore hydrocarbon exploration licensing blocks have been delineated, they do not overlap with marine protected areas (MPAs). Although this is positive in principle, many countries have far more licensing block areas than protected areas, and in some instances, MPA coverage is minimal. These findings suggest the need for marine spatial prioritization to help limit future spatial overlap between marine conservation priorities and hydrocarbon activities. Such prioritization can be informed by the spatial and quantitative baseline information provided here. In increasingly shared seascapes, prioritizing management actions that set both conservation and development targets could help minimize further declines of biodiversity and environmental changes at a global scale.

For species that are slow growing and poorly dispersed, climate change can force a lag between the distributions of species and the geographic distributions of their climatic envelopes, exposing species to the risk of extinction. Climate also governs the resilience of species and ecosystems to disturbance, such as wildfire. Here we use species distribution modelling and palaeoecology to assess and test the impact of vegetation-climate disequilibrium on the resilience of an endangered fire-sensitive rainforest community to fires. First, we modelled the probability of occurrence of Athrotaxis spp. and Nothofagus gunnii rainforest in Tasmania (hereon "montane rainforest") as a function of climate. We then analysed three pollen and charcoal records spanning the last 7,500 cal year BP from within both high (n = 1) and low (n = 2) probability of occurrence areas. Our study indicates that climatic change between 3,000 and 4,000 cal year bp induced a disequilibrium between montane rainforests and climate that drove a loss of resilience of these communities. Current and future climate change are likely to shift the geographic distribution of the climatic envelopes of this plant community further, suggesting that current high-resilience locations will face a reduction in resilience. Coupled with the forecast of increasing fire activity in southern temperate regions, this heralds a significant threat to this and other slow growing, poorly dispersed and fire sensitive forest systems that are common in the southern mid to high latitudes.

There is empirical evidence that exceptionally dry or wet years have an impact on the net C balance in the Amazon. While seasonal and interannual variations in hydrology have a direct impact on the amounts of C transferred through the river-floodplain system, it is not known how far the variation of these fluxes affects the overall Amazon C balance. Here, we introduce a new wetland forcing file for the ORCHILEAK model, which improves the representation of floodplain dynamics and allows us to closely reproduce data-driven estimates of net C exports through the river-floodplain network. Based on this new wetland forcing and two climate forcing datasets, we show that across the Amazon, the percentage of net primary productivity lost to the river-floodplain system is highly variable at the interannual timescale, and wet years fuel aquatic CO2 evasion. However, at the same time overall net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and C sequestration are highest during wet years, partly due to reduced decomposition rates in water-logged floodplain soils. It is years with the lowest discharge and floodplain inundation, often associated with El Nino events, that have the lowest NEP and the highest total (terrestrial plus aquatic) CO2 emissions back to atmosphere. Furthermore, we find that aquatic C fluxes display greater variation than terrestrial C fluxes, and that this variation significantly dampens the interannual variability in NEP of the Amazon basin. These results call for a more integrative view of the C fluxes through the vegetation-soil-river-floodplain continuum, which directly places aquatic C fluxes into the overall C budget of the Amazon basin.

Extreme heterogeneity of population response to climatic variation and the limits of prediction	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian hierarchical model; climate change; long-term data; monitoring; weather	PHENOLOGICAL RESPONSE; BUTTERFLIES; DIVERSITY; DECLINES; WEATHER; TEMPERATURE; COMMUNITY; INCREASE; SHIFTS	Certain general facets of biotic response to climate change, such as shifts in phenology and geographic distribution, are well characterized; however, it is not clear whether the observed similarity of responses across taxa will extend to variation in other population-level processes. We examined population response to climatic variation using long-term incidence data (collected over 42 years) encompassing 149 butterfly species and considerable habitat diversity (10 sites along an elevational gradient from sea level to over 2,700 m in California). Population responses were characterized by extreme heterogeneity that was not attributable to differences in species composition among sites. These results indicate that habitat heterogeneity might be a buffer against climate change and highlight important questions about mechanisms maintaining interpopulation differences in responses to weather. Despite overall heterogeneity of response, population dynamics were accurately predicted by our model for many species at each site. However, the overall correlation between observed and predicted incidence in a cross validation analysis was moderate (Pearson's r = 0.23, SE 0.01), and 97% of observed data fell within the predicted 95% credible intervals. Prediction was most successful for more abundant species as well as for sites with lower annual turnover. Population-level heterogeneity in response to climate variation and the limits of our predictive power highlight the challenges for a future of increasing climatic variability.

Multifunctionality debt in global drylands linked to past biome and climate	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						arid climate; Last Glacial Maximum; nutrient stocks; nutrient transformation rates; paleoclimate; plant productivity; plant species richness; precipitation	ECOSYSTEM MULTIFUNCTIONALITY; MOJAVE DESERT; PLANT; RECOVERY; CALIFORNIA; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; SOILS; PALEOCLIMATE; BIODIVERSITY	Past vegetation and climatic conditions are known to influence current biodiversity patterns. However, whether their legacy effects affect the provision of multiple ecosystem functions, that is, multifunctionality, remains largely unknown. Here we analyzed soil nutrient stocks and their transformation rates in 236 drylands from six continents to evaluate the associations between current levels of multifunctionality and legacy effects of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) desert biome distribution and climate. We found that past desert distribution and temperature legacy, defined as increasing temperature from LGM, were negatively correlated with contemporary multifunctionality even after accounting for predictors such as current climate, soil texture, plant species richness, and site topography. Ecosystems that have been deserts since the LGM had up to 30% lower contemporary multifunctionality compared with those that were nondeserts during the LGM. In addition, ecosystems that experienced higher warming rates since the LGM had lower contemporary multifunctionality than those suffering lower warming rates, with a similar to 9% reduction per extra degree Celsius. Past desert distribution and temperature legacies had direct negative effects, while temperature legacy also had indirect (via soil sand content) negative effects on multifunctionality. Our results indicate that past biome and climatic conditions have left a strong "functionality debt" in global drylands. They also suggest that ongoing warming and expansion of desert areas may leave a strong fingerprint in the future functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide that needs to be considered when establishing management actions aiming to combat land degradation and desertification.

The potential of large rafting objects to spread Lessepsian invaders: the case of a detached buoy	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Anthropogenic debris; Rafting; Non-indigenous species; Introduction vectors; Fouling; Mediterranean Sea	PROPAGULE PRESSURE; INVASIONS; DISPERSAL; LITTER; ESTABLISHMENT; MANAGEMENT; FACILITATE; MOLLUSKS; ECOLOGY	A diverse and abundant fouling community dominated by Lessepsian non-indigenous species was identified on a 13.5-m-long steel buoy stranded on the Israeli coast but originating from Port Said, at the Mediterranean entrance of the Suez Canal, Egypt. The molluscan community was sampled quantitatively by scraping. Three quarters of the individuals and more than half of the species were non-indigenous. Among the latter, a mytilid bivalve, Gregariella cf. ehrenbergi, was first recorded in the Mediterranean Sea on the basis of these samples, suggesting that the full consideration of all potential vectors can contribute to non-indigenous species detection. Large floating objects in coastal waters, such as buoys, are particularly suitable for colonization by Lessepsian species because hard substrates, and artificial ones in particular, are highly susceptible to the establishment of non-indigenous species. Moreover, their size and persistence enable the development of abundant and mature fouling communities that can disseminate propagules as eggs and larvae over long distances and for extended periods if detached. This report highlights the potential for large rafting debris as a vector of the spread of non-indigenous biota within the Mediterranean Sea.

All change at the water's edge: invasion by non-native riparian plants negatively impacts terrestrial invertebrates	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Diversity; Fallopia japonica; Impatiens glandulifera; Invasive species; Morphospecies	IMPATIENS-GLANDULIFERA; SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; NATIVE PLANT; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEMS; BIOINDICATORS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; DISTURBANCE	Riparian zones are complex, dynamic habitats that play a critical role in river ecosystem functioning. Terrestrial invertebrates comprise much of the diversity found in riparian habitats and facilitate the transfer of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems. However, the consequences for terrestrial invertebrates of invasion of riparian zones by invasive non-native plants (INNP) remain poorly understood. Responses of terrestrial macroinvertebrate morphospecies to invasion by two common INNP, Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) were assessed, relative to local environmental factors. Terrestrial invertebrates were collected from 20 sites on low order streams in June and August alongside data on physical attributes and land use. Greater cover of F. japonica and I. glandulifera cover reduced total invertebrate abundance and morphospecies diversity at the individual sample scale, whilst increasing spatial heterogeneity of invertebrates at the site scale. Impatiens glandulifera reduced morphospecies diversity at the site scale with increasing cover, but this was not observed for F. japonica. INNP affected terrestrial invertebrate morphospecies abundance and diversity, to a greater extent than prevailing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore offer support for managing riparian plant invasions to improve habitat heterogeneity, restore terrestrial invertebrate diversity and repair aquatic-terrestrial linkages.

Seeding native species increases resistance to annual grass invasion following prescribed burning of semiarid woodlands	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Biological invasions; Great Basin; Prescribed fire; Resistance to invasion; Restoration; Semiarid woodlands	GREAT-BASIN; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; POSTFIRE RECOVERY; FIRE VARIES; VEGETATION; DOMINANCE; NITROGEN; CLIMATE; DESERT	Exotic grass invasions are often facilitated by disturbances, which provide opportunities for invasion by releasing pulses of resources available to invaders. Where disturbances such as prescribed fire are used as a management tool, there is a pressing need to identify ecosystem attributes associated with susceptibility to disturbance-induced invasion. In the Great Basin of the western United States, expansion of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum is transforming native ecosystems. In this study we examined long-term understory plant community responses to experimental prescribed fire and post-fire seeding treatments in Great Basin pinyon-juniper woodlands. We asked (1) how long-term ecosystem resistance to fire-induced B. tectorum invasion varies along major abiotic and biotic gradients, and (2) whether post-fire seeding of perennial species promotes perennial plant establishment and increases resistance to invasion. Fourteen years after burning, we found that resistance to invasion was high on relatively cool and moist sites (higher elevation), but that the warmer and drier (low- to mid-elevation) burned sites had become heavily invaded by B. tectorum. Post-fire B. tectorum dominance was highest in sites with high pre-fire tree cover, where residual and newly established native perennial plant cover was limited following fire. We found that seeding perennial species after burning decreased invasibility in sites with low resistance. Seeding a mix of native perennial shrubs, forbs, and grasses was more effective at increasing perennial cover and inhibiting B. tectorum invasion than seeding a mix of non-native perennial grasses. Our results highlight the need for long-term studies to evaluate plant community responses to prescribed fire, as important treatment differences were not captured in a shorter (3-4year) post-fire monitoring period.

Investigating the invasiveness of Eucalyptus globulus in Portugal: site-scale drivers, reproductive capacity and dispersal potential	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Blue gum; Dispersal distance; Eucalypt invasion; Invasive alien species; Natural establishment; Naturalisation	WILDLING ESTABLISHMENT; SEEDLING RECRUITMENT; GENETIC-CONTROL; PLANT; REGENERATION; GROWTH; TREES; PLANTATIONS; POPULATIONS; ATTRIBUTES	Plantations of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. have expanded rapidly over the last four decades across temperate parts of the globe. There has been growing concern about the potential invasiveness of this species. Portugal grows more E. globulus than any other country (by area). This study investigates poorly understood factors that may influence wilding establishment and spread from Portuguese plantations. We assessed: site-scale factors influencing the presence and abundance of E. globulus wildlings along plantation edges, as well as the size and reproductive state of these wildlings; and the dispersal distances and developmental state of wildlings away from the plantations edge. We found 1630 E. globulus wildlings in 129 survey plots (10x10m) established along the edge of 67 plantations. Half of the surveyed wildlings were taller than 1.3m. The presence and abundance of E. globulus wildlings was mainly influenced by factors such as soil cover, the age of mother-trees and their reproductive output. Around 8% of the surveyed wildlings were reproductive, including wildlings less than 1.3m tall. The proportion of reproductive wildlings was mainly influenced by wildling size, the location relative to the plantation edge and the annual number of frost days. In 49 survey transects outside plantations we found 641 E. globulus wildlings up to a distance of 76m. Establishment distance was associated with natural drainage lines and the dominant wind direction. We discuss the relevance of the results in terms of the potential invasiveness of E. globulus.

We investigated the effect of biological invasion by Acacia mangium and A. auriculiformis, disturbance promoted by fire and Eucalyptus management, as well as land-use change around Mussununga patches in this neglected ecosystem. Acacia occurrence is negatively related to abundance, basal area, and height of native woody species, and positively correlated with the proportion of dead woody plants. There is a trend of change in vegetation type from open savanna to woodland Mussununga promoted by Acacia. Mussununga patches disturbed by the planting of Eucalyptus species in the past have greater richness in the woody layer (large shrubs and trees), but lower abundance of species in the ground layer (small shrubs and herbs). The land-use change from forest to Eucalyptus plantation was associated with an increase of richness and abundance in the ground layer. Acacia tends to dominate the woody community in Mussununga by invading treeless patches, presenting a correlation with death of woody plants. Subsequently, Acacia promotes several changes that culminate in a height increment and change of the vegetation type. Different from Acacia, disturbance and land-use change associated with Eucalyptus, the main economic activity in the study area, affected both woody and ground layers. The conservation of Mussununga should include actions to preclude disturbance and land-use change, as well as monitoring and control of biological invasion.

Assessing the utility of aerial imagery to quantify the density, age structure and spatial pattern of alien conifer invasions	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Exotic; Non-native; Orthophotography; Size threshold; Spatial patterns; Wilding pine	TREE-CROWN DELINEATION; PINE PINUS-CONTORTA; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; CANOPY COVER; PLANT; SPREAD; DYNAMICS; POPULATION; ACCURACY; CLASSIFICATIONS	Effective detection and monitoring tools are essential to manage the major ecological and economic problems posed by alien conifer invasions. Low-cost aerial imagery has been promoted as a promising tool for the detection of alien trees over large landscapes, but as yet there have been few attempts to assess its reliability for monitoring invasions. In particular, studies have not yet examined how well aerial imagery can detect densities of trees across invasions. To evaluate this, we used freely available, high-resolution aerial imagery to examine how age structure, spatial patterns and density of alien conifers varied across an invasion front. Overall, we were able to detect both the spatial pattern and distribution of trees with canopy diameters greater than 2.5m, but we could only detect smaller trees with certainty where they were found at low density. These results point to aerial imagery being suitable for detecting trees at the edge of the invasion front, where they are often small and at low density. While assessments of the overall age-structure will underestimate the number of small trees, the number and spatial pattern of larger reproductive individuals can still be adequately captured. Thus low-cost aerial imagery can inform managers of where best to target control efforts at the invasion edge and also the location of large reproductive trees that are likely to contribute to future population expansion.

Invasive coqui frogs are associated with differences in mongoose and rat abundances and diets in Hawaii	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Eleutherodactylus coqui; Herpestes auropunctatus; Island Rattus spp; Nest predation; Scavenger; Trophic interactions	ELEUTHERODACTYLUS-COQUI; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; FOREST BIRDS; ISLAND; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; COMPETITION; PREDATION; MELTDOWN; AVIFAUNA	With the increasing rate of species being introduced to areas outside of their native ranges, non-natives are likely to interact in ways that influence each other's populations. The high densities of invasive coqui frogs (Eleutherodactylus coqui) in Hawaii have been hypothesized to increase non-native mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) and rat (Rattus spp.) abundances, and in turn increase bird nest depredation rates. We compared the relative abundances of rats and mongooses and artificial bird nest predation rates at 12 sites that had plots with similar habitat invaded and not invaded by coqui frogs across the island of Hawaii. We interpret our results considering mongoose and rat stomach analyses and camera trap data collected to monitor coqui scavengers. We found that coqui presence was associated with 30% greater mongoose abundance and 17% lower Pacific rat (R. exulans) abundance. Based on our diet analyses and scavenging data, both mongooses and rats consume coquis, but mongooses were the most important consumers of coquis, which may have contributed to their increase in coqui plots. We speculate that coquis are competing with rats for invertebrate prey due to reduced Pacific rat abundance and greater amounts of fruit in rat stomachs collected in coqui-invaded compared to uninvaded plots. We did not observe any difference in birdnest predation rates in coqui-invaded and uninvaded plots. Our results suggest that the coqui invasion may increase or decrease non-native mammal populations, and non-native amphibians may serve as both novel prey and competitors to non-native mammals.

Proximal VIS-NIR spectrometry to retrieve substance concentrations in surface waters using partial least squares modelling	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						hyperspectral; partial least squares; proximal sensing; reservoir; suspended solids; water quality	IN-SITU; CALIBRATION; REGRESSION; TOOL	Many water quality parameters such as concentrations of suspended matter, nutrients and algae directly or indirectly change the electromagnetic reflectance and transmission properties of surface water bodies. Optical measurement approaches have shown great potential to partially substitute water sampling and laboratory analyses, but are obstructed by limited flexibility or high maintenance demands. In order to overcome these problems and to bridge the gap between in situ and remote sensing measurements, the use of close-range, above-surface reflectance measurements in the VIS-NIR domain to measure water quality parameters in surface water bodies was investigated. Remote sensing reflectance in a 1 m(3) water tank with increasing, known concentrations of suspended solids was measured. A partial least squares model was trained to predict concentrations from reflectance curves, which performed well, considering the wide range of concentrations and illumination conditions (R-cal(2) = 0.96, R-val(2) = 0.97). The approach was then transferred to the field and further parameters were tested. Using a semi-autonomous spectrometer mounted to a boom stand on a motor boat, we traced substance concentrations in close intervals along a longitudinal gradient from inflow to dam in a drinking water reservoir in Brazil. The method is suitable for parameters directly influencing the reflection properties of the water body (e.g. suspended solids (R-cal(2) = 0.93), chlorophyll-a (R-cal(2) = 0.74)), or for parameters closely related to those (e.g. total phosphorus (R-cal(2) = 0.97)). For chemical oxygen demand, the method is not well suited (R-cal(2) = 0.14,R-val(2) = 0.45). Once calibrated to the local conditions, the spectrometer can be used stationary or on moving platforms to map and monitor surface waters. The integration of the procedure into acoustic and imaging techniques is further investigated.

Assessment of apparent losses due to meter inaccuracy using an alternative, validated methodology	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						apparent losses; data mining; metering errors; non-revenue water (NRW); water loss management		Despite wide acceptance of the IWA water balance as the basis of managing water losses, experience suggests that there are difficulties with its application. For apparent losses assessment, the traditional approach of deriving consumption profiles and testing water meters exceeds the resources of many utilities. While a few studies have explored alternative methodologies, these have largely not been validated and are susceptible to reproducibility and interpretation difficulties. This paper introduces an improved comparative billing analysis method that combines data preparation techniques, clustering analysis and classical regression analysis on monthly billing data of a water utility in Johannesburg, South Africa. Using the method, an average estimate of apparent losses due to metering errors of 8.2% was found against the best-case scenario of 9.4% using field investigations and laboratory tests, which also measure meter under-registration that the proposed methodology does not cater for. The validated results were possible at a fraction of the cost and effort, while also providing better insight into the underlying consumption patterns. The results show that data-driven discovery processes are viable alternatives for improved assessment and management of water losses.

We determined I-127 concentrations (as a surrogate for( 129)I) in a series of French forest soils (i.e. litters, humus and mineral soils) under different vegetation and climate conditions in order to identify the major processes affecting its accumulation and persistence in the soil column. The input fluxes linked to rainfall, throughfall and litterfall were also characterized. Main results obtained showed that: (i) rainfall iodine concentrations probably influenced those of litterfall through absorption by leaves/needles returning to the ground; (ii) throughfall was the major iodine input to soils (mean = 83%), compared to litterfall (mean = 17%); (iii) humus represented a temporary storage of iodine from atmospheric and biomass deposits; (iv) iodine concentrations in soils depended on both the iodine inputs and the soil's ability to retain iodine due to its organic matter, total iron and aluminium concentrations; (v) these soil properties were the main factors influencing the accumulation of iodine in the soil column, resulting in residence times of 419-1756 years; and (vi) the leaching of iodine-containing organic matter dissolved in soil solution may be an important source of labile organic iodine for groundwater and streams.

However, the impact of these insecticides on this bee has not been fully investigated. This study assessed the susceptibility levels of T. angustula to four neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam), widely used to manage pests on different crops, and their effects on locomotion of the bee. Neonicotinoids with the cyano radical caused lower bee mortality (assessed by mean lethal concentration, LC50), while those compounds with the nitro radical were highly harmful to T. angustula. Locomotion activity was strongly impaired in bees treated with thiacloprid and imidacloprid, while acetamiprid did not affect the locomotion activity, which was similar to the control. Application of thiamethoxam caused hyperactivity, as observed by increases of similar to 4.5 and 5.0-fold in mean speed and distance traveled, respectively. These results suggest that applications of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the pollination activity of T. angustula. These results can also help to develop strategies to conserve these pollinators in agroecosystems. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As honeybee colonies can be frequently exposed to bio-aggressors in real conditions, often concomitantly with pesticides, co-exposure to pesticidei/bio-aggressors is becoming a concern for regulatory authorities. We investigated the effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the homing performances of foragers emerging from colonies differentiated by health status (infestation with Varroa destructor mites, microsporidian parasite Nosema spp. and Deformed Wing Virus). We designed a homing test that has been recently identified to fill a regulatory gap in the field evaluations of sublethal doses of pesticides before their registration. We also assessed the effect of temperature as an environmental factor. Our results showed that the Varroa mite exacerbates homing failure (HF) caused by the insecticide, whereas high temperatures reduce insecticide-induced HF. Through an analytical Effective Dose (ED) approach, predictive modeling results showed that, for instance, ED level of an uninfested colony, can be divided by 3.3 when the colony is infested by 5 Varroa mites per 100 bees and at a temperature of 24 degrees C. Our results suggest that the health status of honeybee colonies and climatic context should be targeted for a thorough risk assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fourteen PaPs and 9 IDs were detected in the water samples with venlafaxine (59%), benzoylecgonine (40%), EDDP (40%), and citalopram (36%) showing the highest detection frequencies. The highest concentrations were measured for venlafaxine (291 ng L-1), benzoylecgonine (142 ng L-1), lorazepam (95.9 ng L-1), and citalopram (92.5 ng L-1). Risk assessment, based on hazard quotients suggested that venlafaxine, citalopram, sertraline, and EDDP were present in concentrations potentially able to cause chronic effects in exposed organisms. Based on the results obtained further monitoring of venlafaxine, citalopram, and EDDP in coastal waters is recommended. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of single and combined exposure to nano and bulk zinc-oxide and propiconazole on Enchytraeus albidus	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Propiconazole; Bulk ZnO; Nano ZnO; Oxidative stress; Reproduction; Enchytraeus albidus	EARTHWORM EISENIA-FOETIDA; COMPARATIVE TOXICITY; JOINT TOXICITY; CADMIUM; NANOPARTICLES; STRESS; ANTIOXIDANT; RESPONSES; ATRAZINE; ZNO	Organisms in soil are often exposed to different mixtures of contaminants. These contaminants may interact with each other and, consequently, may have a different effect on organisms than each of them alone. We wanted to investigate possible effects of ZnO mixtures in bulk and nano form and fungicide propiconazole (PCZ) on biochemical parameters and reproduction in Enchytreus albidus. These compounds were applied separately and in binary mixture. In the single exposure experiment the EC50 values for the number of juveniles were calculated: nano ZnO (641.21 +/- 88.82 mg k g(-1)), bulk ZnO (445.78 +/- 148.4 mg kg(-1)) and PCZ (3.63 +/- 1.68 mg kg(-1)), respectively. These concentrations were subsequently used in the binary exposure experiment. Calculated combination indices (CI), that allow quantitative determination of chemical interactions at different concentration and effect level, indicated additive or antagonistic interactions (CI >= 1) of applied mixture ratios. The only ratio that showed synergistic interaction (CI < 1) was 75% EC50 nZnO/25% EC50 PCZ. Both ZnO forms caused acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increase of up to 40% of control level, as well as increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) level. PCZ did not affect AChE and CAT activities, yet it increased GST activity and MDA level. Induced levels of measured biomarkers indicate an oxidative stress after binary exposure, as well. These effects were not enhanced after binary exposure but reflected the effects on biomarkers that corresponding concentrations of these compounds generated in a single exposure experiment.

Understanding the biophysical controls of the surface nitrogen exchange is essential for the parameterization of process-based and chemical transport models that can be used for the determination of regional or national nitrogen budgets. In this study, we investigated similarities in time series of net total reactive nitrogen (Sigma N-r) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes above forest with regard to their variability and driving factors. We found corresponding shapes of the mean diurnal summertime patterns of Sigma N-r, and CO2. While ecosystem respiration leads to a net CO2 release at night, Sigma N-r, was on average deposited throughout the entire observation period. Using artificial neural network analysis, global radiation (R-g) was identified to be the main control for both Sigma N-r, and CO2. While the concentration of Sigma N-r, substantially improved the coefficient of determination for IN, fluxes when used as a secondary driver, only minor improvements of 2-3% were found for CO2 fluxes when using for example temperature or vapour pressure deficit (VPD) as secondary driver. Considering two dominant drivers, 41 and 66% of the variability in Sigma N-r, and CO2 fluxes, respectively, could be explained. Further data stratification for Sigma N-r revealed that higher concentrations, higher temperature, and higher VPD as well as dry leaf surfaces tend to favour higher deposition of Sigma N-r,N- whereas lower concentrations, lower temperature, and lower VPD as well as wet leaf surfaces mainly correspond to situations when less Sigma N-r, was deposited or even emitted. Our results support the understanding of biosphere-atmosphere interactions, their driving factors, and establish a link between Sigma N-r, and CO2 exchange, which may be beneficial for future developments in state-of-the-art exchange modelling.

Restoration Affects Sexual Reproductive Capacity in a Salt Marsh	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Salt marsh; Spartina alterniflora; Sediment amendment restoration; Sexual reproduction; Seed germination; Flower phenology	CORDGRASS SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; CHESAPEAKE BAY; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SEED PRODUCTION; PLANT; INVASION; TIME; AVAILABILITY; GERMINATION	Plant sexual reproduction is an important driver of plant community maintenance, dispersal, and recovery from disturbance. Despite this, sexual reproduction in habitats dominated by clonally spreading perennial species, such as salt marshes, is often ignored. Communities dominated by long-lived perennial species can still depend on sexual reproduction for recolonizing large disturbed patches or for establishing in new patches, such as restored sites. We investigated the influence of restoration and elevation on flowering phenology, potential seed and seedling production, and insect flower damage of the dominant salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, in reference and restored marshes in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We additionally tested whether elevation gradients or soil parameters could explain differences in sexual reproduction between sites. We demonstrate that sediment-slurry amendment restoration may not affect flowering phenology or insect flower damage at ecologically relevant levels, but that restoration activity increases sexual reproductive output at the patch scale. Restoration activity affected reproductive dynamics more often than changes in elevation alone. Restoration of subsiding salt marsh habitat by altering the soil environment may increase sexual reproductive capacity of these wetlands.

Seasonal, Interannual, and Longitudinal Patterns in Estuarine Metabolism Derived from Diel Oxygen Data Using Multiple Computational Approaches	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Production; Respiration; Metabolism; Bayesian; Chesapeake Bay	NET ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM; ORGANIC-CARBON BALANCE; GAS-EXCHANGE; FRESH-WATER; RIVER; RESPIRATION; LAKES; HETEROTROPHY; DYNAMICS; DELAWARE	Twenty-three station-years of diel oxygen data for the James River Estuary were analyzed to characterize longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual patterns of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). We compared two commonly used methods for deriving metabolism (bookkeeping and Bayesian) to determine whether the observed patterns were robust with respect to computational methodology. The two methods revealed similar longitudinal patterns of increasing GPP and ER, and decreasing net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), with increasing salinity. Seasonal patterns in GPP and ER tracked water temperature and solar radiation, except during high discharge events when metabolism declined by 40%. The bookkeeping method yielded higher estimates of GPP and ER in the higher end of the range, and smaller estimates in the low end of the range, thereby accentuating seasonal and longitudinal differences. Inferences regarding net autotrophy and heterotrophy were robust, as both methods yielded positive estimates of NEM at the chlorophyll maximum (tidal fresh segment) and negative values for the saline portion of the estuary. Inferences regarding the relative importance of allochthonous inputs (based on inferred ER at GPP=0) differed between the two methods. Values derived by the bookkeeping method indicated that respiration was largely supported by autochthonous production, whereas the Bayesian results indicated that autochthonous and allochthonous inputs were equally important. Overall, our findings show that methodological differences were small in the context of longitudinal, seasonal, and interannual variation but that the bookkeeping method yielded a wider range of values for GPP and ER relative to the Bayesian estimates.

Germination Traits Explain Deterministic Processes in the Assembly of Early Successional Coastal Dune Vegetation	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Community ecology; Coastal vegetation; Germination; Regeneration niche; Succession	PLANT-COMMUNITIES; BIOLOGICAL FLORA; ECOLOGY; WETLANDS	The sand dunes found on coastal shores and barrier islands along the Northern Gulf of Mexico are important for protecting inland areas from wind and wave action, especially from tropical storms and hurricanes. The geomorphology of the dunes interacts with the plant community to create this dynamic coastal ecosystem. This study explored the processes that shape the foredunes, the youngest set of dunes where sediments are deposited by winds blowing up from the beach. These sands are thought to be slowed or trapped by early successional vegetation, leading to dune creation and growth. Our results suggest that the vegetative community is strongly associated with distance from the shore, where abiotic conditions are harshest closest to the ocean and gradually reduced moving toward the interior of the island. This deterministic community pattern appears to be maintained by the vegetation's ability to regenerate through time, especially in response to disturbances after heavy wind and wave action. A multifactorial germination experiment revealed strong differences among the germination rates of different species and the effects of salinity on species-specific germination rates. High rates of germination might be beneficial in colonizing open habitats following storms, where high salinity conditions are especially present. Understanding the patterns that shape vegetative community diversity should help guide restoration management in coastal dune systems and shed light on the importance of individual species and their function within the coastal ecosystem.

Effects of Spartina Wrack on Surface-Active Arthropod Assemblage Under Different Environmental Contexts in Southwest Atlantic Salt Marshes	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Salt marsh; Wrack disturbance; Surface-active arthropod assemblage; Environmental context	NEW-ENGLAND; INVASIVE CORDGRASS; SANDY BEACHES; ALGAL WRACK; DETRITUS; DECOMPOSITION; ASSOCIATIONS; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; DEPOSITS	Large amounts of tidally accumulated detritus (i.e., wrack) are an important source of disturbance affecting different abiotic and biotic characteristics in salt marshes, which could in turn affect the macrofauna assemblage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of wrack disturbance in Southwest Atlantic (SWA) salt marshes and its effects on the surface-active arthropod assemblage under different environmental contexts. By sampling the most important SWA salt marshes (from 36 degrees 19 S to 41 degrees 01 S), we found that wrack is a widespread disturbance in this region, present in all the salt marshes and periods sampled. However, the biomass and type of wrack (Spartina alterniflora vs. S. densiflora) vary according to the species that dominates each salt marsh. At two of these sites (Bahia Blanca (BB), 38 degrees 59 S and San Clemente (SC), 36 degrees 19 S), chosen because they represent the two salt marsh types in the SWA region (dominated by Spartina alterniflora or S. densiflora), we performed a field experiment by manipulating the presence and absence of wrack and conducting field samplings of sediment organic matter content and water content. We found that wrack affects surface arthropod assemblage but that this effect was not consistent for the different salt marshes: in BB, it changed the surface-active arthropod assemblage (shifted towards more detritivorous taxa) and increased the number of total individuals but had no effect on the number of species or diversity. At SC, wrack had no effect on any of the parameters evaluated. We suggest that the type of wrack in each salt marsh modulates the amount of organic matter content in the sediment: BB had wrack of better nutritional quality (dominated by S. alterniflora) and in turn had greater organic matter content in the sediment of wrack zones than in no-wrack zones, while in SC (dominated by S. densiflora), there is no differences between the two zones. We also suggest that depending on the original surface-active arthropod assemblage, those modifications will either favor (BB) or not favor (SC) wrack colonization by the surface-active arthropod assemblage. Moreover, considering that SWA wrack has different compositions and that the biomass differs among the different salt marshes, we expect wrack effects in the SWA, and probably in other regions, to be site-specific.

Within this transition environment, we investigated the coexistence of two brachyuran species with different habitat preferences, i.e. marine and freshwater by quantifying niche overlap. The aim was to determine whether shifting environmental pressures or variability within the stromatolite pools (i.e. regular state shifts between marine and freshwater conditions) would invoke a dietary response or competitive interaction between these two species that are usually separated by their habitat tolerances. It was hypothesised that there would be little overlap between the two species but that this overlap would be greater in winter compared to summer due to reduced ectothermic activity. Stable isotope niche analysis revealed no dietary overlap between the two species at any site or in either season (summer or winter). Furthermore, isotope signatures suggest that both species feed on resources from their respective microhabitats. Despite the usual tendency of ecotone or edge populations to adopt a generalist diet, both species were able to remain habitat specialists, likely due to their highly mobile nature and access to suitable microhabitats within this dynamic freshwater/marine ecotone. This study is important from an environmental change perspective as it supports the hypothesis that populations occupying transitional environments such as these might be more tolerant of habitat shifts than their counterparts dwelling in more stable localities, and thus these populations are more likely to coexist.

With increased demands placed on freshwater resources and extreme drought conditions becoming prevalent for many coastal regions, it is important to understand how these changes may impact the extent and distribution of suitable habitat for species that rely on the passage of freshwater to the coastal region. Here, habitat suitability models were constructed for three estuarine species (Farfantepenaeus aztecus, Micropogonias undulatus, and Cynoscion nebulosus) across three estuary classes (based on freshwater balance: positive, neutral, and negative estuaries) and for three simulated salinity regimes (low, moderate, and high salinities). The impact of changing salinity regimes on habitat suitability varied most notably at the species level but also varied significantly across the three estuary types examined. Of the three species examined, F. aztecus showed relatively little salinity-related variation in habitat extent or distribution. Variation in M. undulatus and C. nebulosus salinity impact was especially clear in relatively neutral and positive estuaries where distribution of habitat within the estuary under the varying salinity regimes followed intra-estuarine salinity gradients to match salinity preference for each species and typically resulted in a gradual shrinking of highly suitable habitat area into the far upper estuary as salinities increased. While salinity was not found to be the only or even the most impactful of variables regarding habitat suitability, model outputs show that at the estuary scale, salinity can have substantial influence on the spatial extent and distribution of suitable habitat and this influence is not constant across estuary types. Modeling exercises such as this are the first step in communicating such impacts and focusing the vigilance of resource managers towards vulnerable species and habitat regions.

To assess those effects, we simulated the expansion of the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) in relation to landscape resistance through kernel resistance modeling, confronting it with previously published data regarding the observed pattern of expansion and genetic diversity of the population in Portugal. We modeled population expansion as a function of shrub cover and elevation through iterative simulation of a resistance model and a null model. We then performed an overlap analysis to assess the congruence between the observed pattern of expansion and both resistance and null models across 30years. We also tested whether there is an effect of allelic surfing or the central-marginal hypothesis by correlating observed allelic richness (1) with the number of simulated years that each location with sampled genotypes had been occupied by the mongoose population and (2) with the cumulative resistant kernel density (which is a measure of population centrality). Results indicated a higher similarity between observed range expansion and the simulation using the null model and a marginally significant correlation between observed allelic richness and number of years of the simulated presence of the species in the null model. The pattern of range expansion in this population is most consistent with a neutral model of uniform resistance, and genetic diversity is most correlated with null model as well. This suggests that range expansion and genetic diversity patterns in expanding populations may not always be predicted by landscape resistance models developed through association of observed genetic differentiation with landscape features.

Feeding preferences in dry season of the Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus) in two sites of Corsica	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Italian hare; Feeding preferences; Diet	DIET SELECTION; BROWN HARE; TIMIDUS HIBERNICUS; HERBIVORE; EUROPAEUS; JACKRABBIT; RANGE; FOOD; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATION	In this research, the diet composition and feeding selection of the Italian hare were evaluated and compared in two sites of Haute-Corse region localised in the territories of Tallone and Aleria. The present study is the first considering feeding selection of Lepus corsicanus. The considered period ranged from June to October. Quadrat method was used to assess plant frequency, while diet composition was determined by microhistological analysis of faecal pellets collected monthly. Grasses represented the basis of the diet, with frequencies around 50% in both study areas, followed by non-leguminous forbs with an incidence of 29% in Aleria and over 31% in Tallone. Leguminous forbs and shrubs complemented its diet. Poaceae resulted to be the most preferred and selected family in the diet in both sites. In the diet, we observed 79 species, but only a few of them were in percentages greater than 5%. The most utilised species in the diet were Brachypodium sylvaticum, Briza maxima, and Trifolium angustifolium in Aleria and Digitaria sanguinalis, Briza maxima, and Daucus carota in Tallone. Our study evidenced that in the considered areas, characterised also in the dry period by wide plant diversity, the Italian hare behaved as generalist. Significant differences in the diet composition and in the diversity index between the two sites showed the adaptability of the Italian hare to different habitats and the influence of the vegetation on feeding habits of the species.

Comparison of acoustic and traditional point count methods to assess bird diversity and composition in the Aberdare National Park, Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						bioacoustics; bird survey; habitat heterogeneity; Kenya; species richness; survey techniques	SPECIES RICHNESS; FOREST; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; HABITAT; EXTRAPOLATION; RAREFACTION; RECORDINGS; CLIMATE; UTILITY	Afromontane forests, like those in the Aberdare National Park (ANP) in Kenya, sustain unique avifaunal assemblages. There is a growing need for biodiversity inventories for Afromontane forests, especially through the utilisation of unskilled observers. Acoustic surveys are a potential aid to this, but more comparisons of this technique with that of traditional point counts are needed. We conducted a systematic survey of the ANP avifauna, assessing whether acoustic and traditional surveys resulted in different species richness scores, and whether this varied with habitat and species characteristics. We also investigated the role of habitat and elevation in driving variation in species richness. The ANP provides habitat types including scrub, moorland, montane, hagenia and bamboo forests. Overall, the surveys yielded 101 identified species. The acoustic method resulted in higher species richness scores compared to the traditional method across all habitats, and the relative performance of the two methods did not vary with habitat type or visibility. The methods detected different species, suggesting that they should be used together to maximise the range of species recorded. We found that habitat type was the primary driver of variation in species richness, with scrub and montane forest having higher species richness scores than other habitats.

Primates create seedling growth hotspots through pattern of dung deposition	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						fertiliser; Kibale National Park; nutrient; Piliocolobus tephrosceles; primate; red colobus; Uganda	KIBALE NATIONAL-PARK; WOOLLY MONKEYS; FOREST; ELEPHANTS; DISPERSAL; DYNAMICS; EVOLUTIONARY; CHIMPANZEES; SPIDER; AVAILABILITY	Primates play important roles in tropical forests through seed dispersal and herbivory. They comprise a large part of the biomass of forest communities and tend to have clumped patterns of defecations (i.e. at favoured food trees or sleeping sites). Therefore, they may also play important roles in accelerating ecosystem nutrient cycling. Here we conduct a controlled growth experiment to quantify the effect of the addition of primate dung on the growth of both light-demanding and shade-tolerant seedlings over 1 year in Kibale National Park, Uganda. A mixed model analysis revealed that light-demanding species were affected by the natural dung treatment and plants with small initial size had accelerated growth, whereas there was no effect on plant growth for shade-tolerant species. The long-term implications of increased dung deposition on the local tree community are unclear as shade-tolerant species may only show an effect over the long-term and light-demanding species may only be able to take advantage of the increased growth if subsequently exposed to high light conditions, such as a treefall gap.

This is problematic because an ecological approach that considers species distribution is required to delineate meaningful management units. To do so, vegetation types can be used as management units-however, it is uncertain whether vertebrate communities are associated with vegetation types as defined by the national vegetation map. Here, we investigate mammal diversity patterns within and among biomes (savannah and grassland) and bioregions and test whether different mammal communities were associated with different vegetation types. We used an extensive database of species occurrences in the North West Province. We found that species richness was higher in the savannah than grassland biome. Beta diversity was higher within the savannah than grassland biome, due to greater environmental heterogeneity, though one grassland bioregion was similar to the savannah bioregions. Mammal communities were significantly different among bioregions, but not biomes, suggesting mammal communities are congruent with vegetation type at finer scales (i.e. bioregional), but not at coarser scales (biomes). It thus makes sense to use a bioregional framework to design mammal management strategies. The invasion of grasslands by savannah species should be monitored, specifically given the predicted changes in climate.

However, few studies have reported elevational patterns for arid mountains. We studied elevation-richness pattern along an elevational gradient at the arid mountain Gebel Elba, south-east of Egypt, expecting a unimodal richness pattern. We sampled 133 vegetation plots (10 x 10 m) in four wadis along an elevational gradient from 130 to 680 m which represents the transition from desert to mountain wadi systems. We used generalised additive models to describe the relationship between elevation and plant species richness. We found a strong increase in species richness and Shannon diversity at low elevations followed by a plateau at mid- to high elevations. When we analysed each tributary as a single gradient, no pattern was found. The analysed elevational gradient seems to be a major stress gradient in terms of temperature and water availability, exhibiting a trend of increasing species richness that changes to a plateau pattern; a pattern rarely observed for wadi systems in arid mountains. We discuss the observed pattern with the climatic stress hypothesis and the environmental heterogeneity hypothesis as possible explanations for the pattern.
