Here, we test this ecoregion approach studying the semi-aquatic insect group Odonata in five of these regions, aiming at comparing the ecoregions to the more traditional environmental predictors of water quality and land cover. Based on a data set of occupancy comprising 99 species distributed between 131 localities, a one-way Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance was used to compare differences in the species composition between the ecoregions, followed by a Principal Component Analysis to visualize the variation. The composition varied significantly between all groups tested, and the ordination explained 61.8% of the variance. A partial redundancy analysis of ecoregions, land cover and water quality variables explained 71% of the variance in Odonata community structure. Ecoregion was the most important predictor, followed by water quality and land cover. Within these species assemblies, we could select certain species that were representative of a given ecoregion, to which their distribution within the Pampa biome was entirely or mainly confined. Of 24 representative species 41.7% were rare, while the rest were more abundant and, hence, easier to detect. We suspect that the differences found between the Pampa ecoregions might be due to geology, as such factors may be strong determinants of biodiversity. Specific ecological requirements at the family and genus levels also seemed to act selectively on the species compositions within the ecoregions. Today, the Pampa is highly fragmented due to agricultural activities such as rice cultivation, extensive cattle farming and forest plantations. We suggest that an ecoregion-based approach to the implementation of conservation measures may be the best way to help these distinct species assemblies survive.

Accuracy of identifications of mammal species from camera trap images: A northern Australian case study	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						camera trap; northern Australia; small mammal; species identification; wildlife survey	CONSERVATION	Camera traps are a powerful and increasingly popular tool for mammal research, but like all survey methods, they have limitations. Identifying animal species from images is a critical component of camera trap studies, yet while researchers recognize constraints with experimental design or camera technology, image misidentification is still not well understood. We evaluated the effects of a species' attributes (body mass and distinctiveness) and individual observer variables (experience and confidence) on the accuracy of mammal identifications from camera trap images. We conducted an Internet-based survey containing 20 questions about observer experience and 60 camera trap images to identify. Images were sourced from surveys in northern Australia and included 25 species, ranging in body mass from the delicate mouse (Pseudomys delicatulus, 10g) to the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis, >10kg). There was a weak relationship between the accuracy of mammal identifications and observer experience. However, accuracy was highest (100%) for distinctive species (e.g. Short-beaked echidna [Tachyglossus aculeatus]) and lowest (36%) for superficially non-distinctive mammals (e.g. rodents like the Pale field-rat [Rattus tunneyi]). There was a positive relationship between the accuracy of identifications and body mass. Participant confidence was highest for large and distinctive mammals, but was not related to participant experience level. Identifications made with greater confidence were more likely to be accurate. Unreliability in identifications of mammal species is a significant limitation to camera trap studies, particularly where small mammals are the focus, or where similar-looking species co-occur. Integration of camera traps with conventional survey techniques (e.g. live-trapping), use of a reference library or computer-automated programs are likely to aid positive identifications, while employing a confidence rating system and/or multiple observers may lead to a collection of more robust data. Although our study focussed on Australian species, our findings apply to camera trap studies globally.

Prey stimuli trigger trophic interception across ecosystems	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						insectivorous bats; resource flow; stimuli of prey; trophic interception	TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES; NOCTILIO-ALBIVENTRIS; BULLDOG BAT; FOOD; ECHOLOCATION; SUBSIDIES; BEHAVIOR; PREDATION; CONSTRAINTS; SELECTION	Specialised predators foraging in the boundaries of adjacent ecosystems can control or redirect the flow of subsidies through trophic interception. Ecologically diverse predators can capture terrestrial invertebrates that fall on the water surface and, consequently, influence the flow of energy to aquatic environments. In this study, we show that the movement of prey triggers ripples on the surface of the water, and these stimuli are detected by bulldog bats (Noctilio albiventris, Noctilionidae) during foraging. Thus, the bats located live crickets (Gryllus assimilis, Gryllidae) on average of 15 times faster when compared to the location of dead or artificial crickets (i.e. without movements or ripples on the water surface). The bats also inspected (i.e. touched with their feet) all floating objects on the water surface. During this behaviour, the characteristics of the object (i.e. texture) were critical for bats to distinguish between debris (e.g. leaves and sticks) and the resource (i.e. insect carcasses) that floated on the water surface. In addition, when we compare the efficiency of predators (i.e. bats and fishes) in capturing this resource, our findings suggest that bats are extremely effective (i.e. consumed 100% of the available prey), since the fishes consumed only 40% of the available crickets on the surface of the water over a 60-s period. These results bring novel information about the influence of prey-based stimuli on the behaviour of its predators and, consequently, on the flow of nutrients between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

Habitat selection by the Superb Lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae), an iconic ecosystem engineer in forests of south-eastern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						foraging; landscape heterogeneity; nest site; resource use; Superb Lyrebird	NEST PREDATION; BREEDING BIRDS; SEGREGATION; FRAGMENTATION; POPULATION; VEGETATION; ORGANISMS; IMPACT	Landscape heterogeneity, from both natural and anthropogenic causes, fundamentally influence the distribution of species. Conservation management requires an understanding of how species respond to heterogeneity at different spatial scales and whether differences may occur between demographic components of a species population. We examined the spatial pattern of activity of the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae), an iconic forest species of south-eastern Australia, in the Dandenong Ranges National Park, Victoria. Specifically, we quantified at landscape and local scales, the factors that influence nest site location and foraging activity of lyrebirds. Compared with randomly located sites, nest sites were more likely to occur in wet forest or rainforest close to creek lines; where there were deep litter and complex vegetation in the mid (1.5-2m) and high (>2m) strata. Foraging by lyrebirds was more likely to occur in wet forest and rainforest, with increasing distance from creeks; at sites where low vegetative cover (<30cm) was sparse and the ground layer open. Thus, lyrebirds respond to different cues for different activities (nest sites and foraging), using different resources in the landscape. These results highlight the importance of (i) knowing the range of resources, at both landscape and local scales, required by a species to ensure its persistence and (ii) adopting a landscape approach for conservation planning that incorporates the heterogeneity of the ecosystem, especially that provided by landscape components that may be limited in area but disproportionately valuable for providing habitat resources.

AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						conservation biology; forty-spotted pardalote Pardalotus quadragintus; refuges; threatening processes	CONSERVATION; CLIMATE; FIRE; MANAGEMENT; AUSTRALIA; REINTRODUCTION; REVEGETATION; PARDALOTE; HABITAT; BIOLOGY	Refuges for threatened species are important to prevent species extinction. They provide protection from a range of environmental and biotic stressors, and ideally provide protection against all threatening processes. However, for some species it may not be clear why some areas are refuges and others are not. The forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus) is an endangered, sedentary, cryptic and specialised bird endemic to the island of Tasmania, Australia. Having undergone an extreme range contraction over the past century the species is now mostly confined to a few small offshore island refuges. Key threatening processes to the species include habitat loss, wildfire, competition and predation. The ways in which these processes have molded the species' contemporary range have not been clearly evaluated. Furthermore, the security of the remnant population within refuges is uncertain. To overcome this uncertainty we assessed key threats and established the population status in known refuges by developing a robust survey protocol within an occupancy modelling framework. We discuss our results in the context of planning trial reintroductions of this endangered species in suitable habitat across its former range. We found very high occupancy rates (0.75-0.96) at two refuges and in suitable conditions, the species was highly detectable (p, 0.43-0.77). At a third location our surveys indicated a local extinction, likely due to recent wildfire. We demonstrate that all refuges are at high risk of one or more threatening processes and the current distribution across island refuges is unlikely to secure the species from extinction. We identified large areas of potential habitat across the species' former mainland range, but these are likely too distant from source populations for natural recolonisation. We propose that establishing new populations of forty-spotted pardalotes via reintroduction is essential to secure the species and that this is best achieved while robust source populations still exist.

MicroclimOz - A microclimate data set for Australia, with example applications	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						biophysical ecology; mechanistic niche modelling; microclimate; NicheMapR; soil moisture; soil temperature	CONTINENTAL-SCALE; CLIMATE; SOIL; NICHE; MODEL; PACKAGE	Many problems in pure and applied ecology require the quantification of above- and below-ground microclimates. Here I describe a data set of hourly microclimates for the Australian continent, simulated from the years 1990 to 2017 across a grid of 1893 locations approx. 60km apart. The data were generated with the NicheMapR microclimate model, driven by 0.05 degrees gridded daily meteorological forcing data (air temperature, wind speed, humidity, cloud cover, rainfall), 0.025 degrees elevation and 0.008 degrees soil texture data. The above-ground microclimate variables include horizontal plane solar radiation, solar zenith angle, sky temperature (from which down-welling longwave radiation can be computed), air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed at 1 and 120cm height, and snow depth. The below-ground variables include soil temperature, pore humidity, soil moisture and soil water potential for 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 100 and 200cm below-ground. The computations are for four shade levels (0%, 50%, 70% and 90%). The data set can be used for a wide variety of applications, including the computation of heat and water budgets of organisms, the potential for vegetation growth, and the computation of stress and growth indices. The use of daily forcing data also allows assessments of the consequences of extreme events including heat waves. Example applications are provided for computing plant growth potential, grasshopper egg development, lizard body temperature and mammalian energy and water requirements.

In the current context of crop genetic erosion, this study aims at assessing the effect of wheat cultivar diversity on earthworm growth and survival. Our laboratory experiment was divided into two periods: (1) the "feeding period" (4 months), simulating conditions in autumn with cool temperatures and high food availability, and (2) the "non-feeding period" (1 month) simulating conditions in winter with cold temperatures and low food availability because litter had already been consumed without replacement. The aerial biomass of mixtures of wheat cultivars was used as food for earthworms and their growth was measured twice during the feeding period and once during the non-feeding period. We found two major effects on earthworm growth. Increasing the cultivar number (i) increased juvenile earthworm growth and earthworm survival and (ii) decreased adult earthworm growth. A consistent positive effect of nitrogen concentration of the biomass was found on growth and this effect was independent of biodiversity effects. This study suggests that the loss of litter intraspecific genetic diversity has an impact on earthworm populations, probably through mechanisms linked to the variance in edibility or the balanced diet hypotheses. While they remain to be tested in the field, these results suggest that the current losses of crop genetic diversity could potentially impact processes at the community or ecosystem level through a decrease in food quality.

Carabid communities are regulating weeds in arable fields and include a mix of species ranging from granivores to predators that are obligate omnivores. It is not clear from field studies whether granivore and obligate omnivore species either contribute equally or are complementary in the process of weed suppression, and little is known about the impact of potential predator interference within carabid communities on weed suppression. We compared the weed seed foraging strategy of the granivore Harpalus affinis and the obligate omnivore Poecilus cupreus. Using no-choice test experiments, we compared their activity and seed acceptance for four weed species through a scoring of the proportion of tested individuals consuming weeds, their latency before the consumption of the first seed and the total number of seeds consumed. We then evaluated their seed acceptance for dandelion seed Taraxacum officinale under predator interference by using chemical cues of carabids and tested the impact of three treatments, namely cues of intraspecific competition, interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We found that the obligate omnivore P. cupreus was highly active, had a low latency before consuming its first seed but had an interest in only two of the four weed species. P. cupreus seed acceptance remained unchanged in the presence of predator cues. By contrast, H. affinis was slow to start its seed consumption, accepted equally seeds of the four weed species and significantly increased its seed consumption in the presence of cues mimicking intraguild predation. These findings indicate that the two species differ in their foraging strategies, and as such, could have different contributions to weed seed suppression. This novel result calls for further studies documenting the foraging strategy of carabid species that thrive in arable fields as this could significantly improve our understanding of the delivery of weed seed regulation.

The aim of the current study, which was carried out in Poland in 2015, was to investigate the effect of different fertiliser regimes on bumblebee flower visitation rate and seed yield in crops of the field bean (Vicia faba L.). Our results show that the number of bumblebee visits may be affected by the choice of crop fertiliser. We detected differences in bumblebee number between fertiliser treatments. The organic fertiliser (manure) treatment resulted in the highest bumblebee visitation, although this did not differ significantly from NP, no fertiliser and NK treatments. On the other hand, we observed lower numbers of bumblebees on field bean plots treated with N, NPK, and PK inorganic fertilisers. Manure application also boosted plant height and resulted in a high yield similar to other balanced fertilisers (NPK and PK). Therefore, manure was the only fertiliser that resulted in a high field bean yield and at the same time attracted the main pollinators of the crop. Thus, we suggest that appropriate management practices influence both plant growth and also pollination services and we show that modern agriculture can make compromise between effectiveness and nature conservation.

Yet, little is known on how soil microbial communities in the root zone vary at continental scales within plant species. Here we assess the effects of soil chemistry, large-scale environmental conditions (i.e. temperature, precipitation and nitrogen deposition) and forest land-use history on the soil microbial communities (measured by phospholipid fatty acids) in the root zone of four plant species (Geum urbanum, Milium effusum, Poa nemoralis and Stachys sylvatica) in forests along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Europe. Soil microbial communities differed significantly among plant species, and soil chemistry was the main determinant of the microbial community composition within each plant species. Influential soil chemical variables for microbial communities were plant species-specific; soil acidity, however, was often an important factor. Large-scale environmental conditions, together with soil chemistry, only explained the microbial community composition in M. effusum and P. nemoralis. Forest land-use history did not affect the soil microbial community composition. Our results underpin the dominant role of soil chemistry in shaping microbial community composition variation within plant species at the continental scale, and provide insights into the composition and functionality of soil microbial communities in forest ecosystems.

This extinction of experience has many potential far-reaching implications for both biodiversity and humans, including the decrease of public support for conservation issues and a reduction in the health benefits that humans experience when interacting with nature. However, knowledge of how experiences with biodiversity are distributed among different sectors of society and the key drivers of this distribution remains poor. Here, we report on the results of a nation-wide online survey in Japan in which we explored the extent, distribution, and drivers of participant's direct experiences with wild flowering plants. Participants were asked to provide information on their sociodemographics, orientation toward nature, childhood residential environment, and whether they had experienced each of 21 wild flowering plant species. The reported number of wild flowering plant species that participants had experienced varied greatly. Older and female participants and those with childhoods in rural areas and with a greater orientation toward nature experienced a significantly higher number of interactions with flowering plant species. Plant species that prefer roadside environments (compared to grassland/farmland and forest-dependent species) and are not on the Red List were likely to be experienced by participants. This novel study provides unique information about the interactions of people and the wildlife around them. Such information is crucial for the development of policies and strategies targeted to reduce the ongoing extinction of experience and its negative consequences.

Cryoconite holes (water-filled depressions on glaciers) as natural, simple and dynamic habitats in a glacial biome seem to be a good model for addressing this question. The main aim of our research was to investigate links between changes in weather conditions and short temporal changes in invertebrate densities on glaciers. For this study, we selected cryoconite holes on the valley Longyear Glacier and collected samples at two-day intervals from the same holes in August 2016. During the sampling campaigns, we detected freezing, shrinking and ablation of cryoconite holes. In the samples, we found only two groups of invertebrates, Tardigrada and Rotifera. We observed invertebrates in cryoconite holes until calm weather patterns were interrupted by wind and rainstorm, after which no individuals were detected. Before the storm event, densities in the samples reached up to 149 tardigrades/cm(3) and 119 rotifers/cm(3) of cryoconite. In addition, we found a strong erosion of cryoconite granules, redistribution into sediments (mud-like forms), and the migration of granules after rain, which confirmed the mechanical removal of invertebrates by streaming water. Water depth, pH or electrical conductivity did not seem to shape invertebrates communities. Their frequency and densities on valley glaciers depend on stochastic events, for example, weather breakdown (rainstorms). Furthermore, such events may form new niches for tardigrades and rotifers on polar glaciers and influence their coexistence within cryoconite holes.

Spore diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in human-modified neotropical ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						community structure; management practices; Pinus caribaea; savanna; tropical rainforest	COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; TROPICAL FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; SOIL; SAVANNA; ROOTS; ABUNDANCE; NITROGEN; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY	Neotropical landscapes are diverse mosaics of ecosystems commonly resulting from different degrees of human intervention. Although easily recognized by their vegetation, the associated soil microbiota including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is little known. In Mexico, native tropical rainforest and native savannas are rapidly vanishing, remaining in few spots surrounded by human-made ecosystems. It is unknown, however, how such vegetation types differ in their AMF communities. We compared the spore diversity, spore density and root colonization by AMF in contiguous mosaics of tropical rainforest, savanna and two pine plantations, one managed and the other unmanaged. We detected indicator species associated with tropical rainforest. The savanna displayed the highest values of root colonization of AMF and the lowest spore density. Conversely, the highest spore density and the lowest root colonization rates were found in the tropical rainforest. The two pine plantations showed intermediate values of spore density and colonization between tropical rainforest and the savanna. We did not detect significant seasonal differences (between dry and rainy seasons) in AMF species richness, spore density and root colonization within the vegetation types (except for root colonization in the savanna). Soil cation exchange capacity, phosphorus and nitrogen were negatively associated with AMF spore density and species richness. Our findings suggest that contiguous vegetation types in neotropical landscapes may display significant differences in AMF species composition, spore density and root colonization, and that such differences can be explained in part by soil properties and levels of human intervention.

The plants were grown in protected environments and monitored over 23 consecutive days. When the moisture of the substrate in the vessels reached 50% of their maximum retention capacity, the water levels were elevated according to four treatments: W1=62.5%, W2=75.0%, W3=87.5%, and W4=100.0%. The model appeared to provide a good fit to the data and showed that the estimates of the maximum amount of accumulated ET were similar for the three treatments with soil water deficit and lower for W4. The results of the study supported the idea that optimization of the ET of lettuce plants could be achieved through irrigation with deficit, also indicating that the economical use of water was the most efficient way to boost agricultural production. Recommendations for resource managers The continued growth of the world population will result in a decrease of quality and availability of water and also an increase in demand for food. Therefore, sustainability will depend on high agricultural productivity with rational use of water. Considered the most efficient technology for boosting agricultural productivity, irrigation is also the largest water consumer in the world. With any kind of irrigation in the vegetable production area, the water intake for the plants must be treated with great caution. Both a lack or excess in water can decrease plant productivity. The amount of water available in the soil should be enough to maximize production. It is shown that high levels of irrigation are not necessary for this. It is important to balance the amount of irrigated water for an optimal level, in order that the production has its the production is maximized and valuable water resources are not wasted.

Conservation management decisions to implement control of introduced fauna are often based on diet studies. One of the most common metrics to report in diet studies is Frequency of Occurrence (FO), but this can be difficult to interpret, as it does not include a temporal perspective. Here, we examine the potential for FO data derived from molecular diet analysis to inform invasive species management, using invasive ship rats (Rattus rattus) and endemic frogs (Leiopelma spp.) in New Zealand as a case study. Only two endemic frog species persist on the mainland. One of these, Leiopelma archeyi, is Critically Endangered (IUCN 2017) and ranked as the world's most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered amphibian (EDGE, 2018). Ship rat stomach contents were collected by kill-trapping and subjected to three methods of diet analysis (one morphological and two DNA-based). A new primer pair was developed targeting all anuran species that exhibits good coverage, high taxonomic resolution, and reasonable specificity. Incorporating a temporal parameter allowed us to calculate the minimum number of ingestion events per rat per night, providing a more intuitive metric than the more commonly reported FO. We are not aware of other DNA-based diet studies that have incorporated a temporal parameter into FO data. The usefulness of such a metric will depend on the study system, in particular the feeding ecology of the predator. Ship rats are consuming both species of native frogs present on mainland New Zealand, and this study provides the first detections of remains of these species in mammalian stomach contents.

This decision affects the time and cost of sampling and may affect ecological inference. We analyzed 334 Columbia spotted frogs at 8 microsatellite loci across 40 sites in northern Idaho to determine how inferences from landscape genetic analyses would vary with sampling design. At all sites, we compared a proportion available sampling scheme (PASS), in which all samples were used, to resampled datasets of 2-11 individuals. Additionally, we compared a population sampling scheme (PSS) to an individual sampling scheme (ISS) at 18 sites with sufficient sample size. We applied an information theoretic approach with both restricted maximum likelihood and maximum likelihood estimation to evaluate competing landscape resistance hypotheses. We found that PSS supported low-density forest when restricted maximum likelihood was used, but a combination model of most variables when maximum likelihood was used. We also saw variations when AIC was used compared to BIC. ISS supported this model as well as additional models when testing hypotheses of land cover types that create the greatest resistance to gene flow for Columbia spotted frogs. Increased sampling density and study extent, seen by comparing PSS to PASS, showed a change in model support. As number of individuals increased, model support converged at 7-9 individuals for ISS to PSS. ISS may be useful to increase study extent and sampling density, but may lack power to provide strong support for the correct model with microsatellite datasets. Our results highlight the importance of additional research on sampling design effects on landscape genetics inference.

Heliconiine larvae feed exclusively on Passiflora plants where 30 kinds of CNglcs have been reported. Among them, some CNglcs derived from cyclopentenyl glycine can be sequestered by some Heliconius species. In order to understand the evolution of biosynthesis and sequestration of CNglcs in these butterflies and its consequences for their arms race with Passiflora plants, we analyzed the CNglc distribution in selected heliconiine and Passiflora species. Sequestration of cyclopentenyl CNglcs is not an exclusive trait of Heliconius, since these compounds were present in other heliconiines such as Philaethria, Dryas and Agraulis, and in more distantly related genera Cethosia and Euptoieta. Thus, it is likely that the ability to sequester cyclopentenyl CNglcs arose in an ancestor of the Heliconiinae subfamily. Biosynthesis of aliphatic CNglcs is widespread in these butterflies, although some species from the sara-sapho group seem to have lost this ability. The CNglc distribution within Passiflora suggests that they might have diversified their cyanogenic profile to escape heliconiine herbivory. This systematic analysis improves our understanding on the evolution of cyanogenesis in the heliconiine-Passiflora system.

Environmental and demographic drivers of male mating success vary across sequential reproductive episodes in a polygynous breeder	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						environmental gradient; Equus ferus caballus; reproductive episode; resource availability; sex ratio; sexual selection	FERAL HORSE POPULATION; SEXUAL SELECTION; OPPORTUNITY; DIRECTION; DENSITY; GRADIENT; SURVIVAL; ECOLOGY; WEATHER; EVENTS	Ecological and social factors underpinning the inequality of male mating success in animal societies can be related to sex ratio, sexual conflict between breeders, effects of nonbreeders, resource dispersion, climatic conditions, and the various sequential stages of mating competition that constitute the sexual selection process. Here, we conducted an individual-based study to investigate how local resource availability and demography interact with annual climate conditions to determine the degree of male mating inequality, and thus opportunity for sexual selection across two sequential reproductive episodes (harem and subsequent mate acquisition) in a naturally regulated (feral) horse population in Sable Island National Park Preserve, Canada. Using a 5-year, spatially explicit, mark-resight dataset and hierarchical mixed-effects linear modeling, we evaluated the influence of adult sex ratio (ASR) on mating success and then tested for effects of freshwater availability, density, unpaired male abundance, and precipitation during each breeding season. Unpaired male abundance, freshwater availability, and ASR differed in their effects on male mating success according to year and selection episode. Opportunity for sexual selection in males associated with harem acquisition increased with ASR, and unpaired male abundance further explained weather-related interannual variation after accounting for ASR. In contrast, once a harem was secured, ASR had little effect on male mating inequality in regard to acquiring additional females, while interannual variation in mating inequality increased with decreasing freshwater availability. Our findings show that local demography, resource availability, and weather effect opportunity for sexual selection in males differently depending on selection episode, and can attenuate or accentuate effects of ASR.

Two nonmutually exclusive strategies to assess habitat quality involve either direct assessment of landscape features or observation of social cues from conspecifics as a form of information transfer about forage resources. The conspecific attraction hypothesis proposes that individual space use is dependent on the distribution of conspecifics rather than the location of resource patches, whereas the resource dispersion hypothesis proposes that individual space use and social association are driven by the abundance and distribution of resources. We tested the conspecific attraction and the resource dispersion hypotheses as two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining social association and of adult female caribou (Rangifer tarandus). We used location data from GPS collars to estimate interannual site fidelity and networks representing home range overlap and social associations among individual caribou. We found that home range overlap and social associations were correlated with resource distribution in summer and conspecific attraction in winter. In summer, when resources were distributed relatively homogeneously, interannual site fidelity was high and home range overlap and social associations were low. Conversely, in winter when resources were distributed relatively heterogeneously, interannual site fidelity was low and home range overlap and social associations were high. As access to resources changes across seasons, caribou appear to alter social behavior and space use. In summer, caribou may use cues associated with the distribution of forage, and in winter caribou may use cues from conspecifics to access forage. Our results have broad implications for our understanding of caribou socioecology, suggesting that caribou use season-specific strategies to locate forage. Caribou populations continue to decline globally, and our finding that conspecific attraction is likely related to access to forage suggests that further fragmentation of caribou habitat could limit social association among caribou, particularly in winter when access to resources may be limited.

Assortative mating at the major histocompatibility complex despite molecular signatures of balancing selection	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						assortative mating; balancing selection; major histocompatibility complex; positive selection; song sparrows; trans-species polymorphism	AMINO-ACID SITES; II B GENE; MATE CHOICE; NO EVIDENCE; HETEROZYGOTE ADVANTAGE; ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; NATURAL-SELECTION; MHC; POPULATION; ORIGIN	In vertebrate animals, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determine the set of pathogens to which an individual's adaptive immune system can respond. MHC genes are extraordinarily polymorphic, often showing elevated nonsynonymous relative to synonymous sequence variation and sharing presumably ancient polymorphisms between lineages. These patterns likely reflect pathogen-mediated balancing selection, for example, rare-allele or heterozygote advantage. Such selection is often reinforced by disassortative mating at MHC. We characterized exon 2 of MHC class II, corresponding to the hypervariable peptide-binding region, in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We compared nonsynonymous to synonymous sequence variation in order to identify positively selected sites; assessed evidence for trans-species polymorphisms indicating ancient balancing selection; and compared MHC similarity of socially mated pairs to expectations under random mating. Six codons showed elevated ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous variation, consistent with balancing selection, and we characterized several alleles similar to those occurring in at least four other avian families. Despite this evidence for historical balancing selection, mated pairs were significantly more similar at MHC than were randomly generated pairings. Nonrandom mating at MHC thus appears to partially counteract, not reinforce, pathogen-mediated balancing selection in this system. We suggest that in systems where individual fitness does not increase monotonically with MHC diversity, assortative mating may help to avoid excessive offspring heterozygosity that could otherwise arise from long-standing balancing selection.

Combinations of reproductive, individual, and weather effects best explain torpor patterns among female little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Chiroptera; ecophysiology; Myotis lucifugus; reproduction; thermoregulation; torpor	WHITE-NOSE SYNDROME; BODY-TEMPERATURE; ROOST SELECTION; DEFINING TORPOR; EARED BATS; THERMOREGULATION; SUMMER; HIBERNATION; MAMMALS; BIRDS	Heterothermic mammals can use torpor, a state of metabolic suppression, to conserve energy during times of limited food and poor environmental conditions. Females may use torpor throughout gestation and lactation; however, there are associated physiological and ecological costs with potential fitness consequences. Previous studies have controlled for, but not quantified the impact of interindividual variation on torpor patterns and understanding this may provide insight on why certain thermoregulatory responses are employed. The objective of this study was to identify and quantitatively characterize the intrinsic variables and weather conditions that best explain variation in torpor patterns among individual female little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus. We used temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters affixed to females to measure skin temperature patterns of 35 individuals roosting in bat boxes in the spring and summer. We used Bayesian multi-model inference to rank a priori-selected models and variables based on their explanatory power. Reproductive condition and interindividual effects best explained torpor duration and depth, and weather best explained torpor frequency. Of the reproductive conditions, lactating females used torpor for the shortest durations and at shallower depths (i.e., smallest drop in minimum T-sk), while females in early spring (i.e., not-obviously-pregnant) used torpor for the longest and deepest. Among individuals, the greatest difference in effects on duration occurred between pregnant individuals, suggesting interindividual variation within reproductive condition. Increases in precipitation and wind were associated with a higher probability of torpor use. Our results provide further support that multiple variables explain torpor patterns and highlight the importance of including individual effects when studying thermoregulatory patterns in heterothermic species.

Adaptable mesocosm facility to study oil spill impacts on corals	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						coral reef; flow-through system; marine mesocosm; marine pollution; Millepora alcicornis; oil spill	CRUDE-OIL; MUCUS; MICROBIOME; RESILIENCE; COMPLEXITY; STRESSORS; TOXICITY; PORITES; FUTURE; ALGAE	Although numerous studies have been carried out on the impacts of oil spills on coral physiology, most have relied on laboratory assays. This scarcity is partly explained by the difficulty of reproducing realistic conditions in a laboratory setting or of performing experiments with toxic compounds in the field. Mesocosm systems provide the opportunity to carry out such studies with safe handling of contaminants while reproducing natural conditions required by living organisms. The mesocosm design is crucial and can lead to the development of innovative technologies to mitigate environmental impacts. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a mesocosm system for studies simulating oil spills with several key advantages, including true replication and the use of gravity to control flow-through that reduces reliance on pumps that can clog thereby decreasing errors and costs. This adaptable system can be configured to (a) have continuous flow-through; (b) operate as an open or closed system; (c) be fed by gravity; (d) have separate mesocosm sections that can be used for individual and simultaneous experiments; and (e) simulate the migration of oil from ocean oil spills to the nearby reefs. The mesocosm performance was assessed with two experiments using the hydrocoral Millepora alcicornis and different configurations to simulate two magnitudes of oil spills. With few exceptions, physical and chemical parameters remained stable within replicates and within treatments throughout the experiments. Physical and chemical parameters that expressed change during the experiment were still within the range of natural conditions observed in Brazilian marine environments. The photosynthetic potential (F-v/F-m) of the algae associated with M. alcicornis decreased in response to an 1% crude-oil contamination, suggesting a successful delivery of the toxic contaminant to the targeted replicates. This mesocosm is customizable and adjustable for several types of experiments and proved to be effective for studies of oil spills.	[Silva, Denise P.; Duarte, Gustavo; Villela, Helena D.

Here, we investigate the question of the fine-scale genetic structure of this ecologically important foundation species, subject to severe anthropogenic disturbance in China. The genetic structure will illuminate potential mechanisms for population dynamics and sustainability, which are critical for preservation of biodiversity and for decision-making in management and restoration. We evaluated the fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) and flowering output of E. acoroides, and indirectly estimated the relative importance of sexual versus asexual reproduction for population persistence using spatial autocorrelation analysis. Results reveal high clonal diversity for this species, as predicted from its high sexual reproduction output. The stronger Sp statistic at the ramet-level compared with genet-level indicates that clonality increases the SGS pattern for E. acoroides. Significant SGS at the genet-level may be explained by the aggregated dispersal of seed/pollen cohorts. The estimated gene dispersal variance suggests that dispersal mediated by sexual reproduction is more important than clonal growth in this study area. The ongoing anthropogenic disturbance will negatively affect the mating pattern and the SGS patterns in the future due to massive death of shoots, and less frequency of sexual reproduction.

Tropical dry forests are seasonal environments where seed dormancy may play an important role in plant resilience and resistance to changing precipitation patterns. We studied the germination behavior of seeds from six populations of the Neotropical vine Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae) originating from environments of contrasting rainfall seasonality. Seeds produced by second greenhouse-generation plants were measured and exposed to a favorable wet environment at different time intervals after capsule dehiscence and seed dispersal. We recorded the success and the timing of germination. All populations produced at least some dormant seeds, but seeds of populations originating from more seasonal environments required longer periods of after-ripening before germinating. Within populations, larger seeds tended to require longer after-ripening periods than did smaller seeds. These results indicate among-population genetic differences in germination behavior and suggest that these populations are adapted to local environmental conditions. They also suggest that seed size may influence germination timing within populations. Ongoing changes in seasonality patterns in tropical dry forests may impose strong selection on these traits.

Small, isolated animal populations where genetic diversity is low are at particular risks, such as endangered Virunga mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). Along with climate change-associated environmental shifts that are affecting the entire population, subpopulations of the Virunga gorillas have recently experienced extreme changes in their social environment. As the growing population moves closer to the forest's carrying capacity, the gorillas are coping with rising population density, increased frequencies of interactions between social units, and changing habitat use (e.g., more overlapping home ranges and routine ranging at higher elevations). Using noninvasive monitoring of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGM) on 115 habituated Virunga gorillas, we investigated how social and ecological variation are related to baseline FGM levels, to better understand the adaptive capacity of mountain gorillas and monitor potential physiological indicators of population decline risks. Generalized linear mixed models revealed elevated mean monthly baseline FGM levels in months with higher rainfall and higher mean maximum and minimum temperature, suggesting that Virunga gorillas might be sensitive to predicted warming and rainfall trends involving longer, warmer dry seasons and more concentrated and extreme rainfall occurrences. Exclusive use of smaller home range areas was linked to elevated baseline FGM levels, which may reflect reduced feeding efficiency and increased travel efforts to actively avoid neighboring groups. The potential for additive effects of stress-inducing factors could have short- and long-term impacts on the reproduction, health, and ultimately survival of the Virunga gorilla population. The ongoing effects of environmental changes and population dynamics must be closely monitored and used to develop effective long-term conservation strategies that can help address these risk factors.

However, their habitat use may be different in places with different longitudinal environmental gradients, climatic regimes, and microclimate. This study aimed to determine the habitat variables affecting red panda distribution across different longitudinal gradients through a multivariate analysis. We studied habitat selection patterns along the longitudinal gradient in Nepal's Himalaya which is grouped into the eastern, central, and western complexes. We collected data on red panda presence and habitat variables (e.g., tree richness, canopy cover, bamboo abundance, water availability, tree diameter, tree height) by surveys along transects throughout the species' potential range. We used a multimodal inference approach with a generalized linear model to test the relative importance of environmental variables. Although the study showed that bamboo abundance had a major influence, habitat selection was different across longitudinal zones. Both canopy cover and species richness were unimportant in eastern Nepal, but their influence increased progressively toward the west. Conversely, tree height showed a decreasing influence on habitat selection from Eastern to Western Nepal. Red panda's habitat selection revealed in this study corresponds to the uneven distribution of vegetation assemblages and the dry climatic gradient along the eastern-western Himalayas which could be related to a need to conserve energy and thermoregulate. This study has further highlighted the need of importance of bamboo conservation and site-specific conservation planning to ensure long-term red panda conservation.

Black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) nesting in colonies on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) in western Alaska have declined substantially (50%) since the turn of the century. Black brant are herbivores that rely heavily on Carex subspathacea (Hoppner's sedge) during growth and development. The availability of C. subspathacea affects gosling growth rates, which subsequently affect pre- and postfledging survival, as well as size and breeding probability as an adult. We predicted that long-term declines in C. subspathacea have affected gosling growth rates, despite the potential of behavior to buffer changes in food availability during brood rearing. We used Bayesian hierarchical mixed-effects models to examine long-term (1987-2015) shifts in brant behavior during brood rearing, forage availability, and gosling growth rates at the Tutakoke River colony. We showed that locomotion behaviors have increased (beta = 0.05, 95% CRI: 0.032-0.068) while resting behaviors have decreased (beta = -0.024, 95% CRI: -0.041 to -0.007), potentially in response to long-term shifts in forage availability and brood density. Concurrently, gosling growth rates have decreased substantially (beta = -0.100, 95% CRI: -0.191 to -0.016) despite shifts in behavior, mirroring long-term declines in the abundance of C. subspathacea (beta = -0.191, 95% CRI: -0.355 to -0.032). These results have important implications for individual fitness and population viability, where shifts in gosling behavior putatively fail to mitigate long-term declines in forage availability.

The pond bat (Myotis dasycneme) is a rare species classified as "Near Threatened" with a wide but patchy Palearctic distribution. A total of 277 samples representing populations in Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Hungary, and Russia were used in the genetic analyses; 224 samples representing Denmark, Germany, and Russia were analyzed at 10 microsatellite loci; 241 samples representing all areas were analyzed using mitochondrial D-loop and cytochrome B sequences. A Bayesian clustering approach revealed two poorly resolved clusters, one representing the Danish and German groups and the other the Russian group. However, significantly different pairwise F-ST and D-EST estimates were observed between the Danish and German groups and between the Danish and Russian groups suggesting a recent population structure. These conflicting results might be attributed to the effect of migration or low resolution due to the number of microsatellite markers used. After concatenating the two mitochondrial sequences, analysis detected significant genetic differentiation between all populations, probably due to genetic drift combined with a founder event. The phylogenetic tree suggested a closer relationship between the Russian and Northern European populations compared to the Hungarian population, implying that the latter belongs to an older ancestral population. This was supported by the observed haplotype network and higher nucleotide diversity in this population. The genetic structuring observed in the Danish/German pond bat stresses the need for a cross-border management between the two countries. Further, the pronounced mtDNA structuring, together with the indicated migration between nearby populations suggest philopatric female behavior but male migration, emphasizes the importance of protecting suitable habitat mosaics to maintain a continuum of patches with dense pond bat populations across the species' distribution range.

We selected four diversity indices including species richness, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Pielou, and relative importance values to quantify community assembly and biodiversity. Empirical cumulative distribution and species accumulation curves were utilized to describe the SADs of two forests communities trees. Three types of models, including statistic model (lognormal and logseries model), niche model (broken-stick, niche preemption, and Zipf-Mandelbrodt model), and neutral theory model, were estimated by the fitted SADs. Simulation effects were tested by Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results found that the Fagaceae and Anacardiaceae families were their respective dominance family in the evergreen broad-leaved and deciduous mixed communities. According to original data and random sampling predictions, the SADs were hump-shaped for intermediate abundance classes, peaking between 8 and 32 in the evergreen broad-leaved community, but this maximum increased with size of total sampled area size in the deciduous mixed community. All niche models could only explain SADs patterns at smaller spatial scales. However, both the neutral theory and purely statistical models were suitable for explaining the SADs for secondary forest communities when the sampling plot exceeded 40 m. The results showed the SADs indicated a clear directional trend toward convergence and similar predominating ecological processes in two typical subtropical secondary forests. The neutral process gradually replaced the niche process in importance and become the main mechanism for determining SADs of forest trees as the sampling scale expanded. Thus, we can preliminarily conclude that neutral processes had a major effect on biodiversity patterns in these two subtropical secondary forests but exclude possible contributions of other processes.

Xylem embolism can accumulate to lethal levels during drought, but species that can refill embolized xylem and recover hydraulic function may be able to avoid mortality. Yet the potential controls of embolism recovery, including cross-biome patterns and plant traits such as nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs), hydraulic traits, and nocturnal stomatal conductance, are unknown. We exposed eight plant species, originating from mesic (tropical and temperate) and semi-arid environments, to drought under ambient and elevated CO2 levels, and assessed recovery from embolism following rewatering. We found a positive association between xylem recovery and NSCs, and, surprisingly, a positive relationship between xylem recovery and nocturnal stomatal conductance. Arid-zone species exhibited greater embolism recovery than mesic zone species. Our results indicate that nighttime stomatal conductance often assumed to be a wasteful use of water, may in fact be a key part of plant drought responses, and contribute to drought survival. Findings suggested distinct biome-specific responses that partially depended on species climate-of-origin precipitation or aridity index, which allowed some species to recover from xylem embolism. These findings provide improved understanding required to predict the response of diverse plant communities to drought. Our results provide a framework for predicting future vegetation shifts in response to climate change.	[Zeppel, Melanie J.

The use of DNA barcodes to estimate phylogenetic diversity in forest communities of southern China	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Bayesian tree; ITS; matK; phylogenetic inference; rbcL; subtropical forest	ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; MAXIMUM VARIATION; BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; ALIGNMENTS; EVOLUTION; INFERENCE; TOOL	To elucidate potential ecological and evolutionary processes associated with the assembly of plant communities, there is now widespread use of estimates of phylogenetic diversity that are based on a variety of DNA barcode regions and phylogenetic construction methods. However, relatively few studies consider how estimates of phylogenetic diversity may be influenced by single DNA barcodes incorporated into a sequence matrix (conservative regions vs. hypervariable regions) and the use of a backbone family-level phylogeny. Here, we use general linear mixed-effects models to examine the influence of different combinations of core DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, ITS, and ITS2) and phylogeny construction methods on a series of estimates of community phylogenetic diversity for two subtropical forest plots in Guangdong, southern China. We ask: (a) What are the relative influences of single DNA barcodes on estimates phylogenetic diversity metrics? and (b) What is the effect of using a backbone family-level phylogeny to estimate topology-based phylogenetic diversity metrics? The combination of more than one barcode (i.e., rbcL + matK + ITS) and the use of a backbone family-level phylogeny provided the most parsimonious explanation of variation in estimates of phylogenetic diversity. The use of a backbone family-level phylogeny showed a stronger effect on phylogenetic diversity metrics that are based on tree topology compared to those that are based on branch lengths. In addition, the variation in the estimates of phylogenetic diversity that was explained by the top-rank models ranged from 0.1% to 31% and was dependent on the type of phylogenetic community structure metric. Our study underscores the importance of incorporating a multilocus DNA barcode and the use of a backbone family-level phylogeny to infer phylogenetic diversity, where the type of DNA barcode employed and the phylogenetic construction method used can serve as a significant source of variation in estimates of phylogenetic community structure.

Changes in genetic diversity and differentiation in Red-cockaded woodpeckers (Dryobates borealis) over the past century	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Dryobates borealis; endangered species; microsatellite; mitochondrial DNA sequences; Red-cockaded woodpecker; temporal change	ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DNA; CONSERVATION; REINTRODUCTION; BIRDS; RAREFACTION; MANAGEMENT; INFERENCE; SOFTWARE	Red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCW; Dryobates borealis) declined after human activities reduced their fire-maintained pine ecosystem to <3% of its historical range in the southeastern United States and degraded remaining habitat. An estimated 1.6 million RCW cooperative breeding groups declined to about 3,500 groups with no more than 10,000 birds by 1978. Management has increased RCW population abundances since they were at their lowest in the 1990s. However, no range-wide study has been undertaken since then to investigate the impacts of this massive bottleneck or infer the effects of conservation management and recent demographic recoveries. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences (mtDNA) and nine nuclear microsatellite loci to determine if range-wide demographic declines resulted in changes to genetic structure and diversity in RCW by comparing samples collected before 1970 (mtDNA data only), between 1992 and 1995 (mtDNA and microsatellites), and between 2010 and 2014 (mtDNA and microsatellites). We show that genetic diversity has been lost as detected by a reduction in the number of mitochondrial haplotypes. This reduction was apparent in comparisons of pre-1970 mtDNA data with data from the 1992-1995 and 2010-2014 time points, with no change between the latter two time points in mtDNA and microsatellite analyses. The mtDNA data also revealed increases in range-wide genetic differentiation, with a genetically panmictic population present throughout the southeastern United States in the pre-1970s data and subsequent development of genetic structure that has remained unchanged since the 1990s. Genetic structure was also uncovered with the microsatellite data, which like the mtDNA data showed little change between the 1992-1995 and 2010-2014 data sets. Temporal haplotype networks revealed a consistent, star-like phylogeny, suggesting that despite the overall loss of haplotypes, no phylogenetically distinct mtDNA lineages were lost when the population declined. Our results may suggest that management during the last two decades has prevented additional losses of genetic diversity.

Weapons can also be favored in competition over nonreproductive resources such as food or shelter, and if such nonreproductive competition occurs year-round, weapons may be less likely to vary seasonally. In snapping shrimp (Alpheus angulosus), both sexes have an enlarged snapping claw (a potentially deadly weapon), and males of many species have larger claws than females, although females are more aggressive. This contrasting sexual dimorphism (larger weaponry in males, higher aggression in females) raises the question of whether weaponry and aggression are favored by the same mechanisms in males and females. We used field data to determine whether either sex shows seasonal variation in claw size such as described above. We found sexual dimorphism increased during the reproductive season due to opposing changes in both male and female claw size. Males had larger claws during the reproductive season than during the nonreproductive season, a pattern consistent with sexual selection. Females, however, had larger claws during the nonreproductive season than during the reproductive season-a previously unknown pattern of variation in weapon size. The observed changes in female weapon size suggest a trade-off between claw growth and reproduction in the reproductive season, with investment in claw growth primarily in the nonreproductive season. Sexually dimorphic weaponry in snapping shrimp, then, varies seasonally due to sex differences in seasonal patterns of investment in claw growth, suggesting claws may be advantageous for both sexes but in different contexts. Thus, understanding sexual dimorphisms through the lens of one sex yields an incomplete understanding of the factors favoring their evolution.

An examination of introgression and incomplete lineage sorting among three closely related species of chocolate-dipped damselfish (genus: Chromis)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Chromis; connectivity; coral reef fishes; hybridization; Indo-West Pacific; marine biogeography; microsatellite; mitochondrial DNA; Pomacentridae; population genetics	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; CORAL-REEF FISHES; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; INDO-PACIFIC; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; HYBRIDIZATION; DNA; MITOCHONDRIAL; INFERENCE; PROVINCES	Aim To determine the impact of ecological and environmental histories on the evolution of coral reef damselfishes at two adjacent marine biogeographic suture zones. Location Indo-West Pacific, notably including two suture zones: Socotra and Christmas and Cocos/Keeling Islands. Taxon Chromis dimidiata, Chromis margaritifer, and Chromis fieldi. Methods We utilized a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers in addition to visual abundance survey data of these fishes. Results Despite genetic patterns consistent with incomplete lineage sorting and relatively low genetic differentiation among the three studied Chromis species, there is evidence of hybridization between C. margaritifer and C. fieldi at Christmas Island based on molecular and visual identification. Introgression appears to be spreading westwards to other C. fieldi populations based on COI haplotype comparison. Moreover, the genetic distance between C. margaritifer and C. fieldi suggests that Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations may have contributed to allopatric divergence and secondary contact between these two closely related species. Main conclusions Our study highlights that evolutionary processes in coral reef fishes operate differently between suture zones, possibly due to different ecological and environmental predispositions regulating secondary contact of sister species. While secondary contact likely led to hybridization and introgression at Christmas and Cocos/Keeling Islands, none of those processes seem present at Socotra for the chocolate-dipped damselfish. This difference is likely due to an environmental barrier caused by hydrodynamic regimes in the Gulf of Aden.

Sitting ducklings: Timing of hatch, nest departure, and predation risk for dabbling duck broods	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Anas cyanoptera; Anas platyrhynchos; imprinting; Mareca strepera; nest depredation; nest exodus; predation	SURVIVAL; DEPREDATION; MOVEMENTS; MALLARDS; REMOVAL	For ground-nesting waterfowl, the timing of egg hatch and duckling departure from the nest may be influenced by the risk of predation at the nest and en route to wetlands and constrained by the time required for ducklings to imprint on the hen and be physically able to leave the nest. We determined the timing of hatch, nest departure, and predation on dabbling duck broods using small video cameras placed at the nests of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos; n = 26), gadwall (Mareca strepera; n = 24), and cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera; n = 5). Mallard eggs began to hatch throughout the day and night, whereas gadwall eggs generally started to hatch during daylight hours (mean 7.5 hr after dawn). Among all species, duckling departure from the nest occurred during daylight (98%), and 53% of hens typically left the nest with their broods 1-4 hr after dawn. For mallard and gadwall, we identified three strategies for the timing of nest departure: (a) 9% of broods left the nest the same day that eggs began to hatch (6-12 hr later), (b) 81% of broods left the nest the day after eggs began to hatch, and (c) 10% of broods waited 2 days to depart the nest after eggs began to hatch, leaving the nest just after the second dawn (27-42 hr later). Overall, eggs were depredated at 10% of nests with cameras in the 2 days prior to hatch and ducklings were depredated at 15% of nests with cameras before leaving the nest. Our results suggest that broods prefer to depart the nest early in the morning, which may best balance developmental constraints with predation risk both at the nest and en route to wetlands.

Understanding why this happens requires knowledge of the habitat selection cues animals use, the habitats they prefer and why, and the fitness costs of habitat selection decisions. We conducted experiments with a freshwater insect, the non-biting midge Chironomus tepperi to ask: (a) whether females respond to potential oviposition cues, (b) to explore whether oviposition is adaptive in relation to metal pollution and conductivity, and (c) whether individuals raised in poor quality sites are more likely to breed in similarly poor locations. We found the following: (a) females responded to some cues, especially conductivity and conspecifics, (b) females preferred sites with higher concentrations of bioavailable metals but suffered no consequences to egg/larval survival, (c) females showed some avoidance of high conductivities, but they still laid eggs resulting in reduced egg hatching, larval survival, and adult emergence, and (d) preferences were independent of natal environment. Our results show that C. tepperi is susceptible to ecological traps, depending on life stage and the relative differences in conductivities among potential oviposition sites. Our results highlight that (a) the fitness outcomes of habitat selection need to be assessed across the life cycle and (b) the relative differences in preference/suitability of habitats need to be considered in ecological trap research. This information can help determine why habitat preferences and their fitness consequences differ among species, which is critical for determining which species are susceptible to ecological traps.

Interaction Diversity Maintains Resiliency in a Frequently Disturbed Ecosystem	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						interaction diversity; tri-trophic interaction; resilience; response diversity; scale-dependency; Pinus palustris; prescribed fire	PLANT-SPECIES DIVERSITY; ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE; FIRE; BIODIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; PATTERNS; HISTORY	Frequently disturbed ecosystems are characterized by resilience to ecological disturbances. Longleaf pine ecosystems are not only resilient to frequent fire disturbance, but this feature sustains biodiversity. We examined how fire frequency maintains beta diversity of multi-trophic interactions in longleaf pine ecosystems, as this community property provides a measure of functional redundancy of an ecosystem. We found that beta interaction diversity at small local scales is highest in the most frequently burned stands, conferring immediate resiliency to disturbance by fire. Interactions become more specialized and less resilient as fire frequency decreases. Local scale patterns of interaction diversity contribute to broader scale patterns and confer long-termecosystem resiliency. Such natural disturbances are likely to be important for maintaining regional diversity of interactions for a broad range of ecosystems.

Personality and gonadal development as sources of individual variation in response to GnRH challenge in female great tits	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						seasonal timing; reproduction; endocrinology; personality; birds	TESTOSTERONE LEVELS; CORTICOSTERONE RESPONSES; REALIZED HERITABILITY; NATURAL-SELECTION; STURNUS-VULGARIS; WARMING WORLD; EGG FORMATION; HPG-AXES; PLASMA; REPRODUCTION	Seasonal timing of reproduction is a key life-history trait, but we know little about the mechanisms underlying individual variation in female endocrine profiles associated with reproduction. In birds, 17 beta-oestradiol is a key reproductive hormone that links brain neuroendocrine mechanisms, involved in information processing and decision-making, to downstream mechanisms in the liver, where egg-yolk is produced. Here, we test, using a simulated induction of the reproductive system through a Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) challenge, whether the ovary of pre-breeding female great tits responds to brain stimulation by increasing oestradiol. We also assess how this response is modified by individual-specific traits like age, ovarian follicle size, and personality, using females from lines artificially selected for divergent levels of exploratory behaviour. We show that a GnRH injection leads to a rapid increase in circulating concentrations of oestradiol, but responses varied among individuals. Females with more developed ovarian follicles showed stronger responses and females from lines selected for fast exploratory behaviour showed stronger increases compared to females from the slow line, indicating a heritable component. This study shows that the response of the ovary to reproductive stimulation from the brain greatly varies among individuals and that this variation can be attributed to several commonly measured individual traits, which sheds light on the mechanisms shaping heritable endocrine phenotypes.

A backbone of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic factors such as local resource breadth.

Understanding the full range of variation in rate effects on CTLs and their underlying basis is thus essential if methodological noise is not to overwhelm or bias the ecological signal. We consider the effects of rate variation from multiple intraspecific assessments and provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of the rate effects on both the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and critical thermal minimum (CTmin) for 47 species of ectotherms, exploring which of the available theoretical models best explains this variation. We find substantial interspecific variation in rate effects, which takes four different forms (increase, decline, no change, mixed), with phylogenetic signal in effects on CTmax, but not CTmin. Exponential and zero exponential failure rate models best explain the rate effects on CTmax. The majority of the empirical rate variation in CTmin could not be explained by the failure rate models. Our work demonstrates that rate effects cannot be ignored in comparative analyses, and suggests that incorporation of the failure rate models into such analyses is a useful further avenue for exploration of the fundamental basis and implications of such variation.

However, studies suggest that among-individual variation in the age at death is also affected. Ultimately, both of these outcomes must be caused by effects of nutrition on underlying patterns of age-specific mortality (ASM). Using model life tables, we tested for effects of dietary macronutrients on ASM in mice (Mus musculus). High concentrations of protein and fat relative to carbohydrates were associated with low life expectancy and high variation in the age at death, a result caused predominantly by high mortality prior to middle age. A lifelong diet comprising the ratio of macronutrients self-selected by mouse (in early adulthood) was associated with low mortality up until middle age, but higher late-life mortality. This pattern results in reasonably high life expectancy, but very low variation in the age at death. Our analyses also indicate that it may be possible to minimize ASM across life by altering the ratio of dietary protein to carbohydrate in the approach to old age. Mortality in early and middle life was minimized at around one-part protein to two-parts carbohydrate, whereas in later life slightly greater than equal parts protein to carbohydrate reduced mortality.

Dispersion of vendace eggs and larvae around potential nursery areas reveals their reproductive strategy	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						fish larvae; hydrodynamic model; nursery areas; risk spreading; spawning	COREGONUS-ALBULA L.; FISH LARVAE; BIOENERGETIC MODEL; SPAWNING GROUNDS; POPULATION; GROWTH; SURVIVAL; RECRUITMENT; DYNAMICS; LOCATION	Depending on their reproductive strategy, different fish species aim to aggregate or disperse eggs and larvae in their reproductive habitat. Many pelagic species disperse their eggs widely around the potential nursery areas. Larval dispersion or aggregation affects population sub-structuring, which has important implications in fisheries management and conservation of the natural spatial diversity in populations. The dispersion of larval vendace (Coregonus albula) was quantified in two oligotrophic Finnish lakes, and effects of density and environmental variables on the inter-annual variation in the larval distribution were examined by analysing spatial abundance data from the lakes from 1999 to 2017. A 3-D hydrodynamic egg distribution model was used to simulate the larval transport after hatching. Vendace larvae dispersed lake-wide to both littoral and pelagic zones but, in some littoral hot spots, more larvae aggregated year after year. However, in years of high larval number, the densities increased not only in the hot spots, but generally at all sampling plots. An overall increase in abundance was observed at all sampling sites. The simulations of the egg distribution model supported the hypothesis that the dispersion of the eggs occurs by spawners, i.e. by spawning at several different spawning sites, which are located all around the lake. The dispersion of vendace eggs and larvae can be seen as a bet-hedging strategy in space and time since in boreal oligotrophic large lakes with fragmented morphology, weather and other environmental factors in spring during hatching varies from year to year spatially in unpredictable manner. Lake-wide larval dispersion suggests that the subpopulations of adjacent lake deeps may swap considerable amounts of individuals during early life and may not be closed units. Conservation of particular habitats seems unnecessary for Finnish vendace populations where large potential spawning areas in lakes are available.

To provide guidelines and target variables for evaluating aquaculture impacts on freshwater fish communities, we operated an experimental aquaculture farm as a whole-lake experiment where 10,000 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were raised annually from 2003 to 2007. Impacts were assessed using up to 8years of pre-impact and 8-10years of post-impact data. Prey fish abundance increased dramatically during aquaculture but declined sharply following the experiment. High abundance of littoral minnows in autumn was not observed during spring and, combined with size distribution data, suggests high overwinter mortality of adult minnows. White sucker (Catostomus commersonii) abundance and body condition declined during and after aquaculture, with evidence of overwinter juvenile recruitment failure in the last 2 years of operation, although size-at-age increased. The adult abundance of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) doubled during aquaculture, due to a combination of (a) increased growth rates of young trout and (b) earlier age and larger sizes at maturation. Within 2years following aquaculture, lake trout abundance declined by nearly 50% to background levels, suggesting a large increase in lake trout mortality once operations ceased. These changes were not observed in nearby reference lakes. While aquaculture appeared to benefit some species (slimy sculpin [Cottus cognatus], minnows, lake trout), prolonged declines in white sucker abundance and condition and continued depression of Mysis densities and optimal oxythermal habitat availability nearly a decade following operations suggest potentially long-term impacts at this magnitude. Importantly, this experiment highlights important indicator species and life history traits for monitoring of freshwater aquaculture impacts on native fish communities.

Therefore, their interplay and the associated effects on consumer population growth are important for predator-prey interactions and community dynamics. Experiments in which consumers were exposed to elemental nutrient limitations along food quantity gradients suggest that food quality effects on consumer performance are relevant only at high food quantities. However, elemental nutrients act differently on physiological processes than biochemical nutrients. So far, the interactive effects of food quantity and biochemical compounds on consumer performance have been insufficiently studied. We studied interactive effects of food quantity and biochemical food quality on population growth, including fecundity and survival, of the freshwater rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. We hypothesised that these life history traits are differently affected by the availability of biochemical nutrients and that food quality effects gain importance with increasing food quantity. In a first experiment, we established food quantity and quality gradients by providing rotifers with different concentrations of a low-quality food, the sterol-free cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, supplemented with increasing amounts of cholesterol. In a second experiment, food quantity and quality gradients were established by providing different proportions of two prey species differing in biochemical food quality, i.e. S.elongatus and the lipid-rich alga Nannochloropsis limnetica, at different total food concentrations. We found that the effects of cholesterol supplementation on population growth increased with increasing food quantity. This interactive effect on population growth was mainly due to food quality effects on fecundity, as effects on survival remained constant along the food quantity gradient. In contrast, when feeding on the mixed algal diet, the food quality effect associated with increasing the proportion of the high-quality alga did not change along the food quantity gradient. The data on survival and fecundity demonstrate the missing interactive effect of food quantity and quality on population growth, as both traits were oppositely affected. Survival was affected by food quality primarily at low food quantity, whereas food quality effects on fecundity were stronger at high food quantity. Our results highlight the significance of essential biochemicals in mediating the interactive effects of food quantity and quality on population growth. The interplay between food quantity and biochemical food quality limitation seems to influence resource allocation patterns in order to optimise survival or reproduction, which may strongly affect population dynamics in variable environments. As opposed to exploring the function of a single nutrient via supplementation, using algae mixtures allowed us to assess food quality effects on consumer performance in a more natural context by taking potential interactive effects of multiple co-limiting nutrients into account.

Their invasions appear to comprise a combination of passive and active dispersal mechanisms, both natural and human-mediated. Despite the significance of Ponto-Caspian gobies as invasive species, there is little information about the mechanisms underpinning their dispersal. They are relatively small benthic fish, with high site affinity. Thus, actively dispersing individuals must express a behavioural motivation to engage in persistent directional movement. Several recent studies have suggested that inter-individual behavioural differences in boldness, activity level and tendency to explore might underpin dispersal. In addition, because males are highly territorial, intraspecific competition may lead to density-dependent dispersal of subordinate individuals. To date, studies on this subject have focused mainly on comparisons between individuals from the core of established populations with those at the margins and, thus, address the outcome of dispersal rather than the mechanism itself. We conducted a series of experiments on the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus to address the question of what behavioural and physiological traits predict the tendency of an individual to perform dispersal behaviour, specifically considering the role of conspecifics in influencing the tendency to disperse. We used an artificial channel to measure dispersal tendency in this species in combination with behavioural trials. Our results showed that fish with a greater tendency to disperse in an experimental channel grew more slowly and were bolder; that is displayed a greater propensity to emerge from a cryptic background onto a white background and performed worse in prey capture trials. As predicted, intraspecific competition played a primary role in the dispersal of the racer goby. Dominant males showed a tendency to monopolise limited shelters with an outcome that subordinates were forced to disperse upstream. The specific growth rate of individuals appeared to be a good indicator of social position. Subordinate males expressed the lowest rates of growth, probably as a result of long-term deprivation of food in the presence of dominant conspecifics. They were also quicker to explore novel environments, possibly to search for food. Contrary to expectations, subordinate individuals performed relatively poorly in feeding trials when tested individually. Our findings suggest that intraspecific competition in racer goby males is an important mechanism for active dispersal. It can also influence inter-individual variation in traits such as boldness and tendency to explore novel environments. Similar responses to competitive interactions may have encouraged the invasive expansion of other Ponto-Caspian gobies following establishment in new environments, as well as other fish species that exhibit territorial behaviour.

Aquatic macroinvertebrate community responses to wetland mitigation in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						Clean Water Act; community composition; restoration; species richness; wetland creation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ASSEMBLAGES; SERVICES; TRENDS; USA	Wetlands are critical components of freshwater biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, but human activities have resulted in large-scale loss of these habitats across the globe. To offset this loss, mitigation wetlands are frequently constructed, but their ability to replicate the functions of natural wetlands remains uncertain. Further, monitoring of mitigation wetlands is limited and often focuses exclusively on vegetation and physical characteristics. Wetland fauna are assumed to be present if suitable habitat restoration is achieved, but this assumption is rarely tested. We used the macroinvertebrate community as a proxy for wetland function to compare recently created mitigation wetlands, natural wetlands impacted but not destroyed by road construction activity, and unimpacted reference wetlands along a highway corridor in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Unlike most other studies of invertebrate communities in created wetlands which have occurred in warm climates, our study area has a cold temperate climate with short growing seasons. We estimated macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness and used linear models to test for effects of wetland design features (wetland age, isolation, depth, vegetation, size, and pH) on invertebrate richness. We also used non-metric multidimensional scaling to visualise differences in community composition among wetland types and used indicator species analysis to determine which taxa were causing observed differences. Taxonomic richness of macroinvertebrates was lower in created wetlands than impacted or reference wetlands, whereas richness was similar in impacted and reference wetlands. Wetland age was positively correlated with taxonomic richness. The amount of aquatic vegetation in wetlands had the greatest influence on taxonomic richness, so that recently created wetlands with little vegetation had the simplest invertebrate communities. Community composition of invertebrates in created wetlands also differed from community composition in reference and impacted wetlands. Most notably, created wetlands lacked some passive dispersers that were common in other wetland types, although we found no relationship between taxonomic richness and wetland isolation. Overall, constructed wetlands had diminished and altered macroinvertebrate communities relative to reference and impacted wetlands, suggesting that periods in excess of 5 years may be required for wetland mitigation projects in cold temperate climates to attain full functionality.

Nonetheless, the classification of a taxon into an FFG is often based on its membership of a genus or family rather than on species level information. This extrapolation of the FFG membership of one taxon to the remaining taxa within a group has led to misconceptions and erroneous conclusions. This study aimed to determine the amount of variation in FFG membership within species among seasons and locations and whether this was related to resource availability. For this purpose, we sampled over two seasons (autumn and spring) at three altitudes in each of four basins, measuring the main trophic resources available for aquatic insects and collecting representatives of taxa traditionally assigned to each of the main FFGs. Based on analyses of the diet of multiple individuals in each location and season, we calculated the percentage belonging to each FFG. Diets differed widely among taxa, and within taxa they often varied significantly between sites in the same season and at the same site between different seasons. Species' diets could also differ between different river basins when specimens were collected at the same altitude and season. In some cases, although the primary food source remained the same, the contribution from a secondary source varied between sites. Although availability of the three main trophic resources (epilithic algae, fine and coarse particulate organic matter) differed among sites, we found no association overall between the availability of these resources and insect diets. Our results agree with several recent studies that show that the diets of stream invertebrates vary widely in space and time, potentially indicative of widespread omnivory/opportunistic feeding. This makes classifying taxa into particular FFGs without collection of dietary data, or by assigning one FFG to a taxon across all places and times, fraught with potential errors. These have possible repercussions for ecological studies related to matter cycles or food webs, amongst other issues. Some stream insects are consistently predaceous or have piercing mouthparts that constrain their diet. However, it appears increasingly likely that the majority of taxa, formerly labelled as scraper, shredder, and collector-gatherer or filterer, should be regarded as feeding on a range of sources and not routinely assigned into distinct FFGs (in the absence of local dietary data). We suggest researchers classify stream insect taxa as omnivores unless there are local data that show otherwise, or the taxa are obligate predators, feed by piercing or are otherwise physiologically constrained to a particular diet.

Based on occupancy data, our aim was to assess the relative power of connectivity metrics in explaining amphibian distribution when accounting for cross-scale effects from pond to network scales, and to identify network features relevant to amphibian conservation in agricultural landscapes in the Seine-et-Marne department (east of Paris, France). We propose an original analytical framework that allows examining different spatial scales of influence, with a focus on connectivity. We analyse the distribution of three amphibian species (Bufo bufo, Rana dalmatina, and Lissotriton vulgaris) in relation to various pond conditions (fish presence, water quality, and nearby woodland habitat) as well as connectivity using three connectivity approaches: (1) structural, (2) area-functional based on potential migration areas, and (3) path-functional based on the least accumulated cost paths. Values of landscape resistance were assigned according to a biological risk-based approach that is proposed as an enhanced, transparent expert-based approach. We further investigated cross-scale effects in amphibian responses to the environment by assessing the relative importance of pond and network characteristics as well as their interactions. Despite some species-specific characteristics, the area-functional approach of connectivity was generally the most effective in explaining species distribution by emphasising the relevance of potential migration areas as conservation units. Although pond conditions usually had a greater influence than network connectivity, we highlighted important cross-scale and threshold effects in species' response to local conditions, to pond connectivity, and to the availability of potentially suitable terrestrial habitats in the networks. Our cross-scale approach accounts for scale-dependent processes that potentially underlie amphibian distribution such as habitat selection and metapopulation dynamics. Both structural and functional connectivity should be considered as complementary features of pond connectivity when dispersal traits are likely to be less limiting. From a management perspective, our results encourage conservation plans to combine functional network-centred strategies with the preservation of local conditions. We give guidelines as to the features of such networks to help maintain amphibian populations in agricultural landscapes.

Our study was located along tributary stream networks, naturally fragmented in rapids, slow-flowing reaches, and lakes (i.e. process domains), in the Vindel River catchment in northern Sweden. We tested whether landscape characteristics, specifically to what extent the geomorphology (affecting local abiotic conditions), species richness, and species composition (representing the species pool for recolonisation), as well as the proximity to various upstream process domains (determining the dispersal potential), can predict post-restoration recovery of riparian vegetation. Our results indicate that post-restoration recovery of riparian vegetation richness or composition is not strongly related to landscape-scale species pools in these streams. The restored rapids were most similar to upstream rapids, geomorphically and floristically, including plant traits. Species richness of adjacent landscape units (upstream process domains or lateral upland zone) did not correlate with that of restored rapids, and proximity of upstream rapids or other process domains was only weakly influential, thus diminishing support for the hypothesis that hydrochory or other means of propagule dispersal plays a strong role in riparian vegetation community organisation after restoration in this fragmented stream network. We conclude that, in these naturally fragmented stream systems with three discrete process domains (rapids, slow-flowing reaches and lakes), hydrochory is probably not the main predictor for short-term riparian vegetation recovery. Therefore, other factors than landscape context can serve in prioritising restoration and, in these systems, local factors are likely to outweigh landscape connectivity in the recovery of riparian vegetation.

Positive co-occurrence between feeding-associative savannah fishes depends on species and habitat	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						commensalism; feeding association; freshwater; Leporinus; positive interaction; river	STRESS-GRADIENT HYPOTHESIS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; REEF FISHES; FACILITATION; MUTUALISM; PATTERNS; MODEL; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; OUTCOMES	Understanding the relative importance of abiotic factors and biotic interactions in determining species co-occurrence is a fundamental goal in ecology. Most studies of ecology of freshwater fishes have focused on negative biotic interactions (competition and predation), and much less is known about more positive interactions. The goal of this study was to quantify the relative importance of habitat features and biotic interactions (positive and negative) on co-occurrence of three pairs of feeding-associative Leporinus (L.) fishes in rivers of central Brazil (L. friderici-L.octomaculatus, L.striatus-L.octomaculatus, L.friderici-L.striatus). We sampled 146 sites on two rivers of central Brazil and used two-species occupancy models to examine the relative importance of habitat features and commensalistic feeding association for determining co-occurrence of the three species pairs. Using an information-theoretic framework, we compared weight-of-evidence for models containing effects of habitat covariates only, biotic interactions only, and their combination. Model evidence supported the hypothesis that feeding activity of L.friderici facilitates occurrence of L.octomaculatus and that the interaction is mediated by habitat covariates. In contrast, most evidence suggested that occurrence of L.striatus is independent of L.friderici, and is instead determined entirely by habitat features. Evidence for facilitation of L.octomaculatus by L.striatus was mixedthere is evidence supporting the habitat-only hypothesis as well as habitat-mediated facilitation. Our results suggest that positive interactions can affect co-occurrence among freshwater fishes, at least for species that interact strongly. More facultative interactions, such as those between L.friderici and L.striatus, may be less important, at least in certain abiotic contexts. This study indicates that biotic interactions between species of freshwater fish can be evident beyond the microhabitat scale to positively influence species co-occurrence and adds to evidence from other groups of freshwater organisms indicating the importance of biotic interactions in facilitating species co-occurrence.

Damming interacts with the flood pulse to alter zooplankton communities in an Amazonian river	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						hydrological period; Jirau Hydroelectric Power Plant; Madeira River; run-of-river dam; zooplankton community structure	ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; METACOMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPATIAL PROCESSES; REGRESSION TREES; TESTATE AMEBAS; MADEIRA RIVER; LONG-TERM; FISH; DIVERSITY; PLANKTON	Flow modification of lotic ecosystems is one of the main threats to global freshwater biodiversity. Commonly, and in the river studied here, modification results from hydroelectric dam installation. We evaluated the impacts of damming on zooplankton communities in the Amazonian floodplain of the Madeira River (Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil) following construction in 2012 of the run-of-river dam of Jirau Hydroelectric Power Plant. Using data sampled between 2009 and 2015, we tested for discontinuities in zooplankton community composition attributable to damming and the naturally occurring flood pulse. The flood pulse remained the main predictor explaining variation in zooplankton community structure even with the installation of the dam on the Madeira River. Despite this, discontinuities for the entire zooplankton community and for the main compositional groups (testate amoebae, rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods) were detected in relation to the dam (pre-/post-dam periods), mainly in ebb and low water, and with weaker evidence of dam effects during flood and highwater hydrological periods. A multivariate regression tree explained 9.6% of the variation in zooplankton communities and identified four groups: (1) flood and high-water periods; (2) low water post-dam; (3) low water pre-dam; and (4) ebb hydrological periods. The deviance in each multivariate regression tree node was attributable to variation in eight rotifer, three testate amoeba, and three copepod taxa. Our study demonstrates that the flood pulse, dam construction, and interaction between both of these factors affect zooplankton community structure in the Madeira River. While for many zooplankton community variables, effects occurred mainly during ebb and low-water periods, some effects were also observed during high water and flood periods. We thus recommend the establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring programme during all hydrological periods in tropical floodplain rivers and the addition of sampling sites downstream from dams. Many rivers in the world are increasingly disrupted by multiple dams, yet little is known of their effects, especially for run-of-river dams. Our study identified short-term impacts of only one run-of-river dam on zooplankton communities. More research is needed on the effects of multiple run-of-river dams on zooplankton and other biota, especially in tropical floodplain rivers, so that negative effects can be understood and ameliorated.

Contrasting Habitat Use and Population Dynamics of Reef Manta Rays Within the Nusa Penida Marine Protected Area, Indonesia	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mobula alfredi; citizen science; photo-identification; population structure; animal behavior; site fidelity; nursery; tourism management	REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY; SITE FIDELITY; ALFREDI; MOVEMENTS; SHARKS; PARK; TOURISM; IDENTIFICATION; AGGREGATION; DISTURBANCE	Manta rays (Mobula spp.) are highly valued in nature-based tourism globally. In Indonesia, although manta rays are protected, critical information is lacking on their habitat use, population dynamics and movements. We investigate the population structure and residency patterns of reef manta rays (Mobula alfrech) in the Nusa Penida Marine Protected Area (MPA). From photo-identification data logged by citizen scientists and trained observers (mantamatcher.org ), we identified 624 reef manta rays from 5,913 sightings (January 2012-April 2018) based on their unique ventral coloration patterns. Year-round records were collected from two shallow (<20 m) reefs - Manta Bay (MB; n = 3,029 sightings) and Manta Point (MP; n = 3,058) - that are used frequently by tourism operators. Maximum likelihood techniques and a Markov movement analysis were used to model residency patterns and movement between these sites within the MPA. Manta rays at MB were predominantly male (64%, n = 261 individuals), with immature males (14%, n = 59) being sighted most frequently (39%, n = 1,170). In contrast, few immature individuals were sighted at MP (6%, n = 28), and they were sighted on few occasions (2%, n = 45), while mature female manta rays comprised 26% (n = 127) of the MP community and were the most frequently sighted (48%, n = 1,413). Lagged identification rates indicated high site fidelity at each location. However, 44% (n = 278) of individuals moved between the two sites and cumulative discovery curves showed a continued recruitment of individuals over the 6 years of the study. In addition, the behaviors displayed by the manta rays differed markedly between the two sites: MB appears to be a foraging ground, especially for juveniles, and potentially a nursery, while MP is used mainly for cleaning and courtship, indicating a social and reproductive site. Reproductive behavior coincided with the peak annual sightings in May. To prevent were disturbance to this threatened species by tourism, regulations for the number of boats and interactions, especially during key reproductive times should be considered. Further, strict fishing regulation in the area is recommended as fishing gear entanglement was identified as a threat to this population.	[Germanov, Elitza S.; Chabanne, Delphine B.

Running waters in Mediterranean regions are strongly regulated by dams, which produce significant alterations to natural flow regimes. Climate change will reduce discharge and increase flow intermittence in Mediterranean streams, which will lead to an intensified flow regulation to meet water demands. Very little is known about how the functional features of aquatic communities vary along combined anthropogenic flow alteration and natural intermittence gradients. 2. As intermittent streams are subjected to natural stress (droughts and flash floods), the flow regime alteration effect may differ from that observed in perennial rivers. Consequently, studies that aim to determine the effects of flow regulation on the functioning of aquatic communities in a global change context are crucial. 3. By applying linear mixed-effect models and null models to the macroinvertebrate communities from 65 stream sites in the Segura River Basin (south-east Spain), we assessed the separate effects of natural flow intermittence and flow regulation, as well as their interaction, on biological traits and functional diversity indices. 4. Natural flow intermittence and flow regulation were mainly associated with loss of taxa with semivoltine or univoltine cycles and more sensitive aquatic stages (i.e. eggs), and with the replacement by taxa with multivoltine cycles and more resistant aquatic stages (i.e. adults). Flow regulation intensified the impact of natural flow intermittence on some biological traits, producing synergistic effects (i.e. decreasing interstitial taxa and tegument breathers and increasing taxa with aquatic adult stages). At the same time, antagonistic (life cycle) and opposing (shredders) interaction effects were also observed. Functional diversity, functional dispersion, and functional redundancy underwent a non-random decrease as the flow regime alteration increased, and a significant antagonistic interaction was also found between both stressors for functional redundancy. 5. In general, flow regulation effects were stronger in perennial than in intermittent streams because natural intermittence imposes a previous eco-evolutionary pressure on aquatic biota by selecting those resistant or recovery traits that confer resilience to anthropogenic flow regime alterations. Thus, the natural flow regime influences the functional sensibility of communities to anthropogenic flow alteration.

The terrestrial invertebrate fauna of EdgeOya, Svalbard: Arctic landscape community composition reflects biogeography patterns	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Invertebrates; Diversity; Landscape ecology; Polar; Dispersal	GLACIAL SURVIVAL; BARENTS SEA; ACARI; SPITSBERGEN; REDESCRIPTION; MESOSTIGMATA; DIPTERA; BIODIVERSITY; TEMPERATURE; ECOLOGY	Colonisation and immigration history is often neglected as a factor when investigating community or species distribution patterns. However, for dynamic systems that are still reacting to large-scale environmental change, such as the retreat of the ice since the last glacial maximum, colonisation history may explain a large amount of the variation between geographically distinct communities. The High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard presents an opportunity to test whether it is possible to observe the effects of large-scale biogeographical patterns on species distribution at landscape scales. Svalbard has one of the best described inventories of the invertebrate fauna in the Arctic. Nonetheless, the majority of the species records originate from the more accessible west coast and the invertebrate fauna of the whole eastern region, including EdgeOya, is virtually unknown. EdgeOya is located at the eastern fringe of the archipelago on the boundary between Palaearctic and Nearctic faunas. It was expected that post-colonisation dispersal within EdgeOya would conceal routes to the archipelago. Samples were obtained from six locations along the coast of EdgeOya between 2009 and 2010. 140 invertebrate species were identified belonging to 69 different genera of which 16 are new records for Svalbard. Most new species present an eastern Palaearctic distribution. Habitat variables (percentage cover of moss, lichen, vascular plant, or bare soil) fail to explain 35.5% of the differences among sites. However, cluster analysis reveals a clear east-west distribution pattern across the island suggesting that pan-Arctic dispersal routes can be identified even at relatively short geographical scales.

Genetic and morphological variations of the lichenized fungus Steinera intricata (Arctomiaceae, Lecanoromycetes) from southern South America to Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cyanolichens; Taxonomy; Species diversity; Arctomiaceae; Southern Hemisphere	CYANOBACTERIAL LICHENS; SPECIES DELIMITATION; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; 2016 CLASSIFICATION; CETRARIA-ACULEATA; HIDDEN DIVERSITY; RIBOSOMAL DNA; ASCOMYCOTA	Steinera (Arctomiaceae, Lecanoromycetes) is an Austral genus of lichenized fungi that form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria, producing small and inconspicuous thalli. Most species of Steinera present a high degree of endemism restricted to sub-Antarctic islands except S. intricata which occurs from southern South America to the Antarctic Peninsula and presents remarkable phenotypic variation along its distribution range. In this study, an integrative approach was used to explore the extent of intraspecific diversity of S. intricata throughout its distribution. Morphological and anatomical descriptions and the phylogenetic analyses of three genomic regions were performed with specimens collected from seven Antarctic islands and in the Tierra del Fuego National Park (Argentina). Genetic data revealed species-level lineages are not associated with the differences observed in the thalli shape, which probably are related to distinct microhabitats and substrates as well as to the development stage. Molecular clock analyses estimated that S. intricata originated at about 0.24 Myr and that the diversification of the Antarctic lineages occurred at about 0.16 Myr. This study revealed that there is probably an unknown diversity of new members of Steinera in southern South America and that the evolutionary history of these cyanolichens may contribute to the understanding of the phylogeographic connections between members of the Austral-Antarctic flora.

Behaviour and characteristics of mating polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Beaufort Sea, Canada	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Polar bear; Ursus maritimus; Mating behaviour; Beaufort Sea; Sexual dimorphism; Polygyny	SEXUAL SELECTION; BODY-MASS; REPRODUCTION; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; GROWTH; COMPETITION; AGE; PREDATION; SYSTEM	The dynamic sea ice habitat of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) influences their mating behaviour because it makes the distribution of mates unpredictable. Pronounced sexual dimorphism of polar bears likely results from a polygynous mating system, where intrasexual competition between males influences reproductive access to females. We examine aspects of the mating behaviour of polar bears in the Beaufort Sea, Canada, from 1970 to 2014 based on 135 breeding pairs observed from March through May. Mean age of paired females and paired males was 9.7 and 11.5years, respectively. Paired males were older (by 2.2years) and had significantly higher mass (71kg) than unpaired males suggesting a polygynous mating system in which larger, dominant, and potentially experienced males monopolise access to females. Our binomial logistic regression suggested age was the most important factor in predicting pairing in males, which can be explained by the correlation between age and body size. Paired females had significantly higher labial development than lone females, suggesting that labial swelling is heightened during mating. Taken together, these observed characteristics suggest a polygynous mating system in polar bears, providing further insight into potential mating system variation across their range.	[Biddlecombe, B.

Killer whales (Orcinus orca), the top predators in marine ecosystems, are increasing their presence in the Arctic following the ice cover loss. The impact of killer whales on marine ecosystems differs dramatically across ecotypes: resident' R-type killer whales feed mostly on large fish, while transient' T-type whales feed mostly on marine mammals. We analyze the differences in geographical distribution of killer whale ecotypes in the western North Pacific in order to predict the potential effects of climate change on their range and the consequential impact on Arctic ecosystems. We show that R-type whales prevail in the coastal waters of eastern Kamchatka, Commander and Kuril Islands and in the central Okhotsk Sea, while T-type whales dominate the coastal waters of Chukotka and the coastal Okhotsk Sea. The most prominent difference between these areas is depth: in the regions where R-type whales prevail, deep waters occur close to shore, while the regions dominated by T-type whales are represented by wide shallows covered with ice in winter. We propose several hypotheses to explain this large-scale segregation, including distribution of prey species and ice cover. Habitat preferences suggest that range expansion in the Arctic induced by climate change will likely involve mostly T-type killer whales and consequently increase the predation pressure on marine mammals to a greater extent than on fish stocks. This should be considered in further studies and prediction models highlighting Arctic marine ecosystems change.

Diversity and structure of epibenthic communities of the red algae zone in the White Sea	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Hard bottom; Red algae; Biodiversity; Epibiosis; White Sea	EARLY FOULING COMMUNITIES; LAMINARIA-DIGITATA; KANDALAKSHA BAY; BIODIVERSITY; BIOMASS; KELP; ASSEMBLAGES; SUBSTRATE; ABUNDANCE; ZONATION	At high latitudes, the marine transitional zone between the highly productive kelp communities and the devoid of vegetation deep-waters is occupied mainly by number of red algae species, both encrusting and cespitose, which associate with rich and diverse fauna. However, zoologists and botanists never scrutinized these communities in equal manner up to present. We investigated the transition red algae zone in the White Sea in summer 2016 and 2017 using scuba equipment. The photic depth is limited to 18-23m at different locations. Sessile species prevail among 315 epibenthic organisms in species number (similar to 80%) and biomass (similar to 90%). Communities of the red algae zone are rich in species (from 54 to 177). The most distinct differences were observed between the communities of Kandalaksha and Onega Bays. Vertical heterogeneity of the red algae zone was revealed; at most locations, Rhodophyta predominate in the upper subzone and Cirripedia predominate in the lower parts of the red algae zone. At the investigated depths, shallow-water and deep-water sets of species were defined. Interspecific spatial interactions between sessile organisms are revealed: 72.2 +/- 3.5% of them were recorded as epibionts, and 29.1 +/- 2.5% were registered as basibionts. These interactions provide evidence of the increase of species diversity: 32.7 +/- 6.8% of sessile taxa were recorded exclusively as epibionts. Algae Phycodrys rubens, Odonthalia dentata, and Coccotylus truncatus, ascidian Styela rustica, barnacles Balanus crenatus, Verruca stroemia, and polychaete Pista maculata are foundation species, each supporting multi-level suites (up to four levels) of dependent species.

Long-term changes in the primary productivity of migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) calving grounds and summer pasture on the Quebec-Labrador Peninsula (Northeastern Canada): the mixed influences of climate change and caribou herbivory	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Caribou; Herbivory; Exploitation ecosystem hypothesis; Remote sensing; Primary productivity; Climate change	EXPLOITATION ECOSYSTEMS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PLANT PHENOLOGY; SHRUB COVER; VEGETATION; REINDEER; TUNDRA; FORAGE; HERD; RESPONSES	At high herbivore density, herbivory can reduce forage abundance, potentially contributing to habitat degradation and driving changes in herbivore population size or range use, in accordance with the exploitation ecosystem hypothesis. The migratory Riviere-George caribou herd (RGH, Rangifer tarandus) of the Quebec-Labrador Peninsula (Canada) has experienced a large decline in population size since the population peaked in the early 1990s, with similarly large changes in seasonal range use. Demographic changes are suspected to have influenced forage abundance and caribou range use through density-dependent interactions between caribou and their habitat. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to examine relationships between RGH caribou density and range productivity from 1991 to 2011. A modelling approach was used to control for the response of climate and to isolate the influence of caribou herbivory on primary productivity. Significant negative relationships were identified between caribou density and primary productivity, after controlling for climatic variation, for the global RGH calving grounds (r(2) = 0.54-0.55) and summer range (r(2) = 0.42-0.51), but not for the core ranges, where caribou density was highest. Positive temporal trends in primary productivity appeared to reflect the decline in RGH population size, suggesting vegetation recovery following reductions in caribou abundance. Climate warming (of up to + 1.5 degrees C per decade) was most responsible for the strong positive trends in primary productivity observed over the 1991-2011 period, but decreases in RGH herbivory likely also contributed to the increases in range productivity. Forage access likely improved over the study period, which may have influenced RGH range use and habitat selection.

However, recent studies have revealed contrasting findings and critical knowledge gaps regarding the impacts of biosurfactants on the soil PAH biodegradation efficiency and microbial community. Here, a laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the impact of rhamnolipid on the PAH dissipation efficiency and microbial community structure during the time-course incubation. The data showed that the contribution ratio of biotic loss and abiotic loss depended on the ring number of PAH. In the microcosms supplemented with 20gg(-1) rhamnolipid, the biodegradation efficiencies of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene increased by 10.1%, 12.3%, and 22.0%, respectively, compared to those in the rhamnolipid-free treatment after incubation for 7days. In contrast, rhamnolipid either had no impact on or inhibited PAH degradation in the later time points (21-35days). The abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA and phnAc genes showed significant increase in soil amended of both PAH and rhamnolipid. MiSeq sequencing results revealed that potential PAHs-degrading Massilia, Bacillus, Lysobacter, Archrobacter, and Phenylobacterium became dominant genera in PAH treatment, irrespective of the rhamnolipid added. Nevertheless, PAH addition in the presence of rhamnolipid also significantly stimulated the growth of Delftia, Brevundimonas, Tumebacillus, and Geobacillus. In contrast, the rhamnolipid altered the microbial community composition through the selection of Gaiella, Solirubrobacter, Nocardioides, and Bacillus. The results reveal the intensive selectivity effect of PAH and rhamnolipid on the soil microbes that are involved in bioremediation, and highlight the positive effect on PAHs biodegradation.

They should be more defensive when they breed early in the season, when they produce more young, or as their young get older. Beyond these plastic changes, associations among traits could be explained by consistent among-individual differences. Separating the mechanisms at the origin of behavioral phenotypic variation is essential to understand the determinants and evolution of parental care. During four breeding seasons, we investigated whether variation in Canada goose (Branta canadensis) nest defense resulted from individual short-term plastic adjustments to reproductive stage within breeding seasons, plastic adjustments to brood value across breeding seasons, or from long-term among-individual differences. We thus estimated the among- and within-individual relationships between nest defense, clutch size, and laying date. Female and male nest defense behaviors were highly repeatable in time (R=0.72 and 0.67 on the short term). At the among-individual level, we found no significant association between female nest defense and life history traits, but the more defensive males were mated with the more fecund females. Female and male nest defense was not adjusted to annual variation in laying date nor in clutch size. However, females adjusted their nest defense within each breeding season and became more defensive when approaching egg hatching. Thus, Canada goose nest defense behavior is partly explained by plastic adjustments, but also by consistent among-individual differences which indicate the evolutionary potential of nest defense behavior.Significance statementAn association between traits at the phenotypic level can be partitioned into association at the among- and within-individual levels. This allows to better understand covariation of traits resulting from both among-individual differences and phenotypic plasticity. We observed 141 Canada goose pairs to identify what affected the intensity of their nest defense behavior. We found that geese were very consistent in their nest defense behavior and that female fecundity was related to male personality. Females also became more defensive as their young got older. Analyzing different sources of variation in parental behaviors enables a better understanding of their evolution. Our study also demonstrates the importance of studying nest defense in both sexes even in species where only females incubate eggs, as both sexes can invest in nest defense.

Here, I investigated the relationship between personality and microhabitat use in a free-living population of the clonal gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris. The study site is a small beachfront forest facing two environments with contrasting levels of human disturbance. I conducted a mark-recapture survey to assess the geckos' spacing pattern and evaluated their boldness and exploration scores in the laboratory. The geckos exhibited a small range of movement and a high consistency in their perch height. Boldness was related to two microhabitat features, but exploration was not. Relatively shy geckos were found in trees near the roadside and on low branches, whereas relatively bold geckos were found on both the beachside and the roadside and on low to high branches. These patterns suggest that geckos in high-disturbance microhabitats may have frequently experienced artificial stimuli and become shy. However, the present results cannot exclude the possibility that individual differences are caused by other factors and that different personality types prefer and settle in different microhabitats. Although the actual mechanisms are unclear, my findings highlight that behaviour-related habitat use emerges even in clonal animals.Significance statementIndividuals within conspecifics show different spacing patterns and different behavioural tendencies. If clonal animals live in a spatially diverse environment, it is predicted that different microhabitats may gradually shape different personality types through developmental plasticity. Here, I investigated the association between the personality of clonal geckos and their microhabitat use in different levels of human disturbance. In contrast to the prediction, both juveniles and adults showed a similar pattern of boldness-related microhabitats; relatively shy individuals were found in putatively high-disturbance sites. This result suggests that the association between boldness and microhabitats is not gradually formed through a long-time scale but is likely generated within their early ontogenetic stage.

To test whether co-occurrence patterns of native versus alien species are structured by environmental filtering or biotic associations. Location Mediterranean, Iberian Peninsula, Ebro River catchment. Methods We modelled freshwater fish distributions and their association with environmental conditions using a hurdle model-like approach involving boosted regression trees. Additionally, we applied a joint species distribution model to quantify the co-occurrence of native versus alien fish species that can be attributed to shared environmental responses or potentially to biotic interactions. Results Our results point to environmental factors, rather than biotic associations, as major correlates of the increase of alien and the decline of native fishes in the Ebro River. We observed contrasting patterns of native versus alien species along the upstream-downstream gradient. Alien species dominated in the lower reaches associated with warmer temperatures, higher shares of intensive land use and appeared facilitated by dams and river regulation. Native species richness was highest in the larger tributaries followed by a strong decline in the main stem which was related to the river network position and land use type. Fragmentation played a subordinate role in explaining fish richness and abundance patterns. Main conclusions Given the strong association with temperature, a further range expansion of alien fishes in the Ebro with future climate change may be expected. More local-scale factors related to habitat degradation and hydrologic alteration will further exacerbate the invasion success of many alien fishes. Further multiple, independent species introductions might mask isolation and fragmentation effects of dams on the future spread and distribution of alien fish.

We aim to uncover the variables driving mangrove biodiversity and produce baseline biodiversity maps for the Sundarbans world heritage site-the Earth's largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem. Location The Bangladesh Sundarbans, South Asia. Methods We collected species abundance, environmental and disturbance data from 110 permanent sample plots (PSPs) covering the entire Bangladesh Sundarbans (6,017 km(2)). We applied generalized additive models to determine the key variables shaping the spatial distributions of mangrove diversity and community composition. Biodiversity maps were constructed using covariate-driven habitat models, and their predictive performances were compared with covariate-free (i.e., direct interpolation) approaches to see whether the inclusion of habitat variables bolster spatial predictions of biodiversity or whether we can rely on direct interpolation approaches when environmental data are not available. Results Historical forest exploitation, disease, siltation and soil alkalinity were the key stressors causing loss of alpha and gamma diversity in mangrove communities. Both alpha and gamma diversity increased along the downstream-to-upstream and riverbank-to-forest interior gradients. Mangrove communities subjected to intensive past tree harvesting, disease outbreaks and siltation were more homogeneous in species composition (beta diversity). In contrast, heterogeneity in species composition increased along decreasing salinity and downstream-to-upstream gradients. We find that the surviving biodiversity hotspots (comprising many globally endangered tree species) are located outside the established protected area network and hence open to human exploitation. We therefore suggest bringing them immediately under protected area management. Main conclusions We provide the first habitat-based modelling and mapping of alpha, beta and gamma diversity in threatened mangrove communities. In general, habitat-based models showed better predictive ability than the covariate-free approach. Nevertheless, the small margin of differences between the approaches demonstrates the utility of direct interpolation approaches when environmental data are unavailable.

Additionally, we propose an easily calculated index that can be used to highlight areas with unique species composition for conservation planning. We estimated the strengths of associations between environmental factors and species richness and rarity. Location Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil, covering about 150,000 ha harbouring different marine habitats. Methods We used the Marine Rapid Assessment Protocol at 42 sites to gather information on environmental variables and species in six subtidal marine groups. We determined "singular" sites as the regions harbouring higher numbers of rare species. Then, we estimated the roles of species loss and turnover on the observed total variation among sites. We used Generalized Linear Model to partition the relative importance of the selected environmental factors in driving variation in species richness and singularity. Results The singularity index and richness showed that the bay could be divided into three subregions for subtidal communities. Richness and rarity were structured at different spatial scales and associated with environmental variables related to water productivity and nutrients but varied among taxonomic groups. Community variation over space was largely associated with turnover of species. Main conclusions Higher singularity and richness on the western side of the bay and around the main island suggested that these regions should be conservation priorities, but high species turnover across the whole bay indicated that portions of the central channel should be included in conservation strategies. This draws attention to the importance of community variation rather than just species numbers in conservation and management planning. The high species turnover indicated that these rocky reefs have high beta diversity when compared to other studied biological systems.

Spatially explicit species distribution models: A missed opportunity in conservation planning?	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Bayesian hierarchical modelling; connectivity; gurobi; integer linear programming; spatial autocorrelation; spatial unit	BIOCLIMATE ENVELOPE MODELS; AUTOCORRELATION; MARINE; CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; ACCURACY; NETWORK; DESIGN	Aim Systematic conservation planning is vital for allocating protected areas given the spatial distribution of conservation features, such as species. Due to incomplete species inventories, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used for predicting species' habitat suitability and species' probability of occurrence. Currently, SDMs mostly ignore spatial dependencies in species and predictor data. Here, we provide a comparative evaluation of how accounting for spatial dependencies, that is, autocorrelation, affects the delineation of optimized protected areas. Location Southeast Australia, Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf, Danube River Basin. Methods We employ Bayesian spatially explicit and non-spatial SDMs for terrestrial, marine and freshwater species, using realm-specific planning unit shapes (grid, hexagon and subcatchment, respectively). We then apply the software gurobi to optimize conservation plans based on species targets derived from spatial and non-spatial SDMs (10%-50% each to analyse sensitivity), and compare the delineation of the plans. Results Across realms and irrespective of the planning unit shape, spatially explicit SDMs (a) produce on average more accurate predictions in terms of AUC, TSS, sensitivity and specificity, along with a higher species detection probability. All spatial optimizations meet the species conservation targets. Spatial conservation plans that use predictions from spatially explicit SDMs (b) are spatially substantially different compared to those that use non-spatial SDM predictions, but (c) encompass a similar amount of planning units. The overlap in the selection of planning units is smallest for conservation plans based on the lowest targets and vice versa. Main conclusions Species distribution models are core tools in conservation planning. Not surprisingly, accounting for the spatial characteristics in SDMs has drastic impacts on the delineation of optimized conservation plans. We therefore encourage practitioners to consider spatial dependencies in conservation features to improve the spatial representation of future protected areas.

Yet as highly mobile species with multiple needs in the landscape, bats impose serious modelling challenges, such as advanced use of neighbourhood analyses. The aims of this study were to test the use of a designed sampling of bats for biodiversity and conservation assessments, and to find appropriate modelling solutions for providing nature practitioners with reliable potential bat distribution maps in a mountain area of high conservation interest. Location The western Swiss Alps of Vaud. Methods We conducted a one-year field survey combining passive acoustic recordings supplemented by mist net catching to collect data on bats. These data were then used to create univariate models with focal land use/cover variables using different focal window sizes to detect the optimal species-specific scale of influence for each variable. The large number of selected variables was then used to create ensembles of small models at a 100 m x 100 m resolution, and the resulting habitat suitability maps were transformed into species distribution maps for practitioners. Results We were able to collect data to model 14 different bat species representing 66% of the Swiss bat diversity, including four red list species. In general, the most important variables were Euclidean distance to road or water, temperature and slope, but there was large variation among species both for the variable importance and for the optimal focal window size. Main conclusion Our study greatly increased the knowledge of bats in this region and showed that many of the red list species are nowadays disappearing from the intensively used lowland plains and restricted to the remaining forests along the slopes. Additionally, we highlighted the importance of selecting the variable scale on a species-specific basis accounting for their mobility and range sizes.

Distinguishing local and global correlates of population change in migratory species	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						carry-over effects; climate sensitivity; growth rate; migration; N-mixture model; shorebirds	SHOREBIRD POPULATIONS; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; CONSEQUENCES; HABITAT; BAY; DISTURBANCE; ABUNDANCE; INSIGHTS; DECLINES	Aim Understanding the processes driving population declines in migratory species can be challenging. Not only are monitoring data spatially and temporally sparse, but conditions in one location can carry over to indirectly (and disproportionately) affect the population in another location. Here, we explore whether remote factors can sequentially, and potentially cumulatively, influence local population fluctuations in declining populations of shorebirds. Location Moreton Bay (Australia) and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Methods We use N-mixture models to account for variable observer effort and estimate yearly population growth rate. We then use least squares regressions to correlate population growth rates with remotely sensed climate anomalies at different migratory stages. From this, we estimate species-specific climate sensitivity indices and explore whether species which are declining more rapidly, or which rely more heavily on areas undergoing rapid habitat loss, have higher climate sensitivity indices. Results We find that species which rely more on the Yellow Sea during migratory stopover (a region which has undergone severe habitat loss) are more sensitive to rainfall anomalies in their Arctic breeding grounds, suggesting that habitat loss reduces the resilience of shorebirds to climate extremes. Furthermore, species with higher sensitivities to climatic conditions during stopover are also those which are declining quickest, suggesting that declining populations may also be less resilient to climate fluctuations at bottleneck sites. We also observed species-specific correlations between climate anomalies at all migratory stages and population growth rates, primarily for eastern curlew and lesser sand plover. Main conclusion By applying methods in combination, it is possible to use citizen science data from a single location in a flyway of over 160 sites up to 11,680 km apart, to investigate how different stressors correlate with local population dynamics.

Here, we provide predictions of the impacts of a changing climate on species' geographical ranges within high-latitude mountain flora on a sub-continental scale. We then examined the forecasted changes in relation to species' biogeographic histories. Location Fennoscandia, Northern Europe (55-72 degrees N). Methods We examined the sensitivity of 164 high-latitude mountain species to changing climate by modelling their distributions in regard to climate, local topography and geology at a 1 km(2) resolution. Using an ensemble of six statistical modelling techniques and data on current (1981-2010) and future (2070-2099) climate based on three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 8.5), we developed projections of current and future ranges. Results The average species richness of the mountain flora is predicted to decrease by 15%-47% per 1 km(2) cell, depending on the climate scenario considered. Arctic flora is projected to undergo severe range loss along with non-poleward range contractions, while alpine flora is forecasted to find suitable habitat in a warmer North. A substantial majority (71%-92%) of the studied species are projected to lose more than half of their present range by the year 2100. Species predicted to lose all suitable habitat had ranges centred in the northernmost (>68 degrees N) part of continental Europe. Main conclusions Climate change is predicted to substantially diminish the extent and richness of Europe's high-latitude mountain flora. Interestingly, species' biogeographic histories affect their vulnerability to climate change. The vulnerability of true Arctic and endemic species marks them as highly important for conservation decisions.

Predicting range shifts of Asian elephants under global change	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Asian elephant; climate change; habitat loss; range shift; seasonality; South Asia; species distribution modelling; water balance	LAND-USE CHANGE; SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; EXTINCTION RISK; EXTREME WET; DRY SPELLS; MODELS; COMMUNITY	Aim Climate change alters the water cycle, potentially affecting the distribution of species. Using an ensemble of species distribution models (SDMs), we predicted changes in distribution of the Asian elephant in South Asia due to increasing climatic variability under warming climate and human pressures. Location India and Nepal. Methods We compiled a comprehensive geodatabase of 115 predictor variables, which included climatic, topographic, human pressures and land use, at a resolution of 1 km(2), and an extensive database on current distribution of elephants. For variable selection, we first developed 14 candidate models based on different hypotheses on elephant habitat selection. For each candidate model, a series of 240 individual models were evaluated using several metrics. Using three climatic and one land use change datasets for two greenhouse gas scenarios, ensemble SDMs were used to predict future projections. Results Nine predictor variables were selected for ensemble SDMs. Elephant distribution is driven predominantly by changes in climatic water balance (>60%), followed by changes in temperature and human-induced disturbance. The results suggest that around 41.8% of the 256,518 km(2) of habitat available at present will be lost by the end of this century due to combined effects of climate change and human pressure. Projected habitat loss will be higher in human-dominated sites at lower elevations due to intensifying droughts, leading elephants to seek refuge at higher elevations along valleys with greater water availability in the Himalayan Mountains. Main conclusions Changes in climatic water balance could play a crucial role in driving species distributions in regions with monsoonal climates. In response, species would shift their range upwards along gradients of water availability and seasonal droughts. Conservation and management of elephant populations under global change should include design of movement corridors to enable dispersal of the elephant and other associated species to more conducive environments.

Food-dependent growth and within-species size variation depend on temperature and affect community dynamics through feedbacks between individual performance and population size structure. Still, we know little about how warming affects these feedbacks. Using a dynamic stage-structured biomass model with food-, size- and temperature-dependent life history processes, we analyse how temperature affects coexistence, stability and size structure in a tri-trophic food chain, and find that warming effects on community stability depend on ecological interactions. Predator biomass densities generally decline with warming - gradually or through collapses - depending on which consumer life stage predators feed on. Collapses occur when warming induces alternative stable states via Allee effects. This suggests that predator persistence in warmer climates may be lower than previously acknowledged and that effects of warming on food web stability largely depend on species interactions.

To anticipate these shifts, we need to understand the forces that determine where species currently occur. We tested whether a long-hypothesised trade-off between climate and competitive constraints explains where tree species grow on mountain slopes. Using tree rings, we reconstructed growth sensitivity to climate and competition in range centre and range margin tree populations in three climatically distinct regions. We found that climate often constrains growth at environmentally harsh elevational range boundaries, and that climatic and competitive constraints trade-off at large spatial scales. However, there was less evidence that competition consistently constrained growth at benign elevational range boundaries; thus, local-scale climate-competition trade-offs were infrequent. Our work underscores the difficulty of predicting local-scale range dynamics, but suggests that the constraints on tree performance at a large-scale (e.g. latitudinal) may be predicted from ecological theory.

Coexistence theory for two competing species posits that intraspecific density dependence should be stronger than interspecific density dependence. Great tits and blue tits are two bird species that compete for food resources and nesting cavities. On the basis of long-term monitoring of these two competing species at sites across Europe, combining observational and manipulative approaches, we show that the strength of density regulation is similar for both species, and that individuals have contrasting abilities to compete depending on their age. For great tits, density regulation is driven mainly by intraspecific competition. In contrast, for blue tits, interspecific competition contributes as much as intraspecific competition, consistent with asymmetric competition between the two species. In addition, including age-specific effects of intra- and interspecific competition in density-dependence models improves predictions of fluctuations in population size by up to three times.

Laboratory studies show that environmental factors, particularly diet, are important, while comparative work emphasises host genetics. Here, we compare the influence of host genetics and the environment on the microbiota of sympatric small mammal species (mice, voles, shrews) across multiple habitats. While sharing a habitat caused some microbiota convergence, the influence of species identity dominated. In all three host genera examined, an individual's microbiota was more similar to conspecifics living elsewhere than to heterospecifics at the same site. Our results suggest this species-specificity arises in part through host-microbe codiversification. Stomach contents analysis suggested that diet also shapes the microbiota, but where diet is itself influenced by species identity. In this way, we can reconcile the importance of both diet and genetics, while showing that species identity is the strongest predictor of microbiota composition.	[Knowles, S. C.

A balance of winners and losers in the Anthropocene	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Anthropogenic; biodiversity; colonisation; extinction; population change	LOCAL BIODIVERSITY CHANGE; TIME-SERIES; TRENDS; CONSERVATION; METAANALYSIS; POPULATIONS; BIASES	Scientists disagree about the nature of biodiversity change. While there is evidence for widespread declines from population surveys, assemblage surveys reveal a mix of declines and increases. These conflicting conclusions may be caused by the use of different metrics: assemblage metrics may average out drastic changes in individual populations. Alternatively, differences may arise from data sources: populations monitored individually, versus whole-assemblage monitoring. To test these hypotheses, we estimated population change metrics using assemblage data. For a set of 23 241 populations, 16 009 species, in 158 assemblages, we detected significantly accelerating extinction and colonisation rates, with both rates being approximately balanced. Most populations (85%) did not show significant trends in abundance, and those that did were balanced between winners (8%) and losers (7%). Thus, population metrics estimated with assemblage data are commensurate with assemblage metrics and reveal sustained and increasing species turnover.

When do herbivorous insects compete? A phylogenetic meta-analysis	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Competition; enemy-mediated; indirect competition; plant-mediated; tri-trophic interactions	INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS; PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS; PLANT; EVOLUTION; FACILITATION; MANIPULATION; RESISTANCE; BIAS	When herbivorous insects interact, they can increase or decrease each other's fitness. As it stands, we know little of what causes this variation. Classic competition theory predicts that competition will increase with niche overlap and population density. And classic hypotheses of herbivorous insect diversification predict that diet specialists will be superior competitors to generalists. Here, we test these predictions using phylogenetic meta-analysis. We estimate the effects of diet breadth, population density and proxies of niche overlap: phylogenetic relatedness, physical proximity and feeding-guild membership. As predicted, we find that competition between herbivorous insects increases with population density as well as phylogenetic and physical proximity. Contrary to predictions, competition tends to be stronger between than within feeding guilds and affects specialists as much as generalists. This is the first statistical evidence that niche overlap increases competition between herbivorous insects. However, niche overlap is not everything; complex feeding guild effects indicate important indirect interactions.

We examined the case of Eleutherodactylus frogs, which radiated in the Caribbean islands resulting in more than 160 species that occupy very diverse habitats. A time-calibrated phylogeny revealed that these frogs independently diversified on all larger islands producing species that occupy a broad range of microhabitats in different islands. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we found an association between morphological traits and particular microhabitats, and for most microhabitats detected significant morphological convergence. Our results indicate Caribbean Eleutherodactylus are a novel example of replicate radiations, and highlight the predictability of evolutionary processes, as similar ecological opportunities can lead to similar outcomes.

Multiple approaches to surface water quality assessment provide insight for small streams experiencing oil and natural gas development	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Surface disturbance; Sediment; Hydrocarbons; Macroinvertebrates; Water quality	SEMIPERMEABLE-MEMBRANE DEVICES; IMPACTS; SHALE; CONTAMINANTS; RISKS	Historic, current, and future oil and natural gas development can affect water quality in streams flowing through developed areas. We compared small stream drainages in a semiarid landscape with varying amounts of disturbance from oil and natural gas development to examine potential effects of this development on surface water quality. We used physical, chemical, and biological approaches to assess water quality and found several potential avenues of degradation. Surface disturbance likely contributed to elevated suspended sediment concentrations and spill history likely led to elevated stream polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations. In combination, these environmental stressors could explain the loss of aquatic macroinvertebrate taxon at sites highly affected by oil and natural gas development. Our results provide insight into advantages and disadvantages of approaches for assessing surface water quality in areas affected by oil and natural gas development.

Forest understories are critical yet under-observed ecosystems in which phenological patterns are both altered and obscured by overstory trees. We address the challenge of observing phenological dynamics in the understory by exploiting the physiological relationship between plant phenology and temperature accumulation, a horticultural principle we show to be preserved across spatial scales through a combination of field and growth-chamber observations. These observations provide the foundation for a spaceborne thermal-observation framework, which can trace the discrete phenophases of forest understory plants in near-real time. The thermal basis of this framework also enables the prediction of understory phenology for future climates, which we demonstrate here using Shepherdia canadensis, a widespread fruiting shrub of western North America that has important trophic connections to frugivores. Our approach enables researchers to assess the regional-scale impacts of climate change on bottom-up forest ecosystems and to monitor emerging trophic mismatches.

Beta diversity of stream fish communities along anthropogenic environmental gradients at multiple spatial scales	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Community dissimilarity; Disturbance; Biotic homogenization; Freshwater; Landscape	RIPARIAN FOREST BUFFERS; AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE; HOMOGENIZATION; ASSEMBLAGES; RIVER; DEFORESTATION; LANDSCAPE; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; HABITAT	Despite the importance of assessing beta diversity to understand the effects of human modifications on biological communities, there are almost no studies that properly addressed how beta diversity varies along anthropogenic gradients. We developed an algorithm to calculate beta diversity among a set of sites included in a moving window along any given environmental gradient. This allowed us to assess beta diversity among sites with similar conditions in terms of human modifications (e.g., land use or instream degradation). We investigated beta diversity using stream fish community data and indicators of human modification quantified at four spatial scales (whole catchment, riparian, local, and instream). Variation in beta diversity was dependent on the scale of human modifications (catchment, riparian, local, instream, and all four scales combined) and on the type of diversity considered (taxonomic or functional). We also found evidence for non-linear responses of both taxonomic and functional beta diversity to human-induced environmental alterations. Therefore, the response of beta diversity was more complex than expected, as it depended on the scale used to quantify human impact and exhibited opposite responses depending on the location along the environmental impact gradient and on whether the response was taxonomic or functional diversity. Anthropogenic modifications can introduce unexpected variability among stream communities, which means that low beta diversity may not necessarily indicate a degraded environmental condition and high beta diversity may not always indicate a reference environmental condition. This has implications for how we should consider beta diversity in environmental assessments.

Differences in Engineered Nanoparticle Surface Physicochemistry Revealed by Investigation of Changes in Copper Bioavailability During Sorption to Nanoparticles in the Aqueous Phase	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nanoparticles; Sorption; Titanium dioxide; Copper; Zebrafish; Chlorella vulgaris	TITANIUM-DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES; TIO2 NANOPARTICLES; PARTICLE-SIZE; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; ZN II; TOXICITY; WATER; ADSORPTION; EXPOSURE; REMOVAL	Sorption of chemical substances to nanoparticles (NPs) in the aqueous phase strongly influences NP physicochemisty, and investigations of these complex interactions can provide important insights into the environmental fate of NPs. The objective of the present study was to use differences in copper (Cu) bioavailability to investigate aqueous-phase sorption with NPs that had different physicochemical characteristics (silicon [Si], perovskite, and titanium dioxide NPs [TiO2 NPs]). Sorption of Cu with NPs was assessed by the presence of adsorbent in water and onto the NP surface after ultracentrifugation, and by changes in Cu bioavailability under static conditions during exposure of larval zebrafish, as well as under conditions of continuous agitation during exposure of the alga Chlorella vulgaris. The presence of TiO2 NPs reduced total Cu in the water column and Cu bioavailability (measured by growth inhibition, mortality, and metallothionein 2 gene expression), confirming Cu sorption to TiO2 NPs. Nanoparticle surface area was the most important factor that affected Cu sorption, as indicated by less bioavailable Cu in the presence of smaller TiO2 NPs. The surface area effect was consistent regardless of exposure conditions (alga, continuous agitation; zebrafish, static water) and was further supported by the fact that the lowest total Cu concentration in the water column was found in the presence of the smallest NP. The results differed with other NP types, for example, silicon NPs, in which Cu sorption was indicated by analytical chemistry, but sorption was not sufficient to significantly alter Cu bioavailability. The bioavailability tests did not indicate Cu sorption with perovskite NPs. The results demonstrate that surface area critically influences sorption, that Cu sorption as measured by bioavailability is not affected by agitation or static conditions, and that Cu sorption differs among types of NPs, indicating differences in their surface physicochemistry.

We explored the effects of a common herbicide (atrazine and alachlor) and fertilizer (urea) tank mixture on juvenile frog corticosterone stress levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and pesticide bioaccumulation. Single agrochemical or tank mixtures were applied to terrestrial microcosms, and then individual Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephala) juveniles were added to microcosms for an 8-h exposure. Afterward, frogs were transferred to aquatic microcosms for 1 h to monitor corticosterone prior to euthanasia, brain tissues were excised to evaluate AChE, and tissue homogenates were analyzed for pesticide bioconcentation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Atrazine significantly increased corticosterone in frogs, particularly when combined with alachlor and urea. Atrazine increased AChE and urea decreased AChE, although no interactive effects of chemical combinations were discernible. Relative to their individual treatments, the complete tank mixture with all 3 agrochemicals resulted in 64% greater bioconcentration of atrazine and 54% greater bioconcentration of alachlor in frog tissues. Our results suggest that agrochemical mixtures as well as their active ingredients can lead to altered stress levels and impaired physiological responses in amphibians. An improved understanding of the effects of co-exposure to environmental contaminants in amphibians is important in assessing the ecological risks these compounds pose.

Development of robust new approach methodologies and nontesting approaches requires the use of existing information via curated, integrated data sets. The ecological threshold of toxicological concern (ecoTTC) represents one such new approach methodology that can predict a conservative de minimis toxicity value for chemicals with little or no information available. For the creation of an ecoTTC tool, a large, diverse environmental data set was developed from multiple sources, with harmonization, characterization, and information quality assessment steps to ensure that the information could be effectively organized and mined. The resulting EnviroTox database contains 91 217 aquatic toxicity records representing 1563 species and 4016 unique Chemical s Service numbers and is a robust, curated database containing high-quality aquatic toxicity studies that are traceable to the original information source. Chemical-specific information is also linked to each record and includes physico-chemical information, chemical descriptors, and mode of action classifications. Toxicity data are associated with the physico-chemical data, mode of action classifications, and curated taxonomic information for the organisms tested. The EnviroTox platform also includes 3 analysis tools: a predicted-no-effect concentration calculator, an ecoTTC distribution tool, and a chemical toxicity distribution tool. Although the EnviroTox database and tools were originally developed to support ecoTTC analysis and development, they have broader applicability to the field of ecological risk assessment.

IRES are characterized by periods of flow cessation, during which channel substrates accumulate and undergo physico-chemical changes (preconditioning), and periods of flow resumption, when these substrates are rewetted and release pulses of dissolved nutrients and organic matter (OM). However, there are no estimates of the amounts and quality of leached substances, nor is there information on the underlying environmental constraints operating at the global scale. We experimentally simulated, under standard laboratory conditions, rewetting of leaves, riverbed sediments, and epilithic biofilms collected during the dry phase across 205 IRES from five major climate zones. We determined the amounts and qualitative characteristics of the leached nutrients and OM, and estimated their areal fluxes from riverbeds. In addition, we evaluated the variance in leachate characteristics in relation to selected environmental variables and substrate characteristics. We found that sediments, due to their large quantities within riverbeds, contribute most to the overall flux of dissolved substances during rewetting events (56%-98%), and that flux rates distinctly differ among climate zones. Dissolved organic carbon, phenolics, and nitrate contributed most to the areal fluxes. The largest amounts of leached substances were found in the continental climate zone, coinciding with the lowest potential bioavailability of the leached OM. The opposite pattern was found in the arid zone. Environmental variables expected to be modified under climate change (i.e. potential evapotranspiration, aridity, dry period duration, land use) were correlated with the amount of leached substances, with the strongest relationship found for sediments. These results show that the role of IRES should be accounted for in global biogeochemical cycles, especially because prevalence of IRES will increase due to increasing severity of drying events.

Glacier- and snow-fed rivers are one of the most sensitive ecosystems to climate change, and can provide early warning of wider-scale changes. These rivers are frequently used for hydropower production but there is minimal understanding of how biological communities are influenced by climate change in a context of flow regulation. This study sheds light on this issue by disentangling structural (water temperature preference, taxonomic composition, alpha, beta and gamma diversities) and functional (functional traits, diversity, richness, evenness, dispersion and redundancy) effects of climate change in interaction with flow regulation in the Alps. For this, we compared environmental and aquatic invertebrate data collected in the 1970s and 2010s in regulated and unregulated alpine catchments. We hypothesized a replacement of cold-adapted species by warming-tolerant ones, high temporal and spatial turnover in taxa and trait composition, along with reduced taxonomic and functional diversities in consequence of climate change. We expected communities in regulated rivers to respond more drastically due to additive or synergistic effects between flow regulation and climate change. We found divergent structural but convergent functional responses between free-flowing and regulated catchments. Although cold-adapted taxa decreased in both of them, greater colonization and spread of thermophilic species was found in the free-flowing one, resulting in higher spatial and temporal turnover. Since the 1970s, taxonomic diversity increased in the free flowing but decreased in the regulated catchment due to biotic homogenization. Colonization by taxa with new functional strategies (i.e. multivoltine taxa with small body size, resistance forms, aerial dispersion and reproduction by clutches) increased functional diversity but decreased functional redundancy through time. These functional changes could jeopardize the ability of aquatic communities facing intensification of ongoing climate change or new anthropogenic disturbances.

In this study, we examine the consequences of rainfall pulses and drought that subsequently impact the breeding success of a threatened nocturnal seabird, the Scripps's Murrelet (Synthliboramphus scrippsi). On an island off the coast of southern California, the main cause of reduced nest success for one of their largest breeding colonies is egg predation by an endemic deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus elusus). Mice on the island have an opportunistic diet of primarily terrestrial sources, but drastic declines in terrestrial productivity from drought might be expected to increase their reliance on marine resources, including murrelet eggs. We compiled data on terrestrial and marine productivity between 1983 and 2013 to determine how conditions in these ecosystems influence murrelet nest success. We found that the severity of drought had the strongest negative impact on murrelet nest success. We calculated that the reduction in fecundity during drought years due to increased egg predation by mice was substantial enough to produce a declining population growth rate. Nest success was much higher under normal or high rainfall conditions, depending on whether oceanic conditions were favorable to murrelets. Therefore, the more frequent and severe drought that is projected for this region could lead to an increased risk of murrelet population decline on this island. Our study highlights the need for understanding how species interactions will change through the effects of increasing drought and altered rainfall regimes under global change.

Unfortunately, these services are largely undervalued, and the potential of urban areas themselves to mitigate future climate change has received little attention. In this study, we quantified and mapped city-wide aboveground carbon storage of urban green spaces in China's capital, Beijing, using field survey data of diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height from 326 field survey plots, combined with satellite-derived vegetation index at a fine resolution of 6 m. We estimated the total amount of carbon stored in the urban green spaces to be 956.3 Gg (1 Gg = 10(9) g) in 2014. There existed great spatial heterogeneity in vegetation carbon density varying from 0 to 68.1 Mg C ha(-1), with an average density of 7.8 Mg C ha(-1). As expected, carbon density tended to decrease with urban development intensity (UDI). Likely being affected by vegetation cover proportion and configuration of green space patches, large differences were presented between the 95th and 5th quantile carbon density for each UDI bin, showing great potential for carbon sequestration. However, the interquartile range of carbon density narrowed drastically when UDI reached 60%, signifying a threshold for greatly reduced carbon sequestration potentials for higher UDI. These findings suggested that urban green spaces have great potential to make contribution to mitigating against future climate change if we plan and design urban green spaces following the trajectory of high carbon density, but we should be aware that such potential will be very limited when the urban development reaches certain intensity threshold.

Ancient DNA (aDNA) metabarcoding allows biodiversity responses to major climatic change to be explored at different spatial and temporal scales. We extracted aDNA preserved in fossil rodent middens to reconstruct late Quaternary vegetation dynamics in the hyperarid Atacama Desert. By comparing our paleo-informed millennial record with contemporary observations of interannual variations in diversity, we show local plant communities behave differentially at different timescales. In the interannual (years to decades) time frame, only annual herbaceous expand and contract their distributional ranges (emerging from persistent seed banks) in response to precipitation, whereas perennials distribution appears to be extraordinarily resilient. In contrast, at longer timescales (thousands of years) many perennial species were displaced up to 1,000 m downslope during pluvial events. Given ongoing and future natural and anthropogenically induced climate change, our results not only provide baselines for vegetation in the Atacama Desert, but also help to inform how these and other high mountain plant communities may respond to fluctuations of climate in the future.

Permafrost thaw could release part of these long-term immobile carbon stocks as the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but how much, at which time-span and as which gaseous carbon species is still highly uncertain. Here we assess the effect of permafrost thaw on GHG dynamics under different moisture and vegetation scenarios in a permafrost peatland. A novel experimental approach using intact plant-soil systems (mesocosms) allowed us to simulate permafrost thaw under near-natural conditions. We monitored GHG flux dynamics via high-resolution flow-through gas measurements, combined with detailed monitoring of soil GHG concentration dynamics, yielding insights into GHG production and consumption potential of individual soil layers. Thawing the upper 10-15 cm of permafrost under dry conditions increased CO2 emissions to the atmosphere (without vegetation: 0.74 +/- 0.49 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1); with vegetation: 1.20 +/- 0.50 vs. 1.32 +/- 0.60 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1), mean +/- SD, pre- and post-thaw, respectively). Radiocarbon dating (C-14) of respired CO2, supported by an independent curve-fitting approach, showed a clear contribution (9%-27%) of old carbon to this enhanced post-thaw CO2 flux. Elevated concentrations of CO2, CH4, and dissolved organic carbon at depth indicated not just pulse emissions during the thawing process, but sustained decomposition and GHG production from thawed permafrost. Oxidation of CH4 in the peat column, however, prevented CH4 release to the atmosphere. Importantly, we show here that, under dry conditions, peatlands strengthen the permafrost-carbon feedback by adding to the atmospheric CO2 burden post-thaw. However, as long as the water table remains low, our results reveal a strong CH4 sink capacity in these types of Arctic ecosystems pre- and post-thaw, with the potential to compensate part of the permafrost CO2 losses over longer timescales.

Decoupled trophic responses to long-term recovery from acidification and associated browning in lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						acidification; Adirondack Mountains; aquatic; calcium; dissolved organic matter; long-term trends	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; ACIDIC DEPOSITION; CALCIUM DECLINE; BOREAL LAKES; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; TERRESTRIAL CARBON; ADIRONDACK REGION; MOUNTAIN LAKES; UNITED-STATES; NEW-YORK	Increases in the concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) have been documented in many inland waters in recent decades, a process known as "browning". Previous studies have often used space-for-time substitution to examine the direct consequences of increased DOM on lake ecosystems. However, browning often occurs concomitant with other ecologically important water chemistry changes that may interact with or overwhelm any potential ecological response to browning itself. Here we examine a long-term (similar to 20 year) dataset of 28 lakes in the Adirondack Park, New York, USA, that have undergone strong browning in response to recovery from acidification. With these data, we explored how primary producer and zooplankton consumer populations changed during this time and what physical and chemical changes best predicted these long-term ecosystem changes. Our results indicate that changes in primary producers are likely driven by reduced water clarity due to browning, independent of changes in nutrients, counter to previously hypothesized primary producer response to browning. In contrast, declines in calcium concomitant with browning play an important role in driving long-term declines in zooplankton biomass. Our results indicate that responses to browning at different trophic levels are decoupled from one another. Concomitant chemical changes have important implications for our understanding of the response of aquatic ecosystems to browning.

The extent to which species-specific phenotypic plasticity and biotic interactions mediate organismal adaptation to changing environments, however, remains poorly understood. Woody plant expansion is threatening the extent of alpine grasslands worldwide, and evaluating and predicting its effects on herbivores is of crucial importance. Here, we explore the impact of shrubification on the feeding efficiency of Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra p. pyrenaica), as well as on the three most abundant coexisting domestic ungulate species: cattle, sheep and horses. We use observational diet composition from May to October and model different scenarios of vegetation availability where shrubland and woodland proliferate at the expense of grassland. We then predicted if the four ungulate species could efficiently utilize their food landscapes with their current dietary specificities measuring their niche breath in each scenario. We observed that the wild counterpart, due to a higher trophic plasticity, is less disturbed by shrubification compared to livestock, which rely primarily on herbaceous plants and will be affected 3.6 times more. Our results suggest that mixed feeders, such as chamois, could benefit from fallow landscapes, and that mountain farmers are at a growing economic risk worldwide due to changing land-use practices and climate conditions.

Although noninvasive samples, such as faeces, can be readily collected, DNA from the sample producers is usually present in low quantities, fragmented, and contaminated by microorganism and dietary DNAs. Hybridization capture can help to overcome these impediments by increasing the proportion of subject DNA prior to high-throughput sequencing. Here we evaluate a key design variable for hybridization capture, the number of rounds of capture, by testing whether one or two rounds are most appropriate, given varying sample quality (as measured by the ratios of subject to total DNA). We used a set of 1,780 quality-assessed wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) faecal samples and chose 110 samples of varying quality for exome capture and sequencing. We used multiple regression to assess the effects of the ratio of subject to total DNA (sample quality), rounds of capture and sequencing effort on the number of unique exome reads sequenced. We not only show that one round of capture is preferable when the proportion of subject DNA in a sample is above similar to 2%-3%, but also explore various types of bias introduced by capture, and develop a model that predicts the sequencing effort necessary for a desired data yield from samples of a given quality. Thus, our results provide a useful guide and pave a methodological way forward for researchers wishing to plan similar hybridization capture studies.

We propose a novel approach for estimating population recombination rates based on genotyping or sequence data that involves a sequential multiscale change point estimator. Our method also permits demography to be taken into account. It uses several summary statistics within a regression model fitted on suitable scenarios. Our proposed method is accurate, computationally fast, and provides a parsimonious solution by ensuring a type I error control against too many changes in the recombination rate. An application to human genome data suggests a good congruence between our estimated and experimentally identified hotspots.

Minor allele frequency thresholds strongly affect population structure inference with genomic data sets	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						minor allele frequency; population genetic structure; principal components analysis; structure	RARE ALLELES; DIVERSITY; ADMIXTURE; SELECTION; VARIANTS; ANCESTRY; HISTORY; COMMON; BIASES; LOCI	A common method of minimizing errors in large DNA sequence data sets is to drop variable sites with a minor allele frequency (MAF) below some specified threshold. Although widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism data set to demonstrate the impacts of MAF thresholds on inference of population structure-often the first step in analysis of population genomic data. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behaviour is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.

Within tissue samples, TL varies between cells and chromosomes. Class I telomeres are (presumably static) interstitial telomeric sequences, while terminal telomeres have been divided in shorter (Class II) telomeres and ultralong (Class III) telomeres, and the presence of the latter varies strongly between species. Class II telomeres typically shorten with age, but little is known of Class III telomere dynamics. Using multiple experimental approaches, we show great tits to have ultralong telomeres, and we investigated age effects on Class II and III telomeres using a longitudinal approach (our method excludes Class I telomeres). In adults, TL averaged over the whole distribution did not significantly change with age. However, more detailed analyses showed that Class II TL did shorten with age, and, as in other species, the longest Class II telomeres within individuals shortened more quickly with age. In contrast, Class III TL did not shorten with age within individual adults. Surprisingly, we found the opposite pattern in nestlings: Class III TL shortened significantly with age, while the age effect on Class II TL was close to zero. Thus, Class III TL may provide information on developmental history, while Class II TL provides information on telomere dynamics in adulthood. These findings have practical implications for telomere studies and raise the interesting question of what causes variation in TL dynamics between chromosomes within individuals and how this is related to development.

However, as technological advancements in molecular techniques continue to evolve, conservationists are frequently faced with new genetic markers, each with nuanced variation in their characteristics as well as advantages and disadvantages for informing various questions. We used a well-studied population of Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) from Maria Island, Tasmania, to illustrate the issues associated with combining multiple genetic data sets and to help answer a question posed by many population managers: which data set will provide the most precise and accurate estimates of the population processes we are trying to measure? We analysed individual heterozygosity (as internal relatedness, IR) of 96 individuals, calculated using four genetic marker types (putatively neutral microsatellites, major histocompatibility complex-linked microsatellites, reduced representation sequencing, and candidate region resequencing). We found no correlation in IR values across marker types, suggesting that various genetic markers reflect different aspects of genomic diversity. In addition, some marker types were more informative than others for conservation decision-making. Reduced representation sequencing provided the highest precision (lowest error) for estimating population-level genetic diversity, and most closely reflected genome-wide heterozygosity both theoretically and empirically. Within the conservation context, our results highlight important considerations when choosing a molecular technique for wildlife genetics.

Currently, no standardized methods for bioaerosol collection for molecular ecology research exist. Each study requires a process of optimization, which greatly slows the advance of bioaerosol science. Here, we evaluated air filtration and liquid impingement for bioaerosol sampling across a range of environmental conditions. We also investigated the effect of sampling matrices, sample concentration strategies and sampling duration on DNA yield. Air filtration using polycarbonate filters gave the highest recovery, but due to the faster sampling rates possible with impingement, we recommend this method for fine -scale temporal/spatial ecological studies. To prevent bias for the recovery of Gram-positive bacteria, we found that the matrix for impingement should be phosphate-buffered saline. The optimal method for bioaerosol concentration from the liquid matrix was centrifugation. However, we also present a method using syringe filters for rapid in-field recovery of bioaerosols from impingement samples, without compromising microbial diversity for high -throughput sequencing approaches. Finally, we provide a resource that enables molecular ecologists to select the most appropriate sampling strategy for their specific research question.	[Ferguson, Robert M.

Limitations to routine target enrichment are both the complexity of current protocols and low input DNA quantity. Thus, working with tiny organisms such as microarthropods can be challenging. Here, we propose easy to set up optimizations for DNA extraction and library preparation prior to target enrichment. Prepared libraries were used to capture 1,432 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from microhymenoptera (Chalcidoidea), which are among the tiniest insects on Earth and the most commercialized worldwide for biological control purposes. Results show no correlation between input DNA quantities (1.8-250 ng, 0.4 ng with an extra whole genome amplification step) and the number of sequenced UCEs on an Illumina MiSeq. Phylogenetic inferences highlight the potential of UCEs to solve relationships within the families of chalcid wasps, which has not been achieved so far. The protocol (library preparation + target enrichment) allows processing 96 specimens in five working days, by a single person, without requiring the use of expensive robotic molecular biology platforms, which could help to generalize the use of target enrichment for minute specimens.

Metabarcoding a diverse arthropod mock community	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						community ecology; DNA barcoding; ecological genetics; environmental DNA	DNA BARCODES; BIODIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; IDENTIFICATION; AMPLIFICATION; ILLUMINA; PRIMERS; BIOMASS; UTILITY; SAMPLES	Although DNA metabarcoding is an attractive approach for monitoring biodiversity, it is often difficult to detect all the species present in a bulk sample. In particular, sequence recovery for a given species depends on its biomass and mitome copy number as well as the primer set employed for PCR. To examine these variables, we constructed a mock community of terrestrial arthropods comprised of 374 species. We used this community to examine how species recovery was impacted when amplicon pools were constructed in four ways. The first two protocols involved the construction of bulk DNA extracts from different body segments (Bulk Abdomen, Bulk Leg). The other protocols involved the production of DNA extracts from single legs which were then merged prior to PCR (Composite Leg) or PCR-amplified separately (Single Leg) and then pooled. The amplicons generated by these four treatments were then sequenced on three platforms (Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM and Ion Torrent S5). The choice of sequencing platform did not substantially influence species recovery, although the Miseq delivered the highest sequence quality. As expected, species recovery was most efficient from the Single Leg treatment because amplicon abundance varied little among taxa. Among the three treatments where PCR occurred after pooling, the Bulk Abdomen treatment produced a more uniform read abundance than the Bulk Leg or Composite Leg treatment. Primer choice also influenced species recovery and evenness. Our results reveal how variation in protocols can have substantial impacts on perceived diversity unless sequencing coverage is sufficient to reach an asymptote.	[Braukmann, Thomas W.

This is particularly true for parasites and vectors. Heterozygote deficits and/or linkage disequilibrium often occur in such studies and detecting the origin of those (Wahlund effect, reproductive system or amplification problems) is uneasy. We used new tools (correlation between the number of times a locus is found in significant linkage disequilibrium and its genetic diversity, correlations between Wright's F-IS and F-ST, F-IS and number of missing data, F-IT and allele size and standard errors comparisons) for the first time on a real data set of tsetse flies, a vector of dangerous diseases to humans and domestic animals in sub-Saharan Africa. With these new tools, and cleaning data from null allele, temporal heterogeneity and short allele dominance effects, we unveiled the coexistence of two highly divergent cryptic clades in the same sites. These results are in line with other studies suggesting that the biodiversity of many taxa still largely remain undescribed, in particular pathogenic agents and their vectors. Our results also advocate that including individuals from different cohorts tends to bias subdivision measures and that keeping loci with short allele dominance and/or too frequent missing data seriously jeopardize parameter's estimations. Finally, separated analyses of the two clades suggest very small tsetse densities and relatively large dispersal.

Climate change perception and vulnerability were assessed based on the household survey information collected from randomly selected 118 farmers of Kalapara subdistrict in Bangladesh. This paper identified the socio-economic covariates of climate change perception and vulnerability in relation to agricultural adaptation. It was also determined whether their perception was consistent with meteorological information. Findings revealed that the farmers had a moderate level of perception of and vulnerability to climate change. An overwhelming majority (98%) of the respondents perceived a wanner summer and 96% of them observed a colder winter compared to the past. Among the fanners, 91% believed that rainfall had increased and 97% thought that the timing of rainfall had changed. The belief of increase in soil salinity and associated loss was prevailing among 98 and 99% of them, respectively. Observed climate data were mostly aligned with the fanners' perception with respect to temperature, rainfall, floods, droughts and salinity. Positive correlations were found among the perception of climate change, the perception of vulnerability and the number of adopted adaptation practices. Farmers' level of understanding of climate change, vulnerability and adaptation practices could be improved by involving them in different organizations, such as climate field school and farmer associations. It could accelerate the dissemination of agricultural adaptation practices among them to cope with adverse agricultural impacts of climate change.

Factors influencing the occurrence of WVC along roads can be divided in general into two groups: spatially random and non-random. The latter group consists of local factors which act at specific places, whereas the former group consists of globally acting factors. We analyzed 27,142 WVC records (roe deer and wild boar), which took place between 2012 and 2016 on Czech roads. Statistically significant clusters of WVCs occurrence were identified using the clustering (KDE +) approach. Local factors were consequently measured for the 75 most important clusters as cases and the same number of single WVCs outside clusters as controls, and identified by the use of odds ratio, Bayesian inference and logistic regression. Subsequently, a simulation study randomly distributing WVC in clusters into case and control groups was performed to highlight the importance of the clustering approach. All statistically significant clusters with roe deer (wild boar) contained 34% (27%) of all records related to this species. The overall length of the respective clusters covered 0.982% (0.177%) of the analyzed road network. The results suggest that the most pronounced signal identifying the statistically significant local factors is achieved when WVCs were divided according to their occurrence in clusters and outside clusters. We conclude that application of a clustering approach should precede regression modeling in order to reliably identify the local factors influencing spatially non-random occurrence of WVCs along the transportation infrastructure.

Impact of hydraulic residence time on nitrate removal in pilot-scale woodchip bioreactors	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hydraulic residence time; Pilot-scale; Woodchip bioreactors; Water quality; Nutrient removal	DENITRIFICATION BIOREACTORS; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES	Nitrate (NO3-N) export from row crop agricultural systems with subsurface tile drainage continues to be a major water quality concern. Woodchip bioreactors are an effective edge-of-field practice designed to remove NO3-N from tile drainage. The NO3-N removal rate of woodchip bioreactors can be impacted by several factors, including hydraulic residence time (HRT). This study examined the impact of three HRTs, 2 h, 8 h, and 16 h, on NO3-N removal in a set of nine pilot-scale woodchip bioreactors in Central Iowa. NO3-N concentration reduction from the inlet to the outlet was significantly different for all HRTs (p < 0.05). The 16 h HRT removed the most NO3-N by concentration (7.5 mg L-1) and had the highest removal efficiency at 53.8%. The 8 h HRT removed an average of 5.5 mg L-1 NO3-N with a removal efficiency of 32.1%. The 2 h HRT removed an average of 1.3 mg L-1 NO3-N with a removal efficiency of 9.0%. The 2 h HRT had the highest NO3-N mass removal rate (MRR) at 9.0 g m(-3) day(-1), followed by the 8 h HRT at 8.5 g m(-3) day(-1), and the 16 h HRT at 7.4 g m(-3) day(-1), all of which were statistically different (p < 0.05). Significant explanatory variables for removal efficiency were HRT (p < 0.001) and influent NO3-N concentration (p < 0.001), (R-2 = 0.80), with HRT accounting for 93% contribution. When paired with results from a companion study, the ideal HRT for the bioreactors was 8 h to achieve maximum NO3-N removal while reducing the impact from greenhouse gas emissions.	[Martin, E.

In fact, community weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity (FD) metrics assimilate meaningful complementary information from species to community level. Relating species abundance data from national forest inventories (France, Italy and Spain) with species trait values from published sources, we explored CWM and FD variations along climatic gradients for traits related to leaf, hydraulic and live history strategies, and how the CWM or the FD of single traits co-vary. Results show how the combined effects of water availability and temperature modulate CWM, and to a lower extent FD, of Western European forests. PCA on CWM traits data showed that main axis accounts for 46.6% of the variability and is represented by wood density, seed dry weight (SDW) and maximum height. This axis is similarly preserved in humid and dry areas and potentially related to competition ability, growth rates and successional status of tree species dominants. Furthermore, the second axis is associated with leaf wilting and cavitation resistance (P-50), but not consistent in dry areas. Correlation patterns of FD data, which were partially preserved across climatic regions, showed one main axis involving the joint variability of all traits. However, between humid and dry areas determinants of SDW and P-50 differ from all other traits. Results showed that at least a part of the co-variation patterns among traits change with climate conditions, suggesting scale-dependent effects which should be taken into account when scaling assembly mechanisms.

Does plant allometry predict biased sex allocation in Triadica sebifera (L.) small (Euphorbiaceae)?	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Chinese tallow; Triadica sebifera; Life-history theory; Sex allocation; Germination	CHINESE TALLOW TREE; SIZE; REPRODUCTION; POPULATION; VISITATION; EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY; GENDER; COSTS; RATIO	Early seed production by non-native plants may be important to their successful establishment and spread. Understanding the mechanisms underlying age- or size-biased seed production in introduced plants may also identify factors that contribute to propagule pressure and their success as invaders. Here, we asked whether differences in male and female reproductive allocation among individuals of the invasive woody plant species Triadica sebifera (L.) Small (Euphorbiaceae), a monoecious prolific seed producer, were consistent with a life-history trade-off involving sex allocation. We also asked if the quality of seeds produced by trees of different size differed in terms of seed size and germinability. We found no evidence that biomass allocation to either male or female function was related to plant size. Trees varied in ratio of female:male investment from 0.6 to 15.8, but investment ratio was also unrelated to plant size. We also found no relationship between plant size and seed size or mean germination time, and a weak negative relationship between percent seed germination and plant size. Overall, the results do not support the idea that patterns of reproductive sex allocation are the result of a life-history trade-off and are instead most consistent with local resource tracking by individual trees.

A trade-off between primary and secondary seed dispersal by wind	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Anemochory; Diaspore; Dispersal evolution; Experimental ecology; Functional traits; Plant dispersal	DIASPORE MORPHOLOGY; MECHANISTIC MODEL; EVOLUTION; PLANT; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS; RETENTION; ECOLOGY	The seeds of most plant species are dispersed by multiple mechanisms. Whether functional traits mediate positive correlations or negative correlations (trade-offs) between different dispersal mechanisms has important consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. We investigate how traits affect wind-driven seed dispersal through the air and across the ground (primary and secondary wind dispersal, respectively). We hypothesized that primary and secondary wind dispersal were positively correlated because they should both decrease with the wing loading of seeds. We test this hypothesis with wind-tunnel experiments using different seed morphologies of Zygophyllum xanthoxylon (heterocarpous) and Calligonum species. We measured primary dispersal distance at varying wind speeds and release heights, and quantified secondary dispersal potential as the threshold wind speed for seed movement on four ground surfaces. Contrary to our expectation, we found a context-dependent trade-off between primary and secondary wind dispersal. The smoother the ground surface, the stronger this trade-off becomes. The trade-off results from a positive relationship between wing loading and the ratio of vertical to horizontal seed projection (v/h-ratio): an increasing v/h-ratio not only promotes secondary dispersal on smooth surfaces by increasing wind interception of seeds, but also decreases primary dispersal distance by increasing wing loading and terminal velocity of seeds. The trade-off contradicts the widespread assumption of a positive correlation between primary and secondary dispersal. A simple classification into poorly and well-dispersed seeds is thus not possible. The trade-off may affect dynamics of succession and the expansion of pioneer vegetation, while potentially slowing down evolutionary responses to selection on seed dispersal.

Furthermore, soils constitute an important reservoir of carbon in our environment. In light of climate change, consistent SOC data over extended periods in combination with information on agricultural management are much required, but still scarce. We report SOC changes in the topsoil (0-20 cm) of Swiss cropland measured at well-defined monitoring sites resampled every 5 years from 1990 to 2014 by the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network NABO using consistent sampling protocols and quality assurance. Data on agricultural management practices were retrieved from farmers. Overall, SOC remained stable for the ensemble of monitoring sites, although increasing and decreasing trends were observed for individual sites, ranging from -11 to +16% relative change per decade. Changes in the agricultural management of cropland triggered substantial changes in SOC contents for some sites. Moreover, sites with a low ratio of SOC/clay (< 0.1) generally showed more positive trends than sites with higher ratios. We presume that SOC was either at or near steady state, given the consistency of management practices over the last few decades. Finally, our study provides insights into the uncertainties related to (real-world) SOC monitoring and underlines the relevance of short-term SOC variations that could hamper the detection of long-term trends. The minimum detectable change (MDC) by the applied monitoring scheme is estimated at 0.35% per year, in relative terms.

For instance, the egg-rejection process, one of the most important defensive responses of hosts against brood parasites, may be affected by variation in predation risk, which might divert their focus from the nest (present reproduction) to self-maintenance (future reproduction). In this study we explore the effect of predation risk on the first two stages of the egg-rejection process (judgment and decision) and if this potential effect changes according to the target of predation (adults vs offspring). To do so, we experimentally parasitized nests of common blackbirds (Turdus merula) with mimetic model eggs simultaneously exposing them to different predation-risk situations: adult predator, egg predator, and control. We found that predation risk did not affect egg recognition. Nevertheless, blackbirds exposed to the adult predation risk showed a significant reduction in the ejection rate, particularly at the end of the breeding season. We discuss our results in relation to the egg-rejection process and life-history theory. Our findings suggest that a predation risk directed to adults of parasitized nests, but not to their offspring, can play an important role in the blackbirds' decision-making influencing the ejection of parasitic eggs, consequently affecting the outcome of the evolutionary relationship between brood parasites and their hosts. Significance statement Brood parasitism and predation are two important selective forces in nature, which play a crucial role in the evolutionary process in birds. Despite this, few studies have explored the possible relationships between these two selective pressures. In particular, the possibility that predation risk affects host defenses against brood parasites has usually been neglected. Predation risk could influence the egg-rejection process, which is the main defensive measure adopted by hosts once they have been parasitized. In this study we showed that predation risk seems to modulate host defenses against brood parasites in common blackbirds, but depending on the threat posed by predators. In particular, adult predation risk affects the second stage of the egg-rejection process reducing the ejection rate of parasitic eggs. Our results open a new line of research in brood parasitism studies, demonstrating that external stimuli to brood parasite-host systems can influence egg-rejection decisions.

Astragalus tragacantha (Fabaceae), is a rare endangered plant species along the coastal habitats where the plant populations have undergone considerable fragmentation and decline of size. Controlled pollination treatments, the observation of pollinator activity, and pollinator captures, have been conducted to study: (1) the mating system of A. tragacantha and the potential for inbreeding depression and/or outbreeding depression based on controlled pollination treatments, (2) the pollinator composition among populations using a correspondence analysis and a hierarchical clustering, and (3) the link between pollinators and the plant reproductive success using a path-analysis model. In this study, we demonstrated that this plant was not autogamous self-pollinating and depended on pollinators for its reproduction. The absence of difference between manual and open pollinations regarding the reproductive success showed an absence of pollen limitation in our populations. We showed that populations differed in the composition of their pollinator guilds. Some pollinator species were predominant in certain populations. The pollination treatments revealed the existence of a mixed mating system in A. tragacantha populations. We showed an inbreeding depression potentially linked to a predominant pollinator-facilitated selfing, and the existence of outbreeding depression between some distant populations. These differences in pollinator guild and plant mating systems among populations must be considered during the restoration of populations along the Mediterranean coastal habitats in order to enhance the reproductive success and sustainability of A. tragacantha.

The Species-Area Relationship (SAR) is one of the most general patterns in ecology. Focusing on a Mediterranean area as case study, we investigated SAR and the drivers underlying species richness. We gathered data from all vascular floras published for circumscribed areas in Tuscany after 1970 and then we fitted SAR models based on Arrhenius' power function for the whole established flora, and for native and alien species separately. SAR residuals, which express the actual species richness free of area-effect, were modelled through spatially explicit Generalised Linear Models using geographic, climatic, and anthropogenic explanatory variables. The most relevant predictor for species richness is the grain of the study area, while environmental drivers play a minor role. Topographic heterogeneity and the amount of precipitation show a positive effect on total floristic richness, while the spatial heterogeneity of annual temperature range shows a negative effect. Native and alien species richness are positively correlated, but different combinations of drivers are involved to explain the patterns of the two different species pools. A fundamental factor driving species richness is the insularity: islands host, proportionally, fewer native species and more alien species than mainland areas. Alien species richness is positively affected by landscape heterogeneity. Finally, we present for the first time a method to draft maps of SAR-predicted floristic richness, integrated by the influence of environmental drivers.

Long-term experimental studies of the effects of conservation management alternatives are needed for such forests. Here we present a rare follow-up study of the response of beetles (a highly diverse taxon with many red listed species) to conservation thinning, an action that could favour biodiversity. We previously harvested about 25% of the tree and shrub basal area in a treatment plot, and no trees and shrubs in a nearby matched minimal intervention plot, in each of eight oak-rich (Quercus robur and/or petrea) forest reserves. After two seasons, thinning had led to an increased number of species of both herbivorous and saproxylic beetles. In the present study, we examined the 10-year response of the beetle groups at the same sites. For herbivorous beetles, the initial positive effect of thinning on the number of species had disappeared after 10 years, presumably because of regrowth. In contrast, saproxylic beetles showed a further positive response after 10 years, increasing in the number of species by a third compared to before thinning. We found no change in species composition of either group due to the thinning, but many saproxylics were unique to thinning plots. Overall, our results suggest that in mixed oak-rich forests, saproxylic beetles seem to benefit from conservation-oriented thinning for at least 10 years.

Yet, land use transformation for livestock grazing can lead to natural habitat degradation and fragmentation, identified as the main threats to biodiversity worldwide. Understanding which species are "winners" (i.e. species with a higher relative abundance index on farmland than protected area) and "losers" (i.e. species that have been extirpated or have a lower relative abundance index on farmland) in farming landscapes is crucial for the global sustainability of food production and biodiversity conservation. We used camera traps across 332 locations, over 23,796 trap nights to compare species richness and several aspects of community diversity (evenness, dominance, functional diversity and community structure) on 22 extensive small-livestock farms and a nearby protected area in the semi-arid region of the Karoo, South Africa. Species richness was not significantly different between the two land uses, but there were important differences in community structure and composition. Large carnivores were the "losers" of extensive livestock farming. Farmland displayed a lower effective number of species and functional diversity and a higher dominance than the protected area. The latter had a positive influence on the presence of large mammals and on the relative abundance of the region's main mesopredator, the black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas). Contrary to consensus, extensive small-livestock farming may be beneficial to some species and may therefore represent an important opportunity for biodiversity conservation outside of formally protected areas.

We assessed the relevance of undisturbed upstream patches ("refugia") on the responses of benthic communities to forest cover loss. We selected four Andean rivers with a well-protected forest in their upstream section and different degree of forest cover loss downstream and evaluated the dissimilarity patterns of three benthic communities (diatoms, Chironomidae, and the assemblage of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera-"EPT') along their water courses. We evaluated the dissimilarity by using Euclidean (environment), SOrensen (incidence data) and Morisita-Horn (abundance data) pairwise distances. We found that diatom beta-diversity, as organisms with passive but higher dispersal ability, significantly tracked the environmental changes caused by forest loss. However, insect communities, whose a priori are active dispersers and can track for suitable conditions, were weakly affected by deforestation. These results provide evidences that the existence of well-preserved upstream reaches along patched corridors may allow non-tolerant species to remain extant throughout dispersal-driven feedbacks. This being the case in the Andean streams, effects of deforestation on benthic communities were small, and not uniform. Our results reinforce the strategy of preserving upstream sections in order to achieve successful restoration or rehabilitation goals.

Globally, fire frequency and the extent of fires are predicted to increase in the future. The impact of fire on the biodiversity of temperate wetlands has gained little attention so far. We compared species richness and abundance of plants and birds in burnt and unburnt areas in the Amur floodplain/Russian Far East in the year of fire and 1 year after. We also analysed vegetation recovery in relation to time since fire over a period of 18 years. Plant species richness was higher in burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. This suggests that fire has a positive short-term effect on plant diversity. Bird species richness and abundance were lower on burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. Over a period of 18 years, high fire frequency led to an increase in herb cover and a decrease in grass cover. We show that the effects on biodiversity are taxon- and species-specific. Fire management strategies in temperate wetlands should consider fire frequency as a key driving force of vegetation structure, with carry-over effects on higher trophic levels. Designing fire refuges, i.e., areas that do not burn annually, might locally be necessary to maintain high species richness.

How such responses empirically relate to the mechanisms that govern species coexistence is, however, poorly understood. Previous results from 1 ake phytoplankton communities suggested that the evenness of organismal traits in multiple dimensions increases with resource limitation, possibly due to resource partitioning at the individual level. Here we experimentally tested the emergence of this pattern by growing two phytoplankton species (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Microcystis aeruginosa) under a gradient of light intensity, in monoculture and jointly. Under low light (resource) conditions, the populations diversified into a wide range of phenotypes, which were evenly distributed in multidimensional trait space (defined by four pigment-related trait dimensions), consistent with the observed field pattern. Our interpretation is that under conditions of light limitation, individual phytoplankton cells alter photosynthetic traits to reduce overlap in light acquisition, acquiring unexploited resources and thereby likely maximising individual success. Our results provide prime experimental evidence that resource limitation increases the evenness of conspecific and heterospecific microbial phenotypes along trait axes, advancing our understanding of trait-based coexistence.

ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PLANT DIVERSITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; SEASONAL-CHANGES; REGIONAL-SCALE; SALT-MARSH; RICHNESS; RESPONSES; BIODIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGES	The composition and structure of plant-root-associated fungal communities are determined by local abiotic and biotic conditions. However, the relative influence and identity of relationships to abiotic and biotic factors may differ across environmental and ecological contexts, and fungal functional groups. Thus, understanding which aspects of rootassociated fungal community ecology generalise across contexts is the first step towards a more predictive framework. We investigated how the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors scale across environmental and ecological contexts using high-throughput sequencing (ca. 55 M Illumina metabarcoding sequences) of >260 plant-root-associated fungal communities from six UK salt marshes across two geographic regions (South-East and North-West England) in winter and summer. Levels of root-associated fungal diversity were comparable with forests and temperate grasslands, quadrupling previous estimates of salt-marsh fungal diversity. Whilst abiotic variables were generally most important, a range of site- and spatial scale-specific abiotic and biotic drivers of diversity and community composition were observed. Consequently, predictive models of diversity trained on one site, extrapolated poorly to others. Fungal taxa from the same functional groups responded similarly to the specific drivers of diversity and composition. Thus site, spatial scale and functional group are key factors that, if accounted for, may lead to a more predictive understanding of fungal community ecology.	[Alzarhani, A.

Passage performance and behaviour of wild and stocked cyprinid fish at a sloping weir with a Low Cost Baffle fishway	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Barrier; Fish passage; Cyprinids; Dispersal; Longitudinal connectivity; PIT telemetry	ROACH RUTILUS-RUTILUS; LEUCISCUS-CEPHALUS L.; BARBEL BARBUS-BARBUS; ATLANTIC SALMON; RICHELIEU RIVER; ADULT BARBEL; MOVEMENTS; MIGRATION; BARRIERS; JUVENILE	Weir construction has fragmented many rivers, resulting in the exclusion of some fish populations from suitable habitat. A cheap retrofit fishway for small, sloping weirs is the Low Cost Baffle (LCB) solution - A series of notched baffles perpendicular to flow on the downstream weir face, generating an angled passage route across the weir face. To test the degree to which LCBs can pass upstream-moving, lowland-river fish at steep weirs, LCBs were fitted onto a 1:3.3-sloping gauging-weir face, in an urban tributary of the River Thames, England. The study also compared the passage of wild and stocked fish (the latter are employed to facilitate population recovery in restored English rivers). Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) antennas were positioned on the weir to record the upstream movement of PIT-tagged barbel (Barbus barbus; n(stock) = 120), chub (Squalius cephalus; n(stock) = 119; n(wild) = 194), dace (Leuciscus leuciscus; n(wild) = 50), and roach (Rutilus rutilus; n(wild) = 30). Over six months, more stocked fish attempted passage (58.9%) than wild (14.6%; chi(2)(1) = 26.7, p < 0.001), but there was no difference in successful passage of those that attempted (stock = 34.0%; wild = 40.0%; chi(2)(1) = 0.5, p = 0.49). Successful passage was achieved under a range of flow conditions. This study finds that LCBs have the potential to facilitate passage for cyprinid fishes at steep urban weirs that cannot readily be removed, but there is need for design improvements. This study also indicates that stocked and wild fish exhibited similar passage success, a finding with important management implications for achieving dispersal of stocked fish as a rehabilitation measure.

Early screening of new accumulating versus non-accumulating tree species for the phytomanagement of marginal lands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Non-accumulating tree species; Trace elements; Phytomanagement; Salix aquatica grandis	TRACE-ELEMENTS; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL; POLLUTED SOILS; PHYTOREMEDIATION; CADMIUM; PLANTS; SALIX; CD; PHYTOEXTRACTION; BIOMASS	The use of fast-growing trees producing a high quantity of biomass can bring significant practical and economic benefits to the reclamation of marginal lands. The present study aims to identify new shrub/tree species to offer a wider range of shrubs/trees useful for phytomanagement practices. We implemented three experimental sites in France of 1 ha each (Thann, Carrieres-sous-Poissy and Leforest) contaminated by different potentially toxic elements (PTE) with a total of 38 different tree species. After two years of growth, the element concentrations in stem and leaf biomasses, tree survival rate and growth of plants were assessed. Although the three sites had elevated concentrations of total PTE and nutrients in their soil, the element contents in the trees strongly differed depending on the species. Alnus subcordata, Platanus orientalis, Ulmus pumila, Ostrya carpinifolia and the Acer species appeared to be well adapted to the drastic conditions of the sites and presented the lowest PTE concentrations in their aboveground biomass. Conversely, the Salix, Populus, Betula and Quercus species, especially Salix aquatica grandis, exhibited the highest accumulations of Cd, Zn and/or Mn at the three sites. Inoculation with the endomycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis did not have a significant impact on the growth of the tree species at the three sites after two growing seasons. Overall, the present study offers two options for the phytomanagement of marginal lands. The first option is based on the production of clean biomass, which is useful for plant-based industrial processes (e.g., biomaterials, bioenergy) that could valorize this biomass. The second option is based on the production of TE-enriched biomass that could be better exploited in the ecocatalysis process.

It has traditionally been used as a measure of developmental instability, which is the inability of an organism to buffer environmental fluctuations during development. Developmental stability has a genetic component that influences the final phenotype of the organism and can lead to congenital disorders. According to alternative hypotheses, this genetic component might be either the result of additive genetic effects or a by-product of developmental gene networks. Here we present a genome-wide association study of the genetic architecture of fluctuating asymmetry of the skull shape in mice. Geometric morphometric methods were applied to quantify fluctuating asymmetry: we estimated fluctuating asymmetry as Mahalanobis distances to the mean asymmetry, correcting first for genetic directional asymmetry. We applied the marginal epistasis test to study epistasis among genomic regions. Results showed no evidence of additive effects but several interacting regions significantly associated with fluctuating asymmetry. Among the candidate genes overlapping these interacting regions we found an over-representation of genes involved in craniofacial development. A gene network is likely to be associated with skull developmental stability, and genes originally described as buffering genes (e.g., Hspa2) might occupy central positions within these networks, where regulatory elements may also play an important role. Our results constitute an important step in the exploration of the molecular roots of developmental stability and the first empirical evidence about its genetic architecture.

Constraints exerted by nutrient limitation or nutrient imbalance can influence the maximal value that fitness components such as reproduction and lifespan attains, and organisms may shift how resources are allocated to different structures and functions in response to changes in nutrition. Whether the phenotypic changes associated with changes in nutrition represent an adaptive response is largely unknown. Further, it is unclear whether the response of fitness components to diet even has the potential to evolve in most systems. In this study, we use an admixed multi-parental population of Drosophila melanogaster reared in three different diet conditions to estimate quantitative genetic parameters for lifespan and fecundity. We find significant genetic variation for both traits in our population and show that lifespan has moderate to high heritabilities within diets. Genetic correlations for lifespan between diets were significantly less than one, demonstrating a strong genotype by diet interaction. These findings demonstrate substantial standing genetic variation in our population that is comparable to natural populations and highlights the potential for adaptation to changing nutritional environments.

HEREDITY			English	Article							DIFFERENTIATION; ASSOCIATION; MAINTENANCE; SPERMATOZOA; TRANSITION; EVOLUTION; MOTILITY; RATIOS	Polygenic sex determination (PSD) may show variations in terms of genetic and environmental components between populations of fish species exposed/adapted to different environments. The European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is an interesting model, combining both a PSD system and a genetic subdivision into an Atlantic and a Mediterranean lineage, with genetic substructures within the Mediterranean Sea. Here, we produced experimental progeny crosses (N = 927) from broodstock sampled in four wild populations (North Atlantic, NAT; Western Mediterranean, WEM; North-Eastern Mediterranean, NEM; South-Eastern Mediterranean, SEM). We found less females than males in the progeny, both in the global dataset (32.5%) and within each paternal group (from 25.1% for NEM to 39.0% for WEM), with significant variation among populations, dams, and sires. Sex, body weight (BW), and body length (BL) showed moderate heritability (0.52 +/- 0.17, 0.46 +/- 0.17, 0.34 +/- 0.15, respectively) and sex was genetically correlated with BW and BL, with r(Asex/BW) = 0.69 +/- 0.12 and r(A sex/BL) = 0.66 +/- 0.13. A weighted GWAS performed both on the global dataset and within each paternal group revealed a different genetic architecture of sex determination between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations (9 QTLs found in NAT, 7 in WEM, 5 in NEM, and 4 in SEM, with a cumulated variance explained of 27.04%, 21.87%, 15.89%, and 12.10%, respectively) and a more similar genetic architecture among geographically close populations compared to geographically distant populations, consistent with the hypothesis of a population-specific evolution of polygenic sex determination systems in different environments.

However, as traits develop over ontogeny, patterns of genetic (co)variation and integration captured by the G matrix may also change. Despite this, few studies have investigated how genetic parameters underpinning multivariate phenotypes change as animals pass through major life history stages. Here, using a self-fertilizing hermaphroditic fish species, mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus), we test the hypothesis that G changes from hatching through reproductive maturation. We also test Cheverud's conjecture by asking whether phenotypic patterns provide an acceptable surrogate for patterns of genetic (co)variation within and across ontogenetic stages. For a set of morphological traits linked to locomotor (jumping)performance, we find that the overall level of genetic integration (as measured by the mean-squared correlation across all traits) does not change significantly over ontogeny. However, we also find evidence that some trait-specific genetic variances and pairwise genetic correlations do change. Ontogenetic changes in G indicate the presence of genetic variance for developmental processes themselves, while also suggesting that any genetic constraints on morphological evolution may be age-dependent. Phenotypic correlations closely resembled genetic correlations at each stage in ontogeny. Thus, our results are consistent with the premise that-at least under common environment conditions-phenotypic correlations can be a good substitute for genetic correlations in studies of multivariate developmental evolution.

Onshore wind and the likelihood of planning acceptance: Learning from a Great Britain context	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Planning; Demographics; GIS; Great Britain; Logistic regression	GIS-BASED APPROACH; RENEWABLE ENERGY; PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; SUITABILITY ANALYSIS; POWER DEVELOPMENT; FARM DEVELOPMENT; OUTCOMES; SUPPORT; UK; UNDERSTAND	Geospatial modelling is extensively used to identify suitable sites for the installation of onshore wind turbines, with the starting point being the estimate of exploitable resource. However, there are concerns that such approaches do not accurately consider the social issues surrounding such projects, resulting in large numbers of projects subsequently being rejected at the planning permission stage. Using the location of 1721 historic wind turbine planning applications in Great Britain, this paper explores whether the planning success of proposed wind turbine projects can be better predicted using a range of geospatial, social and political parameters. The results indicate that the size of the project, local demographics and the proximity to existing wind turbines are key influences affecting planning approval. The paper demonstrates that quantitatively linking local social and political data enhances the prediction of the planning outcome of wind turbine proposals, and highlights that geospatial parameters are necessary but in isolation, not sufficient for assessing the suitability of potential sites. These results also suggest that national policy is restricting the development of onshore wind energy in regions which appear generally supportive of wind energy.

A common strategy consists in the comparison with background element content (BEC) values, often built up by uncritically merging methodologically heterogeneous data. In this respect, the acid digestion of samples was identified as a major step affecting BEC data. Here, the analytical outcomes of two acid mixtures were compared on a set of matched paired samples of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea, a widely used biomonitor for which BEC values based on partial digestion were previously provided. The standard reference material BCR 482 (P. furfuracea) was used to validate analytical procedures consisting of either a HF total mineralization or an aqua regia partial one, both associated to ICP-MS multi-element analysis. In particular, the performance of the procedures was evaluated by comparing analytical results of field samples with the accuracy obtained on BCR aliquots (measured-to-expected percentage ratio). The total digestion showed a better performance for Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Sn, and Zn, whereas the opposite was found for Cr, Co, P, and S. Moreover, new BEC values were provided for P. furfuracea using a consolidated statistical approach, after a total sample digestion with hydrofluoric acid. The multivariate investigation of the background variability of 43 elements in 57 remote Italian sites led to the identification of geographically homogeneous areas for which BEC values are provided for use as reference in biomonitoring applications.

Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) lead to the removal of bioavailable nitrogen, but few studies have examined this in intertidal sediments. The sediment anammox and denitrification rates in September 2015 and November 2016 were measured using a N-15 tracer technique at two sites, with and without macroalgae, in the hypereutrophic Yatsu tidal flat, eastern Japan. At both sites, the rate of N-2 production via anammox was consistently low compared with that via denitrification, accounting for <7% of the total N-2 production. In a fed-batch incubation experiment, the anammox rate increased in the surface sediment after 3months. However, the contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal did not exceed that of denitrification, suggesting that denitrification is the major pathway for conversion of inorganic nitrogen to N-2, and that anammox plays a limited role in nitrogen removal in the Yatsu tidal flat. Denitrification activity measured from August 2012 to January 2017 using the acetylene block method was higher in the sediment with macroalgae than that without. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that denitrification in the sediment with macroalgae was limited by the nitrogen substrate, likely due to competition with macroalgae for nitrogen. Temperature and H2S production under macroalgae cover might also affect denitrification. In comparison, the organic carbon content was a key factor regulating heterotrophic denitrification in the sediment without macroalgae. These findings suggest that the occurrence of macroalgae changes the progress of denitrification in intertidal ecosystems.

We used existing water quality data and field surveys of 15 saltmarshes across a broad trophic gradient of coastal waters, but similar biogeographic setting (in Ireland) to investigate if phosphorus and nitrogen pools in saltmarsh soils are related to those in tidal water across saltmarshes. We also investigated if the strength of such relationships is inversely related to ground elevation, which approximates the degree of tidal inundation. Plant-available phosphorus and nitrogen pools in soil were related to water nutrients, albeit only weakly. We did not find any support for the moderating influence of elevation, indicating that it may be obscured by internal cycling and external sources. We also found evidence for effect of birds on the saltmarsh nutrient pool. Saltmarsh soils are unlikely to serve as general sentinels of nutrient conditions in their corresponding water bodies and may need separate assessment criteria and management tools, which in turn require disentangling localised and whole-saltmarsh sources of variation in nutrient concentrations.

Climate change is shifting the distribution and magnitude of environmental gradients, making identification of when and where foundation species effects occur necessary for effective management. We reviewed existing work to identify expected mechanisms by which seagrass affect suspension feeding bivalves, then tested whether these effects shifted across estuarine conditions for two species of oysters (native Ostrea lurida and non-native Crassostrea gigas) grown in and out of eelgrass (Zostera marina) at six estuarine sites in Washington state. Hypothesized mechanisms of eelgrass influence include reduced predation pressure, reduced or altered food availability, and amelioration of environmental (pH) stress. We analyzed oyster survival, shell and tissue growth, shell strength, and stable isotope (SI) and fatty acid (FA) biomarkers. Oyster survival was >20% lower in eelgrass at lower-estuary sites, but not up-estuary sites. Both species grew faster in eelgrass at one low-estuary (higher pH) site, but not elsewhere. Shell strength in eelgrass increased by 21.1% for native but decreased by 12.6% for non-native oysters. FA and SI biomarkers only differed in eelgrass at one site but correlated significantly to growth among individuals. No measurement showed a consistent response to eelgrass across estuarine conditions and taxa, and responses were often opposite of expectations based on published literature. These results have important implications for management and restoration of oysters in areas with eelgrass.

Here, we examined two such species in the Florida Everglades, red drum Sciaenops ocellatus and snook Centropomus undecimalis, to evaluate niche separation based on diet and multiple stable isotope (white muscle, C-13, N-15, S-34) analyses. For these two estuarine predators, our results indicated that although dietary niche overlap was broad, different feeding modes (spatial and behavioral) allow niche partitioning. The diet of red drum was dominated by pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum and other demersal species. For snook, although their diet included significant numbers of pink shrimp, it was largely dominated by pelagic and epibenthic fishes. Mean red drum C-?13 signatures (-10.5 to -20.8 parts per thousand) differed significantly between areas and were strongly correlated with both area-specific seagrass concentration and amount of incidental seagrass ingestion. Mean snook C-13 signatures were generally depleted (-20.9 to -22.4 parts per thousand) with the exception of one area (-14.1 parts per thousand). Red drum and snook diet and mean N-15 signatures (10.1 parts per thousand, 10.8 parts per thousand, respectively) indicated they were both mid-trophic-level consumers. Mean red drum S-34 signatures were significantly depleted (-0.31 parts per thousand) in the seagrass-dominated area, but enriched (2.03 to 3.78 parts per thousand) in the other areas and indicated benthic but no pelagic sources of primary production. Mean snook S-34 signatures varied widely (0 to 20 parts per thousand) among areas suggesting dependence on benthic (benthic algae and seagrass) and pelagic (phytoplankton) sources of primary production.

One recovery strategy is to restore tidal wetlands, thereby increasing productivity and prey abundance. However, the link between tidal wetlands and foraging of delta smelt is not yet established. Using GIS, we quantified the area of tidal wetlands (km(2)) within a 2-km radius around sampling stations from which 1380 delta smelt were collected over 4years (2011-2015). We quantified stomach fullness, a metric of foraging success, for each fish and regressed it against tidal wetland area, turbidity, water temperature, and other factors known to influence foraging success of delta smelt. Stomach fullness increased with both increasing tidal wetland area and increasing water temperature and was reduced at turbidities >80NTU. Model estimates show that stomach fullness increased twofold from the minimum (0km(2)) to the maximum (4.89km(2)) tidal wetland area. Of this increase, 60% was due to increased predation on larval fish, while 40% was due to increased predation on zooplankton. Delta smelt collected from areas with the highest tidal wetland area were six times more likely to have a larval fish in their guts than those collected from areas with the lowest. Thus, tidal wetland appears to confer substantial benefits to the foraging success of delta smelt, mainly via increased predation on larval fish.

However, the mudflat's food web is poorly characterized, especially the primary production that supports it and the degree of dependence on adjacent mangroves. In this study, we investigated the trophodynamics of vagile fish fauna utilizing a large tropical intertidal mudflat area during high tide in Klang, Malaysia, using stomach content and stable isotope (carbon and nitrogen) approaches. Cluster analysis revealed that 53 major fish species using the mudflats, which comprised mainly of juveniles, can be grouped into eight dietary guilds implying a variable degree of food resource partitioning among species. The dominant guild of shrimp feeders and all other guilds prey on shrimps of the families Penaeidae and Sergestidae to varying degrees. These abundant crustaceans constitute the prevalent shared prey resource, ecologically important to the co-existence of many mudflat fishes. Stable isotope analysis revealed four to five trophic levels in a relatively complex food web fueled not only by microphytobenthos but also phytoplankton in highly turbid waters. Close pelagic-benthic coupling due to shallow waters and strong tidal mixing probably sustains the mudflat's primary production and relatively high number of trophic levels despite the transitory and highly dynamic environment. The mudflat's autochthonous production and diverse prey resources highlight the importance of this often overlooked coastal habitat especially in supporting the early life stage of diverse fish species and, thus, coastal fisheries.

Rare Species Enhance Niche Differentiation Among Tropical Estuarine Fish Species	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Estuaries; Functions; Rarity; Resource use	COASTAL LAGOON SYSTEM; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; RESPONSE DIVERSITY; MUNDAU-MANGUABA; SOUTH-AMERICA; HABITAT USE; ASSEMBLAGES; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; REDUNDANCY	Based on the assumption that rare species in estuarine systems may display a different set of traits relative to common species, we hypothesized that the extirpation of rare species would negatively affect functional diversity components of these ecosystems. Therefore, the contribution of rare species to the functional structure of estuarine fish assemblages in a tropical estuarine lagoon was tested using two different simulation scenarios of species loss: (1) losing the rare species first and (2) removal occurring at random. Overall, high functional redundancy among studied estuarine fish species was found, with many species, including some rare species performing similar functions as shown by the consistent and marked species' overlap in the functional space. Nevertheless, the removal of rare species negatively impacted niche differentiation among assemblages, indicating that while rare species play redundant functions in the studied estuary, they also have a crucial role in increasing niche differentiation among fish assemblages. Such increase in niche differentiation granted by rare speciesmostly represented by marine straggler speciesappears to be a key component of ecosystem stability by allowing functions to be continued even when the estuary is faced with disturbances.

Skewed contributions of individual trees to indirect nature experiences	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article							STREET TREES; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; HEALTH; BENEFITS; VIEW; BIODIVERSITY; INEQUALITIES; INCREASE; WINDOW; AREAS	Exposure to nature is associated with a broad range of benefits to human health. Whilst there has been exploration of how these experiences vary amongst people, the converse - how different individual organisms contribute to human nature experiences - has largely been overlooked. The most common way that people experience nature occurs indirectly, when they are in a room with a natural view. Here, we estimate variation in how individual trees provide indirect nature experiences in an urban human population. As a proxy for its contribution towards indirect nature experiences, within an extended urban area in southern England, UK (n = 612,920) we calculated the number of buildings with line of sight to each tree. We then modelled each tree's contribution towards these experiences against potential predictors, namely tree height, land ownership, social deprivation, while controlling for human population density. We demonstrate that a small number of trees contribute disproportionately towards indirect nature experiences, with individual trees in socio-economically deprived high density housing falling within the view scape of significantly more buildings. Further, trees in private gardens were generally more important for providing indirect nature experiences than those in public green spaces. This novel study demonstrates the skewed contribution of different organisms to human population indirect nature experiences. This approach can be applied more broadly to understand how individual organisms provide indirect, incidental and intentional nature experiences. Understanding the ecology behind human nature experiences is an important step towards linking urban design and policy for maximising the health benefits from nature.	[Cox, Daniel T.

The nature and spatial patterns of local recreation within a forest area are far harder to detect. Recreational behavior and perceived forest benefits (FB) such as fresh air or tranquility are weakly studied. We investigated local recreation in an urban and a rural forest in southern Germany during a summer and a winter survey. We mapped the visitors' paths and asked them to rate FB and to name reasons for pathway choice. We analyzed visitors' patterns of perceived FB and spatial behavior. Forest visitors concentrated their use along existing paths in limited parts of both forests. Most parts of the forest were used by multiple recreation groups, while specific groups (e.g., cyclists) dominated only small parts. Forest visitors gave high ratings to FB such as fresh air, experiencing nature, escaping everyday life, or health. Spatial clusters of similarly perceived FB were detectable but not fundamental in both forests. A regression analysis showed that FB ratings were significantly affected by visitor groups and insignificantly affected by forest characteristics or demographic factors. Pathway choice was dominantly driven by habit, spontaneity, or vicinity to the visitors' homes and not attributable to specific forest characteristics. In sum, we found a weak connection between recreational behavior and demand for specific forest characteristics. For local recreation, we recommend to provide a basic level of highly rated FB and to avoid nuisances rather than designing forests for a desired appearance.

Despite yards being ubiquitous, little comprehensive information exists on how vegetation varies between front and backyards. This hinders our ability to optimize greening interventions on private urban land. We devised an accurate GIS algorithm to locate and classify front and backyards within residential landscapes. By applying this method to the greater Boston area, we measured vegetation structure (i.e., canopy cover, height and volume) of front and backyards with LiDAR and multispectral imagery. We further investigated relationships between urban form, architectural style, socio-economics, and the structure of front and backyard vegetation across Boston's residential landscapes. Among the 85,732 residential parcels that were not corner lots and had cadastral and architectural data available, backyards were twice as large as front yards on average and had significantly greater canopy cover, vegetation volume and taller trees. Parcel-level characteristics, including vegetation in the corresponding front or backyard, as well as morphological characteristics of parcels, were the best predictors of vegetation structure. House architectural style was related to vegetation structure. The neighborhood socio-economic characteristics were the least important factors in predicting yard vegetation structure. Our study highlights that urban greening in yards depends on urban form and morphology at the parcel scale, and as such, it could be enhanced through urban to provide opportunities for additional vegetation. Architectural style might represent a further filter by which residents manage vegetation in their home environment, making it possible to devise strategies to green our cities - in style.

Volunteered geographic information has only recently started to be used by managers to examine patterns of trail use in reserves. As yet, little is known about the benefits and limitations of this type of data. Therefore, we compared how mountain bikers, runners and walkers use popular reserves (Daisy Hill Conservation Park, Venman Bushland National Park and Bayview Conservation Area) close to Brisbane, Australia, based on extracted route data from the fitness tracking application MapMyFitness. Routes for all three activity types were displayed and analysed using ArcGIS. Mountain biking was more popular (49% of the 948 routes), than walking (27%) or running (24%) across the three reserves. Route data was effective at predicting the relative popularity of specific trails with significant linear regressions when compared with fixed-point trail counts (R-2 = 0.681). Bikers went further, used a greater range of trail combinations and used more reserves per trip than the other two activities. Weekends were popular for all three activities, but more so for biking (57%), than walking (44%), or running (43%). The results highlight how volunteered geographic information complements other trail data allowing urban planners and managers to better assess visitor movements in reserves. A number of specific management challenges were identified, such as bikers using more areas within and across the reserves, and in some cases, the use of private land and unauthorised access points.

Persistence, loss and gain: Characterising mature green roof vegetation by functional composition	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Extensive green roof; Vegetation dynamics; Long-term perspective; CSR adaptive strategies; Functional composition; Urban ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; SUBSTRATE DEPTH; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; CLASSIFICATION; DIVERSITY; RUNOFF; PLANTS; SEDUM; SOIL	Like any constructed ecosystem, the vegetation of extensive green roofs (EGRs) will change over time. Although this may influence the desired function and performance, little work has examined the floristic dynamism of EGRs over the long-term. Variations in species composition may be associated with original species (persistent or lost), colonisers (gained), or the effects of spatial heterogeneity. This paper reports on floristic variation of two unmanaged German EGRs twenty years after installation. To evaluate floristic change, the analyses focused on functional composition and plant strategies sensu Grime's CSR theory, referring to the basic adaptive strategies of competition, stress-tolerance and ruderality, and their derivatives. With reference to original documentation, less than half the original species persisted. In spite of the losses, both roofs had entire cover, or nearly so, thanks to colonising species. The generalist strategy (CSR strategists) was the most important functional trait in the observed vegetation, followed by stress-tolerance and then by variations in stress-tolerant ruderality. The functional composition of colonising species was chiefly ruderals, followed by stress tolerators and generalists. The drivers behind these changes relate to the pressures of stress, disturbance and competition, as well as spatial heterogeneity and strategies for dispersal and regeneration, seedbank and propagule sources. This study suggests that long-term floristic diversity may be facilitated by ensuring a diversity of traits and species from the start, by providing spatial heterogeneity, and by considering the mechanisms that support persistence and those which determine colonisation.

Evaluation of a Norwegian-developed ELISA to determine microcystin concentrations in fresh water	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						correlation; cyanobacteria; ELISA; fresh water; microcystins	CYANOBACTERIA; HEPATOTOXINS	Cyanobacteria are known for their extensive and highly visible blooms in rivers or dams in Africa. One of the most important cyanobacteria is Microcystis aeruginosa which can synthesise various microcystins that may affect the health of humans and animals. Accurate and efficient detection of microcystins in water is thus important for public and veterinary health. Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), a commercially-available ELISA kit (Abraxis) and a newly-developed Norwegian ELISA (putatively cheaper and more robust) were used to detect microcystins in fresh water in South Africa. Water samples were collected monthly at two sites, the Hartbeespoort Dam and a crocodile breeding dam. Extremely high microcystin concentrations (exceeding 360 mu g L-1) were detected in the Hartbeespoort Dam during January 2015, whereas the microcystin concentrations in the crocodile breeding dam peaked during March-April 2015. Both ELISAs were positively correlated when analysing water samples 'as is' and following resin adsorption and methanol extraction. However, following resin adsorption and methanol extraction of the water samples, the correlation between the two assays was much stronger. These results suggests that the two ELISAs provide comparable results. If the Norwegian-developed ELISA can be packaged and made available as a user-friendly kit, it could be used successfully in surveillance programmes to monitor microcystin concentrations in fresh water bodies in Africa.

Laboratory analyses were coupled with on-site, continuous measurements to assess the impact of pollutants on water quality based on both conventional and surrogate parameters. Laboratory data included total suspended solids, caffeine, total phosphorus and nitrogen, and their dissolved forms. Screening of trace metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd) and PBDEs (polybromodiphenylethers) was carried out. Continuous measurements included water level, physico-chemical variables and turbidity. Nutrient concentrations were generally high (e.g. average total phosphorus > 1,000 mu g/L) indicating strong sewage contributions. Among monitored pollutants Cr, Cu, Pb, and Cd concentrations were well correlated to TSS, turbidity and discharge, being bound mostly to suspended particulate matter. A different behavior was found for Ni, that showed an early peak occurring before the flow peak, as a result of first flush events. PBDEs correlated well to nutrient concentrations, showing the highest peaks soon after activation of the combined sewer overflows, likely because of its accumulation in sewers. In addition to showing the existing correlations between quality parameters, the paper highlights the importance of surrogate parameters as indicators of anthropic pollution inputs.

In this study, concentration and distribution of nutrients and trace elements in forest soils of Singapore, and the effect of geology on the current conditions of soils, were evaluated. Litter and mineral soil samples (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-50 cm) were divided into three groups according to geology (sedimentary rocks, Neogene-Quaternary sediments and igneous rocks). Basic soil properties, exchangeable cations including cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pseudototal concentrations of 17 elements including nutrients and potentially toxic elements (PTE; As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn) were determined. Results showed that the soils of Singapore were acidic (pH 3.7-6.2) and characterised by a low CEC (maximum mean value: 100 mmol(c) kg(-1)) and low P concentrations (mean values of 0.28 g kg(-1)or less) irrespective of geology. Pseudototal concentrations of PTE were also low, except for As. However, significantly (p < 0.05) higher concentrations of soil organic carbon, total P, base forming elements, exchangeable base cations and PTE (except As and Cd) were found in soils developed on sedimentary rocks and Neogene-Quaternary sediments compared to those developed on igneous rocks. Although total N and S concentrations did not differ significantly between the three geological groups, the differences in nutrient status were more pronounced than in trace element levels across geology. The properties of forest soils, which are mainly unaffected by anthropogenic activities, vary depending on the parent material, i.e. igneous or sedimentary rocks and Neogene-Quaternary sediments.

In risk assessment of pesticides, ecotoxicity tests have been applied to assess the effects of products and mixtures under laboratory conditions, but they are limited in their ecological relevance when compared to field assessments. Considering the differences between laboratory and field exposure, and the lack of data on the effects of metsulfuron-methyl in natural soils, this study consisted in a set of tests to assess the ecotoxicity of this herbicide applied alone, combined with an adjuvant (mineral oil) and the adjuvant applied alone, both under laboratory and field exposure, with artificial and natural soil respectively. Reproduction tests with four non-target soil invertebrates species were performed in laboratory, while two experiments were performed in field evaluating avoidance behaviour, feeding activity, mesofauna abundance and pesticide residual. Laboratory results showed that metsulfuron-methyl alone is not a threat to soil fauna on the recommended doses. However, the presence of mineral oil as adjuvant showed ecotoxicity to Eisenia andrei, Enchytraeus crypticus and Proisotoma minuta on laboratory tests. Field evaluations indicated that metsulfuron-methyl and the adjuvant do not impaired the feeding activity of the soil fauna. The low abundance of native communities could be related to soil management. Results showed that laboratory and field evaluations are necessary to better understanding of the effects of pesticides to soil fauna and adjuvant addition should be considered on pesticides risk assessment.

To remediate and potentially rehabilitate these contaminated sites, phytoremediation procedures are being put into place, often using amendments to help offset the extreme conditions of such soils. The aim of this study was to define the best amendment to use on the field. This was done by studying how the addition of three different amendments (biochar, compost and iron grit), alone or in combination, could affect: (i) soil physico-chemical properties, (ii) Salix viminalis growth, and (iii) metal(loid) stabilization. A 69 day-mesocosm study was thus set up using a former mine technosol, the three amendments applied alone or combined, and S. viminalis cuttings. The results showed that biochar and/or compost improved the soil fertility and the soil pore water characteristics, with reductions of acidity, metal(loid) mobility and toxicity, while iron grit amendment presented negative effects on such parameters. Such ameliorations allowed better plant growth and higher biomass production. In addition, stress indicators (leaf pigment content and root guaiacol peroxidase activity) showed a reduction in plant stress following biochar and/or compost application. Finally, among the different treatments, the use of compost or a biochar-compost combination showed better results in terms of improvement of soil conditions, increase in plant growth and reduced translocation of metal(loid)s towards upper parts, making these two treatments a valuable option for a field trial.

In this paper we assess the potential economic impact of heat stress on working people in urban Malaysia by analysing the loss in productivity that they associate with heat stress. We found that nearly every respondent (99%) from a sample of 514 drawn from an online survey sometimes feels heat stressed and also less productive as a result. The median number of days in a year on which people felt their productivity had been compromised because of heat stress was 29. On those days half of the respondents felt their work capacity had been at least halved. The estimated median annual loss from reduced productivity was 257 (sic), nearly 10% of respondents' median annual income. Respondents who work in mentally challenging jobs are more affected by heat than those in physically intense jobs. They also receive the highest incomes, so suffer the highest losses. Our research suggests that the real economic costs of heat has probably been underestimated because most research has so far focused on people working in physically intense outdoor jobs or those performed in very hot environments.

Structure and evolution of cod quota market networks in Iceland over times of financial volatility	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Quota markets; Market-based-instruments; Cod fishery; Iceland; Social network analysis; Exponential random graph	PROPERTY-RIGHTS; CATCH SHARES; FISHERIES; MANAGEMENT; CONSOLIDATION; PRIVATIZATION; SYSTEM; IMPACT; TRADE	The quota market is the instrument through which fishing operations under an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system achieve greater efficiency. It allows fishing companies to optimally configure their quota portfolios to their catches. Globally, fisheries corresponding to similar to 25% of landings have adopted ITQ systems. However, there is surprisingly little empirical information on quota markets functioning. Here we study the development of quota share and lease markets and assess market activity and functioning for the cod fishery in Iceland. We use a social network analysis to assess changes in four Icelandic quota markets, distinguished by boat size (large versus small) and permanence of transfers (leases versus shares). The quota market for permanent trades in small-boat quota shows a sharp increase in trade and network connectivity between 2004 and 2006, resulting in a high rate of quota concentration. The quota markets for permanent quota shares were the most fragmented and sparse during the years of the financial crash in Iceland and never regain the same activity. Our results suggest that quota systems evolve towards a consolidated state and that their markets are not entirely resilient to financial instability. We also found some evidence that better-connected traders could sell quota at higher prices in the lease markets, though price dispersion was generally low.

Confronting variability with uncertainty in the ecotoxicological impact assessment of down-the-drain products	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Ecotoxicity; Shampoo; Environmental impact; Monte Carlo; QSAR; Parameter uncertainty	FRESH-WATER ECOTOXICITY; IMPROVING SUBSTANCE INFORMATION; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; PART 2; MODEL; TOXICITY; CHEMICALS; FATE	The use of down-the-drain products and the resultant release of chemicals may lead to pressures on the freshwater environment. Ecotoxicological impact assessment is a commonly used approach to assess chemical products but is still influenced by several uncertainty and variability sources. As a result, the robustness and reliability of such assessments can be questioned. A comprehensive and systematic assessment of these sources is, therefore, needed to increase their utility and credibility. In this study, we present a method to systematically analyse the uncertainty and variability of the potential ecotoxicological impact (PEI) of chemicals using a portfolio of 54 shampoo products. We separately quantified the influence of the statistical uncertainty in the prediction of physicochemical properties and freshwater toxicity as predicted from Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPRs) and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) respectively, and of various sources of spatial and technological variability as well as variability in consumer habits via 2D Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the variation in the PEIs of shampoo use was mainly the result of uncertainty due to the use of toxicity data from three species only. All uncertainty sources combined resulted in PEIs ranging on average over seven orders of magnitude (ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile) so that an absolute quantification of the ecological risk would not be meaningful. In comparison, variation in shampoo composition was the most influential source of variability, although less than compared to uncertainty, leading to PEIs ranging over three orders of magnitude. Increasing the number of toxicity data by increasing the number of species, either through additional measurements or ecotoxicological modelling (e.g. using Interspecies Correlation Equations), should get priority to improve the reliability of PEIs. These conclusions are not limited to shampoos but are applicable more generally to the down-the-drain products since they all have similar data limitations and associated uncertainties relating to the availability of ecotoxicity data and variability in consumer habits and use.

Detecting fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in wild bird tissues and feathers	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Pharmaceuticals; Fluoxetine; Biomonitoring; Wild birds; Bioaccumulation; Feathers	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; BIOMONITORING TOOL; MERCURY LEVELS; PHARMACEUTICALS; WATER; FISH; PHARMACOKINETICS; CONTAMINATION; ENVIRONMENT	The contamination of the environment with human pharmaceuticals is widespread and demand for such products is mounting globally. Wild vertebrates may be at particular risk from any effects from pharmaceuticals, because of the evolutionary conservation of drug targets. However, exposure of wildlife to pharmaceuticals is poorly characterised, partly due to challenges associated with detecting rapidly metabolised compounds. As part of a wider study on the behavioural effects of fluoxetine (Prozac) on Eurasian starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), we investigated which avian samples are best suited for detecting exposure to fluoxetine in free-living birds. We analysed plasma, various tissues and tail feathers (grown both in the wild and in captivity during the dosing period) from fluoxetine-treated birds (dosed daily with 0.035 mg kg(-1) bodyweight for 28 weeks), and liver tissue and tail feathers from sham-dosed birds. We detected fluoxetine in only two of twelve plasma samples from dosed birds. In dosed birds, median concentrations of free fluoxetine/norfluoxetine in tissues (two hour post-final dose) were: 111.2/67.6 ng g(-1) in liver, 29.6/5.7 ng g(-1) in kidney, 14.2/4.0 ng g(-1) in lung, 15.1/1.6 ng g(-1) in brain. We estimated that fluoxetine would remain detectable in liver and kidney approximately 4.5 times longer (90 h) than in brain (20h). In dosed birds, fluoxetine was detected in feathers regrown during the dosing period (median concentration = 11.4 ng g(-1)) at concentrations significantly higher than in regrown feathers from control birds. Fluoxetine residues were detected in wild-grown feathers (grown before the birds were brought into captivity) at concentrations up to 27.0 ng g(-1), providing some evidence of likely exposure in the wild. Our results show liver and kidney can be used for detecting fluoxetine in avian carcasses and provide a first indication that feathers may be useful for assessing exposure to fluoxetine, and possibly other pharmaceuticals.

Epidemiological and animal studies have suggested that exposure to these two heavy metals can cause metabolic health problems, including type 2 diabetes (T2DM). It has been hypothesized that T2DM could be mediated through the gut microbiome and the metabolites it produces. Although many studies have investigated the association between the gut microbiome and T2DM, few have focused on the connection to arsenic and cadmium. Results: We applied 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics to examine the changes in the gut microbiome and metabolite profiles of exposed mice to relevant levels of cadmium and arsenic in the drinking water over two weeks. Cadmium chloride (Cd) exposure significantly changed the mice gut microbiome and resulted in a significantly lower microbial diversity whereas sodium arsenite (As) caused a non-significant decrease in microbial diversity. For Cd and As treatment respectively, we identified 5 and 2 phyla with significant changes and 42 and 24 genera. Bacterial genera that were observed to decline upon both treatments, included several butyrate-producers. Both As and Cd treatment perturbed the metabolome significantly, with 50 ppm Cd compound exposure having the greatest effect when compared to 50 ppm As compound exposure. Two unidentified features were differentially abundant in the As group, while 33 features changed in the Cd group. Differential abundance analysis of all bile acid associated molecular components showed differences under both treatments. Finally, integrative network analysis via bipartite correlation networks suggested that several genera, including the metabolically important Blautia, Eisenbergiella, Clostridium_XlVa, etc. declined in numbers of metabolite interactions. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that As and Cd exposure caused significant changes to the gut microbiome and metabolome by affecting bile acids, amino acids and taxa associated with metabolic health.

Iodine speciation in a silver-amended cementitious system	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Iodine speciation; Cement; Slag; Immobilization; Redox; Silver-impregnated zeolite	NATURAL ORGANIC-MATTER; RADIOIODINE I-129; SOIL; TRANSFORMATION; CAPTURE; BINDING; CARBON	Silver-impregnated zeolite (AgIZ) has been used for removing radioiodine from contaminated groundwater and nuclear waste streams and the worldwide inventory of such secondary waste is rapidly increasing. The objective of this study was to 1) quantify the effectiveness of two grout waste forms for disposing of the used AgIZ, and 2) determine the I speciation leached from AgIZ encapsulated in grout. A 60-day kinetics batch experiment demonstrated that AgIZ encapsulated in slag-free grout was extremely effective at immobilizing I and Ag, a potential non-radioactive carcinogen. However, AgIZ encapsulated in slag-containing grout, the most common type of grout used for low-level radioactive waste disposal, was entirely ineffective at immobilizing I. While the slag-free grout with AgIZ released only 3.3 mu g/L Itotal into the contact solution, the slag-containing grout released 19,269 mu g/L I-total. Based on thermodynamic calculations, the strongly reducing conditions of the slag-containing system (Eh was -392 mV) promoted the reductive dissolution of the AgI, forming Ag-(aq)(0) and releasing iodide (I-) into the aqueous phase. The slag-free grout system was maintained under more oxidizing conditions (Eh was 439 mV) and a minimal amount of I was released from the grout. In both grout systems, the aqueous I, originally added to the AgZ as iodide, was composed primarily of iodide and org-I, and essentially no iodate was detected. More organo-I was detected in the slag-free than the slag-containing grout system because the high redox potential of the former system was more conducive to the formation of oxidized I species, such as I-2, which may be intermediates in the covalent bonding of I with organic C in grout. Iodine K-edge XANES analysis indicated that I existed exclusively as silver iodide in both AgIZ-grout samples. Together, these results indicate that subsurface grout disposal of AgIZ waste should be done under oxidizing conditions and that radioiodide released from AgIZ can undergo speciation transformations that have important implications on subsequent mobility and estimated risk.

All-cause mortality and long-term exposure to low level air pollution in the '45 and up study' cohort, Sydney, Australia, 2006-2015	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						All-cause mortality; Low concentration; Fine particulate matter; Gaseous pollutants; Survival model	FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; GLOBAL BURDEN; EUROPEAN COHORTS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; DISEASE; RISK; METAANALYSIS; CANCER; MODEL	Background: Epidemiological studies show that long-term exposure to ambient air pollution reduces life expectancy. Most studies have been in environments with relatively high concentrations such as North America, Europe and Asia. Associations at the lower end of the concentration-response function are not well defined. Objectives: We assessed associations between all-cause mortality and exposure to annual average particulate matter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Sydney, Australia, where concentrations are relatively low. Methods: The '45 and Up Study' comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort from the state of New South Wales, Australia with 266,969 participants linked to death registry data. We analyzed data for the participants who resided in Sydney at baseline questionnaire (n = 75,268). Exposures to long-term pollution were estimated using annual averages from a chemical transport model (PM2.5), and a satellite-based land-use regression model (NO2). Socio-demographic information was extracted from the baseline questionnaire. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate associations, while adjusting for covariates. Results: In our cohort mean annual PM2.5 was 4.5 mu g/m(3) and mean NO2 was 17.8 mu g/m(3). The mortality rate was 4.4% over the 7 years of follow up. Models that adjusted for individual-level and area-level risk factors resulted in a detrimental non statistically significant hazard ratio (HR) of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.98-1.12) per 1 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5, and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98-1.07) per 5 mu g/m(3) increase in NO2. Conclusions: We found evidence that low-level air pollution exposure was associated with increased risk of mortality in this cohort of adults aged 45 years and over, even at the relatively low concentrations seen in Sydney. However, a clear determination of the association with mortality is difficult because the results were sensitive to some covariates. Our findings are supportive of emerging evidence that exposure to low levels of air pollution reduces life expectancy.

Alterations in the microbial community were examined after incubation of treated contaminated soils. One soil was contaminated with Pb and As, a second soil with Cd and Zn. Red pepper stalk (RPS) and biochars produced from RPS in either N-2 atmosphere (RPSN) or CO2 atmosphere (RPSC) were applied at a rate of 2.5% to the two soils and incubated for 30 days. Bacterial communities of control and treated soils were characterized by sequencing 16S rRNA genes using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing. In both soils, bacterial richness increased in the amended soils, though somewhat differently between the treatments. Evenness values decreased significantly, and the final overall diversities were reduced. The neutralization of pH, reduced available concentrations of Pb or Cd, and supplementation of available carbon and surface area could be possible factors affecting the community changes. Biochar amendments caused the soil bacterial communities to become more similar than those in the not amended soils. The bacterial community structures at the phylum and genus levels showed that amendment addition might restore the normal bacterial community of soils, and cause soil bacterial communities in contaminated soils to normalize and stabilize.

Moreover, it may be extremely difficult to validate sustainability out of the honey bee home range and in otherwise poorly studied environment. We evaluated the influence of the migratory apiculture upon the pre-emergent reproductive success (PERS) of four Brazilian native plant species in the Caatinga, a xerophylous physiognomy exclusive to Brazil. Data on flower and fruit production and pre-emergent reproductive success were compared between areas with and without apiaries, on selected plant species with a generalist pollination system, chosen according to beekeeper's interest on them. The selected plant species respond differently to the migratory apiculture; some species exhibited increased PERS, while others were not influenced. Therefore, our study sustains the hypothesis of migratory apiculture to be sustainable, since it was either beneficial or not-influential on native plant species, for what concerns PERS value. Future studies may highlight if the presence of A. mellifera is affecting other variables in the pollination networks of the native species in the area.

Dipteran assemblages as functional indicators of extreme droughts	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Semi-arid; Reservoirs; Macroinvertebrates; Functional richness; Functional evenness; Environmental degradation	SPECIES TRAITS; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; RESERVOIRS; RESPONSES; STREAMS; RIVERS; LARVAE	In the present study, we assessed the potential of dipterans as functional indicators of extreme drought. Dipteran assemblages were sampled four times in 2014 and 2015 at 141 sites, from six reservoirs located in two semi-arid watersheds. Our results showed that dipteran functional traits changed over an extreme drought period (p < 0.0001) and were associated with different environmental variables. Body size, feeding group, feeding strategy, preferential habit and tubule positions changed in dominance over time. Small engulfers were more abundant in the driest period and significantly associated with water quality variables, such as chlorophyll-a, turbidity and total dissolved solids. In the driest months, negative correlations were found between smaller organisms, presence of hemoglobin, short pseudopods and sprawler habit and water and habitat parameters (e.g., organic matter). We found that during the study period, there was a decrease in functional richness and increase in functional evenness in communities, indicating functional loss and a greater biotic homogenization. Therefore, future management plans of reservoirs and other freshwater ecosystems, especially in areas with frequent drought events (such as arid and semi-arid areas), should consider the importance of maintaining a certain water quantity to guarantee ecosystem functioning during the dry season.

Desert locust detection using Earth observation satellite data in Mauritania	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Arid environments; Breeding areas; Desert locust; Earth observation; Machine learning; Species distribution model	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SCHISTOCERCA-GREGARIA; ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS; SURFACE TEMPERATURE; VEGETATION INDEX; DYNAMICS; LAND; NDVI; AREA; DISTRIBUTIONS	Desert locust plagues have threatened food security in northern African countries for centuries. To prevent their effects, current early warning systems in arid environments need to be improved using the latest and most advanced modelling techniques and Earth observation datasets. Previous studies have analysed certain environmental predictors such as NDVI or soil moisture individually in an effort to detect suitable areas. However, we introduce new variables (Surface Temperature, LAI and Soil Moisture Root Zone) from the SMAP satellite and apply different machine learning methods in our species distribution model in order to identify desert locust presence. We obtain highly satisfactory model results (KAPPA & TSS = 0.901 and ROC = 0.986) to detect the probability of presence and, hence, likely breeding areas based on environmental factors. The most relevant variables were surface temperature, NDVI and soil moisture at root zone under different time scenarios. This study also confirms the potential of the SMAP satellite to retrieve critical temperatures due to its time pass, in addition to reinforcing the NDVI product from MODIS as a reliable environmental predictor. These results demonstrate the validity of this new approach based on machine learning methods to identify favourable breeding areas in Mauritania.

Seed bank community and soil texture relationships in a cold desert	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Plant communities; Seed banks; Soil texture; Drylands; Cheatgrass; NMDS	CHEATGRASS BROMUS-TECTORUM; SONORAN DESERT; VEGETATION; PATTERNS; IMPACTS; GERMINATION; PERSISTENCE; RESPONSES; ECOSYSTEM; DENSITY	Sustainable dryland management depends on understanding environmental factors driving the composition of current and future ecological communities. While there has been extensive research on aboveground plant communities, less is known about belowground soil seed bank communities. In the Colorado Plateau of the western United States, we simultaneously explored aboveground and belowground plant communities and how they varied across sites with similar climate but contrasting soil textures. We found that aboveground vegetation and belowground seed bank community composition each varied significantly among sites. We also observed marked aboveground-belowground compositional dissimilarity across sites, suggesting that the two spatially associated communities may respond differently to the same environmental gradient. Lastly, we found that abundances of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) - one of the region's major exotic invasive plants - varied strongly with soil texture, a finding with implications for invasive species management. From our results, we highlight two general patterns for dryland managers. First, we show that aboveground and belowground plant communities can respond to the same environmental variation in a strongly divergent manner. Second, the data underscore a large potential role for soil texture and its associated factors in mediating plant community responses to a range of environmental conditions.

In these ecosystems, plant functional types are particularly important in realizing many ecosystem processes such as the dynamics and regulations of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) to the changing environment. Here, we measured the diurnal dynamics of NEE in patches of succulent and non-succulent shrubs over two growing seasons (2012 and 2013) in the Alxa Desert, located in northern China. We find that the interannual difference of NEE was greater for the non succulent shrub than that for he succulent shrub species. Diurnal NEE changes were similar for all species and were more strongly influenced by soil moisture than by temperature. Nonetheless, these environmental factors had a greater influence on non-succulent shrubs than succulent shrubs. Our findings highlight that species with different life history traits have different NEE dynamics and vary by time scales. These dynamics are strongly tied to water availability and plant type-specific water storage capacity, with plants possessing large water storage organs maintaining their physiological functioning better under stressful conditions. Our findings on the interaction between plant type and environment could be used to improve estimates of terrestrial carbon uptake in critical desert ecosystems.

The models employed site-representative concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chia) from a total of 688 national water quality monitoring stations and the spatial factors of the corresponding 688 watersheds. The spatial environmental factors included topography, climate, land use class, soil type, and proximity of the monitoring station to the weir downstream and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The explanatory power (adjusted R-2 or R-adj(2)) of the models was used to compare different spatial influential scales defined by stream buffers and upstream circular buffers. The spatial environmental factors of the entire watershed area better explained the inter-station variation in Chl-a than did those of the stream buffer and/or upstream circular buffer areas. However, the spatial environmental factors of watershed areas more than 25 km upstream circular buffer zones had only minor influence on the explainability of the models with regards to the inter-station variation in Chl-a levels. Generally, land use patterns were more strongly related to the inter-station Chl-a variation than were point sources of pollutants such as WWTPs. The two most influencing land uses on the inter-station Chl-a variation were urban and agricultural land uses, with varying relative contributions depending on the spatial influential scale: In general relative contribution of urban land use was larger at a larger spatial influential scale while that of agricultural land use showed an opposite trend. In addition, the proximity to the weir downstream explained high Chl-a concentrations in the stream water. Relative importance and causal effects of the spatial environmental variables to instream Chl-a were established based on this national scale correlative analysis, leading to decision-making with the goal of controlling instream algal growth.

The role of blank filter mass in attenuation measurements using an off-line transmissometer	JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE			English	Article						Emfab; Filter thickness; Transmittance; Light attenuation	ATMOSPHERIC BLACK CARBON; PARTICULATE MATTER; LIGHT-ABSORPTION	We describe how reference filter characteristics (unexposed weights) can influence instrument-reported attenuation (thereby black carbon concentrations) using the OT21 (SootScan Optical Transmissometer), in the case of Emfab filters. Reference filters (unexposed filters) with higher unexposed weights (pre-weights) compared to that of sample filters are found to reduce the instrument-reported aerosol sample attenuation measurement; reference filters weighing less than the sample filter results in the reverse outcome. This sensitivity can lead to significant under- and over-estimation by the instrument (estimated mean absolute error: similar to 10 and 16 ATN units for infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) channels, respectively, in our tests, which represent 44% and 15% errors, respectively). We find that the error is linear with respect to difference in the unexposed filter weights of the sample and reference filters. We report two equations (one for IR, one for UV) for correcting the Transmissometer output based on experimental data, which allow use of any unexposed Emfab filter as the reference filter; application of correction parameters to data here reduces the error to 2 and 3 ATN units, respectively, for IR and UV (10% and 3% errors, respectively).

For example, integrated evaluation of aquatic ecosystem conditions and functioning usually involves a group of criteria, such as biological organisms and communities, physicochemical and hydromorphological variables, which are measured individually and combined by a weighted linear function into an overall 'score'. We argue that the network interactions of evaluation components are useful information for expert judgments, which have not been sufficiently considered in existing multi-criteria combination strategies in environmental assessment and management. Built upon the Analytic Network Process and demonstrated with the Chishui River Basin in China, this paper introduces a network-based expert judgment approach to construct ecological water quality indicators, and to determine and adjust their variable weight settings with information of interaction networks. This approach has potential to construct composite indicators for a broad environmental context.

This study aims to integrate spatial predictions of hydrologic variables as provided by a hydrologic model into a land use model for a rapidly urbanizing catchment in India. The benefits of this integration are quantified by comparing predictions of a land use model that uses a basic set of explanatory variables to a land use model that additionally uses the modeled hydrologic variables. Our results indicate that the integration of the hydrologic variables improved the model accuracy indicated by overall accuracy (+ 3 and + 4 percentage points (pp)), class specific user and producer accuracies (up to + 8 pp) and figure of merit (+ 4 and + 5.3 pp) when compared with land use classifications at two points in time. Moreover, the land use patterns show that the integration of the hydrologic variables helped to avoid allocation errors.

The development of robust strategies to cope with the region's climatic challenges requires thorough consideration of uncertainty and risk in decision making. We demonstrate the use of probabilistic decision analysis to compare intervention options to prevent reservoir sedimentation in Burkina Faso. To illustrate this approach, we developed a causal impact pathway model based on the local knowledge of expert stakeholders. Input parameters were described by probability distributions derived from estimated confidence intervals. The model was run in a Monte Carlo simulation to generate the range of plausible decision outcomes, quantified as the net present value and the annual cash flow. We used Partial Least Squares regression analysis to identify the parameters that most affected projected intervention outcomes and we computed the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) to highlight critical uncertainties. Numerical results show that the preferred intervention to secure agricultural production is a combination of dredging, rock dams and a buffer scheme around the reservoir. The EVPI calculation reveals an information value for the profit per ton of vegetables, indicating that more information on this variable would be useful for supporting the decision. However, without the need for follow-up analysis, the results show high probability of benefits given the combined interventions, which, given the current state of information, should be preferred over inaction.

Particulate matter-driven haze poses a serious threat to human beings from a public health point of view. Substantial evidences had linked adverse health effects with exposures to PM2.5, but recent research indicated that PM10-2.5 also had great risk. However, the relative contributions of driving forces to PM10-2.5 pollution are not well understood in the urban areas in China, and no targeted policies have been regulated to control the pollution. In this study, we quantified the contributions of potential driving factor across China with the structural equation model (SEM). Our results showed that in 2015 and 2016, the annual average concentrations of PM10-2.5 in the 290 prefecture-level cities with a mean value of 36 and 35 mu g/m(3), respectively. Industrial scale contributed more to PM10-2.5 pollution than city size and residents' activities in urban areas based on SEM results. Driving forces included in our model could explain 42% of variations in PM10-2.5 pollution, which indicated that there existed influences from other anthropogenic sources and natural sources. Eleven targeted recommendations were then proposed to control PM10-2.5 pollution based on our mechanism analysis. Findings from our study are beneficial to control PM10-2.5 pollution on a national scale, and also can provide a theoretical basis for the formulation of PM10-2.5 pollution control policy in China.

To protect human health and valuable recreational resources, it is necessary to develop a quantitative understanding of coastal pollution. Here we studied the influence of storm runoff on the nutrients and microbial pathogens at two popular bathing beaches in northern China. Dongshan Beach, located near the mouth of an urban river, is influenced by non-point source pollution while Tiger-Rock Beach, a coastal beach, is primarily influenced by a point source from a storm drain outfall. Storm runoff significantly (P < 0.001) decreased the salinity and Chl a post-storm at both the beaches, but only reduced the concentration of dissolved inorganic N at Tiger-Rock Beach. Escherichia coli decreased by 68.7% at Dongshan Beach, possibly due to the dilution effect of the stormflow, contradicting the notion of elevated fecal contamination in coastal beaches from storm runoff. Vibrio parahaemolyticus increased at both beaches post-storm, by 155.7% at Dongshan Beach and 136.7% at Tiger-Rock Beach. Regardless of storm impact, both E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus were much higher at Dongshan Beach than that at Tiger-Rock, suggesting the influence of different surrounding topographies. Lastly, the statistical models developed based on the environmental and microbial parameters regression showed predictive power (adjusted R-2 > 0.5) to estimate the concentration of E. coli at Dongshan Beach and V. parahaemolyticus at Tiger-Rock Beach. Overall, the results suggest the unique role of the individual beaches in attenuating the effect of rainfall on the concentration of microbial pathogens in bathing water quality and provide unique predictive models for recreational water management and public health protection.

The use of ecological species trait information instead of taxonomic units may help to overcome these challenges. Abundance data for fish communities were gathered from 134 river restoration projects conducted in Switzerland, Germany and Finland, monitored for up to 15 years. These data were related to a dataset of 22 categories of ecological traits describing fish life-history strategies to assess the outcome of the restoration projects. Restoration increased trait functional diversity and evenness in projects that were situated in the potamal zone of rivers. Restoration effect increased with the length of the restored river reaches. In areas with low levels of anthropogenic land use, the peak of the restoration effect was reached already within one to five years after the restoration and effect receded thereafter, while communities responded later in areas with higher levels of anthropogenic land use. In the lower potamal zone, a shift towards opportunistic life-history strategists was observed. In the upper rhithral zone, in contrast, species with an opportunistic life-history strategy increased only in the first five years of restoration, followed by a shift towards equilibrium strategists at restorations older than 5 years. This pattern was more pronounced in rivers with higher level of anthropogenic land use and longer restored river reaches. Restoration reduced the variability in community trait composition between river reaches suggesting that community trait composition within these zones converges when rivers are restored. This study showed how ecological traits are suitable to analyse restoration outcomes and how such an approach can be used for the evaluation and comparison of environmental management actions across geographical regions.

The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate soil chemistry, in particular soil acidity, after the application of three alkaline residuals from the pulp and paper industry, and (2) to determine if these alkaline residuals altered soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as a result of the change in soil pH or due to their chemical composition. Soil properties and GHG fluxes were monitored for two years after alkaline residuals were applied to six forest sites dominated by sugar maple in southeastern Quebec, Canada. Each site received six treatments: wood ash applied at 5, 10 and 20 t ha(-1), lime mud (7.5 t ha(-1)), a mixture of slaker grits and green liquor sludge (7 t ha(-1)) and an unamended control. These treatments had acid-neutralizing power from 0 to 9 t ha(-1). All alkaline residuals buffered soil acidity as a function of their neutralizing power, and more neutralization occurred in the forest floor layer than in the underlying mineral soil. In the forest floor, the alkaline residual treatments significantly increased pH by more than one unit, nearly doubled the base saturation, and reduced exchangeable acidity, Al and Fe concentrations compared to control plots. The CO2 and N2O fluxes were lower after application of alkaline residuals, and this was related to the soil pH increase and the type of alkaline residual applied. Lime mud was more effective at reducing GHG fluxes than other alkaline residuals. We conclude that these alkaline residuals can effectively counteract soil acidity in sugar maple forests without increasing soil GHG emissions, at least in the short term. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This has not been possible in the past due to both modelling and measurement constraints. Here, the analytical transient probability distribution (pdf) of pesticide concentrations is derived. The pdf results from the random ways in which rain events occur after pesticide application. First-order degradation kinetics and linear equilibrium sorption are assumed. The analytical pdfs allow understanding of the relative contributions that climate (mean storm depth and mean rainfall event frequency) and chemical (sorption and degradation) properties have on the variability of soil concentrations into the future. We demonstrated the two uncertain reaction parameters can be constrained using Bayesian methods. An approach to a Bayesian informed forecast is then presented. With the use of new rapid tests capable of providing quantitative measurements of soil concentrations in the field, real-time forecasting of future pesticide concentrations now looks possible for the first time. Such an approach offers new means to manage crops, soils and water quality, and may be extended to other classes of pesticides for ecological risk assessment purposes. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Multiple stressors and the role of hydrology on benthic invertebrates in mountainous streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Multiple stressors; Macroinvertebrates; Land use; Hydrology; Path analysis; Community structure	LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS; ALTERED FLOW REGIMES; LAND-USE; ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; ASSEMBLAGES; RESPONSES; FISH; MACROINVERTEBRATES; CLASSIFICATION	Hydrological alteration of rivers is recognised as a major threat to lotic biodiversity acting at broad spatial scales, however, the effect size and pathways of hydrology are rarely quantified in comparison with other stressors such as land use and physico-chemistry. Here we present a multiple stressor study that aims to disentangle the effect sizes and pathways of hydrological alteration on benthic invertebrate community structure and functional metrics. Therefore, we analyse the following four multiple stressor groups: land use, hydrology, physical habitat structure, and physico-chemistry at 51 sites including 72 surveys in the German mountain range. Stressor data were contrasted to benthic invertebrate data using partial canonical correspondence analysis to quantify the community-level response and path analysis to investigate the cause-effect pathway structure of single stressors affecting benthic invertebrate metrics either directly or indirectly (i.e. mediated by other stressors). Hydrological stressors showed a strong impact on community structure, with its unique effects being more dominant than those of any other stressor group. Path analysis confirmed strong direct effects of hydrological stressors on biological metrics but revealed land use to be the most influential stressor group in terms of the sum of direct and indirect effects on biology. Notably, indirect land use effects are mediated by hydrology. Our findings suggest a key role of hydrological stressors in lotic ecosystem assessment, which, however, are rarely addressed in operational river monitoring and management. In light of the wide-spread availability of hydrological data from gauging stations throughout Europe, we plea for a better involvement of hydrological data in river basin management.

Multidimensional analysis of environmental impacts from potato agricultural production in the Peruvian Central Andes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Environmental impact; Multivariate analysis; Environmental efficiency; Farming systems	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; ASSESSMENT LCA; FARMING SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; EMISSIONS	Rain-fed potato systems, being the most important cash crop in the Peruvian Central Andes, play a key role in food security. Quantifying the environmental impacts and understanding their complex interactions is an important step towards an improvement of the technical sustainability of these systems. From 2005 until 2015, 58 potato field plots located on a transect of Mantaro Valley, Junin, Peru were investigated at field level during the rainy cropping seasons. All external inputs used for crop production were measured and registered on fortnightly basis. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed (per ton yield fresh weight) to assess the most important potential environmental impact categories (EICs). Due to the intrinsic variability of the production systems, a cluster analysis (k-means algorithm) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were implemented to group and evaluate the classification based on the EICs values. Furthermore, latent variables were obtained using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to investigate the correlational structure of main biophysical inputs (kg ha(-1)) and EICs values (kg unit-eq. t(-1)). Similarly, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to quantify the relative environmental efficiency based on the EICs values (unit-eq. t(-1), input) and the productivity level (kg ha(-1), output). Overall LCA results showed considerable EICs values for acidification and eutrophication due to the inappropriate or sub-optimal use of fertilizer sources. Restricted use of machinery and low technology level caused low global warming potential and cumulative energy demand. Based on the cluster analysis, three groups were found mainly defined by the nature of the inputs and EICs values: inorganic, organic and mixed systems. LDA showed a good overall classification accuracy for the groups (98.3%), being cumulative energy demand the most important discriminant variable due to scarce machinery use. In addition, EFA proved that the first and second latent variables are correlated with an inorganic- and organic-oriented agriculture respectively, being the inorganic more associated with the EICs values. Environmental efficiency (from 0.04 to 0.61 on average) was linked to the quantity and source of the inputs, showing that potential environmental savings can be reached if more balanced input sources are used.

If these lags are large, then the observed composition of assemblages will fall out of equilibrium with current climatic conditions. This disequilibrium has several expected signatures, including trends in the magnitude of climate relationships through time and stronger climate relationships across space than through time. Here, I describe spatial and temporal patterns of functional assemblage composition of birds and trees and ask whether there is evidence of disequilibrium between climate and functional assemblage structure. I used bird assemblage data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and tree data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program (FIA), in both cases spanning the continental United States and covering the time period 1970-2016. To describe functional assemblage composition, I used the community weighted means of five functional traits for trees and six traits for birds, and fit linear models to explain the variation in composition through time and across space. For most traits, spatial relationships were much stronger than temporal relationships, consistent with lagged responses of assemblages to climate change. Several of the traits showed trends over the study period, in some cases associated with trends in mean annual temperature. Others showed dynamics in the spatial relationships between climate and trait values. For example, the mean clutch size of birds depended only weakly on temperature in the early study period, but the relationship became strongly negative by 2016. While precipitation was often an important predictor of spatial patterns of functional composition, it was typically weakly correlated with the temporal patterns. This likely reflects the fact that temperature experienced more consistent long-term trends over the study period, whereas large year-to-year fluctuations in precipitation prevent composition from ever coming into equilibrium with precipitation in a particular year. Overall, there was substantial evidence of disequilibrium between functional assemblage composition and climate.

Here, we examined these effects by investigating the SOC density (SOCD) and the STN density (STND) at depths of up to 5m in shrub patches and grassy matrix at 18 grassland sites in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results revealed that 44.0-54.1% of SOC and 65.5-74.8% of STN were stored in soil layers of 100cm to 500cm, and that shrub encroachment resulted in a significant accumulation of SOC and STN in shrub patches. The mean SOCD at 0-500cm soil layers in shrub patches and grassy matrix was 11.34 and 8.39kgCm(-2), respectively, and the mean STND was 2.45 and 2.13kgNm(-2), respectively. These differences between the shrub patches and grassy matrix were equivalent to an increase in the mean SOC and STN stocks of 2.95kgCm(-2) and 0.32kgNm(-2), respectively. Increases in SOCD and STND mainly occurred in 30-300cm soil layers, and varied between typical grassland and desert grassland. The changes in SOCD and STND exhibited significant negative correlations with temperature and pH and positive correlations with precipitation and plant biomass. Our findings suggest that shrub encroachment can significantly accumulate SOC and STN in deep soils in temperate grasslands, which helps to understand soil C and N dynamics in shrub-encroached grasslands.

One of the difficulties of broad-scale assessment arises from the use of biomonitoring databases for which the monitoring sites are often spread across different geographic regions, with varying species compositions and heterogeneous environmental factors. This problem was circumvented using a trait-based approach, which extracts patterns of ecological properties of species response to changes in either chemical concentration or environmental factors. We identified groups of species that had particular trait categories that were negatively correlated with herbicide pollutants (the predicted concentration divided by the acute toxic concentration). Numerical abundances of species groups classified by trait categories had more sensitive responses to herbicide pollutants than total species abundance. However, a finding that trait diversity and species diversity indexes in the communities examined did not change with herbicide pollutants means that the two indexes showed resistance to chemical stresses. We inferred that the reason for the greater resistance in terms of trait and species diversity was that compositional changes of species caused by increasing herbicide pollutions were simply a shift from communities composed of susceptible species to those composed only of tolerant species.

This study aims to estimate the relative risk (RR) of major air pollutants on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations in Kuala Lumpur. Daily hospitalisations due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases from 2010 to 2014 were obtained from the Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz (HCTM). The trace gases, PM10 and weather variables were obtained from the Department of Environment (DOE) Malaysia in consistent with the hospitalisation data. The RR was estimated using a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) based on Poisson regression. A "lag" concept was used where the analysis was segregated into risks of immediate exposure (lag 0) until exposure after 5 days (lag 5). The results showed that the gases could pose significant risks towards cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations. However, the RR value of PM10 was not significant in this study. Immediate effects on cardiovascular hospitalisations were observed for NO2 and O-3 but no immediate effect was found on respiratory hospitalisations. Delayed effects on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations were found with SO2 and NO2. The highest RR value was observed at lag 4 for respiratory admissions with SO2 (RR = 1.123, 95% CI = 1.045-1.207), followed by NO2 at lag 5 for cardiovascular admissions (RR = 1.025, 95% CI = 1.005-1.046). For the multi-pollutant model, NO2 at lag 5 showed the highest risks towards cardiovascular hospitalisations after controlling for O-3 8 h mean lag 1 (RR = 1.026, 95% CI = 1.006-1.047), while SO2 at lag 4 showed highest risks towards respiratory hospitalisations after controlling for NO2 lag 3 (RR = 1.132, 95% CI = 1.053-1.216). This study indicated that exposure to trace gases in Kuala Lumpur could lead to both immediate and delayed effects on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalisations.

This intense traffic releases in the air chemical compounds with mutagenic properties that can affect the entire ecosystem. The birds for the flight accumulate air, absorbing gases or particles. The absorption of this polluted air may be causative agent responsible for micronucleus (MN) induction in bird erythrocytes. The quantitative analysis of MN in birds can assists in the monitoring environmental quality of various places. The study aimed to quantify the MN frequency in birds and compare their variation: I) among forest fragments distant from and near to urbanization, II) among species and populations of birds and III) to find if there is a relation between vehicle traffic and MN induction. The capture of the birds took place in four forest fragments in central Brazil (two distant and two near the city) using mist nets. Blood smears were prepared with blood collected from the tarso-metatarsal vein. A total of 354 individuals were analyzed and MN were found in 52% of the individuals analyzed. All sampled birds were identified and resulted to belong to 50 different species, only 4 of which were captured in all the 4 forest fragments. The average MN frequency, regardless of bird species and sampling area, was 1.04/10,000 erythrocytes. From an overall analysis carried out on all birds, the MN frequencies were found to vary among forest fragments distant from and near to urbanization (x(2) = 15.513; p < 0.001) and demonstrated positive correlation between vehicle traffic intensity and the MN frequency (r = 0.988; df = 2; p = 0.011). The species of birds presented variation in the amount of MN (x(2) = 84.64; df = 49; p = 0.001). Therefore, a restricted analysis carried out on the 4 species of birds present in all the forest fragments showed that the populations of Antilophia galeata (x(2) = 6.029; p = 0.014), Basileuterus culicivorus (x(2) = 9.53; p = 0.002), Eucometis penicillata (x(2) = 8.067; p = 0.005) and Myiothlypis flaveola (x(2) = 4.771; p = 0.029) showed difference in the MN frequency, when compared between forest fragments distant from and near to cities. The analysis demonstrated that birds living in forest areas near to the city presented higher MN frequency, probably because pollutants generated by urbanization affect birds and that the larger the vehicle traffic the greater the induced MN in the birds.

The plants were irrigated with tap or processed water (mine wastewater). The results suggest that the combined effects of the contaminated soil and processed water inhibited growth parameters, gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) values. In contrast, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, organic acids, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and the accumulation of metals/metalloids in the plant tissues were increased compared to the control. When the soil was supplemented with lime and N100; growth, physiological, biochemical parameters, and resistance capacity were significantly higher compared to unamended soil treatments, especially in the contaminated soil treatments. The combined lime- and N100-amended soil treatment produced higher growth rates, resistance capacity, photosynthesis rates and phytoextraction efficiency levels relative to either the lime-amended or the N100-amended soil treatments. This study provides practical evidence of the efficient chelate-assisted phytoextraction capability of Klara and highlights its potential as a viable and inexpensive novel approach for in situ remediation of Cu-, Ni- and Zn-contaminated soils and mine wastewaters.

Gut microbiomes are becoming recognized as important players in organism health, with comprehension of their perturbations in the polluted environment offering new insights into the nature and extent of heavy metal effects on the health of soil biota. Our aim was to investigate the effect of environmentally relevant heavy metal concentrations of cadmium (Cd) on the earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) gut microbiota. Our results revealed that Cd exposure led to perturbations of earthworm gut microbiota with an increase in bacteria previously described as heavy metal resistant or able to bind heavy metals, revealing the potential of the earthworm-gut microbiota system in overcoming human-caused heavy metal pollution. Furthermore, an 'indicator species analysis' linked the bacterial genera Paenibacillus, Flavobacterium and Pseudomonas, with Cd treatment, suggesting these bacterial taxa as biomarkers of exposure in earthworms inhabiting Cd-stressed soils. The results of this study help to understand the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on soil fauna health and will have implications for environmental monitoring and protection of soil resources.

Got shrubs? Precipitation mediates long-term shrub and introduced grass dynamics in chaparral communities after fire	FIRE ECOLOGY			English	Article						burn severity; community dynamics; invasion; post fire; reburn; structural equation modeling (SEM)	MEDITERRANEAN-CLIMATE SHRUBLANDS; POSTFIRE RECOVERY; PLANT DIVERSITY; CALIFORNIA; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; SUCCESSION; CONVERSION; INVASIONS; SEVERITY	Background: Short-term post-fire field studies have shown that native shrub cover in chaparral ecosystems negatively affects introduced cover, which is influenced by burn severity, elevation, aspect, and climate. Using the southern California 2003 Old and Simi fires and the 2008 Sesnon Fire, we investigated the role of native shrubs in post-fire ecosystem responses across gradients of elevation, aspect, climate, burn severities, fire histories, and time. We collected field estimates of species cover in 2004 and 2015 at nested sampling sites. We used structural equation models with introduced and shrub cover as dependent variables. Results: Shrub cover in 2004 was most influenced by the number of reburns, while shrub cover in 2015 was most influenced by the time between the two most recent fires. In 2004, introduced cover was most influenced by burn severity in 2003; similarly, in 2015, introduced cover was most influenced by burn severity in 2008. In both one and twelve years post fire, average precipitation increased the length of time between fires and decreased the number of times a site burned. This direct reduction in the number of times a site had burned due to average precipitation resulted in lower shrub cover one and twelve years post fire. Additionally, mean annual precipitation increased burn severity one year post fire, which resulted in lower introduced cover. However, this indirect relationship between precipitation and introduced cover through burn severity was no longer present twelve years post fire. Shrub cover increased with a longer average time between fires twelve years after fire. Shrub cover did not mediate any indirect relationships between burn severity or fire history metrics and introduced cover in either year, suggesting competitive exclusion of introduced species by shrubs. Conclusion: Our research found that significant fire effects on shrub and introduced species are often mediated by precipitation. Precipitation trends are likely to change fire regimes and thus alter plant community dynamics.

This study performed a spatial analysis of the hematologic cancer incidence and mortality among younger people, using a Bayesian approach, to associate with traffic density in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two databases were employed: incidence (2002-2011) and mortality (2002-2013). The relationships between the cases of hematologic cancer and the covariates - traffic density, the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI), and population density - were evaluated using a Besag-York-Mollie ecological model with relative risks (RRs) estimates. Per 1-unit standard-deviation increase in traffic density, in the MHDI, and in population density, the RR for the incidence was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.97-1.14), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.16-1.42), and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.94-1.08), respectively.

Our findings suggest significant association between living in regions with better socioeconomic conditions, where traffic density is usually higher, and risk of hematologic cancer in younger people.

For this purpose, crude water extracts of the halophytes Chenopodium quinoa, Sesuvium portulacastrum, and Tripolium pannonicum were prepared. Different amounts of SMT were added to the different extracts (final concentration of 1, 2, and 5 mg L-1) and incubated at 37 degrees C. Crude extracts of T. pannonicum were further used to evaluate the degradation rate over time. In order to evaluate the influence of endophytic or naturally plant-associated microorganisms on the biodegradation of SMT, extracts from plants grown in sterile and non-sterile conditions were compared. SMT was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI LC-MS). Based on the findings, crude extracts of T. pannonicum have a high potential to biodegrade SMT with a decrease up to 85.4% (4.27 +/- 0.10 mg L-1) from an initial concentration of 5 mg L-1. The lowest activity was obtained using extracts of C. quinoa with degradation of 4.5%. Extracts of plants cultivated under sterile and non-sterile conditions do not have any significant difference in SMT degradation. Therefore, microorganisms and their enzymatic activities do not seem to play a significant role during this process.

Yet there are few studies addressing the full extent of biotic and abiotic changes that may occur in response to invasive species. Less is known of how other human-induced stressors such as eutrophication and lake draining may interact over time with invasive macrophytes to influence biodiversity. We combined limnological observations with paleoecological data from Fuquene Lake, Colombia, a eutrophic neotropical shallow lake, to provide information on the current and long-term (decades-centuries) dynamics of the spread of two well-established invasive plants Eichhornia crassipes and Egeria densa. We found a unique in macrophyte species composition in areas currently dominated by Egeria and Eichhornia. Eichhornia-dominated areas had 14 macrophyte species, turbid (secchi=19 +/- 6 cm) and poorly oxygenated (3.94 +/- 2.61 ppm) waters whereas Egeria-rich areas supported 5 species and had clearer (secchi=51 +/- 12 cm) and better-oxygenated (6.06 +/- 2.4 ppm) waters. Historical macrophyte community shifts were linked to eutrophication and lake level variation and characterized by the loss of charophytes and bryophytes before 1500 CE and subsequent reductions in Nymphaea sp., Potamogeton illinoensis and Najas guadalupensis in the early 1900s (lake draining). Eichhornia crassipes (since 1500 CE) and E. densa (early 1900s) occurred well before proposed dates of introduction (1950s and 1990 respectively). Both species have rapidly expanded since the 1990s along with Azolla filiculoides in response to an inflow water diversion scheme and heavy nutrient loads. Our results suggest that the spread of Eichhornia and Egeria was not responsible for native macrophyte species loss, but that their current dominance is exerting synergistic and antagonistic secondary effects on plant assemblages through habitat modification, competitive exclusion and promotion of habitat heterogeneity across the lake. It could therefore be misleading to suggest that invasive plants causes macrophyte species loss in degraded lakes. We suggest that aggressive species like Eichhornia, Azolla, and Egeria require hydrologically stable and eutrophic environments to spread; thus, management actions should focus on controlling these two factors. Our study demonstrates the need to use a long-term approach to fully-understand the effects of invasive macrophytes.

However, the contribution of the different sources of precursors to O-3 formation within each country relative to the imported (regional and hemispheric) O-3 is poorly quantified. This lack of quantitative knowledge prevents local authorities from effectively designing plans that reduce the exceedances of the O-3 target value set by the European air quality directive.O-3 source attribution is a challenge because the concentration at each location and time results not only from local biogenic and anthropogenic precursors, but also from the transport of O-3 and precursors from neighbouring regions, O-3 regional and hemispheric transport and stratospheric O-3 injections. The main goal of this study is to provide a first quantitative estimation of the contribution of the main anthropogenic activity sectors to peak O-3 events in Spain relative to the contribution of imported (regional and hemispheric) O-3. We also assess the potential of our source apportionment method to improve O-3 modelling. Our study applies and thoroughly evaluates a countrywide O-3 source apportionment method implemented in the CALIOPE air quality forecast system for Spain at high resolution (4 x 4 km(2)) over a 10-day period characterized by typical summer conditions in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). The method tags both O-3 and its gas precursor emissions from source sectors within one simulation, and each tagged species is subject to the typical physico-chemical processes advection, vertical mixing, deposition, emission and chemistry) as the actual conditions remain unperturbed. We quantify the individual contributions of the largest NOx local sources to high O-3 concentrations compared with the contribution of imported O-3. We show, for the first time, that imported O-3 is the largest input to the ground-level O-3 concentration in the IP, accounting for 46 %-68 % of the daily mean O-3 concentration during exceedances of the European target value. The hourly imported O-3 increases during typical northwestern advections (70 %-90 %, 60-80 mu g m(-3)), and decreases during typical stagnant conditions (30 %-40 %, 30-60 mu g m(-3)) due to the local NO titration. During stagnant conditions, the local anthropogenic precursors control the O-3 peaks in areas downwind of the main urban and industrial regions (up to 40 % in hourly peaks). We also show that ground-level O-3 concentrations are strongly affected by vertical mixing of O-3-rich layers present in the free troposphere, which result from local/regional layering and accumulation, and continental/hemispheric transport. Indeed, vertical mixing largely explains the presence of imported O-3 at ground level in the IP. Our results demonstrate the need for detailed quantification of the local and remote contributions to high O-3 concentrations for local O-3 management, and show O-3 source apportionment to be an essential analysis prior to the design of O-3 mitigation plans in any non-attainment area. Achieving the European O-3 objectives in southern Europe requires not only ad hoc local actions but also decided national and European-wide strategies.

Predator control by means of culling is frequently employed to benefit threatened prey species or to increase the abundance of small game species for hunting. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes), a generalist mesopredator of global relevance, is a major target of predator control. Commonly, in central Europe, red fox culling efforts intended to benefit prey species remain restricted to small areas. It is unclear, however, whether such restricted-area culling effectively lowers predation risk at a site or whether red fox abundance is more important than culling in shaping predation risk. We conducted an experiment using 273 camera supervised artificial nests at multiple study sites in clusters of hunting concessions with or without targeted fox culling in a fragmented montane forest landscape in Germany.ResultsUsing generalized additive models, we assessed whether incentivized recreational culling of red foxes was associated with local reductions in an index of predation risk and fox occurrence probability, or whether both were explained by red fox abundance instead. Final models indicated that restricted-area culling of red foxes was not associated with local reductions in predation risk, nor lower probability of a fox sighting, even for the plots with the largest hunting bags. Predation risk at a plot instead appeared to be driven by variation in the abundance of red foxes in the landscape surrounding the plots. After accounting for fox abundance, we found no additional relationship of artificial nest predation risk with landscape configuration.ConclusionsOur results imply that the scale and intensity of predator control achieved by incentivized recreational hunting was ineffective at altering fox abundance patterns and associated predation risk. We thus find no evidence to support incentives for uncoordinated recreational red fox culling as a conservation measure.

The quantification of N2O emissions is challenging due to the strong spatial and temporal variabilities of the emission sources and so N2O emission estimates are very uncertain. This study presents N2O emission measurements from two grazing systems in western Switzerland over the grazing season of 2016. The 12 dairy cows of each herd were kept in an intensive rotational grazing management. The diet for the two herds of cows consisted of different protein-to-energy ratios (system G: grass only diet; system M: grass with additional maize silage) resulting in different nitrogen (N) excretion rates. The N in the excretion was estimated by calculating the animal nitrogen budget taking into account the measurements of feed intake, milk yield, and body weight of the cow herds. Directly after the rotational grazing phases, background and urine patches were identified based on soil electric conductivity measurements while fresh dung patches were identified visually. The magnitude and temporal pattern of these different emission sources were measured with a fast-box (FB) chamber and the field-scale fluxes were quantified using two eddy covariance (EC) systems. The FB measurements were finally upscaled to the field level and compared to the EC measurements for quality control by using EC footprint estimates of a backward Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model. The comparison between the two grazing systems was performed during emission periods that were not influenced by fertilizer applications. This allowed the calculation of the excreta-related N2O emissions per cow and grazing hour and resulted in considerably higher emissions for system G compared to system M. Relating the found emissions to the excreta N resulted in excreta-related emission factors (EFs) of 0.74 +/- 0.26% for system M and 0.83 +/- 0.29% for system G. These EF values were thus significantly smaller compared to the default EF of 2% provided by the IPCC guidelines for cattle excreta deposited on pasture. The measurements showed that urine patch emission dominated the field-scale fluxes (57 %), followed by significant background emissions (38 %), and only a small contribution of dung patch emission (5 %). The resulting source-specific EFs exhibited a clear difference between urine (1.12 +/- 0.43 %) and dung (0.16 +/- 0.06 %), supporting a disaggregation of the grazing-related EFs by excreta type in emission inventories. The study also highlights the advantage of a N-optimized diet, which resulted in reduced N2O emissions from animal excreta.

Puerto Rico Sicydium goby diversity: species-specific insights on population structures and distributions	NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						Gobiidae; amphidromous; Sicydiinae; biodiversity; conservation		Sicydiine gobies are major contributors to Caribbean stream fish biodiversity, and ecosystem functions and services. In the Caribbean, Sicydiine gobies are represented by a single genus, Sicydium, but species-level Sicydium taxonomy and distributions remain unresolved in this region. A previous study posited that four species of Sicydium are present in Puerto Rico, including the recently described Sicydium gilberti; however, that study relied solely on morphological characters, and samples from a limited number of locations. Identification of Sicydium to species in studies with more comprehensive sampling has not occurred due to the impracticality of field identification. In our study, we employed morphological data and Mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase I (mtCOI) genetic sequence data, collected from over 500 Sicydium spp. individuals at 16 broadly distributed sites, to provide an inventory of the species of Sicydium that occur in Puerto Rico. Additionally, we reveal new information on the spatial patterns of distribution, relative abundance, population structure, and observed molecular diversity among Sicydium taxa in Puerto Rico's river systems. This information is essential to advance ecological and evolutionary knowledge of Caribbean fish assemblages, guide stream fish conservation, and to effectively manage fisheries.

Biologgers can be used by researchers to measure the impact of human disturbances on wildlife and guide conservation decisions. In this study, the behavioral and physiological responses of brown bears (Ursus arctos) to hunts using dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and human encounters were assessed to better understand the impact of human outdoor activities on brown bears. In Scandinavia, brown bear hunting and the use of dogs during hunts is increasing in popularity. Nonetheless, not every hunt leads to a killed bear. This means that for each bear that is shot, multiple bears may be chased but not killed. In addition, bears can also be disturbed when encountering non-hunting humans. Heart rates, body temperatures, GPS coordinates and dual-axis activity data were collected from 52 simulated hunts (a simulated hunt using dogs with the bear allowed to flee at the end) and 70 human encounters (humans intentionally approaching the bear) that were carried out on 28 free-ranging female brown bears in two study areas in Sweden. The results showed that: (1) simulated hunts had a greater impact and induced a greater energy cost than human encounters; (2) the amount of time bears rested the day after the simulated hunts increased linearly with the duration of the simulated hunts, implying a lasting behavioral impact relative to the intensity of the disturbance. Although not tested in this study, brown bears that are repeatedly disturbed by dog hunts and human encounters may be unable to compensate the disturbances' energy cost, and their fitness may, therefore, be altered. If it is the case, this effect should be accounted for by managers.

We studied four species (Dasyliron lucidum Zucc., Juniperus deppeana Steud., Echinocactus platyacanthus Link & Otto, and Agave potatorum Zucc.) in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. The objectives were to describe and quantify survival and resprouting, as well as the factors determining them, for the selected species. Six months after a 330 ha wildfire in 2014, 32 plots were established on three transects. Forest dasometric and fire severity variables were recorded. Logistic regression was utilized to obtain mortality and resprouting probability models, as well as linear regression to detect relationships among post- and pre-fire variables. Results: All species had high survival rates (74.5 to 97.7%). All surviving D. lucidum individuals resprouted apically. For J. deppeana, the probability of mortality was directly related to fire scar height on the trunk and inversely related to its diameter, whereas the probability of crown recovery was inversely related to the proportion of the tree height scorch. For E. platyacanthus, necrosed height was directly related to plant height There was a positive relationship between basal area and the emission of new leaves for the A. potatorum. Conclusions: In the different species, several traits that allowed high fire survival rates were observed (e.g., thick cortex or bark, fleshy non-flammable leaves, flammable leaves that reduce fire intensity, high volume to surface ratio). Many of these were primarily linked to drought resistance. All species gain fire resistance or tolerance as they increase in size. We concluded that the studied arid ecosystem of Mexico can withstand an altered or a base fire regime.

Yet our understanding of their efficacy is often limited because it is measured for a few biological components, typically top predators or species of commercial interest. To achieve conservation targets, marine protected areas can benefit from ecosystem-based approaches. Within such an approach, documenting the variation of plankton indicators and their covariation with climate is crucial as plankton represent the base of the food webs. With this perspective, we sought to document the variations in the emerging properties of the plankton to better understand the dynamics of the pelagic fishes, mammals and seabirds that inhabit the region. For the first time, we analyze the temporal variations of the entire plankton community of one of the widest European protected areas, the Parc Naturel Marin de la Mer d'Iroise. We used data from several sampling transects carried out in the Iroise Sea from 2011 to 2015 to explore the seasonal and inter-annual variations of phytoplankton and mesozooplankton abundance, composition and size, as well as their covariation with abiotic variables, through multiple multivariate analyses. Overall, our observations are coherent with the plankton dynamics that have been observed in other regions of the North-East Atlantic. We found that both phytoplankton and zooplankton show consistent seasonal patterns in taxonomic composition and size structure but also display inter-annual variations. The spring bloom was associated with a higher contribution of large chain-forming diatoms compared to nanoflagellates, the latter dominating in fall and summer. Dinoflagellates show marked inter-annual variations in their relative contribution. The community composition of phytoplankton has a large impact on the mesozooplankton together with the distance to the coast. The size structure of the mesozooplankton community, examined through the ratio of small to large copepods, also displays marked seasonal patterns. We found that larger copepods (members of the Calanidae) are more abundant in spring than in summer and fall. We propose several hypotheses to explain the observed temporal patterns and we underline their importance for understanding the dynamics of other components of the food-web (such as sardines). Our study is a first step toward the inclusion of the planktonic compartment into the planning of the resources and diversity conservation within the Marine Protected Area.

Lustosa			Temporal activity of rural free-ranging dogs: implications for the predator and prey species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						Canis lupus familiaris; carnivores; competitive exclusion; Leopardus pardalis; meso predators; prey; temporal segregation	ACTIVITY PATTERNS; DOMESTIC DOGS; LEOPARDUS-PARDALIS; RAIN-FOREST; FOOD-HABITS; FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPE; CANIS-FAMILIARIS; CAMERA TRAPS; FERAL DOGS; OCCUPANCY	Domestic or free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) can have deleterious effects on wildlife, acting as predators or competitors to native species. These impacts can be highly important in fragmented pristine habitats or well-preserved areas located in human dominated landscapes and where biodiversity values are usually high, such as those in southeastern Brazil. Here we explored the level of overlap or mismatch in the distributions of activity patterns of rural free-ranging dogs and potential wild prey (Didelphis aurita, Cuniculus paca; Sylvilagus brasiliensis) and a wild predator (Leopandus pandalis) in areas of Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. We further explored the possible influence of the wild predator on the dog presence pattern detected in the territory analyzed. Our camera-trap data (714 camera-trap days) showed that while rural free-ranging dogs display a cathemeral activity pattern, with activity peaks at dusk and dawn, ocelot and prey species are mainly nocturnal. Moreover, we found no evidence of an effect of ocelot presence, the distance to human houses and the presence of native forests on site occupancy by dogs. The ocelot activity patterns in this study were similar to those already reported in previous studies. On the other hand, previous studies have indicated that that free-ranging dogs are often reported to be more diurnal, and it seems that the rural free-ranging dogs in our study area may have adjusted their behaviour to be more active at dawn and dusk periods. This might be to both maintain some overlap with potential prey, e.g. Sylvilagus brasiliensis, and also to avoid ocelots by being less active in periods when this predator is more active (which also coincides with peaks in activity for potential prey species). We hypothesize that the presence of ocelots might be influencing the temporal niche dimension of rural free-ranging dogs. As a sustainable management strategy, we propose conserving territories to promote the presence of medium to large predators in natural areas, in order to control free-ranging dogs and protect their vertebrate prey species.

ALAN can seriously disrupt physiological systems that follow circadian rhythms, and may be particularly influential early in life, when developmental trajectories are sensitive to stressful conditions. Using great tits (Paras major) as a model species, we experimentally examined how ALAN affects physiological stress in developing nestlings. We used a repeated-measure design to assess effects of ALAN on telomere shortening, body mass, tarsus length and body condition. Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences that protect chromosomes from damage and malfunction. Early-life telomere shortening can be accelerated by environmental stressors, and has been linked to later life declines in survival and reproduction. We also assayed nitric oxide, as an additional metric of physiological stress, and determined fledging success. Change in body condition between day 8 and 15 differed according to treatment. Nestlings exposed to ALAN displayed a trend towards a decline in condition, whereas control nestlings displayed a trend towards increased condition. This pattern was driven by a greater increase in tarsus length relative to mass in nestlings exposed to ALAN. Nestlings in poorer condition and nestlings that were smaller than their nest mates had shorter telomeres. However, exposure to ALAN was unrelated to telomere shortening, and also had no effect on nitric oxide concentrations or fledging success. Thus, exposure to ALAN may not have led to sufficient stress to induce telomere shortening. Indeed, plasticity in other physiological systems could allow nestlings to maintain telomere length despite moderate stress. Alternatively, the cascade of physiological and behavioral responses associated with light exposure may have no net effect on telomere dynamics. (C) 2019 Elsevier BA,. All rights reserved.

Drug-induced behaviour changes could have a substantial impact on consumer-resource interactions influencing stability of the community and ecosystem. We combined laboratory experiments and functional response modelling to investigate effects of real wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, as well as environmentally relevant concentrations of the antidepressants citalopram and opioid pain medication tramadol, on trophic interactions. Our biological system consisted of dragonfly Aeshna cyanea larvae as predator of common carp Cyprinus carpio fry. Exposure to WWTP effluent significantly increased A. cyanea maximum feeding rate, while those parameters in tramadol and citalopram-exposed larvae were significantly lower from unexposed control group. This suggested the potential of all tested pollutants to have an effect on consumer-resource equilibrium in aquatic ecosystems. While WWTP effluent strengthened interaction strength (IS) of consumer-resource interaction dynamics making the food web more vulnerable to fluctuation and destabilization, tramadol and citalopram could inhibit the potential oscillations of the consumer-resource system by weakening the IS. Similar studies to reveal the potential of pervasive pharmaceuticals to change of consumer-resource interactions dynamics are needed, especially when real WWTP effluent consisting of mixture of various pharmaceuticals displayed very different effect from single compounds tested.

However, limited research assessing the transferability of these models between cities has been published to date. In this study, LUR models were generated for Ultra-Fine Particles (UFP) (<0.1 um) using data collected from mobile monitoring campaigns in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Toronto. City-specific models were first generated for each city before the models were transferred to the second city with and without recalibration. The calibrated transferred models showed only a slight decrease in performance, with the coefficient of determination (R-2), dropping from 0.49 to 0.36 for Toronto and from 0.41 to 0.38 for Montreal. Transferring models between cities with no calibration resulted in low R-2; 0.11 in Toronto and 0.18 in Montreal. Moreover, two additional models were generated by combining data from the two cities. The first combined model (CM1) assumed a spatially invariant effect of the predictors, while the second (CM2) relaxed the assumption of spatial invariance for some of the model coefficients. The performance of both combined models (R-2 ranged between 0.41 for CM1 and 0.43 for CM2; root mean squared error (RMSE) ranged between 0.34 for CM1 and 0.33 for CM2) was found to be on par with the Toronto city-specific model and outperformed the Montreal model. The results of this study highlight that the UFP LUR models appear to support transferability of model structures between cities with similar geographical characteristics, with a minor drop in model fit and predictive skill.

Multiple stressors inherent in natural environments, however, confound estimates for observable radiation specific responses. To disentangle differences between field and laboratory outcomes to tritium exposures, a multivariate analysis comparing biomarkers for radiation exposure at the cellular level with changes in biological processes within tissues is described for fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Over tritium activity concentrations up to 180,000 Bq/L, DNA damage in the field were lower than DNA damage in the laboratory. This finding does not support an increase in morbidity of biota in field exposures. Energy deposited by tritium decay produces oxidised free radicals, yet the biological responses in brain, muscle and liver to oxidative stress differed between the studies and were not related to the tritium. For both studies, DNA damage in gonad and blood increased with increased tritium as did the fluorescence associated with lysosomal function in spleen. The studies differed in spleen phagocytosis activity were, in the laboratory but not the field, activity increased with increased tritium-and was correlatd with lysosomal function (Spearman coefficient of 0.98 (p = 0.001). The higher phagocytosis activity in the field reflects exposures to unmeasured factors that were not present within the laboratory. In the laboratory, DNA damage and lysosomal function were correlated: Spearman coefficients of 0.9 (Comet, p = 0.03) and 0.9 (micronuclei, p = 0.08). In the field, DNA damage by the Comet assay, but not by micronucleus frequency, correlated with lysosomal function: Spearman coefficients of 0.91 (Comet, p < 0.001) and 0.47 (micronuclei, p = 0.21). These observations highlight a need for better physiologic understanding of linkages between radiation-induced damage within cells and responses at higher levels of biological organization.

Mitigating these conflicts requires targeted conservation and education measures based on a solid understanding of how visitors perceive wildlife. We assessed visitors' perception of the major wildlife groups (i.e., amphibians, reptiles, water birds) that were detectable during visiting hours, within an archaeological site overlapping with a biodiversity hotspot in southeastern Romania. We explored whether age, gender, education, nationality, and awareness (i.e., prompted by guided tours, previous visits, or protection level of the area) influenced visitors' perception towards the different wildlife groups. Visitors were disturbed or felt repulsion mostly towards the less charismatic wildlife groups: snakes, frogs, and toads; the perception was significantly explained by gender, nationality and awareness. We recommend the site to be used to promote education regarding wildlife conservation, to improve visiting experience and protect less charismatic species.

Power models and average ship parameter effects on marine emissions inventories	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							EXHAUST EMISSIONS	Maritime greenhouse gas emissions are projected to increase significantly by 2050, highlighting the need for reliable inventories as a first step in analyzing ship emission control policies. The impact of ship power models on marine emissions inventories has garnered little attention, with most inventories employing simple, load-factor-based models to estimate ship power consumption. The availability of more expansive ship activity data provides the opportunity to investigate the inventory impacts of adopting complex power models. Furthermore, ship parameter fields can be sparsely populated in ship registries, making gap-filling techniques and averaging processes necessary. Therefore, it is important to understand of the impact of averaged ship parameters on ship power and emission estimations. This paper examines power estimation differences between results from two complex, resistance-based and two simple, load-factor-based power models on a baseline inventory with unique ship parameters. These models are additionally analyzed according to their sensitivities toward average ship parameters. Automated Identification System (AIS) data from a fleet of commercial marine vessels operating over a 6-month period off the coast of the southwestern United States form the basis of the analysis. To assess the inventory impacts of using averaged ship parameters, fleet-level carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are calculated using ship parameter data averaged across ship types and their subtype size classes. Each of the four ship power models are used to generate four CO2 emissions inventories, and results are compared with baseline estimates for the same sample fleet where no averaged values were used. The results suggest that a change in power model has a relatively high impact on emission estimates. They also indicate relatively little sensitivity, by all power models, to the use of ship characteristics averaged by ship and subtype. Implications: Commercial marine vessel emissions inventories were calculated using four different models for ship engine power. The calculations used 6 months of Automated Identification System (AIS) data from a sample of 248 vessels as input data. The results show that more detailed, resistance-based models tend to estimate a lower propulsive power, and thus lower emissions, for ships than traditional load-factor-based models. Additionally, it was observed that emission calculations using averaged values for physical ship parameters had a minimal impact on the resulting emissions inventories.

Most data originate from temperate regions. We aim to study the health impact of air pollution, particularly among the elderly, in a tropical region.MethodsA daily time-series analysis was performed to estimate excess risk (ER) of various air pollutants on daily death counts amongst the general population in Singapore from 2001 to 2013. Air pollutants included particulate matters smaller than 10m, and 2.5m (PM10, PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). The studied outcomes were non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality. Single-day lag and distributed lag models were studied and adjusted for confounders.ResultsIn single-day lag models, a 10g/m(3) increase in particulate matter was associated with significant increases in non-accidental (PM10 ER: 0.627%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.260-0.995% and PM2.5 ER: 0.660%; 95% CI: 0.204-1.118%) and cardiovascular mortality (PM10 ER: 0.897; 95% CI: 0.283-1.516 and PM2.5 ER: 0.883%; 95% CI: 0.121-1.621%). This was significant in the elderly 65years but not in those <65years and were seen in the acute phase of lag 0-5days. Effects by other pollutants were minimal. For cardiovascular mortality, the effects turned protective at a cumulative lag of 30days in the elderly and could due to harvesting.ConclusionsThese first contemporary population-based data from an equatorial country with tropical climate show that exposure to particulate air pollution was significantly associated with non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality, especially in the elderly.

The mite acts as a vector of the viral pathogen and can trigger its replication in infected bees. However, the mechanistic details underlying this tripartite interaction are still poorly defined, and, particularly, the causes of viral proliferation in mite-infested bees. Here, we develop and test a novel hypothesis that mite feeding destabilizes viral immune control through the removal of both virus and immune effectors, triggering uncontrolled viral replication. Our hypothesis is grounded on the predator-prey theory developed by Volterra, which predicts prey proliferation when both predators and preys are constantly removed from the system. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that the experimental removal of increasing volumes of haemolymph from individual bees results in increasing viral densities. By contrast, we do not find consistent support for alternative proposed mechanisms of viral expansion via mite immune suppression or within-host viral evolution. Our results suggest that haemolymph removal plays an important role in the enhanced pathogen virulence observed in the presence of feeding Varroa mites. Overall, these results provide a new model for the mechanisms driving pathogen-parasite interactions in bees, which ultimately underpin honeybee health decline and colony losses.

Genes, geology and germs: gut microbiota across a primate hybrid zone are explained by site soil properties, not host species	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Papio; microbiome; species sorting; isolation by distance; genetic effects; hybrid zone	INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA; DIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERGENCE; STABILITY; HABITAT; DIET	Gut microbiota in geographically isolated host populations are often distinct. These differences have been attributed to between-population differences in host behaviours, environments, genetics and geographical distance. However, which factors are most important remains unknown. Here, we fill this gap for baboons by leveraging information on 13 environmental variables from 14 baboon populations spanning a natural hybrid zone. Sampling across a hybrid zone allowed us to additionally test whether phylosymbiosis (codiversification between hosts and their microbiota) is detectable in admixed, closely related primates. We found little evidence of genetic effects: none of host genetic ancestry, host genetic relatedness nor genetic distance between host populations were strong predictors of baboon gut microbiota. Instead, gut microbiota were best explained by the baboons' environments, especially the soil's geologic history and exchangeable sodium. Indeed, soil effects were 15 times stronger than those of host-population F-ST, perhaps because soil predicts which foods are present, or because baboons are terrestrial and consume soil microbes incidentally with their food. Our results support an emerging picture in which environmental variation is the dominant predictor of host-associated microbiomes. We are the first to show that such effects overshadow host species identity among members of the same primate genus.

Depending on whether the traits of colonizers are complementary or redundant to the assemblage, species gains can increase the efficiency or stability of ecological functions, yet detecting these processes is not straightforward. We propose a new conceptual model to identify potential changes to complementarity and redundancy in response to landscape change via relative changes in taxonomic and functional richness. We applied our model to a 14-year study of birds across an extensive agricultural region. We found compelling evidence that high levels of landscape-scale tree cover and patch-scale restoration were significant determinants of functional change in the overall bird assemblage. This was true for every one of the six traits investigated individually, indicating increased trait-specific functional complementarity and redundancy in the assemblage. Applying our conceptual model to species diversity data provided new insights into how the return of vertebrates to restored landscapes may affect ecological function.

Currently, although the link between habitat composition and animal population dynamics is undisputed, its function has not been quantified in a way that enables accurate prediction of population change in nature. Here, using 12 house sparrow colonies as a proof-of-concept, we apply recent theoretical advances to predict population growth or decline from detailed data on habitat composition and habitat selection. We show, for the first time, that statistical population models using derived covariates constructed from parametric descriptions of habitat composition and habitat selection can explain an impressive 92% of observed population variation. More importantly, they provide excellent predictive power under cross-validation, anticipating 81% of variability in population change. These models may be embedded in readily available generalized linear modelling frameworks, allowing their rapid application to field systems. Furthermore, we use optimization on our sample of sparrow colonies to demonstrate how such models, linking populations to their habitats, permit the design of practical and environmentally sound habitat manipulations for managing populations.

Despite extensive research on chimpanzee communication, there is little evidence that chimpanzees are capable, without extensive human training, of regulating collaborative activities via communication. This study investigated whether pairs of chimpanzees were capable of communicating to ensure coordination during collaborative problem-solving. The chimpanzee pairs needed two tools to extract fruits from an apparatus. The communicator in each pair could see the location of the tools (hidden in one of two boxes), whereas only the recipient could open the boxes. The subjects were first successfully tested for their capacity to understand the pointing gestures of a human who indicated the location of the tools. In a subsequent conspecifics test, the communicator increasingly communicated the tools' location, by approaching the baited box and giving the key needed to open it to the recipients. The recipient used these signals and obtained the tools, transferring one of the tools to the communicator so that the pair could collaborate in obtaining the fruits. The study suggests that chimpanzees have the necessary socio-cognitive skills to naturally develop a simple communicative strategy to ensure coordination in a collaborative task.

The consensus that has emerged from over two decades of research is that the form of the biodiversity-functioning relationship follows a saturating curve. However, the foundation from which these conclusions are drawn mostly stems from empirical investigations that have not accounted for post-extinction changes in community composition and structure, or how surviving species respond to new circumstances and modify their contribution to functioning. Here, we use marine sediment-dwelling invertebrate communities to experimentally assess whether post-extinction compensatory mechanisms (simulated by increasing species biomass) have the potential to alter biodiversity-ecosystem function relations. Consistent with recent numerical simulations, we find that the form of the biodiversity-function curve is dependent on whether or not compensatory responses are present, the cause and extent of extinction, and species density. When species losses are combined with the compensatory responses of surviving species, both community composition, dominance structure, and the pool and relative expression of functionally important traits change and affect species interactions and behaviour. These observations emphasize the importance of post-extinction community composition in determining the stability of ecosystem functioning following extinction. Our results caution against the use of the generalized biodiversity-function curve when generating probabilistic estimates of post-extinction ecosystem properties for practical application.

Despite several reports of the recent emergence of L2-Beijing in Africa, no study has investigated the evolutionary history of this sub-lineage on the continent. In this study, we used whole genome sequences of 781 L2 clinical strains from 14 geographical regions globally distributed to investigate the origins and onward spread of this lineage in Africa. Our results reveal multiple introductions of L2-Beijing into Africa linked to independent bacterial populations from East- and Southeast Asia. Bayesian analyses further indicate that these introductions occurred during the past 300 years, with most of these events pre-dating the antibiotic era. Hence, the success of L2-Beijing in Africa is most likely due to its hypervirulence and high transmissibility rather than drug resistance.

The limitations of current oil remediation techniques have inspired researchers to study the application of nanotechnology for oil cleanup. Previously, we reported essentially 100% removal of a reference MC252 oil using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) from oil-water mixtures under a wide range of environmentally relevant conditions. Our previous results showed that in the synthetic water samples, the concentration of cations and natural organic macromolecules (NOM) can significantly affect the oil removal efficiency of NPs. Here, we studied the application of these NPs for oil removal from natural freshwater samples and compared the results with the synthetic water samples with the same concentrations of major ions and NOM. For both natural and synthetic samples, concentrations of NOM, calcium, and magnesium were positively correlated with oil removal (p-value <0.05). NPs show an average of 30% higher oil removal efficiency from natural samples compared to the synthetic samples. Using up to 50 ppm of NP, essentially 100% oil removal was observed under most conditions specially hardwater samples (initial 0.15 g L-1 oil concentration). Results show that these NPs are a facile and reliable technique for removing oil under realistic conditions.

The present study aimed to assess air pollution concentrations in passenger cars from diesel and electric trains. Personal exposure monitoring (6-7 h per day) was carried out for 49 days on diesel and 22 days on electric trains. Diesel trains had higher concentrations of all the assessed air pollution components. Average increases (and fold differences) in passenger cars of diesel trains compared with electric trains were for ultrafine particles 212 000 particles/cm(3) (35-fold), black carbon 8.3 mu g/m(3) (6-fold), NOx 316 mu g/m(3) (8-fold), NO2 38 mu g/m(3) (3-fold), PM2.5 34 mu g/m(3) (2-fold), and benzo(a)pyrene 0.14 mu g/m(3) (6-fold). From time-series data, the pull and push movement modes, the engine in use, and the distance to the locomotive influenced the concentrations inside the diesel trains. In conclusion, concentrations of all air pollutants were significantly elevated in passenger cars in diesel trains compared to electric trains.

Nevertheless, a major component of global warming, the predicted increase in daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs), has been ignored at the interface of evolutionary ecotoxicology and global change biology. We studied whether 4 degrees C warming and a 5 degrees C DTF increase (to 10 degrees C DTF) magnified the negative impact of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) in larvae of low- and high latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. While 4 degrees C warming only increased CPF-induced mortality in high latitude larvae, the high (10 degrees C) DTF increased CPF-induced larval mortality at both latitudes. CPF reduced the heat tolerance; however, this was buffered by latitude-specific thermal adaptation to both mean temperature and DTF. Integrating our results in a space-for-time substitution indicated that gradual thermal evolution in high-latitude larvae may offset the negative effects of CPF on heat tolerance under warming, unless the expected DTF increase is taken into account. Our results highlight the crucial importance of jointly integrating DTFs and thermal evolution to improve risk assessment of toxicants under global warming.

Utilizing Eutrophication Assessment Directives From Transitional to Marine Systems in the Thames Estuary and Liverpool Bay, UK	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						eutrophication; assessment; marine; freshwater; nutrients	SURFACE-STATE VARIABLES; NORTH-SEA; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; COASTAL; PHYTOPLANKTON; OXYGEN; CLASSIFICATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSEQUENCES; REDUCTION	The assessment of eutrophic conditions is a formal requirement of several European Directives. Typically, these eutrophication assessments use a set of primary indicators which include dissolved inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and secondary information such as phytoplankton community data. Each directive is characterized by a different geographical or political boundary which defines the area under assessment. Several disparate sources of data from the Thames estuary and Liverpool Bay in the United Kingdom collected from different monitoring programs were combined to generate a fully integrated dataset. Data sources included remote sensing, ecosystem models, moorings, freshwater inputs and traditional ship surveys. Different methods were explored for assigning ecologically relevant assessment areas including delineation of the assessment area based on salinity, extent of the river plume influence and ecohydrodynamic characteristics in addition to the traditional geographically defined typologies associated with the different directives. Individual eutrophication indicators were tested across these revised typologies for the period 2006-2015, and outcomes of the different metrics were compared across the river to marine continuum for the two UK areas. There have been statistically significant decreasing trends in the loads of ammonium, nitrite and dissolved inorganic phosphorous between 1994 and 2016 in both the Thames estuary and Liverpool Bay study areas but no statistically significant trends in loads of nitrate or dissolved inorganic nitrogen. There have been statistically significant increases in riverine nitrogen: phosphorous between 1994 and 2016. Nutrient concentrations exceeded assessment thresholds across nearly all areas other than the large offshore assessment areas, and outcomes of the chlorophyll metric were often below assessment thresholds in the estuarine-based areas and the offshore areas, but exceedances of thresholds occurred in the near coastal areas. However, trait-based indicators of phytoplankton community using functional groups show changes in plankton community structure over the assessment period, indicating that additional metrics that quantify community shifts could be a useful measurement to include in future eutrophication assessments.

Several Bacillus spp. strains show promising characteristics in the use of several carbon sources and are an interesting alternative for the production of P(HB-co-HV). Sewage from the agricultural and food processing industries can be used to obtain abundantly starch as a carbon source for PHA production. The aim of the present study was to optimize by response surface methodology and desirability, the production of PHA by a Bacillus megaterium strain using starch as the sole carbon source. Two optimal conditions were determined without sporulation and were used to perform new experiments to calibrate and validate a mechanistic model, developed to simulate the dynamics of PHA and biomass production. The developed model successfully represents the kinetics of the microorganism. Employing different characterization techniques, it was determined that the PHA produced by the strain is a copolymer composed of different HB:HV proportions. Using starch as the sole carbon source in a minimal salt medium, this work shows the first reports in the literature of: 1) a mathematical model for predicting growth kinetic and PHA production for B. megaterium strain and 2) a Bacillus spp. producing P(HB-co-HV) copolymer.

In this study, methanotrophic cultures were enriched, under ammonium concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 mM, from an inoculum comprising leachate and top-cover soil from a landfill. Specific CH4 biodegradation rates were highest (7.8 x 10(-4) +/- 6.0 x 10(-5)gCH(4)g(x)(-1)h(-1)) in cultures enriched at 4 mM NH4+, which were mainly dominated by type II methanotrophs belonging to Methylocystis spp. Lower specific CH4 oxidation rates (average values of 1.8-3.6 x 10(-4)gCH(4)g(x)(-1)h(-1)) were achieved by cultures enriched at higher NH4+ concentrations (20 and 80 mM), and had higher affinity for CH4 compared to 4 mM enrichments. These lower affinities were attributed to lower diversity dominated by type I methanotrophs, of the Methylosarcina, Methylobacter and Methylomicrobium genera, encountered with increasing concentrations of NH4+. The study indicates that CH4 oxidation biotechnologies applied at low NH4+ concentrations can support efficient abatement of CH4 and high diversity of methanotrophic consortia, whilst enriching type II methanotrophs.

While both methods are capable of fecal pathogen sterilization, the agronomically-beneficial properties of waste sanitized between methods remains unclear. Therefore, this study compared recovery and quality of soil amendments produced by compostation, torrefaction, and pyrolysis of HSW, established their financial value, and quantified tradeoffs between product value and conversion efficiency. Temperature and associated mass losses significantly affected the physical and chemical properties of thermochemically-treated HSW. Thermophilic composting, a biological sanitation method practiced in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, produced an amendment that contained between 16 and 858-fold more plant-available nitrogen (N; 214.5 mg N/kg) than HSW pyrolyzed between 300 and 700 degrees C (0.2-15.2 mg N/kg). Conversely, HSW pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C had four-fold higher plant-available phosphorus (P; 3117 mg P/kg) and five-folct higher plant-available potassium (K; 7403 mg K/kg) than composted HSW (716 mg P/kg and 1462 mg K/kg). Wide variation between international fertilizer prices on the low end and regional East African prices on the high end resulted in broadspaced quantiles for the value of agronomic components in HSW amendments. Phosphorus and K comprised a disproportionate amount of the value, 52-87%, compared to plant-available N, which contributed less than 2%. The total value of treated HSW, summed across all agronomic components per unit weight amendment, was greatest for thermochemically-treated HSW at 600 degrees C, averaging 220 USD/Mg, more than four-fold that of composted HSW, 53 USD/Mg. In contrast, torrefaction provided the highest monetary value per unit weight feedstock, 144 USD/Mg, as low heating temperatures engender minimal mass loss and higher nutrient densities per unit weight feedstock, compared to composted or pyrolyzed HSW. When benchmarked against total N, P, and K of eight commonly-applied organic amendments, including sewage-sludge (Milorganite), compost, and alfalfa meal, HSW pyrolyzed at 700 degrees C was of greatest value per unit weight of amendment, 365 USD/Mg, compared to 89 USD/Mg for composted HSW, and contained 2.9% total N (0.5 mg available N/kg), 3.1% total P (7640 mg available P/kg), 3.5% total K (17,671 mg available K/kg).

However, the response is far from clear at plant community level, especially for grassland systems. Using a long-term field experiment initiated 123 years ago with varying soil nutrient levels (deficient, sub-optimal, optimal and over-optimal) established by use of two nutrient sources (animal manure or mineral fertiliser), we examined the effects of soil nutrient level and source on herbage yield and composition, root biomass and root-to-shoot (R/S) ratio of an unfertilised multispecies grass-legume ley. Increased nutrient levels enhanced herbage yield, but did not affect root biomass. The R/S ratio decreased from deficient to sub-optimal level, but remained constant from optimal to over-optimal level. Nutrient source did not influence herbage yield, root biomass or R/S ratio, but the legume proportion increased in soils previously receiving mineral fertiliser. The R/S ratio decreased with herbage yield, but did not vary with herbage composition. We conclude that soil nutrient level and herbage yield rather than nutrient source and herbage composition determine biomass allocation between aboveground and belowground in temperate grassland leys.

Recent methods combining per capita feeding rates, population abundances and environmental contexts have shown great utility in predicting invader impacts. Here, clearance rates of the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and native mussel, Mytilus edulis, were investigated in a laboratory experiment where oscillatory water flow and algal food concentrations were manipulated. Invasive oysters had lower clearance rates than native mussels in all experimental groups and did not differ among flow velocities or food concentrations. Native mussel clearance rates were higher at 5 cm s(-1) compared to 0 and 15 cm s(-1) flow velocities and increased with increasing food concentration. The Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric was used to assess (i) the influence of flow velocity and food concentration on potential impacts of C gigas on plankton resources and, (ii) the impacts of coexisting reefs, containing both species, on resources compared to monospecific native mussel beds. Greatest Relative Impact Potential of invasive oysters was seen at the lowest flow velocity, but became reduced with increasing flow velocity and food concentration. Relative Impact Potentials of coexisting reefs were generally greater than monospecific native mussel beds, with greatest impacts predicted at lowest flow velocity. We suggest that the greatest ecological impacts and competition potential of C. gigas will occur in areas with low flow velocity, but that increased flow will mediate co-existence between the two species.

The importance of fire season when managing threatened plant species: A long-term case-study of a rare Leucopogon species (Ericaceae)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fire ecology; Plant functional traits; Fire interval squeeze; Mediterranean versus non-Mediterranean climates; Physiological dormancy; Seed ecology	POPULATION VIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PERSISTENCE; EXTINCTION; BIOLOGY; CONSERVATION; GERMINATION; WIDESPREAD; RESPONSES; DORMANCY	Implemented burns are a primary source of fire in natural systems and occur outside of the wildfire season. However, the impacts of fire season shift on native plant species are rarely studied. Understanding fire season effects are particularly important for managing threatened species, which are often the focus of managed burn(s). To assess the impacts of fire seasonality and identify potential limiting traits, I studied the threatened Leucopogon exolasius and two common congeners, all of which persist via fire-driven population dynamics. All species were monitored over a 16 year period to assess seedling survival, growth and primary juvenile period after fire. For L. exolasius and the common L. esquamatus, comparisons of survival, growth and maturation were made after winter and summer fires, to assess the effects of season of burn. A key difference was found in primary juvenile period, which was exceptionally long for L. exolasius (> 11 years for 80% of the population to flower) compared to the common congeners (3.2-7.57 years). Seasonal seed dormancy mechanisms meant that winter fires delayed emergence, leading to increases in primary juvenile period for both species. A long primary juvenile period may limit L. exolasius population persistence because plants are more likely to be killed by subsequent fire before maturation, while seasonal dormancy cues is a trait that would exacerbate the effects of this interval squeeze. In fire-prone systems, fire frequency is the key factor assumed to drive persistence, however, interactions with fire season can influence recruitment success. There are scant data on recruitment variation in response to fire seasonality, a factor that may have broad implications for rare and common species with seasonal germination requirements.

A screening approach to improve water management practices in undeveloped shale plays, with application to the transboundary Eagle Ford Formation in northeast Mexico	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Shale plays; Hydraulic fracturing; Eagle Ford; Water stress; Mexico	GAS DEVELOPMENT; UNITED-STATES; UNCONVENTIONAL OIL; INDUCED SEISMICITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; IMPACT; GROUNDWATER; RESOURCES; BASIN	Hydraulic fracturing (HF) operations have transformed the unconventional energy industry, leading to a global increase in hydrocarbon production. Despite this, only the US, China, Canada and Argentina currently dominate production of unconventional resources, with the majority of shale basins globally remaining unprofitable to develop. An important gap in current water-energy nexus research, which this study addresses, is the assessment of potential water use to satisfy HF procedures in emergent plays. This work presents a screening tool for assessing first-order estimates of water impacts in undeveloped shale plays, testing the approach in the trans boundary Eagle Ford (EF) play in northeast Mexico. We couple surface water and groundwater stress indicators derived from global hydrological variables to depict a baseline water stress index. Relative water stress is mapped for proposed blocks to be leased by the Mexican government in the future. We simulate four HF scenarios to assess new total water stress indicators for each block, considering shale production schemes using representative well drilling density (well lateral length(s) per unit area) and HF water intensity (HF water volume per unit lateral length) from existing EF development in Texas. Results suggest that the most feasible management scenario would consider the drilling of similar to 1360 new unconventional wells/yr with projected HF water use of similar to 57 Mm(3)/yr (0.7% of the total water withdrawals). The remaining scenarios will largely affect groundwater resources. Though applied to the EF in Mexico, this screening tool can assess water use constraints in emerging unconventional plays globally.

We described a silvopastoral landscape, searching for browsed plants to assess how much of the forest is actually used for this end, and also searching for potential new useful species for silvopastoral purposes. The first objective was accomplished through a floristic description, making observations of individuals with browsing marks. Information from interviews, bromatological analyses and vegetative propagation tests further complemented this information to achieve the second objective. We classified the results using Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs). A great variety of nutritious browsed plants was found, distributed across various types of vegetation, growth habits and taxonomic groups: forest frontiers already are like silvopastoral systems. Various plants like Acalypha leptopoda, Montanoa tomentosa and Verbesina perymenioides are interesting prospects for further intensification of silvopastoral systems.

The best management option is elimination or at least minimization of effluence into the environment, but in several regions, mining wastewater or acid mine drainage (AMD) effluence into natural wetlands has continued. The ability of wetlands to attenuate heavy metals in mining wastewater and AMD has led to natural wetlands being used as recipients of these effluents in many parts of the world. Ten greenhouse-based laboratory-scale constructed wetlands (GLCW) were set up at IHE-Delft Institute for Water Education to understand the mechanisms and fate of heavy metals in three Zambian wetlands in attenuation of Co, Cu, and Pb. These were operated as Free Water Surface Constructed Wetlands (FWS-CWs). The principal investigations compared how vegetated and unvegetated microcosm artificial wetlands retained controlled additions of heavy metals and the effect of drying and rewetting on that. The potential for phytoremediation using Typha angustifolia was also investigated. Typha angustifolia was planted in three vegetated and compared with one unvegetated treatment. Treatments A, B, and, the investigated, Treatment D received synthetic wastewater containing Co, Cu, and Pb, while a control, Treatment C, received tap water. Water samples were taken throughout the experiment, and sediment samples collected after the first flushing and before drying. Samples of T. angustifolia were taken before drying the wetlands. Analyses for Co, Cu, and Pb were made in the water and sediment, and in roots, stems and leaves of plant samples. The unvegetated Dutch sediments GLCWs removed more Co from wastewater (52%) than the vegetated Dutch and Zambian sediments GLCWs (13% and -4%, respectively). There was a similar removal of Cu among the GLCWs receiving wastewater (81%-87%). The removal of Pb was significantly higher in the vegetated Dutch sediment GLCWs than the unvegetated Dutch sediments GLCWs, (89% and 72%, respectively). It was concluded that a hectare of the vegetated Zambian sediments with similar design parameters of 50 mg/m(2).day for Co, Cu, and Pb used in the experiment would on average retain 83 g/day of Co, and 417 g/day of both Cu and Pb. After drying, Co, Cu, and Pb washed out on the first day of rewetting. The washout after that took only a few days. How long the metals washed out of the GLCWs was in order Co > Cu > Pb. T. angustifolia could neither be classified as an accumulator nor an excluder species because the concentrations of Co, Cu, and Pb in the sediments and T. angustifolia were below phytotoxic levels mainly due to a short running period of the experiment.

Maladaptive nest-site selection by a sagebrush dependent species in a grazing-modified landscape	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Maladaptive selection; Grazing; Fences; Sagebrush; Sage-grouse	GREATER SAGE-GROUSE; HABITAT SELECTION; LINEAR FEATURES; SURVIVAL; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; COYOTES	Animals are expected to select habitats that maximize their fitness over evolutionary time scales. Yet in human modified landscapes, habitat selection might not always lead to increased fitness because animals undervalue high-quality resources that appear less attractive than those of lower quality. In the American West, agriculture has modified landscapes, yet little is known about whether agricultural changes alter the reliability of the cues animals use to identify habitat quality; ultimately forming maladaptive breeding strategies where behavioral cues are mismatched with survival outcomes. Using the greater sage-grouse, a species highly dependent upon sagebrush landscapes, we (1) evaluated how females select nesting habitats based on sagebrush type, along with livestock grazing related linear and point features, and other biotic, abiotic characteristics, given hypothesized influences on hiding cover, microclimate and predator travel routes and perches, (2) compared habitat selection information with results for nest survival estimates to evaluate if selection appears to be adaptive or not, and (3) used our results to evaluate the most appropriate strategies for this species in a grazing-modified landscape. Nest-site selection for sagebrush type appears to be maladaptive: in the most-preferred sagebrush type, nest survival rate was one-fourth the rate realized by females nesting in the sagebrush type avoided. Nest survival was four times higher for nests placed away from (> 100 m), rather than next to (1 m), the nearest fence, and survival was lower within sites with higher cow pie density (a proxy for previous grazing intensity). Live and dead grasses influenced selection and survival in opposing ways such that dead grass was selected for but resulted in reduced survival while live grass was avoided but resulted in increased survival. Results collectively provide the first empirical evidence that a specific type of sagebrush acts as an ecological trap while another sagebrush type is undervalued. These results also suggest that adding more fences to control livestock grazing systems will likely reduce sage-grouse nest survival.

Occurrence of coliphage in raw wastewater and in ambient water: A meta-analysis	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Raw wastewater; Ambient water; Systematic review; Microbial risk assessment; Male-specific coliphage; Somatic coliphage	HUMAN ENTERIC VIRUSES; MICROBIAL SOURCE TRACKING; ESCHERICHIA-COLI HOST; PUBLIC-HEALTH RISK; SOMATIC COLIPHAGES; RIVER WATER; VIRAL CONTAMINATION; RECREATIONAL WATERS; FECAL CONTAMINATION; SECONDARY-TREATMENT	Coliphage have been proposed as indicators of fecal contamination in recreational waters because they better reflect the persistence of pathogenic viruses in the environment and through wastewater treatment than traditional fecal indicator bacteria. Herein, we conducted a systematic literature search of peer-reviewed publications to identify coliphage density data (somatic and male-specific, or MSC) in raw wastewater and ambient waters. The literature review inclusion criteria included scope, study quality, and data availability. A non-parametric two-stage bootstrap analysis was used to estimate the coliphage distributions in raw wastewater and account for geographic region and season. Additionally, two statistical methodologies were explored for developing coliphage density distributions in ambient waters, to account for the nondetects in the datasets. In raw wastewater, the analysis resulted in seasonal density distributions of somatic coliphage (SC) (mean 6.5 log(10) plaque forming units (PFU)/L; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.2-6.8) and MSC (mean 5.9 log(10) PFU/L; 95% CI: 5.5-6.1). In ambient waters, 49% of MSC samples were nondetects, compared with less than 5% for SC. Overall distributional estimates of ambient densities of coliphage were statistically higher for SC than for MSC (mean 3.4 and 1.0 log(10) PFU/L, respectively). Distributions of coliphage in raw wastewater and ambient water will be useful for future microbial risk assessments. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of E-coli in intertidal estuarine sediments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						FIO; Estuaries; Pathogens; Bathing water quality; Sediments	FECAL-COLIFORMS; WATERBORNE PATHOGENS; SEASONAL VARIABILITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; BATHING WATER; FRESH-WATER; E. COLI; SURVIVAL; BACTERIA; RELEASE	Microbiological water quality monitoring of bathing waters does not account for faecal indicator organisms in sediments. Intertidal deposits are a significant reservoir of FIOs and this indicates there is a substantial risk to bathers through direct contact with the sediment, or through the resuspension of bacteria to the water column. Recent modelling efforts include sediment as a secondary source of contamination, however, little is known about the driving factors behind spatial and temporal variation in FIO abundance. E. coli abundance, in conjunction with a wide range of measured variables, was used to construct models to explain E. coli abundance in intertidal sediments in two Scottish estuaries. E. coli concentrations up to 6 log(10) CFU 100 g dry wt(-1) were observed, with optimal models accounting for E. coli variation up to an adjusted R-2 of 0.66. Introducing more complex models resulted in overfitting of models, detrimentally affected the transferability of models between datasets. Salinity was the most important single variable, with season, pH, colloidal carbohydrates, organic content, bulk density and maximum air temperature also featuring in optimal models. Transfer of models, using only lower cost variables, between systems explained an average deviance of 42%. This study demonstrates the potential for cost-effective sediment characteristic monitoring to contribute to FIO fate and transport modelling and consequently the risk assessment of bathing water safety.

Biodiversity of leaf litter fungi in streams along a latitudinal gradient	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Latitudinal diversity gradient; Aquatic fungi; Litter decomposition; Temperature; Streams; Global biodiversity	DIVERSITY GRADIENT; DECOMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE; PATTERNS; COMMUNITIES; ECOLOGY; LEAVES; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SPORULATION; BREAKDOWN	Global patterns of biodiversity have emerged for soil microorganisms, plants and animals, and the extraordinary significance of microbial functions in ecosystems is also well established. Virtually unknown, however, are large-scale patterns of microbial diversity in freshwaters, although these aquatic ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity and biogeochemical processes. Here we report on the first large-scale study of biodiversity of leaf-litter fungi in streams along a latitudinal gradient unravelled by Illumina sequencing. The study is based on fungal communities colonizing standardized plant litter in 19 globally distributed stream locations between 69 degrees N and 44 degrees S. Fungal richness suggests a hump-shaped distribution along the latitudinal gradient. Strikingly, community composition of fungi was more clearly related to thermal preferences than to biogeography. Our results suggest that identifying differences in key environmental drivers, such as temperature, among taxa and ecosystem types is critical to unravel the global patterns of aquatic fungal diversity.

Elevated atmospheric humidity shapes the carbon cycle of a silver birch forest ecosystem: A FAHM study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Net primary production; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Silver birch forest; Soil respiration	GREENHOUSE-GAS FLUXES; AIR HUMIDITY; BETULA-PENDULA; SOIL RESPIRATION; BIOMASS; TURNOVER; CLIMATE; CO2; PATTERNS; MYCELIUM	Processes determining the carbon (C) balance of a forest ecosystem are influenced by a number of climatic and environmental factors. In Northern Europe, a rise in atmospheric humidity and precipitation is predicted. The study aims to ascertain the effect of elevated atmospheric humidity on the components of the C budget and on the C-sequestration capacity of a young birch forest. Biomass production, soil respiration, and other C fluxes were measured in young silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) stands growing on the Free Air Humidity Manipulation (FAHM) experimental site, located in South-East Estonia. The C input fluxes: C sequestration in trees and understory, litter input into soil, and methane oxidation, as well as C output fluxes: soil heterotrophic respiration and C leaching were estimated. Humidified birch stands stored C from the atmosphere, but control stands can be considered as C neutral. Two years of elevated air humidity increased C sequestration in the understory but decreased it in trees. Humidification treatment increased remarkably the C input to the soil. The main reason for such an increase was the higher root litter input into the soil, brought about by the more than two-fold increase of belowground biomass production of the understory in the humidification treatment. Elevated atmospheric humidity increased C sequestration in young silver birch stands, mitigating increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, the effect of elevated atmospheric humidity is expected to decrease over time, as plants and soil organisms acclimate, and new communities emerge. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Primarily, picocyanobacteria belonging to the genus Synechococcus and filamentous cyanobacterial group belonging to Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum dominated top water column during non-bloom and bloom periods respectively. The dominance of Synechococcus in early summer informs that blooming in Utah Lake starts in early summer and then later is taken over by other bloom-forming cyanobacteria, such as species belonging to the genus Aphanizomenon. A strong negative correlation (r = -0.9, p < 0.001) was found between the occurrence of Aphanizomenon and Synechococcus which correlates very well with the fact that the blooms of these two different cyanobacteria never coexisted. The predominance of cyanobacteria in 2017 was attributed more to temperature (r = 0.18, p < 0.001). The Actinobacteria was negatively correlated with primary production and high chlorophyll a concentration. Flavobacterium and Limnohabitans were the main phytoplankton colonizers and predators detected that could secrete extracellular enzymes to degrade algal exudates (such as proteins and polysaccharides). Additionally, cyanotoxins producers Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix accounted for up to 12.43% and 7.04% of total cyanobacteria abundance during blooms. The relative abundance of chloroplast reads was overall lower than the cyanobacteria reads, except for the May 5th sampling in 2017. There was interannual variability in the bloom-associated heterotrophic bacterial populations, but these populations were consistent with bloom-associated bacterial populations found in other lakes. Community diversity analysis for both Shannon and Simpson indices indicated lower community diversity during the bloom period. The beta diversity conducted by PCoA and UPGMA trees suggested the significant temporal rather than spatial impacts on shaping the phytoplankton community structures during the summer season.

Although studies indicated that climate will significantly affect forest litterfall, the role of biotic factors such as the spatial heterogeneity of forest age, remains unclear. In this study, we built an updated dataset of litterfall in China and explored the key drivers affecting forest litterfall by establishing optimal linear mixed models (OLMMs). The potential bias of models and their spatial patterns were then evaluated based on the OLMMs and remotely sensed and China's forest inventory data. The results showed the mean annual temperature (MAT) and forest age were the key drivers affecting forest litterfall. Abiotic factors and forest age and height together accounted for 77.5% of the variation in observed litterfall. Although forest age and height did not apparently enhance the coefficient of determination (R-2), these factors significantly decreased spatial errors. Therefore, if the model contains only climate factors and the spatial patterns of biotic factors are ignored, it will produce high spatial errors (-52% to 92%). In addition, when forest age and height were not considered, variation of litterfall explained by forest age was inappropriately attributed to MAT, which significantly overestimated the importance of climate factors on forest litterfall. Specifically, litterfall was overestimated for young forests and underestimated for old forests if the model did not contain forest age in China. Models that ignored forest age significantly overestimated the contribution of climatic factors on forest litterfall and produced high spatially specific errors. The comparison of the litterfall modeled by OLMMs and the remote sensing-based net primary production (NPP) indicated that litterfall and NPP are strongly dependent, and the ratio of litterfall to NPP linearly increased with forest age.

The emission of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) puts the surrounding environment inevitably into contact with this radiation. We have therefore exposed honey bee queen larvae to the radiation of a common mobile phone device (GSM band at 900 MHz) during all stages of their pre-adult development including pupation. After 14 days of exposure, hatching of adult queens was assessed and mating success after further 11 days, respectively. Moreover, full colonies were established of five of the untreated and four of the treated queens to contrast population dynamics. We found that mobile phone radiation had significantly reduced the hatching ratio but not the mating success. If treated queens had successfully mated, colony development was not adversely affected. We provide evidence that mobile phone radiation may alter pupal development, once succeeded this point, no further impairment has manifested in adulthood. Our results are discussed against the background of long-lasting consequences for colony performance and the possible implication on periodic colony losses. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, processes and factors controlling these transfers and transformations are not well constrained, particularly with respect to land use effect. We compared C and IN concentrations in shallow groundwater and first-order streams of a sandy lowland catchment dominated by two types of land use: pine forest and maize cropland. Contrary to forest groundwater, crop groundwater exhibited oxic conditions all-year round as a result of higher evapotranspiration and better lateral drainage that decreased the water table below the organic-rich soil horizon, prevented the leaching of soil-generated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in groundwater, and thus limited consumption of dissolved oxygen (O-2). In crop groundwater, oxic conditions inhibited denitrification and methanogenesis resulting in high nitrate (NO3-; on average 1140 +/- 485 mu mol L-1) and low methane (CH4; 40 +/- 25 nmol L-1) concentrations. Conversely, anoxic conditions in forest groundwater led to lower NO3- (25 +/- 40 mu mol L-1) and higher CH4 (1770 +/- 1830 nmol L-1) concentrations. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2); 30,650 +/- 11,590 ppmv) in crop groundwater was significantly lower than in forest groundwater (50,630 +/- 26,070 ppmv), and was apparently caused by the deeper water table delaying downward diffusion of soil CO2 to the water table. In contrast, pCO(2) was not significantly different in crop (4480 +/- 2680 ppmv) and forest (4900 +/- 4500 ppmv) streams, suggesting faster degassing in forest streams resulting from greater water turbulence. Although NO3- concentrations indicated that denitrification occurred in riparian-forest groundwater, crop streams nevertheless exhibited important signs of spring and summer eutrophication such as the development of macrophytes. Stream eutrophication favored development of anaerobic conditions in crop stream sediments, as evidenced by increased ammonia (NH4+) and CH4 in stream waters and concomitant decreased in NO3- concentrations as a result of sediment denitrification. In crop streams, dredging and erosion of streambed sediments during winter sustained high concentration of particulate organic C, NH4+ and CH4. In forest streams, dissolved iron (Fe2+), NH4+ and CH4 were negatively correlated with O-2 reflecting the gradual oxygenation of stream water and associated oxidations of Fe2+, NH4+ and CH4. The results overall showed that forest groundwater behaved as source of CO2 and CH4 to streams, the intensity depending on the hydrological connectivity among soils, groundwater, and streams. CH4 production was prevented in cropland in soils and groundwater, however crop groundwater acted as a source of CO2 to streams (but less so than forest groundwater). Conversely, in streams, pCO(2) was not significantly affected by land use while CH4 production was enhanced by cropland. At the catchment scale, this study found substantial biogeochemical heterogeneity in C and IN concentrations between forest and crop waters, demonstrating the importance of including the full vegetation-groundwater-stream continuum when estimating land-water fluxes of C (and nitrogen) and attempting to understand their spatial and temporal dynamics.

Oil sands process-affected water impairs the olfactory system of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Olfactory sensory neuron; Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; Electro-olfactography; Histopathology, Toxicity	NAPHTHENIC ACIDS; ACUTE TOXICITY; COPPER; AVOIDANCE; RESPONSES; FISH; DEGRADATION; EPITHELIUM; FRACTIONS; APOPTOSIS	Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), a byproduct of the extraction of bitumen in the surface mining of oil sands, is currently stored in massive on-site tailings ponds. Determining the potential effects of OSPW on aquatic ecosystems is of main concern to oil sands companies and legislators concerned about the reclamation of mining sites. In the present study, the interaction of OSPW with the chemosensory system of rainbow trout was studied. Using an electro-olfactography (EOG) technique, a 24 h inhibition curve was established and concentrations that inhibit the olfactory system by 20% and 80% (IC20 and IC80) were estimated at 3% and 22% OSPW, respectively. To study the interaction of exposure time and concentration along with the mechanism of the toxic effects, rainbow trout were exposed to 3% and 22% OSPW for 2, 24, and 96 h. An EOG investigation of olfactory sensitivity demonstrated a positive interaction between exposure time and concentration of OSPW concentration, because an increase in either or both elevated the inhibitory effect. To investigate whether or not structural damage of the olfactory epithelium could account for the observed inhibitory effects of OSPW on fish olfaction, the ultrastructure of the olfactory epithelium of exposed fish was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). The SEM micrographs showed no changes in the structure of the olfactory epithelium. The light micrographs revealed an increase in the number of mucous cells in 22% OSPW. The results of the present study demonstrated that exposure to OSPW impairs the olfactory system of rainbow trout and its effects increase gradually with increasing exposure time. The present study demonstrated that structural epithelial damage did not contribute to the inhibitory effects of OSPW on the olfactory system.

Seed mix type but not planting method or seed priming affect grassland restoration outcomes: a greenhouse trial	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						biomass; cellulose gel planting method; germination; multivariate diversity; restoration seed mixes; smoke water seed priming	MESIC GRASSLAND; LAND-USE; SMOKE SOLUTIONS; SOUTH-AFRICA; GERMINATION; DIVERSITY; VEGETATION; BIODIVERSITY; EMERGENCE; HOMOGENIZATION	Commercial seed mixes and various mechanical planting methods have been implemented to overcome barriers to successful restoration of degraded grasslands but their effectiveness in aiding the restoration process has been understudied. Harvested seed must be cleaned of chaff to allow mechanical planting, which can exclude small seeds. We propose that fluid seed drilling techniques (suspending uncleaned harvested seed in a cellulose-based gel matrix, which may then be injected into the soil with a mechanical planter) may overcome these challenges. As a preliminary investigation of the proposed method we designed a greenhouse pot trial experiment aimed at quantifying restoration success through the measurement of seedling recruitment, biomass production and composition responses of commercial and harvested seed mixes under simulated fluid seed drilling and smoke water priming (collectively termed application method). These data were analysed using generalised linear modelling and multivariate analyses. Commercial mixed seed resulted in greater recruitment, whereas harvested seed produced the greatest biomass production. There was large multivariate separation between seed types and seed type x application method centroids for recruitment responses and only seed type for biomass responses. Application method had minimal effects on restoration measurements whilst seed type greatly affected these measurements. Careful selection of the restoration seed mix is advised.

However, for incubating birds, the level of compensation may depend on how reduced care changes the risk of entire brood failure, for example due to clutch predation, and on individual variation in the timing of depletion of energy stores. Although biparental incubation dominates in non-passerines, short-term manipulations of care during incubation are scarce. Here, we describe the response of 25 semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) to an unexpected similar to 12-h absence (experimental removal) of their partner in the middle of the 21-day incubation period. During the period when the removed partner would have taken over to start its regular similar to 12-h incubation bout, parents compensated partially for the absence of their partner's care (mean: 59%, 95% CI: 49-70%). However, individuals varied in their response from no to full compensation, independent of parental sex. In contrast to incubation in undisturbed nests or by uniparental species, nest attendance of compensating parents tended to be higher during the warmer part of the day. Whereas compensation was unrelated to before-experimental share of incubation, parents that left the nest from a further distance upon human approach (more aware of or more "responsive" to their environment) compensated more. The quality of incubation in the after-experimental period, i.e., after return of the partner, was lower than usual, but improved quickly over time. In seven nests where the removed parent never returned, the widowed partner attended the nest for 0-10 days (median: 4), which suggests that widowed semipalmated sandpipers can adjust their incubation behavior to that observed in uniparental incubators. To conclude, our results indicate that biparental incubators are willing to tolerate a missed or irregular incubation bout of their partner. We speculate that all individuals would compensate fully, but that some fail because they deplete their energy stores, while others may be less responsive to or initially unaware of the absence of their partner.

Social and Individual Factors Influence Variation in Offspring Care in the Cooperatively Breeding Western Australian Magpie	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						cooperative breeding; helping behavior; social and individual traits; Western Australian magpie; individual variation; contributions to care	EXTRA-GROUP PATERNITY; GROUP-SIZE; GYMNORHINA-TIBICEN; HELPING-BEHAVIOR; KIN SELECTION; EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION; POSTFLEDGING PERIOD; GROUP AUGMENTATION; EGG-PRODUCTION; BODY CONDITION	In cooperatively breeding species, the level of investment in young can vary substantially. Despite receiving considerable research attention, how and why investment in young varies with cooperatively breeding group members remains unclear. To investigate the causes of variation in care of young, we assessed patterns of both helper and parental behavior in the cooperatively breeding Western Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis). Observations of 19 helpers and 31 parents provisioning 33 broods raised in 11 different groups over two consecutive breeding seasons revealed substantial variation in offspring care behavior. Our results suggest that the level of investment in young by helpers is strongly influenced by group size, chick age, and individual helper traits (including foraging efficiency, age and sex). Helping behavior was facultative, and individuals from smaller groups were more likely to invest in helping behavior. Overall, the number of broods receiving help was lowest during the nestling phase and highest during the fledgling phase. Female helpers provided more care than both male and juvenile helpers. We found thatmothers investmore time in offspring care than do fathers, however fathers increase their effort in the presence of helpers while mothers do not.

Apparent Competition, Lion Predation, and Managed Livestock Grazing: Can Conservation Value Be Enhanced?	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						African savanna; Allee effect; glade; human-occupied landscape; refuge; refuge-mediated apparent competition; wildlife-livestock interactions; hartebeest	SAVANNA HERBIVORE DYNAMICS; DOMINATED LANDSCAPE; LARGE CARNIVORES; PREY; WILDLIFE; DENSITY; POPULATION; ECOSYSTEM; RAINFALL; HABITAT	Predator restorations often result in apparent competition, where co-occurring prey populations experience asymmetric predation pressure driven by predator preferences. In many rangeland ecosystems, livestock share the landscape with wildlife, including ungulates and the large carnivores that consume them. We examined whether apparent competition reorganized prey communities following restoration of lions (Panthera leo) to a savanna ecosystem, and whether and how livestock management could alter this indirect interaction between lions and their prey. Three lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that Jackson's hartebeest (Alcelaphus bucelaphus lelwel; an ungulate of conservation concern) are suppressed via lion-mediated apparent competition. First, hartebeest exhibited an Allee effect where they were exposed to lions, but displayed negative density-dependent population growth where they were protected from lions. Second, spatial overlap between plains zebra (Equus burchelli; the primary prey of lions) and hartebeest further exacerbated lion predation on hartebeest. Finally, hartebeest were killed selectively by lions, whereas zebra were killed by lions in proportion to their abundance. We then tested whether glades [nutrient-rich hotspots created by abandoned cattle (Bos indicus) corrals] could be used to manipulate top-down control of hartebeest via their influence on the spatial distribution of zebra. Zebra aggregated at glades, and survival of hartebeest increased with increasing distance from glades, suggesting that corrals may be placed on the landscape away from hartebeest to create spatial refuges from lions. Our findings demonstrate how informed placement of livestock corrals can be used tomanipulate the spatial distribution of primary prey (zebra), thereby reducing apparent competition suffered by hartebeest. Our work further provides an example of how integrating apparent competition theory with proactive livestock management can improve conservation efforts in multiple-use landscapes.

This problem is particularly salient in areas where populations of humans and wildlife are increasing and share limited space and resources. However, few studies look at how both people and wildlife navigate shared spaces. To better examine people and wildlife within the same environment, we used methods from social science and spatial ecology to investigate how humans and elephants in Botswana utilize trees, a shared natural resource. Trees provide an opportunity to study shared resource use because they are important for people as firewood and for elephants as food and habitat. We compared tree species gathered on 49 firewood collections with the species damaged by elephants in 83 vegetation plots. We found that many tree species were damaged by elephants in ways that would generate firewood. There was also a strong overlap in the tree species that people collected and the species that elephants browsed and/or damaged. We compared spatially-explicit firewood collection locations and movement data from elephant GPS collars to model resource selection by people and elephants. Proximity to settlements was a strong driving factor for people in firewood collection, while various factors including vegetation characteristics played a role in predicting elephant movement. We found that areas where people collect firewood were negatively correlated with daytime elephant movement and positively correlatedwith nighttime elephantmovement. We further compared the times that people collected firewood with the times when elephants were near the villages and found that people collected firewood during daylight hours when elephants were not nearby, providing further evidence of temporal partitioning. People and elephants utilized the same species of trees, and also had correlated spatial patterns of resource selection. Therefore, elephant foraging of trees provides a previously unrecognized utility to people in the form of firewood creation, and temporal partitioning allows this to occur without direct human-elephant interaction.

Rare breeds may carry important genes that allow breeders to respond to global production challenges including climate change and emerging disease risk. Yet, exploration of approaches to improve cost-effectiveness of investments in farm animal genetic diversity has been limited. We employ multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to investigate how rare breed incentive schemes can be rationalised. A performance matrix was used to assess 19 UK cattle native breeds at risk, in terms of diversity, marketability, and endangerment criteria, and an expert workshop was used to assign weights for prioritisation. The workshop participants suggested that criteria pertaining to diversity, marketability and endangerment should be weighted 30, 20, and 50%, respectively. A principal component analysis (PCA) on the criteria suggested that fewer criteria could be used to characterise breed status but that each criteria node contributed effectively in explaining variation in breed scores. Breed scores from the MCDA model were used in a hypothetical exercise to rationalise monetary investments across the case study breeds. The allocation of the hypothetical breed improvement fund (BIF) revealed that the greatest variation in the allocation of incentives occurred when marketability was weighted highest, while least variation occurred when endangerment received the highest weight. We suggest MCDA can support more targeted investments in diversity by considering the multiple factors that may be driving extinction risk in addition to the cultural and diversity attributes that compliment conservation.

However, information on species-specific effects of ship traffic on seabirds at sea is limited, and tools are needed to prioritize species and areas to support the integration of conservation needs in Marine Spatial Planning. In this study, we investigated the responses of 26 characteristic seabird species in the German North and Baltic Seas to experimental ship disturbance using large datasets collected as part of the Seabirds at Sea counts. We developed a Disturbance Vulnerability Index (DVI) for ship traffic combining indicators for species' shyness, escape costs, and compensatory potential, and analyzed the relationships among shyness, escape costs, and vulnerability. The DVI was calculated using the following eight indicators: escape distance, proportion of escaping birds, proportion of birds swimming prior to disturbance, wing loading, habitat use flexibility, biogeographic population size, adult survival rate, European threat and conservation status. Species-specific disturbance responses differed considerably, with common scoters (Melanitta nigra) and red-throated loons (Gavia stellata) showing the longest escape distances and highest proportions of escaping individuals. Red-throated loon, black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), Arctic loon (Gavia arctica), velvet scoter (Melanitta fusca), and red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator) had the highest DVI values, and gulls and terns had the lowest. Contrary to theoretical considerations, shyness correlated positively with escape costs, with the shyest species also being the most vulnerable among the species studied. The strong reactions of several species to disturbance by ships suggest the need for areas with little or no disturbance in some marine protected areas, to act as a refuge for vulnerable species. This DVI can be used in combination with distribution data to identify the areas most vulnerable to disturbance.

Receptor modelling of both particle composition and size distribution from a background site in London, UK - a two-step approach	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; NUMBER CONCENTRATIONS; PMF ANALYSIS; AEROSOLS	Some air pollution datasets contain multiple variables with a range of measurement units, and combined analysis using positive matrix factorization (PMF) can be problematic but can offer benefits through the greater information content. In this work, a novel method is devised and the source apportionment of a mixed unit dataset (PM10 mass and number size distribution, NSD) is achieved using a novel two-step approach to PMF. In the first step the PM10 data are PMF-analysed using a source apportionment approach in order to provide a solution which best describes the environment and conditions considered. The time series G values (and errors) of the PM10 solution are then taken forward into the second step, where they are combined with the NSD data and analysed in a second PMF analysis. This results in NSD data associated with the apportioned PM10 factors. We exemplify this approach using data reported in the study of Beddows et al. (2015), producing one solution which unifies the two separate solutions for PM10 and NSD data datasets together. We also show how regression of the NSD size bins and the G time series can be used to elaborate the solution by identifying NSD factors (such as nucleation) not influencing the PM10 mass.

Here, we used the general additive models to determine the trends of taxonomic diversity (species richness, SR), phylogenetic and functional diversity (PD and FD), phylogenetic structure net relatedness index (NRI), and functional structure net functional relatedness index (NFRI) of seed plants along the elevational gradient in Mount Kenya, a tropical mountain in Africa. Wemeasured growth form, fruit type, maximumheight, andmaximum leaf size of each species, calculated the phylogenetic signal of each trait, and tested the Pearson correlation coefficients between NRI and NFRI of each trait. Our results showed that SR, PD, and FD decreased gradually along the elevational gradient. NRI exhibited a fluctuating pattern along the elevational gradient, while NFRI of the four functional traits showed noticeably different patterns. We concluded that the relationship between the phylogenetic and functional structures in different functional traits could be congruent or mismatched along the elevational gradient. Compared with relatively conservative categorical traits (e.g., growth form and fruit type), continuous traits (e.g., height and leaf size) have a random or convergent evolutionary pattern. Therefore, they could be more easily affected by the environment and possibly have higher phenotypic plasticity.

The seedlings were grown in greenhouses for ambient CO2 (400 ppm) and in enclosed CO2-controlled chambers, which were installed inside the greenhouses for elevated CO2 (800 ppm). The tidal flooding duration was set-up according to the species distribution in the intertidal zone in New Caledonia for the controlled treatment and was increased by 1 h 45min for the experimental treatment. A total of 400 A. marina and 720 R. stylosa were monitored during this experiment. We measured heights and basal diameters of all seedlings every 90 days, and we determined the above and below ground biomass at the end of the experiment. Our results showed that elevated CO2 increased the growth rates of both A. marina and R. stylosa, for which the final biomass was, respectively, 46 and 32% higher than in the ambient CO2 treatment. We suggest that this increase was driven by a stimulation of photosynthesis under elevated CO2, as demonstrated in a previous study. Considering the tidal flooding duration treatment, we observed a contrasted effect between the species. Longer tidal flooding increased the growth of A. marina, whereas it reduced the growth of R. stylosa in comparison to the controlled treatment. This result may be related to the specific ecosystem zonation in this semi-arid climate, which limits water inputs into the Avicennia zone that increases the salt concentration in the soil, whereas Rhizophora is regularly submerged by tides due to its lower position in the intertidal zone. As a result, the combination of both treatments had a positive cumulative effect on the growth of A. marina. Although it was not the case for R. stylosa, the negative effect of longer tidal flooding on this species did not suppress the enhancement of growth resulting from elevated CO2 concentrations. At the end of the experiment, elevated CO2 increased the C:Nratios of the seedlings, thereby producing a more refractory organic matter, which will potentially result in lower decomposition rates and thus may increase carbon accumulation in mangrove soils. These results suggest that future climate changes may enhance the productivity of mangrove seedlings by increasing their growth, which may in turn increase the carbon storage potential of mangroves in their biomass.

We analyzed time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from LandTrendr spectral-temporal segmentation fitting to examine post-fire NBR recovery for several wildfires that occurred in three different coniferous forest types in western North America during the years 2000 to 2007. We summarized NBR recovery trends, and investigated the influence of burn severity, post-fire climate, and topography on post-fire vegetation recovery via random forest (RF) analysis. Results: NBR recovery across forest types averaged 30 to 44% five years post fire, 47 to 72% ten years post fire, and 54 to 77% 13 years post fire, and varied by time since fire, severity, and forest type. Recovery rates were generally greatest for several years following fire. Recovery in terms of percent NBR was often greater for higher-severity patches. Recovery rates varied between forest types, with conifer-oak-chaparral showing the greatest NBR recovery rates, mixed conifer showing intermediate rates, and ponderosa pine showing slowest rates. Between 1 and 28% of patches had recovered to pre-fire NBR levels 9 to 16 years after fire, with greater percentages of low-severity patches showing full NBR recovery. Precipitation decreased and temperatures generally remained the same or increased post fire. Pre-fire NBR and burn severity were important predictors of NBR recovery for all forest types, and explained 2 to 6% of the variation in post-fire NBR recovery. Post-fire climate anomalies were also important predictors of NBR recovery and explained an additional 30 to 41% of the variation in post-fire NBR recovery. Conclusions: Landsat time series analysis was a useful means of describing and analyzing post-fire vegetation recovery across mixed-severity wildfire extents. We demonstrated that a relationship exists between post-fire vegetation recovery and climate in temperate ecosystems of western North America. Our methods could be applied to other burned landscapes for which spatially explicit measurements of post-fire vegetation recovery are needed.

Rapid response of habitat structure and above-ground carbon storage to altered fire regimes in tropical savanna	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							WOODY VEGETATION STRUCTURE; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; AUSTRALIAN SAVANNAS; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; DOMINANT TREE; BIOMASS; FOREST; DYNAMICS; GRASS	Fire regimes across the globe have been altered through changes in land use, land management, and climate conditions. Understanding how these modified fire regimes impact vegetation structure and dynamics is essential for informed biodiversity conservation and carbon management in savanna ecosystems. We used a fire experiment at the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP), northern Australia, to investigate the consequences of altered fire regimes for vertical habitat structure and above-ground carbon storage. We mapped vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure in high spatial resolution with airborne lidar across 18 replicated 1 ha plots of varying fire frequency and season treatments. We used lidar-derived canopy height and cover metrics to extrapolate field-based measures of woody biomass to the full extent of the experimental site (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 7.35 tC ha(-1)) and analysed differences in above-ground carbon storage and canopy structure among treatments. Woody canopy cover and biomass were highest in the absence of fire (76% and 39.8 tC ha(-1)) and lowest in plots burnt late in the dry season on a biennial basis (42% and 18.2 t Cha(-1)). Woody canopy vertical profiles differed among all six fire treatments, with the greatest divergence in height classes < 5 m. The magnitude of fire effects on vegetation structure varied along the environmental gradient underpinning the experiment, with less reduction in biomass in plots with deeper soils. Our results highlight the large extent to which fire management can shape woody structural patterns in savanna landscapes, even over time frames as short as a decade. The structural profile changes shown here, and the quantification of carbon reduction under late dry season burning, have important implications for habitat conservation, carbon sequestration, and emission reduction initiatives in the region.

However, reported effects of CF, as applied by smallholders, on storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa differ considerably between studies. This is partly due to differences in management practice, soil type and adoption level between individual farmers. Where CF involves planting basins, year-to-year changes in position of basins make SOC stock estimates more uncertain. Here we assess the difference in SOC build-up and soil quality between inside planting basins (receiving inputs of lime and fertilizer; basins opened each year) and outside planting basins (no soil disturbance or inputs other than residues) under hand-hoe tilled CF in an Acrisol at Mkushi, Zambia. Seven years of strict CF husbandry significantly improved soil quality inside planting basins as compared with outside basins. Significant effects were found for SOC concentration (0.74 +/- 0.06% vs. 0.57 +/- 0.08%), SOC stock (20.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 16.4 +/- 2.6 t ha(-1), 0-20 cm), soil pH (6.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.95 +/- 0.4) and cation exchange capacity (3.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4 cmol(c) kg(-1)). As planting basins only occupy 9.3% of the field, the absolute rate of increase in SOC, compared with outside basins, was 0.05 t C ha(-1) yr(-1). This corresponds to an overall relative increase of 2.95% SOC yr(-1) in the upper 20 cm of the soil. Also, hot water extractable carbon (HWEC), a proxy for labile organic matter, and potential nitrification rates were consistently greater inside than outside basins. The significant increase in quantity and quality of SOC may be due to increased inputs of roots, due to favorable conditions for plant growth through input of fertilizer and lime, along with increased rainwater infiltration in the basins.

Do agricultural pesticides in streams influence riparian spiders?

Emerging insects are prey for predators in the riparian zone, enriching the terrestrial ecosystemwith energy and nutrients. Stressors associated with agriculture can alter insect communities in water and on land, resulting in complex response patterns of terrestrial predators relying on prey fromboth systems. Examining the effects from individual agricultural stressors such as pesticides is hampered in landscapes with intensive agriculture where multiple stressors like habitat degradation and typically co-occur. In rural regions of Eastern Europe, traditional low intensity agriculture based on working animals and human labour prevails alongside intensive, mechanised agriculture. Assuming that low-intensity agriculture relies on no or limited pesticide use, whereas fertilizer use is similar across different agricultural intensities, such regionsmay allowto study in-streampesticide effects independent fromother stressors, such as nutrient input or habitat degradation. We examined the taxonomic and trait response of riparian spider communities to gradients of agricultural stressors and environmental variables in the region around Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Pesticide sampling was done using passive samplers in the streams adjacent to spider sampling sites. To capture spiders with different traits and survival strategies, we used multiple collection methods. Community composition was best explained by in-stream pesticide toxicity and shading of the stream bank, a proxy for the quality of the habitat. Species richness and the number of spider individuals were negatively associated with in-stream pesticide toxicity. In contrast, mean body size and shading preference of spider communities responded strongest to shading, whereas mean niche width (habitat preference for moisture and shading) responded strongest to the other environmental variables. Our study suggests that in-stream pesticide toxicity can influence riparian communities. The identification of mechanisms requires further studies targeting the potential contributions of direct toxicity and indirect effects from reduced aquatic and terrestrial prey availability.

Effects of four years of elevated ozone on microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities in a semi-natural grassland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						(semi-)Natural vegetation; Climate change; Hydrolytic enzymes; FACE; Soil aggregates	COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; EXTRACTION METHOD; ORGANIC-MATTER; SOIL; O-3; CO2; TREES; METAANALYSIS	Reduced belowground carbon (C) allocation by plants exposed to ozone may change properties and activities of the microbial community in soils. To investigate how soil microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities respond to elevated ozone, we collected soils from a temperate grassland after four years of ozone exposure under fully open-air field conditions. We measured soil microbial biomass, the metabolism of low molecular weight C substrates and hydrolytic extracellular enzyme activities in both bulk soil and isolated aggregates to assess changes in microbial activity and community function. After four years of elevated ozone treatment, soil total organic C was reduced by an average of 20% compared with ambient condition. Elevated ozone resulted in a small but insignificant reduction (4-10%) in microbial biomass in both bulk soil and isolated aggregates. Activities of extracellular enzymes were generally not affected by elevated ozone, except beta-glucosidase, whose activity in bulk soil was significantly lower under elevated ozone than ambient condition. Activities of beta-glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase and acid phosphatase were higher in microaggregates (<0.25 mm) as compared to macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm). Elevated ozone had no effects on mineralization rates of low molecular weight C substrates in both bulk soil and isolated aggregates. We therefore conclude that the size and activity rather than function of the soil microbial community in this semi-natural grassland are altered by elevated ozone. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the available research focuses on large and high-traffic highways, while low-medium-traffic roads are often assumed to have negligible impacts. However, small roads are ubiquitous in landscapes around the world. We examined the effects of these roads, as well as habitat types, on the activity of three bat guilds (short-, mid- and long-range echolocators) and the most common bat species Pipistrellus kuhlii. We performed three bat acoustic surveys between May and October 2015, with these surveys being performed along twenty transects that were each 1000 m long and perpendicular to three roads with different traffic volumes. The surveys were performed in dense Mediterranean woodland ("montado") and open agricultural field habitats, which were the two dominant land uses. At each transect, bat activity was simultaneously registered at 0, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 m from the road with the use of an ultrasound recorder. According to the generalized linear mixed effects models, the overall activity of bats and of the short- and mid-range echolocators increased with increased distance from the roads and was dependent on the surrounding habitats. In contrast, the long-range echolocators and P. kuhlii were more tolerant to road. Our results also show that the activity was higher in woodland areas, however road verges seem to be a significant habitat in an open agricultural landscape. The major negative effects extended to approximately 300 m from the roads in woodlands and penetrate further into the open field (>500 m). The management of roadside vegetation, combined with the bat habitat improvement in areas that are further from the roads, may mitigate the negative effects. To make road-dominated landscapes safer for bats, the transport agencies need to balance the trade-offs between habitat management and road kill risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Strain by the train: Patterns of toad fatalities on a Brazilian Amazonian railroad	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Railway; Road ecology; Road-kill; Amphibian; Carcass persistence; Wildlife mortality	AMPHIBIAN ROAD MORTALITY; CANE TOADS; BUFO-BUFO; HOT-SPOTS; IMPACT; CARCASS; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; WILDLIFE; COMMON	Transportation infrastructures are directly responsible for killing billions of animals worldwide. Although the understanding about road impacts have recently increased, the impact of railroads on wildlife has received less attention. The current knowledge concerning the impacts of railroads focuses mainly on large mammals although amphibians might be affected. Our study aims to unravel temporal and spatial patterns of Rhinella toad fatalities on a Brazilian Amazonian railroad, to comprehend how toads are killed and to estimate the magnitude of toad fatalities. Data collection was carried out on foot on an 871-km stretch of the Estrada de Ferro Carajas from 2013 to 2017. We identified different potential causes for fatalities: being run over, desiccated or with barotrauma signs. We estimated a surprisingly high carcass persistence probability of about 38 days. After correcting for the bias from carcass detection and removal, we estimated that approximately 10,000 toads are killed per year (approximate to 11 fatalities/km/year). A GLM model showed that toads were more likely to be killed in the dry to wet transition. We identified critical zones of fatalities and prioritized them according to their intensity. The highly critical segments encompass >10% of all fatalities although they cover only 1.5% of the railroad. Our study is the first one to address carcass detection and persistence on railroads and to unravel patterns of fatalities of an amphibian species in a tropical climate.

However, it remains unclear how FL and PA bacterial communities respond to cyanobacterial blooms across water depths. Here, we examined the community dynamics of the FL (0.2-3 mu m) and PA (>3 mu m) bacterioplankton based on 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing in a subtropical stratified reservoir under Microcystis aeruginosa bloom and non-bloom conditions. Both FL and PA bacterioplankton communities showed different responses in alpha- and beta-diversities to the bloom, suggesting the idea that the responses of bacterial community could depend on lifestyle. Specifically, abundant PA subcommunities showed a greater variation between bloom and non-bloom groups than abundant FL ones. In contrast, rare FL subcommunities exhibited a stronger response to water depth than rare PA ones. Furthermore, the rare taxa exhibited a preference for PA status, shaped and stimulated by the M. aeruginosa bloom. Our analyses also showed that PA bacterial communities were generally more diverse and appeared to be more responsive to routinely measured environmental variables than FL bacteria. Microcystis blooms had a facilitative influence on specific bacteria by mediating the transitions from free-living to particle-attached lifestyles. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of bacterial lifestyle and abundance in understanding the dynamics of microbial community in cyanobacterial bloom aquatic ecosystem.

Spatially explicit exposure models offer a quantitative approach for evaluating and managing the potentially toxic effects of chronic fluoride consumption on wildlife. We monitored eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) inhabiting a high-fluoride environment in the buffer zone of an aluminium smelter in southeastern Australia between 2010 and 2013. We measured fluoride levels at 19 pasture sites and determined the foraging range of 37 individual kangaroos. A series of generalised linear models were developed to estimate bone fluoride accumulation as a function of pasture exposure. Model outputs were compared to identify the most appropriate predictive tool for kangaroo bone fluoride accumulation relative to exposure. Accounting for age there was a negative association between bone fluoride concentration and distance of the central emission point from both the mean centre of foraging range and the point of death. The mean foraging range centre was the best predictor, with point of death just as suitable (and simpler), whereas more complex parameters such as monthly and cumulative fluoride exposure were poor predictors of bone fluoride concentration. The more complex dietary fluoride exposure estimates did not improve predictive capability compared with the simple, spatial models. We conclude that in actively managed wildlife populations, simple, locally validated models can provide estimates of bone fluoride accumulation sufficient to support decision-making.

The grazing value of these systems, which is closely related to soil moisture, is increasingly threatened by changes in climate variability and vegetation structure, mainly by shrub encroachment. However, it remains relatively unexplored to what extent the concurrent effect of climate change and shrub encroachment will affect the exposure to drought stress of Mediterranean wood-pastures - defined as a period where soil water availability drops below 40%. Here we combined soil moisture measurements and a process-based water balance model to assess the effect of shrubs, a shallow-and a deep-rooted, on soil moisture under current (2009-2012) and future weather (i.e. RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Soil moisture was measured and predicted in six sites, three for each type of shrub, where two adjacent plots were selected, a control and an encroached plot. During 2009-2012, encroached plots had more extended droughts (29 and 48 days longer in sites encroached with shallow-and deep-rooted shrubs, respectively) and higher usage of deep water (similar to 30%) than control plots. Under future climatic projections, our results show a consistent increase in the duration, an earlier onset of drought and higher reliance on shallow water with time, particularly under the worst climatic scenario. Encroached plots showed higher inter-annual variability than control plots, particularly in plots encroached with the deep-rooted shrub. Our results indicate that the presence of shrubs magnify the effect of climate. This suggests a likely increase in the exposure of Mediterranean wood-pastures to drought if processes of shrub encroachment persist in a context of climatic changes where earlier and more prolonged droughts will become more frequent.

Risk to the supply of ecosystem services across aquatic ecosystems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sustainability; Biodiversity; Marine; Coastal; Freshwater; Ecosystem-based management	FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; MARINE HABITATS; COASTAL; SUPPORT; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; PRESSURE; IMPACT; POLICY; COST	The capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services is decreasing. Sustaining this supply requires an understanding of the links between the impacts of pressures introduced by human activities and how this can lead to changes in the supply of services. Here, we apply a novel approach, assessing 'risk to ecosystem service supply' (RESS), across a range of aquatic ecosystems in seven case studies. We link aggregate impact risk from human activities on ecosystem components, with a relative score of their potential to supply services. The greatest RESS is found where an ecosystem component with a high potential to supply services is subject to high impact risk. In this context, we explore variability in RESS across 99 types of aquatic ecosystem component from 11 realms, ranging from oceanic to wetlands. We explore some causes of variability in the RESS observed, including assessment area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population density. We found that Lakes, Rivers, Inlets and Coastal realms had some of the highest RESS, though this was highly dependent on location. We found a positive relationship between impact risk and service supply potential, indicating the ecosystem components we rely on most for services, are also those most at risk. However, variability in this relationship indicates that protecting the supply of ecosystem services alone will not protect all parts of the ecosystem at high risk. Broad socio-economic factors explained some of the variability found in RESS. For example, RESS was positively associated with GDP and artificial and agricultural land use in most realms, highlighting the need to achieve balance between increasing GDP and sustaining ecosystem health and human well being more broadly. This approach can be used for sustainable management of ecosystem service use, to highlight the ecosystem components most critical to supplying services, and those most at risk. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Intra-specific variation (ITV) in the growth response of trees to warming and drought has been widely neglected so far, but could play a key role for adapting forests to future climate conditions. We analyzed tree rings from four conifers (Picea abies, Abies alba, Larix decidua, Pseudotsuga menziesii) regarding their intra-specific adaptation potential when trees are growing at the warm and dry margins of species distributions. Our study comprises data from four common garden experiments (45 provenances and a total of 743 trees) and assessed growth response at different temporal scales from decades (long-term) to only a few event years (short-term) and finally for density fluctuations within one year (sudden response). We observed significant variation among provenances at all time-scales, but with varying degree among species. However, variation in short-term response (drought years) was remarkably unstable across all species, when the seasonal variation of drought occurrence was considered. Silver-fir and Douglas-fir showed significant associations between seed-source climate and growth response as well as trade-offs between early- and latewood growth reaction which strongly suggests that growth responses are adaptive. Intra-specific variation in conifers in response to drought will probably be sufficient to mitigate climate change consequences on forest growth, but growth-environment interactions as well as dependencies between temporal scales could create major pitfalls for adaptive forest management in the future.

Recent studies have revealed the effectiveness of living walls in the reduction of this pollution; these systems use variable planting designs and their topographical dynamics might have an impact on PM dry deposition. This present study, employing an experimentally manipulable living wall system using box (Buxus sempervirens L.) plants, examined whether plants arranged in a design with heterogeneous topography have a differential PM removal capacity compared to plants in a design with homogenous topography. Two planting designs using 'short' and 'tall' plants, were simultaneously used on this living wall and equally exposed to traffic-based PM for 5 consecutive days. PM accumulation on leaves was estimated using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope and ImageJ image analysis software. The experiment was replicated four times changing the position of each design on the wall, and any variation in PM capture levels on leaves belonging to different designs were identified using a Generalised Linear Mixed-effect Models (GLMM). The planting design with topographical heterogeneity resulted in significantly higher PM densities (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) on leaf surfaces compared to a design with homogenous topography, indicating that topographical heterogeneity has a strong positive impact on the ability of plants to immobilise PM.

Bioaccessibility and relative oral bioavailability of cobalt and nickel in residential soil and dust affected by metal grinding operations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Human health risk assessment; Cobalt; Nickel; Alloy; Bioaccessibility; Relative bioavailability	CONTAMINATED SOILS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; LEAD; FERRIHYDRITE; ELEMENTS; HUMANS	Including measures of relative bioavailability (RBA) improves the accuracy of site-specific risk assessment when evaluating metals bound in matrices that resist acid digestion (alloys, slag, tailings). In vitro gastrointestinal bioaccessibility and in vivo RBA assessments were conducted using baghouse dust, surface dust, and soil collected in a neighborhood near a metal forge, which emitted metals in the form of corrosion resistant alloys. The study objective was to characterize the in vitro bioaccessibility and relative bioavailability (RBA) of cobalt and nickel when ingested as freely soluble forms (ionic salts used as the basis for oral toxicity criteria), compared to when incidentally ingested in the forms found in the environment. Test materials and standard reference materials-cobalt chloride and nickel sulfate-were administered daily for 14 or 21 days, twice daily, to juvenile swine. Daily intake doses for cobalt were <= 229 mu g/kg-day, and for nickel, <= 1419 mu g/kg-day. Concentrations of cobalt and nickel were measured in various tissues; 24-hour urinary excretion of each metal was also measured. Multiple linear regression modeling was performed for tissue concentration or urinary excretion vs. dose in each material, with weighting as inverse variance in each dose group. Liver, urine, and kidney provided the optimal data. Although RBA values were affected by limited absolute bioavailability of cobalt and nickel in reference materials, trends across the different biological matrices consistently showed significantly reduced bioavailability of cobalt and nickel in soil and dust, with RBAs ranging from 0.2% to 12%. Bioaccessibility of cobalt and nickel in soil and dust were 1% to 5%, and similar results were found for baghouse dust. The data demonstrate that cobalt and nickel in soil and dust affected by alloys are resistant to bioelution and absorption.

By stimulating indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), cover cropping enhances soil health and promotes agroecosystem sustainability. Still, the legacy effects of cover crops (CCs) and the major factors driving the AM fungal community are not well known; neither is the influence of the specific CC. This work describes a field experiment established in Central Spain to test the effect of replacing winter fallow by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) or vetch (Vicia sativa L.) during the intercropping of maize (Zea mays L.). We examined the community composition of the AMF in the roots and rhizosphere soil associated with the subsequent cash crop after 10 years of cover cropping, using Illumina technology. The multivariate analysis showed that the AMF communities under the barley treatment differed significantly from those under fallow, whereas no legacy effect of the vetch CC was detected. Soil organic carbon, electrical conductivity, pH, Ca and microbial biomass carbon were identified as major factors shaping soil AMF communities. Specific AMF taxa were found to play a role in plant uptake of P, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cd, which may shed light on the functionality of these taxa. In our conditions, the use of barley as a winter CC appears to be an appropriate choice with respect to promotion of AMF populations and biological activity in agricultural soils with intercropping systems. However, more research on CC species and their legacy effect on themicrobial community composition and functionality are needed to guide decisions in knowledge-based agriculture.

Changes in lateral floodplain connectivity accompanying stream channel evolution: Implications for sediment and nutrient budgets	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						HEC-RAS; Channel geometry; Overbank flow; Floodplain storage; Phosphorus	BANK EROSION; WALNUT CREEK; LAND-USE; OVERBANK SEDIMENTATION; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; GRAZED PASTURES; LARGE RIVER; PHOSPHORUS; INUNDATION; IOWA	Floodplain storage commonly represents one of the largest sediment fluxes within sediment budgets. In watersheds responding to large scale disturbance, floodplain-channel lateral connectivity may change over time with progression of channel evolution and associated changes in channel geometry. In this study we investigated the effects of channel geometry change on floodplain inundation frequency and flux of suspended sediment (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) to floodplain storage within the 52.2 km(2) Walnut Creek watershed (Iowa, USA) through a combination of 25 in-field channel cross section transects, hydraulic modeling (HEC-RAS), and stream gauging station-derived water quality and quantity data. Cross sectional area of the 25 in-field channel cross sections increased by a mean of 17% over the 16 year study period (1998-2014), and field data indicate a general trend of degradation and widening to be present along Walnut Creek's main stem. Estimated stream discharge required to generate lateral overbank flow increased 15%, and floodplain inundation volume decreased by 37% over study duration. Estimated annual fluxes of SS and TP to floodplain storage decreased by 61 and 62% over study duration, respectively. The estimated reductions in flux to floodplain storage have potential to increase watershed export of SS and TP by 9 and 18%, respectively. Increased contributions to SS and TP export may continue as channel evolution progresses and floodplain storage opportunities continue to decline. In addition to loss of storage, higher discharges confined to the channel may have greater stream power, resulting in further enhancement of SS and TP export through accelerated bed and bank erosion. These increased contributions to watershed loads may mask SS and TP reductions achieved through edge of field practices, thus making it critical that stage and progression of channel evolution be taken into consideration when addressing sediment and phosphorus loading at the watershed scale.

Stomatal conductance (g(s)) under optimal growth conditions was stimulated by enhanced N supply but was not significantly affected by enhanced O-3 exposure. Birch root, woody (stem + branches) and total biomass (root + woody) were not affected by the Phytotoxic Ozone Dose (POD1SPEC) after two seasons of O-3 exposure, and enhanced N supply stimulated biomass production independent of POD1SPEC (i.e. there were no POD1SPEC x N interactions). There was a strong linear relationship between the stem cross-sectional area and tree biomass at the end of the experiment, which was not affected by O-3 exposure or N load. Enhanced N supply stimulated the stem cross-sectional area at the end of season 2, but not at the end of season 1, which suggests a time lag before tree biomass responded to enhanced N supply. There was no significant effect of POD1SPEC on stem cross-sectional area after either the first or second growing season of the experiment. Contrasting results reported in the literature on the interactive impacts of O-3 and N load on tree physiology and growth are likely due to species-specific responses, different duration of the experiments and/or a limitation of the number of O-3 and N levels tested.

Our objectives were to identify primary instream stressors affecting algal, macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages in wadeable streams. Biotic communities were surveyed once at each site, and various instream stressors were measured during a 4-week index period preceding the ecological sampling. The measured stressors included nutrients; contaminants in water, passive samplers, and sediment; instream habitat; and flow variability. All nine boosted regression tree models - three for each of algae, invertebrates, and fish - had cross-validation R-2 (CV R-2) values of 0.41 or above, and an invertebrate model had the highest CV R-2 of 0.65. At least one contaminant metric was important in every model, and minimum daytime dissolved oxygen (DO), nutrients, and flow alteration were important explanatory variables in many of the models. Physical habitat metrics such as sediment substrate were only moderately important. Flow alteration metrics were useful factors in eight of the nine models. Total phosphorus, acetanilide herbicides and flow(time since last peak) were important in all three algal models, whereas insecticide metrics (especially those representing fipronil and imidacloprid) were dominant in the invertebrate models. DO values below approximately 7 mg/L corresponded to a strong decrease in sensitive taxa or an increase in tolerant taxa. DO also showed strong interactions with other variables, particularly contaminants and sediment, where the combined effect of low DO and elevated contaminants increased the impact on the biota more than each variable individually. Contaminants and flow alteration were strongly correlated to urbanization, indicating the importance of urbanization to ecological stream condition in the region. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Belowground biota responses to maize biochar addition to the soil of a Mediterranean vineyard	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Biochar; Mediterranean soils; Soil biota; Soil microbial biomass; Microbial biochar utilization; PLFA	PYROGENIC ORGANIC-MATTER; PHOSPHOLIPID FATTY-ACIDS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; COMPOST AMENDMENTS; CARBON ISOTOPES; YIELD RESPONSES; BIOMASS; IMPACT; BACTERIAL	Biochar is a high carbon material resulting from biomass pyrolysis that, when applied to croplands, can increase soil carbon and soil water retention. Both effects are of critical importance in semi-arid regions, where carbon decline and desertification are the main drivers of soil degradation. Since most environmental services provided by soil are mediated by below ground biota, effects of biochar on soil microbial and invertebrate communities must be evaluated under field conditions before its agricultural application can be recommended. We tested maize biochar for its mid-term effect on soil microbes and micro-arthropods of a Mediterranean vineyard. We applied biochar to three field plots with neutral sandy loam soils at a dose of 5 Mg ha(-1). During two years, we monitored the abundance of functional groups of soil micro-arthropods and estimated the biomass of soil microbial groups. We also analyzed the delta C-13 value of microbial PLFA biomarkers to determine biochar-C utilization by each microbial group taking advantage of the delta C-13 natural abundance differences between the applied biochar and the soil. Biochar addition significantly reduced soil microbial biomass but did not alter the functional microbial diversity nor the abundance or biodiversity of soil micro-arthropods. The contribution of biochar-C to the diet of most microbial groups was very low through the monitoring period. However, two gram-negative bacterial groups increased their biochar-derived carbon uptake under extreme soil dryness, which suggests that biochar-C might help soil microbes to overcome the food shortage caused by drought. The decrease in microbial biomass observed in our experiment and the concomitant decrease of SOM mineralization could contribute to the carbon sequestration potential of Mediterranean soils after biochar addition.

Upscaling ES maps is often carried out to avoid mismatches between the scale of ES assessment and that of their level of management. However, so far only a few efforts have been made to quantify how information loss occurs as data are aggregated to coarser scales. In the present study this was analyzed for three distinct case studies in the eastern Alps by comparing ES maps of outdoor recreation at the municipality level and at finer scales, i.e. high-resolution grids. Specifically, we adopt an innovative and flexible methodology based on Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA), to disentangle the problem of the scale from the perspective of different levels of jurisdiction, by assessing in an iterative process how ES patterns change when upscaling high-resolution maps. Furthermore, we assess the sensitivity to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) by calculating global statistics over three grid displacements. Our results demonstrate that spatial clusters tend to disappear when their extent becomes smaller than the features to which values are upscaled, leading to substantial information loss. Moreover, cross-comparison among grids and the municipality level highlights local anomalies that global spatial autocorrelation indicators fail to detect, revealing hidden clusters and inconsistencies among multiple scales. We conclude that, whenever ES maps are aggregated to a coarser scale, our methodology represents a suitable and flexible approach to explore clustering trends, shape and position of upscaling units, through graphs and maps showing spatial autocorrelation statistics. This can be crucial to finding the best compromise among scale mismatches, information loss and statistical bias that can directly affect the targeted ES mapping. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Furthermore, intentional object presentation has been suggested as an extremely rare form of communication evolutionarily. Research on comparable means of communication in non-human species may therefore shed light on the selection pressures that acted upon components of human communication. However, the functions and cognitive mechanisms that underlie object presentation in animals are poorly understood. Here, we addressed these issues by investigating object presentations in wild, cooperative breeding Arabian babblers (Aves: Turdoides squamiceps). Our results showed that individuals presented objects to specific recipients. The recipients most often responded by approaching the signaler and the dyad then moveed jointly to copulate at a hidden location. We provide evidence that object presentations by Arabian babblers (i) do not represent a costly signal, as objects were not costly to acquire; (ii) were not used to trade food for sex, as the presentation of food was not more likely to result in copulation; and (iii) possessed hallmarks of first-order intentionality. These results show that intentional presentation of objects is not restricted to the primate linage andmay suggest that the need to engage in cooperative interactions facilitates elaborate socio-cognitive performances.

LIMOSA; SPRING MIGRATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RICE FIELDS; POPULATION; STRATEGIES; MORTALITY; PATTERNS; NETHERLANDS; SELECTION	Few studies have been able to directly measure the seasonal survival rates of migratory species or determine how variable the timing of migration is within individuals and across populations over multiple years. As such, it remains unclear how likely migration is to affect the population dynamics of migratory species and how capable migrantsmay be of responding to changing environmental conditions within their lifetimes. To address these questions, we used three types of tracking devices to track individual black-tailed godwits from the nominate subspecies (Limosa limosa limosa) throughout their annual cycles for up to 5 consecutive years. We found that godwits exhibit considerable inter- and intra-individual variation in their migratory behavior across years. We also found that godwits had generally high survival rates during migration, although survival was reduced during northward flights across the Sahara Desert. These patterns differ from those observed in most other migratory species, suggesting that migration may only be truly dangerous when crossing geographic barriers that lack emergency stopover sites and that the levels of phenotypic flexibility exhibited by some populations may enable them to rapidly respond to changing environmental conditions.

This paper describes the diversity, ecology and role of non-scleractinian corals on scleractinian cold-water coral carbonate mounds in the Logachev Mound Province, Rockall Bank, NE Atlantic. In total ten non-scleractinian species were identified, which were mapped out along eight ROV video transects. Eight species were identified as black corals (three belonging to the family Schizopathidae, one each to the Leiopathidae, Cladopathidae, and Antipathidae and two to an unknown family) and two as gorgonians (Isididae and Plexauridae). The most abundant species were Leiopathes sp. and Parantipathes sp. 2. Areas with a high diversity of non-scleractinian corals are interpreted to offer sufficient food, weak inter-species competition and the presence of heterogeneous and hard settlement substrates. A difference in the density and occurrence of small vs. large colonies of Leiopathes sp. was also observed, which is likely related to a difference in the stability of the substrate they choose for settlement. Non-scleractinian corals, especially black corals, are an important habitat for crabs, crinoids, and shrimps in the Logachev Mound Province. The carrier crab Paromola sp. was observed carrying the plexaurid Paramuricea sp. and a black coral species belonging to the genus Parantipathes, a behavior believed to provide the crab with camouflage or potentially a defense mechanism against predators. More information on the ecophysiology of non-scleractinian corals and fine-scale local organic matter supply are needed to understand what drives differences in their spatial distribution and community structure.

However, isolating the specific traits used as mate choice criteria and the possible genetic underpinnings of both trait and preference has proven difficult, particularly in natural systems offering little experimental control over key variables. In this study, we used discrete color morphs of otherwise phenotypically identical domestic canaries (Serinus canaria) in a mate choice apparatus to test whether breeding-condition female canaries show preference for males of varying color phenotypes (yellow, white, red, or wild-type green), using spatial association as a proxy for choice. We also used synthesized vocal recordings to examine whether females in our population exhibited mate choice for song characteristics, as has been demonstrated in this species. Contrary to previous study, we found that neither white nor yellow females in our colony showed any preference for males associated with songs of differing quality, and yellow females also did not prefer supernormal red or wild-type green males over yellow males. However, yellow-but not white-females demonstrated a preference to associate with yellow males over white males. We hypothesize that preference for brightly colored mates is ancestral in domestic canaries, but that strong artificial selection for white females to reproduce successfully with white males has eliminated the preference for color (along with color itself) in the white canaries.

Insects detect odorants through receptors that are expressed in the sensory neurons of the olfactory sensilla, which cover the surface of the antennae. The olfactory capacities of an insect thus depend largely on the repertoire of the odorant receptors. Here, we study the repertoire of olfactory proteins in the stick insect Timema cristinae. We first generate transcriptomes from the antennae of adult males and females and identify, via homology searches, putative olfactory proteins of three different families: odorant binding proteins, odorant receptors, and chemosensory proteins (CSPs). We then attempt to categorize olfactory proteins likely involved in sexual communication by comparing gene expression between adults and juveniles, as well as between males and females. Notably, the olfactory proteins involved in the perception of food or abiotic environmental components, should be expressed in both adults and juveniles. By contrast, the olfactory proteins involved in sexual communication, such as the detection of sex pheromones, should be expressed in adults and often comprise different repertoires in males and females. Finally, we also tested whether olfactory proteins in general and the subset, with putative roles in sexual communication in particular, are under relaxed selection in the asexual species T. monikensis, a close relative of T. cristinae. We found that olfactory proteins are typically differentially expressed between juveniles and adults, but there is little overlap of differential expression between developmental stages and the level of sex bias in adults. Furthermore, while we find evidence that olfactory proteins are indeed under relaxed selection in the asexual species, there is no evidence that this is necessarily the case for olfactory genes with a putative role in sexual communication. Nevertheless, the list of olfactory genes generated in our study provides a useful tool for future studies on olfaction in Timema and other stick insects.

Yet, attaining and maintaining a high social status often comes with elevated energetic costs. Dominance rank-related exposure to energetic and psychosocial stressors is predicted to vary depending on the type of breeding system, the means a high rank is acquired and maintained, and the stability of the dominance hierarchy. Using behavioral data and urinary cortisol levels, we investigated whether a high dominance rank is associated with elevated energetic costs in Tai male chimpanzees and whether the relationship between male dominance rank and cortisol levels varies between stable and unstable dominance periods. Additionally, we investigated potential sources of energetic and psychosocial stress linked to competition over dominance status and mating opportunities. We found that higher-ranking males gave more aggressions than lower-ranking males in stable and unstable dominance periods, but that dominance rank and urinary cortisol levels were not associated in either period. Urinary cortisol levels were higher in all males in unstable compared to stable dominance periods, whereas aggression rates showed the reversed pattern, with higher rates in stable periods. Our results indicate that dominance maintenance is not associated with elevated physiological stress for dominant Tai male chimpanzees, and that social instability exposed all males to psychosocial stress, despite lower rates of aggressive interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that male chimpanzees adjust competitive behavior to context dependent conditions, possibly by means of predictability of outcomes of social interactions, and use conflict management strategies, such as avoidance of aggression potentially diminishing the risk of escalation.

The DOM concentration and properties along the water flow path through forest ecosystems depend on its sampling location and transformation processes. To improve our understanding of the effects of forest management, especially tree species selection and management intensity, on DOM concentrations and properties of samples from different ecosystem fluxes, we studied throughfall, stemflow, litter leachate and mineral soil solution at 26 forest sites in the three regions of the German Biodiversity Exploratories. We covered forest stands with three management categories (coniferous, deciduous age class and unmanaged beech forests). In water samples from these forests, we monitored DOC concentrations over 4 years and characterized the quality of DOM with UV-vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Additionally, we performed incubation-based biodegradation assays. Multivariate statistics revealed strong significant effects of ecosystem fluxes and smaller effects of main tree species on DOM quality. Coniferous forests differed from deciduous forests by showing larger DOC concentrations, more lignin- and protein-like molecules, and fewer tannin-like molecules in throughfall, stemflow, and litter leachate. Cluster analysis of FT-ICR-MS data indicated that DOM compositions, which varied in aboveground samples depending on tree species, become aligned in mineral soil. This alignment of DOM composition along the water flow path in mineral soil is likely caused by microbial production and consumption of DOM in combination with its interaction with the solid phase, producing a characteristic pattern of organic compounds in forest mineral soils. We found similarly pronounced effects of ecosystem fluxes on the biodegradability of DOM, but surprisingly no differences between deciduous and coniferous forests. Forest management intensity, mainly determined by biomass extraction, contribution of species, which are not site-adapted, and deadwood mass, did not influence DOC concentrations, DOM composition and properties significantly.

However, to arrive and establish in new aquatic ecosystems, this snail must survive to the overland translocation through aerial exposure and must tolerate the new physical and chemical conditions of the recipient ecosystem. In this study, we simulated different conditions for the NZMS invasion by combining two air exposure treatments (0 and 20 h) with different physical and chemical conditions of the rehydration water (low and normal water temperatures and normal and high water conductivities). Mortality, behavior and neonate production were compared across treatments. Air exposure caused a high percentage of mortality but survivors tolerated the subsequent abiotic conditions. Low temperatures and high conductivities altered the behavior of adult snails, increasing significantly their reaction time (i.e. time to start normal movement). This may have negative consequences for the survival of this species under natural conditions. Finally, these conditions did not affect significantly the production of neonates. These results supported that the surviving NZMS to a brief period of air exposure possess the ability to acclimate to contrasting abiotic conditions with a potential establishment of new populations and that survivors can reproduce in different abiotic conditions after an air exposure period.

The dark side of facilitation: native shrubs facilitate exotic annuals more strongly than native annuals	NEOBIOTA			English	Article; Data Paper						Bromus rubens; deserts; exotic species; facilitation; invasional meltdown; native species; plant invasions; shrubs	ALPINE CUSHION PLANTS; INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS; POSITIVE INTERACTIONS; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; NURSE-PLANTS; DESERT; COMPETITION; RESTORATION; COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS	Positive interactions enhance biodiversity and ecosystem function, but can also exacerbate biological invasions. Facilitation of exotic invaders by exotic foundation species (invasional meltdown) has been studied extensively, but facilitation of exotic invaders by native foundation species has attracted less attention. Specifically, very few studies have examined the extent that native foundation species facilitate native and exotic competitors. Understanding the processes that mediate interactions between native and exotic species can help explain, predict, and improve management of biological invasions. Here, we examined the effects of native foundation shrubs on the relative abundance of the annual plant community - including native and exotic taxa - from 2015-2018 in a desert ecosystem at Carrizo Plain National Monument, California, USA (elevation: 723 m). Shrub effects varied by year and by the identity of annual species, but shrubs consistently enhanced the abundance of the annual plant community and facilitated both native (n=17 species) and exotic (n=4 species) taxa. However, at the provenance level, exotic annuals were facilitated 2.75 times stronger in abundance than native annuals, and exotic annuals were always more abundant than natives both near and away from shrubs. Our study reaffirms facilitation as an important process in the organisation of plant communities and confirms that both native and exotic species can form positive associations with native foundation species. However, facilitation by native foundation species can exacerbate biological invasions by increasing the local abundance of exotic invaders. Thus, the force of facilitation can have a dark side relevant to ecosystem function and management.

Multiple regression analysis to assess the spatial distribution and speciation of mercury in surface sediments of a contaminated lagoon	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Chlor-alkali industry; Mercury species; Coastal lagoon; Sediments; Multiple regression model	COASTAL LAGOON; METAL POLLUTION; METHYL MERCURY; AVEIRO LAGOON; WATER COLUMN; LAVACA BAY; RIA; ESTUARY; SYSTEM; RIVER	The concentrations of inorganic mercury (IHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in surface sediments from the contaminated Aveiro Lagoon (Portugal) were determined by species-specific isotope dilution analysis. Different behaviour of IHg and MeHg was observed based upon multiple regression analysis, including geochemical characteristics of the surface sediments (fine fraction, concentrations of organic matter and metals) and non-Euclidean distances between sampling points. This data treatment method was valid over the entire concentration range of IHg and MeHg, allowing robust quantitative evaluation with respect to extrapolation. For IHg, there was statistical separation of the dispersion away from the contamination source and of Al concentration in the sediments. The MeHg concentrations followed those of IHg at high concentrations. The geochemical variables, such as concentrations of Ca (marine influence proxy), Mn and organic matter, were necessary to describe the behaviour of MeHg across the whole concentration range. The models for MeHg demonstrated that, close to the mouth of the lagoon, net production of MeHg was higher. In future, multiple regression analysis could be applied to separate and to evaluate quantitatively the effects of geochemistry and dispersion away from the contamination source in sediments contaminated with other substances.

In our study, individual movement strategies of red-necked phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus), a long-distance migratory wader which uses saline waters in the non-breeding period, were studied using light-level geolocators. Results revealed a migratory divide between two populations with distinct migration routes and wintering areas: one breeding in the north-eastern North Atlantic and migrating ca. 10,000 km oversea to the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, and the other breeding in Fennoscandia and Russia migrating ca. 6,000 km-largely over land-to the Arabian Sea (Indian Ocean). In line with our expectations, the transoceanic migration between the North Atlantic and the Pacific was associated with proportionately longer wings, a more even spread of stopovers in autumn and a higher migration speed in spring compared to the migration between Fennoscandian-Russian breeding grounds and the Arabian Sea. In the wintering period, birds wintering in the Pacific were stationary in roughly a single area, whereas individuals wintering in the Arabian Sea moved extensively between different areas, reflecting differences in spatio-temporal variation in primary productivity between the two wintering areas. Our study is unique in showing how habitat distribution shapes movement strategies over the entire non-breeding period within a species.	[van Bemmelen, Rob S.

However, assessing the starvation status of copepods in situ using conventional methods is difficult because of spatial and temporal changes in food availability. Here, we analyzed gene expression to identify the molecular markers associated with starvation in the copepod Calanus sinicus from the western North Pacific Ocean. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared between starved and satiated copepods using high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Sixteen DEGs were identified. Nine of these DEGs were assigned to known functional genes associated with energy metabolism, egg production, and somatic growth, and therefore were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) as candidate markers for starvation. To evaluate the reliability of these candidate markers as indicators for starvation, copepods were given different food concentrations and fasted for various periods. Gene expression was highly sensitive to temporal and quantitative changes in food conditions. During starvation, the expression of NADH-dehydrogenase (related to energy metabolism) was upregulated and that of vitellogenin 2 (related to egg production) was downregulated compared to their expression in satiated copepods. As might be expected from such changes in expression, complete fasting significantly decreased egg production. Changes in NADH-dehydrogenase and vitellogenin 2 expression were therefore correlated with the degree of copepod starvation or food limitation. This information may help to assess potential reproductivity and predict egg production rates in copepods in their natural environment.

Seagrass meadows are net autotrophic ecosystems, but respiration increases faster than primary production with temperature. This may lead to a shift from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic system at the highest temperatures. Although tropical seagrasses are adapted to high temperatures, the metabolic rates of Red Sea seagrasses have not yet been reported. Here we assessed the community metabolism of 2 seagrass ecosystems, an Enhalus acoroides monospecific meadow and a Cymodocea serrulata and Halodule uninervis mixed meadow, located in the central Red Sea. We measured in situ net community production (NCP), community respiration (R), gross primary production (GPP), activation energy and community production- irradiance curves along their natural temperature gradient over 1 yr by measuring diel fluctuations in dissolved oxygen. The results were species-specific; while the monospecific meadow was autotrophic throughout the year (annual weighted average NCP: 64.63 +/- 11.89 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), GPP: R ratio: 1.42 +/- 0.06), the mixed meadow was heterotrophic during the summer months (annual weighted average NCP: -4.15 +/- 9.39 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), GPP: R: 1.04 +/- 0.05). In both seagrass meadows, R and GPP increased with increasing temperature, but differences in activation energies indicated that the mixed meadow is more sensitive to increasing seawater temperatures. These findings suggest contrasting responses in tropical seagrass species to rising temperature, pointing out the potential vulnerability of seagrasses to ocean warming in the Red Sea.

Through the analysis of both in situ photo graphs and trawl catch data from annual multispecies bottom-trawl surveys, we examined community composition, species density, and abundance of epibenthos and fish associated with V. pourtalesi compared to locations without this sponge. Using generalized linear models and analysis of similarities, the importance of V. pourtalesi in enhancing species density and abundance of the associated epibenthic community was assessed against that of the hard substrate on which it settles. Our results indicated that the megafaunal assemblage associated with V. pourtalesi was significantly different in composition and higher in species density and abundance compared to locations without V. pourtalesi. Analysis of similarity of trawl catch data indicated that fish communities associated with the sponge grounds are significantly different from those without V. pourtalesi, although no species were found exclusively on the sponge grounds. Our study provides further evidence of the role played by sponge grounds in shaping community structure and biodiversity of associated deep-sea epibenthic and fish communities. The mechanism for biodiversity enhancement within the sponge grounds formed by V. pourtalesi is likely the combined effect of both the sponge itself and its attachment substrate, which together comprise the habitat of the sponge grounds. We also discuss the role of habitat provision between the mixed-species tetractinellid sponges of the Flemish Cap and the monospecific glass sponge grounds of Emerald Basin.

Predation strategies of larval clownfish capturing evasive copepod prey	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Amphiprion ocellaris; Bestiolina similis; Escape behavior; Feeding behavior; Ichthyoplankton; Larval fish; Prey capture performance; Plankton predator-prey interactions; Match-mismatch theory	ESCAPE BEHAVIOR; FEEDING PERFORMANCE; CALANOID COPEPODS; STRIKE KINEMATICS; FORCE PRODUCTION; LIFE-HISTORY; FISH; ZOOPLANKTON; SUCTION; NAUPLII	Fish larvae depend on finding and capturing enough prey for rapid growth during the planktonic phase. The diet of many fish larvae is dominated by copepods, small crustaceans that are highly sensitive to hydrodynamic disturbances and possess strong escape responses. We examined how fish larvae with immature jaws, musculature and fins capture such evasive prey. The kinematics of feeding attempts by larval clownfish Amphiprion ocellaris on 3 developmental stages of copepod Bestiolina similis were investigated using high-speed videography. A stealthy approach brought the fish larva within similar to 1 mm of the copepod; shortest distances were observed in early larvae (1 to 5 d post-hatch [dph]) attacking immature copepods. Peak speeds during strikes increased with fish age and copepod developmental stage (150 to 250 mm s(-1)), with time to capture < 8 ms on average. Most successful captures (70%) were of copepods that failed to initiate an escape response during the strike. If a copepod initiated an escape, capture success decreased to similar to 50% for nauplii and copepodites and 25% for adults. Adult copepods were more likely to attempt an escape response than copepodites or nauplii. Prey stage and the interaction between strike distance and speed were the parameters that best fit a logistic regression model to the observed captures and escapes. The successful switch to larger and more evasive copepod prey by A. ocellaris larvae did not occur until 7 dph and coincided with ontogenetic changes (post-flexion) and a predatory strategy that included shorter approach phases and greater strike speeds.

Additionally, cyclical climate oscillations, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), influence species presences throughout the Atlantic Basin. We evaluate the potential effects of local habitat variability on the nearshore presence of 7 commercial fish species along the South Atlantic Bight. Employing random forest models, we assess the relationships between historical observed presence and bottom temperature (BT), salinity, benthic habitat structure, and the NAO. Our results suggest that for some species, the influence of BT on species nearshore presence depends on the phase of the NAO. Thus, the statistical responses of some species to changing ocean temperatures will largely depend on the phase of the NAO.

Foraging ecology of a winter breeder, the Fiordland penguin	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Foraging behaviour; Winter breeding; Bio-logging; Prey encounter; Eudyptes pachyrhynchus; New Zealand	ROCKHOPPER PENGUINS; NEW-ZEALAND; SOUTH ISLAND; EUDYPTES-CHRYSOLOPHUS; DIVING BEHAVIOR; MACARONI; PREY; HABITAT; TOOL; SEGREGATION	Breeding in most species is timed to coincide with the greatest availability of food resources to support the increased energetic needs of reproduction. Correspondingly, the majority (76%) of seabird species in temperate and polar regions breed in spring/summer, matching the peak in ocean productivity. The Fiordland penguin Eudyptes pachyrhynchus is one of only 34 seabird species worldwide that have part of their breeding cycle during the winter, and its chicks fledge when the eggs of congeneric Eudyptes species in the same region are only starting to hatch. Little is known of the foraging ecology of this species and the factors that may influence its timing of breeding. In the present study, the foraging behaviour of breeding individuals from Taumaka/Open Bay Island, New Zealand, was investigated using GPS, dive recorder and tri-axis accelerometer data loggers. In total, 35 individuals (4 males, 31 females) were tracked at sea, revealing extensive use of continental shelf slope (200-1000 m) habitat within 42 +/- 5 km of the colony. Individuals foraged mostly during daylight in the epi-pelagic zone (mean modal depth 22 +/- 2 m) and prey encounter events occurred in 50% of dives. Blood isotopic signatures suggest a trophic level indicative of squid consumption, supporting previous findings that winter-spawning squid are the most important prey type. The results of the present study suggest that a winter-breeding strategy by seabirds can reflect locally abundant prey resources and suitable conditions at the time for breeding.

Seasonal and Temporal Drivers Influencing Phytoplankton Community in Kuwait Marine Waters: Documenting a Changing Landscape in the Gulf	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						sewage; phytoplankton; nutrients; Kuwait; eutrophication; assessments	CARBON-TO-CHLOROPHYLL; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; SEWAGE CONTAMINATION; NITRATE UPTAKE; ARABIAN GULF; CORAL-REEFS; GROWTH-RATE; ENVIRONMENT; RATIO; AMMONIUM	This assessment of environmental drivers and phytoplankton community in Kuwait (Arabian Gulf) describes changes in environmental conditions linked to the rapid urbanization over recent decades. To describe these changes, we have analyzed a long-term water quality dataset (1984-2017) and explored potential changes in a sub-set of phytoplankton community data by analyzing 10 years of phytoplankton data available (2007-2016) for Kuwait Bay and the Northern Gulf waters. The longer-term water quality data show that dissolved nutrient concentrations, with the exception of a recent fall in SiO4, have been increasing over 30 years, but with a high degree of variability reflecting the changing rate of inputs from river outflows and point sewage sources. The correlative analysis between the environmental parameters and phytoplankton in the period from 2007 to 2016 shows that the seasonal variability of the phytoplankton are influenced by several co-stressors including higher temperatures, coastal sewage runoff and changing salinity. While the extended nutrient enrichment has changed the trophic state of Kuwait waters, the seasonal and temporal correlations highlight that recent changes in phytoplankton community seem to be responding to cumulative pressures of eutrophication, climate, and salinity changes. The seasonal and temporal changes in the coastal phytoplankton community, responding to co-stressors, present challenges for managers to consider the simultaneous management of local, regional and external pressures. Continued declines in water quality within a system that is influenced by a warming climate can potentially have long-term consequences on the resilience of the Northern Gulf environment.

Therefore, potential size-related feeding patterns remain poorly documented. Using stomach content data (N = 88) and stable isotope values of white muscle tissue (N = 40), this study evaluates the diet of sharks ranging in size from 81 to 474 cm (total length). The importance of prey categories ("Fish," "Mammal," "Squid," "Crustacean," and "Other") was evaluated based on the reconstructed prey biomass of the stomach contents. Stable isotope values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 ranged between -14.4 to -19.9 parts per thousand. and 11.8 to 17.2 parts per thousand, respectively. The importance of each prey category was estimated by the Index of Relative Importance (IRI). Our findings suggest that the smallest Greenland sharks (<200 cm) feed on lower trophic level prey, predominantly squids. Larger sharks (>200 cm) mainly feed on higher trophic level prey such as seals, epibenthic and benthic fishes including gadoids (Gadidae), skates (Rajidae), righteye flounders (Pleuronectidae), lumpfish (Cyclopteridae), wolffish (Anarhichadidae), and redfish (Sebastidae). Redfish were, however, only found to be important in the largest sharks sampled ( >400 cm). In addition to demonstrating ontogenetic shifts in their feeding preferences, this study supports that Greenland sharks are capable of active predation on fast swimming seals and large fishes.

Impact of Ammonia During Composting on Calonectria pseudonaviculata and C. henricotiae, Causal Agents of Boxwood Blight	COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION			English	Article						Calonectria; Compost; boxwood blight; microsclerotia	1ST REPORT; CYLINDROCLADIUM-BUXICOLA; BUXUS-SEMPERVIRENS; MICROSCLEROTIA; SPP.	Boxwood (Buxus spp.) blight is a devastating disease caused by the Ascomycete fungus Calonectria pseudonaviculata in the U.S. and Europe. A second Calonectria species, C. henricotiae, is also pathogenic on boxwood in Europe, but is not present in the U.S. where it is classified as a quarantine pathogen. Composting can eradicate various plant pathogens and high temperature is likely the most important factor influencing pathogen eradication. We previously reported that C. pseudonaviculata microsclerotia survived exposure to 40 degrees C in an incubator without compost, whereas exposure to the same temperature and time, but with compost added, greatly decreased survival. That is, the decrease in Calonectria growth and survival in compost was greater than could be accounted for by high temperature alone. We hypothesized that the enhanced decrease in Calonectria growth and survival might be due to ammonia, a fungitoxic gas produced during composting. In this laboratory study, we determined that ammonia within agar in Petri plates reduced radial growth of both C. pseudonaviculata and C. henricotiae. In studies with C. pseudonaviculata, gaseous ammonia reduced microsclerotia survival. Our findings suggest that composting dead or dying blighted boxwoods in the presence of ammonia could reduce dissemination of both Calonectria species from blighted to healthy boxwoods.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Arabian babblers; Turdoides squamiceps; joint attention; cooperative breeding; human cognition; intentional communication	SOCIAL COGNITION; CHIMPANZEES; LANGUAGE; APES	Human cooperation strongly relies on the ability of interlocutors to coordinate each other's attentional state: joint attention. One predominant hypothesis postulates that this hallmark of the unique cognitive system of humans evolved due to the combination of an ape-like cognitive system and the prosocial motives that facilitate cooperative breeding. Here, we tested this hypothesis by investigating communicative interactions of a cooperatively breeding bird species, the Arabian babbler (Turdoides squamiceps). The behaviour of 12 wild social groups was observed focusing on two distinct communicative behaviours: OBJECT PRESENTATION and BABBLER WALK. The results showed that both behaviours fulfilled the criteria for first-order intentional communication and involved co-orientation of recipients' attention. In turn, recipients responded with cooperative and communicative acts that resulted in coordinated joint travel between interlocutors. These findings provide the first evidence that another animal species shows several key criteria traditionally used to infer joint attention in prelinguistic human infants. Furthermore, they emphasize the influence of cooperative breeding on sophisticated socio-cognitive performances, while questioning the necessity of an ape-like cognitive system underlying joint attentional behaviour.

This uniqueness is mainly a result of endemic species that have evolved in situ in the absence of mammal herbivores. However, island endemism is under severe threat by introduced herbivores. We test the assumption that endemic species are particularly vulnerable to generalist introduced herbivores (European rabbit) using an unprecedented dataset covering an entire island with enormous topographic, climatic and biological diversity (Tenerife, Canary Islands). With increasing endemism, plant species are more heavily browsed by rabbits than non-endemic species with up to 67% of endemics being negatively impacted by browsing, indicating a dramatic lack of adaptation to mammal herbivory in endemics. Ecosystems with high per cent endemism are most heavily browsed, suggesting ecosystem-specific vulnerability to introduced herbivores, even within islands. Protection of global biodiversity caused by disproportionally high endemism on oceanic islands via ecosystem-specific herbivore control and eradication measures is of utmost importance.

However, we still have limited understanding of how landscape complexity shapes pollinator communities in both crop and non-crop habitat, and whether pollinator responses to landscape complexity vary with their association with mass-flowering crops. Here, we surveyed pollinator communities on mass-flowering leek crops and in nearby semi-natural habitat in landscapes of varying complexity. Surveys were done before and during crop bloom and distinguished between pollinators that visit the crop frequently (dominant), occasionally (opportunistic), or not at all (non-crop). Forty-seven per cent of the species in the wider landscape were also observed on leek flowers. Crop pollinator richness increased with local pollinator community size and increasing landscape complexity, but relationships were stronger for opportunistic than for dominant crop pollinators. Relationships between pollinator richness in semi-natural habitats and landscape complexity differed between groups with the most pronounced positive effects on non-crop pollinators. Our results indicate that while dominant crop pollinators are core components of crop pollinator communities in all agricultural landscapes, opportunistic crop pollinators largely determine species-richness responses and complex landscapes are local hotspots for both biodiversity conservation and potential ecosystem service provision.

In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, males that have won previous contests are more likely to win in subsequent conflicts and losers are more likely to lose (winner-loser effects), but the direct fitness consequences and genetic underpinnings of this plasticity are poorly understood. Here, we tested how male genotype and the outcomes of previous male-male conflicts influence male pre- and post-copulatory success. We quantified pre-copulatory success in a choice and no-choice context, and post-copulatory success by quantifying ejaculate offensive and defensive ability. We found that winners have higher reproductive success compared to losers in both pre-copulatory scenarios. However, losers consistently mated for a longer duration, boosted female fecundity and had an increased paternity share when they were the first males to mate, suggesting increased investment into post-copulatory mechanisms. Finally, by using clonal hybrids from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we documented that genetic variation explained a sizeable proportion of the observed differences between lines, and of the interaction between line and winner and loser effects. Our results place the behavioural data on winner-loser effects in an evolutionary context by documenting the potential fitness gain to males from altering their reproductive strategy based on fighting experience. Our data may also explain the presence and maintenance of trade-offs between different male reproductive strategies.	[Filice, David C.

In particular, human cultural aspects may differ substantially between the extensively studied urban settings of temperate regions and the poorly studied cities of the tropics, which may offer profoundly different niches for urban wildlife. Here, we report how the population levels of a scavenging raptor which breeds in the megacity of Delhi, the black kite Milvus migrans, depend on spatial variation in human subsidies, mainly in the form of philanthropic offerings of meat given for religious purposes. This tight connection with human culture, which generated the largest raptor concentration in the world, was modulated further by breeding-site availability. The latter constrained the level of resource-tracking by the kites and their potential ecosystem service, and could be used as a density-management tool. Similar ties between animal population densities, key anthropogenic resources and human beliefs may occur in thousands of cities all over the globe and may fit poorly with our current understanding of urban ecosystem functioning. For many urban animals, key resources are inextricably linked with human culture, an aspect that has been largely overlooked.

Human-induced reductions in fish predator boldness decrease their predation rates in kelp forests	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						predation; consumer function; anti-predator behaviour; protected areas; kelp forest; finfish	TROPHIC CASCADES; PROTECTED AREAS; TRAITS; RISK; CONSEQUENCES; CONTINUUM; DEPLETION; BEHAVIOR; SIZE	Humans have restructured food webs and ecosystems by depleting biomass, reducing size structure and altering traits of consumers. However, few studies have examined the ecological impacts of human-induced trait changes across large spatial and temporal scales and species assemblages. We compared behavioural traits and predation rates by predatory fishes on standard squid prey in protected areas of different protection levels and ages, and found that predation rates were 6.5 times greater at old, no-take (greater than 40 years) relative to new, predominantly partial-take areas (approx. 8 years), even accounting for differences in predatory fish abundance, body size and composition across sites. Individual fishes in old protected areas consumed prey at nearly twice the rate of fishes of the same species and size at new protected areas. Predatory fish exhibited on average 50% longer flight initiation distance and lower willingness to forage at new protected areas, which partially explains lower foraging rates at new relative to old protected areas. Our experiments demonstrate that humans can effect changes in functionally important behavioural traits of predator guilds at large (30 km) spatial scales within managed areas, which require protection for multiple generations of predators to recover bold phenotypes and predation rates, even as abundance rebounds.

Glucocorticoid hormone concentrations often change in response to fluctuating environmental conditions and mediate changes in immune function, resource allocation and tissue repair. Thus, changes in glucocorticoid hormone concentrations might mediate individual variation in investment in resistance versus tolerance. In this study, we experimentally increased glucocorticoid concentrations in red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) that were naturally infected with haemosporidian parasites, and assessed changes in resistance and tolerance of infection. Glucocorticoid treatment increased burdens of Plasmodium, the parasite causing avian malaria, but only in the absence of co-infection with another Haemosporidian, Haemoproteus. Thus, glucocorticoids might reduce resistance to infection, but co-infection can mitigate the negative consequences of increased hormone concentrations. Glucocorticoid treatment also decreased tolerance of infection. We found no evidence that the inflammatory immune response or rate of red blood cell production underlie the effects of glucocorticoids on resistance and tolerance. Our findings suggest that exogenous glucocorticoids can increase the costs of haemosporidian infections by both increasing parasite numbers and reducing an individual's ability to cope with infection. These effects could scale up to impact populations of both host and parasite.

Identifying the evolutionary origins of parenting is fundamental to understanding the relationships between sexual selection, social evolution and parental care systems of contemporary Anura. Moreover, parenting has been hypothesized to allow the invasion of terrestrial habitats by the ancestors of terrestrial vertebrates. Using comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of frogs and toads based on data from over 1000 species that represent 46 out of 55 Anura families, we test whether parental care is associated with terrestrial reproduction and several life-history traits. Here, we show that both the duration of care and offspring protection by males and females have coevolved with terrestrial reproduction. Sexual size dimorphism is also related to care, because the large male size relative to female size is associated with increased paternal care. Furthermore, increased egg size and reduced clutch volume are associated with increased care in bivariate but not in multivariate analyses, suggesting that the relationships between care, egg size and clutch volume are mediated by terrestrial reproduction. Taken together, our results suggest that parenting by males and females has coevolved, and complex parenting traits have evolved several times independently in Anura in response to breeding in terrestrial environments.

Stochastic processes drive rapid genomic divergence during experimental range expansions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						range expansion; rapid evolution; gene surfing; genetic drift; pool-seq	GENETIC DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; SPREAD; DISPERSAL; INVASIONS; MUTATIONS; DEPENDS; LOAD	Range expansions are crucibles for rapid evolution, acting via both selective and neutral mechanisms. While selection on traits such as dispersal and fecundity may increase expansion speed, neutral mechanisms arising from repeated bottlenecks and genetic drift in edge populations (i.e. gene surfing) could slow spread or make it less predictable. Thus, it is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from neutral mechanisms to robustly predict expansion dynamics. This is difficult to do with expansions in nature, as replicated expansions are required to distinguish selective and neutral processes in the genome. Using replicated microcosms of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), we identify a robust signature of stochastic, neutral mechanisms in genomic changes arising over only eight generations of expansion and assess the role of standing variation and de novo mutations in driving these changes. Average genetic diversity was reduced within edge populations, but with substantial among-replicate variability in the changes at specific genomic windows. Such variability in genomic changes is consistent with a large role for stochastic, neutral processes. This increased genomic divergence among populations was mirrored by heightened variation in population size and expansion speed, suggesting that stochastic variation in the genome could increase unpredictability of range expansions.

Nocturnal flight-calling behaviour predicts vulnerability to artificial light in migratory birds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						nocturnal migration; flight calls; artificial light at night; building collisions; collective migration	UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; EVOLUTION; TRACKING; WARBLERS; NIGHT; AGE	Understanding interactions between biota and the built environment is increasingly important as human modification of the landscape expands in extent and intensity. For migratory birds, collisions with lighted structures are a major cause of mortality, but the mechanisms behind these collisions are poorly understood. Using 40 years of collision records of passerine birds, we investigated the importance of species' behavioural ecologies in predicting rates of building collisions during nocturnal migration through Chicago, IL and Cleveland, OH, USA. We found that the use of nocturnal flight calls is an important predictor of collision risk in nocturnally migrating passerine birds. Species that produce flight calls during nocturnal migration tended to collide with buildings more than expected given their local abundance, whereas those that do not use such communication collided much less frequently. Our results suggest that a stronger attraction response to artificial light at night in species that produce flight calls may mediate these differences in collision rates. Nocturnal flight calls probably evolved to facilitate collective decision-making during navigation, but this same social behaviour may now exacerbate vulnerability to a widespread anthropogenic disturbance. Our results also suggest that social behaviour during migration may reflect poorly understood differences in navigational mechanisms across lineages of birds.

Individual and Population Level Variation in the Reproductive Potential of Deep-Sea Corals From Different Regions Within the Gulf of Maine	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Primnoa resedaeformis; Paramuricea placomus; reproductive ecology; age at maturation; image analysis; size distribution; remotely operated vehicle (ROV); video	GREAT BARRIER-REEF; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; SOFT CORAL; PRIMNOA-RESEDAEFORMIS; WATER CORALS; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; GORGONIAN CORALS; COLONY SIZE; EGG SIZE; GROWTH	Deep-sea corals are of conservation concern in the North Atlantic due to prolonged disturbances associated with the exploitation of natural resources and a changing environment. As a result, two research cruises in the Gulf of Maine region during 2014 and 2017 collected samples of two locally dominant coral species, Primnoa resedaeformis and Paramuricea placomus, at six locations to investigate reproductive ecology. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) were used to collect specimens that were examined via paraffin histology, and coincident video surveys were used to determine size class distributions. Both species were identified as gonochoristic, and sampled locations exhibited dissimilarities in spermatocyst development and oocyte size except for those in close geographic proximity. Fecundities exhibited substantial ranges across sample locations and average oocyte sizes (+/- SD) were 140 +/- 117 mu m for P. resedaeformis and 64 +/- 46 mu m for P. placomus. In addition, colony size distributions were also significantly different across sampling locations. Notably, the Outer Schoodic Ridge sample location, with larger colony and oocyte sizes, was identified as a potential key source population of reproductive material in the Gulf of Maine. These data were used to calculate differences in reproductive potential based on relationships between colony morphology and reproductive output using height as a predictive proxy. Furthermore, calculated age at first reproduction, 7.6-19.8 years for P. resedaeformis and 20.7-37 years for P. placomus, which may be dependent on sex of the colony, provides a metric for estimating the amount of time these coral habitats will take to recover. This investigation, in response to historical population impacts and environmental change, links reproductive and morphometric relationships to inform population scale reproductive models, while also establishing an understanding of regional scale gametogenic variability within the Gulf of Maine region.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between healthcare access and utilization, and post-disaster mental health symptoms. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted with 750 disaster-affected individuals in six districts in central Nepal 15 months post-earthquake. Anxiety and depression were measured through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Healthcare utilization questions examined types of healthcare in the communities, utilization, and approachability of care providers. Univariate analyses, ANOVAs and Tobit regression were used. Results: Depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly higher for females and individuals between 40-50 years old. Those who utilized a district hospital had the lowest anxiety and depression scores. Participants who indicated medical shops were the most important source of health-related information had more anxiety and depression than those who used other services. Higher quality of healthcare was significantly associated with fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Mental health symptoms can last long after a disaster occurs. Access to quality mental health care in the primary health care settings is critical to help individuals and communities recover immediately and during the long-term recovery.

Key information necessary is how different forest user groups perceive and prioritize different ecosystem services based on their local setting. We assessed the socio-cultural values of ecosystem services of high-altitude oak forests in Western Bhutan using participatory approaches with two important forest users: local communities and forest experts. We found that these forests serve as a pool of 22 ecosystem services under four MEA categories of provisioning (9), regulating (8), supporting (2), and cultural (3) services. Fresh water was unanimously identified as the most valuable service, as well as the most vulnerable, by both the groups. The priorities of local communities inclined towards provisioning and cultural services due to their dependence on these services for their livelihood and wellbeing. Forest experts' priorities were more evenly spread over three categories of services: provisioning, regulating, and supporting services, reflecting their broader interest in resource management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation. Several regulating and supporting services were not easily identified by many villagers, suggesting that bridging the priorities of local interests with broader national forestry goals may require public partnerships and integrated decision-making about the entire suite of ecosystem services. Several management interventions proposed by the groups were presented for consideration by local users, scientists, and policy makers. For all ongoing and future ecosystem service assessments, we recommend the integration of socio-cultural values with biophysical and monetary assessments to fully value the benefits from the high-altitude oak forests.

A pot trial for pakchoi (Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis L.) was conducted under greenhouse conditions with: (1) control; (2) chemical fertilizer; and (3) organic fertilizer. The responses of the plant, soil properties, and rhizobacterial community were measured after 45 days of cultivation. Fertilization increased soil nutrient levels and pakchoi productivity and the reshaped rhizobacterial community structure, while no differences in rhizobacterial abundance and total diversity were observed. Generally, most plant antioxidants were negatively correlated with inorganic nitrogen (N) and positively correlated to organic N in soil. The genera of Arthrospira and Acutodesmus contained differential rhizobacteria under chemical fertilizer treatment, which are known as copiotrophs. In addition, the addition of a chemical fertilizer may stimulate organic substance turnover by the enrichment of organic compound degraders (e.g., Microbacterium and Chitinophaga) and the promotion of predicted functional pathways involved in energy metabolism. Several beneficial rhizobacteria were associated with organic fertilizer amended rhizosphere including the genera Bacillus, Mycobacterium, Actinomycetospora, and Frankia. Furthermore, Bacillus spp. were positively correlated with plant biomass and phenolic acid. Moreover, predictive functional profiles of the rhizobacterial community involved in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism were significantly increased under organic fertilization, which were positively correlated with plant antioxidant activity. Overall, our study suggests that the short-term application of chemical and organic fertilizers reshapes the rhizobacterial community structure, and such changes might contribute to the plant's performance.

We investigated interspecific variation in migratory behavior over three decades at a Central-European site, testing whether the type and extent of behavioral change are predicted by species' responsiveness to short-term variation in large-scale climatic indices. We found that species with earlier arrivals at the breeding grounds after winters with higher North-Atlantic Oscillation indices were more likely to overwinter at the study site. This behavior was more frequent in the second half than in the first half of the study, although the extent of this change was not predicted quantitatively by short-term climatic responsiveness. Overwintering was more prevalent in short-distance migrants with more complex diets and larger population sizes. Furthermore, species arriving earlier after summers with higher Sahel rainfall indices increasingly advanced their first arrival date, whereas species that do not molt in the pre-breeding season increased their frequency of overwintering in more recent years. Our results demonstrate that interspecific variation in short-term climatic responsiveness predicts long-term changes in migratory behaviors, supporting that the latter are responses to climate change. Furthermore, the type of response (advancing arrivals or overwintering near the breeding grounds) depends on life history. Finally, we found that overwintering behavior during the study period predicted subsequent trends in population size, suggesting that information on temporal changes in migratory strategy may help conservation planning and risk assessment.

The Shenandoah River Watershed (U.SA.) was selected to conduct on-site exposure experiments to assess endocrine disrupting characteristics of different source waters. This investigation integrates WWTP wastewater reuse modeling, hydrological and chemical characterization, and in vivo endocrine disruption bioassessment to assess contaminant sources, exposure pathways, and biological effects. The percentage of accumulated WWTP effluent in each river reach (ACCWW%) was used to predict environmental concentrations for consumer product chemicals (boron), pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine), and steroidal estrogens (estrone, 17-beta-estradiol, estriol, and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol). Fish endocrine disruption was evaluated using vitellogenin induction in adult male or larval fathead minnows. Water samples were analyzed for >500 inorganic and organic constituents to characterize the complex contaminant mixtures. Municipal ACCWW% at drinking water treatment plant surface water intakes ranged from <0.01 to 2.0% under mean-annual streamflow and up to 4.5% under mean August streamflow. Measured and predicted environmental concentrations resulted in 17-beta-estradiol equivalency quotients ranging from 0.002 to 5.0 ng L-1 indicating low-to-moderate risk of fish endocrine disruption. Results from the fish exposure experiments showed low (0.5- to 3.2-fold) vitellogenin induction in adult males.

We used a combination of molecular tools to examine the potential physiological impacts of HOC exposure in two bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) ecotypes in the SCB. We quantified 25 HOCs in the blubber of 22 biopsies collected from males between 2012 and 2016. We then analyzed genome-wide gene expression in skin using RNA-sequencing and measured blubber testosterone to compare HOC exposure with cellular and endocrine biomarkers. We found high levels of HOCs in both ecotypes with significantly higher total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol (TCPMOH), and chlordane-related compounds in the coastal ecotype versus the offshore ecotype. We found evidence of PBDE bioaccumulation in both ecotypes, however, the pattern of bioaccumulation or endocrine disruption for other HOCs was different between the ecotypes, suggesting potential endocrine disruption in the coastal ecotype. We also observed correlations between HOCs and gene coexpression networks enriched for xenobiotic metabolism, hormone metabolism, and immune response that could indicate cellular effects from HOC exposure. By integrating measurements of HOC load with both transcriptome profiling and endocrine biomarkers, our approach provides insight into HOC exposure and potential impacts on wild cetacean health in southern California.

Genome-Wide Stress Responses to Copper and Arsenic in a Field Population of Daphnia	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION; MAGNA POPULATION; TOLERANCE; EXPOSURE; CADMIUM; INDIVIDUALS; TEMPERATURE; ADAPTATION; FRAMEWORK; EVOLUTION	Over the past decade, significant advances have been made to unravel molecular mechanisms of stress response in different ecotoxicological model species. Within this study, we focus on population level transcriptomic responses of a natural population of Daphnia magna Straus, (1820), to heavy metals. We aim to characterize the population level transcriptomic responses, which include standing genetic variation, and improve our understanding on how populations respond to environmental stress at a molecular level. We studied population level responses to two heavy metals, copper and arsenic, and their binary mixture across time. Transcriptomic patterns identified significantly regulated gene families and genes at the population level including cuticle proteins and resilins. Furthermore, some of these differentially regulated gene families, such as cuticle proteins, were also significantly enriched for genetic variations including SNPs and MNPs. In general, genetic variation was observed in specific gene families, many of which are known to be involved in stress response. Overall, our results indicate that molecular stress responses can be identified within natural populations and that linking molecular mechanisms with genetic variation at the population level could contribute significantly to adverse outcome frameworks.

Dynamic linear models were used to study long-term trends and seasonality of dissolved inorganic nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a) in rivers and coastal waters. For the period 1997-2013, the reduction in dissolved riverine inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations led to the decrease in their Chl a levels. However, while dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations decreased only slightly in the Vilaine, they increased in the Loire, specifically in summer. Simultaneously, phytoplankton in the VB underwent profound changes with increase in biomass and change in the timing of the annual peak from spring to summer. The increase in phytoplankton biomass in the VB, manifested particularly by increased summer diatom abundances, was due to enhanced summer DIN loads from the Loire, sustained by internal regeneration of DIP and dissolved silicate (DSi) from sediments. The long-term trajectories of this case study evidence that significant reduction of P inputs without simultaneous N abatement was not yet sufficient to control eutrophication all along the Loire-Vilaine-VB continuum. Upstream rivers reveal indices of recoveries following the significant diminution of P, while eutrophication continues to increase downstream, especially when N is the limiting factor. More N input reduction, paying particular attention to diffuse N sources, is required to control eutrophication in receiving VB coastal waters. Internal benthic DIP and DSi recycling appears to have contributed to the worsening of summer VB water quality, augmenting the effects of anthropogenic DIN inputs. For this coastal ecosystem, nutrient management strategies should consider the role played by internal nutrient loads to tackle eutrophication processes.

Taxonomic resolution refinement does not improve understanding of invertebrate's role on leaf litter breakdown	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Filtering-collectors; Fungus sporulation; Gathering-collectors; Hyphomycetes; Predators; Shredders	PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER; FUNCTIONAL FEEDING GROUPS; MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; TROPICAL STREAMS; LAND-USE; DECOMPOSITION; COLONIZATION; DYNAMICS; DIVERSITY; DETRITUS	The invertebrate biodiversity of subtropical streams depends on the seasonal input of organic matter, as much as the leaf decomposition process on stream system. However, one of the challenges in determining the importance of invertebrates for leaf breakdown in subtropical streams is the low taxonomic resolution applied in most studies. To overcome this limitation, here we used litter bags with senescent leaves to evaluate the impact of different taxonomic resolutions of trophic group classification to assess the seasonal importance of invertebrate community for leaf litter breakdown in a subtropical stream (Atlantic Forest in western of Parana state, Brazil). Litterfall was quarterly measured over a year. The leaf litter accumulated in an interval of 30 days was retrieved, weighed, and used for the leaf breakdown experiments (by litter bags). We found a lower importance of invertebrate community richness and density (shredders and scrapers) in leaf breakdown process irrespective of the taxonomic resolution (family or genus level used). Hyphomycetes biomass and fungi spondation also did not present changes among sample times, and consecutively, importance for leaf breakdown. However, the richness and density of Chironomidae taxa respond differently depending on the taxonomic resolution used. Low litter breakdown may be explained by the increase of consumption of microorganisms, due to high density of Chironomidae scrapers evaluated at the genus level. Moreover, temperature is the main factor responsible for breakdown over the year, in a positive way. Therefore, our results indicated the family level as the taxonomic resolution sufficient to assess the role of shredders and scrapers in the leaf litter breakdown process of this subtropical stream system.

Key factors affecting the diversity of Sphagnum cover inhabitants with the focus on ground beetle assemblages in Central-Eastern European peat bogs	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Belarus; Carabidae; diversity; environmental factors; Sphagnum dwellers	SUCCESSION	A key structural component in peat bog formation is Sphagnum spp., which determines very specific associated environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to characterise some of the key factors affecting the diversity, species richness and abundance of sphagnum inhabiting ground beetles and to examine the maintenance of stable populations of cold adapted specialised peat bog species. A total of 52 carabid species were recorded by pitfall traps along six main habitats, such as the lagg zone, pine bog, hollows, hummock open bog and dome. The results are characterised by a low diversity, which vary significantly among habitat types, and include a high abundance of a few carabid species. Among the variables influencing carabid species richness and abundance were plant cover, pH and the conductivity of the Sphagnum mat water. Vascular plant cover was a key factor shaping carabid beetle assemblages in the slope and the dome, while electric conductivity affected carabid beetle assemblage in the lagg. Whereas, the water level was the most important factor for the hollows. At the same time, peat bog specialists showed low sensitivity to the gradient of the analysed variables. Most of the specialised species are protected boreal beetles in the temperate zone of Europe, and therefore Belarusian peat bogs are a significant repository of cold adapted specialised bog species and potentially represent a significant refugia for these species in the context of global warming.

However, studies of seabird-reptile interactions arc limited. Here, we assessed the influence of the 'Critically Endangered' Whenua Hou Diving Petrel (Pelecanoides whenuahouensis) on the occurrence of two threatened skinks, Stewart Island green skink (Oligosoma of chloronoton) and southern grass skink (O. aff polychtvma). We surveyed skinks for 26 consecutive days at 51 sites with and 48 sites without Diving Petrel burrows in the dunes on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou), New Zealand. We used occupancy modelling to assess the influence of burrows on the occurrence of skinks, while accounting for other factors affecting occupancy (Psi) and detection probabilities (p). Diving Petrel burrows had a contrasting effect on the occurrence of skinks. On average, (Psi) over cap of Stewart Island green skinks was 114% higher at sites with burrows compared to sites without, while (Psi) over cap of southern grass skinks was only 2% higher. Occurrence of both skinks was negatively influenced by the presence of the other skink species. On average ( p) over cap were low: 0.013 and 0.038 for Stewart Island green and southern grass skinks, respectively. Stewart Island green skinks appear attracted to burrows, which might facilitate thermoregulation (i.e., shelter from temperature extremes). The larger Stewart Island green skinks may subsequently exclude the smaller southern grass skinks at burrows, causing the contrasting relationships. We suggest that these interspecific interactions should be considered when implementing conservation management, e.g., through the order of species reintroductions.	[Fischer, J. H.; McCauley, C.

Abundance and size of birds determine the position of the species in plant-frugivore interaction networks in fragmented forests	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Fragmentation; Frugivory; Tropical forests	SEED-DISPERSAL; EXTINCTION; CENTRALITY; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS	The relationships between frugivorous animals and plants are of vital importance particularly in tropical forests. The way species interact and how they are organized within interaction networks could be determined by their ecological and morphological characteristics. This study evaluates the hypothesis that the topological position of species within an interaction network is determined by their degree of frugivory, body size, and abundance. Thus, we constructed the frugivory network between birds and plants in a rainforest fragment in northwestern Colombia. The position of the species within the network was calculated based on three centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and closeness), and its association with relative abundance, degree of frugivory, and body size of each bird species was evaluated by means of a generalized linear model. We found that the species that were most abundant and had the smallest body size had central positions in the interaction network. This pattern is contrary to what has been observed in pristine forests, where species with large body size are more important for network stability. Our results suggest that forest fragmentation modifies the roles of species within the network structure, in part, due to changes in the makeup of the original frugivore community. The information presented may be useful to evaluate the effects of the loss of species as a result of anthropic actions, with the aim of generating ecosystem restoration strategies.

However, these hypotheses were mostly developed with insects and fish, and they have not been tested on many invertebrate lineages. Pleuroceridae gastropods are of particular ecological importance to rivers of eastern North America, sometimes comprising over 90% of macroinvertebrate biomass. Yet, virtually nothing is known of pleurocerid landscape genetics, including whether genetic diversity follows predictions made by hypotheses developed on more mobile species. Moreover, the commonly repeated hypothesis that intraspecific morphological variation in gastropods results from ecophenotypic plasticity has not been well tested on pleurocerids. Using 2bRAD- seq to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms, we show that the threatened, Cahaba River endemic pleurocerid, Leptoxis ampla, has limited gene flow among populations and that migration is downstream- biased, conflicting with previous hypotheses. Both tributary and main stem populations harbour unique genomic profiles, and genetic diversity was highest in downstream populations. Furthermore, L. ampla shell morphology was more correlated with genetic differences among individuals and populations than habitat characteristics. We anticipate similar genetic and demographic patterns to be seen in other pleurocerids, and hypotheses about gene flow and population demographics that were based on more mobile taxa often, but not always, apply to freshwater gastropods. From a conservation standpoint, genetic structure of L. ampla populations suggests distinctive genetic diversity is lost with localized extirpation, a phenomenon common across the range of Pleuroceridae.

Directly quantifying dispersal of marine fishes is challenging but important, particularly for the design of marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we studied kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) sampled along similar to 25 km of coastline in a boundary current-dominated ecosystem and used genetic parentage analysis to identify dispersal events and characterize them, because the distance between sedentary parents and their settled offspring is the lifetime dispersal distance. Large sample sizes and intensive sampling are critical for increasing the likelihood of detecting parent-offspring matches in such systems and we sampled more than 6,000 kelp rockfish and analysed them with a powerful set of 96 microhaplotype markers. We identified eight parent-offspring pairs with high confidence, including two juvenile fish that were born inside MPAs and dispersed to areas outside MPAs, and four fish born in MPAs that dispersed to nearby MPAs. Additionally, we identified 25 full-sibling pairs, which occurred throughout the sampling area and included all possible combinations of inferred dispersal trajectories. Intriguingly, these included two pairs of young-of-the-year siblings with one member each sampled in consecutive years. These sibling pairs suggest monogamy, either intentional or accidental, which has not been previously demonstrated in rockfishes. This study provides the first direct observation of larval dispersal events in a current-dominated ecosystem and direct evidence that larvae produced within MPAs are exported both to neighbouring MPAs and to proximate areas where harvest is allowed.

Red-br easted (Sphyrapicus ruber) and red-naped (S. nuchalis) sapsuckers meet and hybridi ze along a narrow contact zone that stretches from northern California to southern British Columbia. We found strong evidence for changes in the structure of thi s hybrid zone across time, with significant temporal shifts in allele frequencies and in the proportions of parental phenotypes across the landscape. In addition to these shifts, we found that differences in plumage predict genetic differences (R-2 = 0.80), suggesting that plumage is a useful proxy for assessing ancestry. We also found a significant bimodal distribution of hybrids across the contact zone, suggesting that premating barriers may be driving reproductive isolation, perhaps as a result of assortative mating based on plumage differences. However, despite evidence of selecti on and strong patterns of population structure between parental samples, we found only weak patterns of genetic divergence. Using museum specimens and genomic data, this study of sapsuckers provides insight into the ways in which phenotypic and genetic structure have changed over a 40-year period, as well as insight into the mechanisms that may contribute to the maintenance of the hybrid zone over time.

Gene flow, divergent selection and resistance to introgression in two species of morning glories (Ipomoea)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						divergent selection; gene flow; introgression; Ipomoea; morning glory; speciation	REVEALS CANDIDATE GENES; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; GENOMIC ISLANDS; DIFFERENTIAL INTROGRESSION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; BACKGROUND SELECTION; ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE; MATING SYSTEM; HYBRID ZONE; SPECIATION	Gene flow is thought to impede genetic divergence and speciation by homogenizing genomes. Recent theory and research suggest that sufficiently strong divergent selection can overpower gene flow, leading to loci that are highly differentiated compared to others. However, there are also alternative explanations for this pattern. Independent evidence that loci in highly differentiated regions are under divergent selection would allow these explanations to be distinguished, but such evidence is scarce. Here, we present multiple lines of evidence that many of the highly divergent SNPs in a pair of sister morning glory species, Ipomoea cordatotriloba and I. lacunosa, are the result of divergent selection in the face of gene flow. We analysed a SNP data set across the genome to assess the amount of gene flow, resistance to introgression and patterns of selection on loci resistant to introgression. We show that differentiation between the two species is much lower in sympatry than in allopatry, consistent with interspecific gene flow in sympatry. Gene flow appears to be substantially greater from I. lacunosa to I. cordatotriloba than in the reverse direction, resulting in sympatric and allopatric I. cordatotriloba being substantially more different than sympatric and allopatric I. lacunosa. Many SNPs highly differentiated in allopatry have experienced divergent selection, and, despite gene flow in sympatry, resist homogenization in sympatry. Finally, five out of eight floral and inflorescence characteristics measured exhibit asymmetric convergence in sympatry. Consistent with the pattern of gene flow, I. cordatotriloba traits become much more like those of I. lacunosa than the reverse. Our investigation reveals the complex interplay between selection and gene flow that can occur during the early stages of speciation.

Contrasting evolutionary histories in Neotropical birds: Divergence across an environmental barrier in South America	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						biological attributes; genomics; idiosyncrasy; Neotropical forests; phenotypic divergence; speciation	ATLANTIC FOREST; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; COLOR PATTERNS; GENE FLOW; DIVERSIFICATION; MITOCHONDRIAL; SPECIATION; INFERENCE; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BIOGEOGRAPHY	Avian diversity in the Neotropics has been traditionally attributed to the effect of vicariant forces promoting speciation in allopatry. Recent studies have shown that phylogeographical patterns shared among codistributed species cannot be explained by a single vicariant event, as species responses to a common barrier depend on the biological attributes of each taxon. The open vegetation corridor (OVC) isolates Amazonia and the Andean forests from the Atlantic Forest, creating a notorious pattern of avian taxa that are disjunctly codistributed in these forests. Here, we studied and compared the evolutionary histories of Ramphotrigon megacephalum and Pipraeidea melanonota, two passerines with allopatric populations east and west of the OVC that represent different subspecies. These species differ in their biological attributes: R. megacephalum is a sedentary, forest specialist mostly confined to bamboo understorey, whereas P. melanonota is a seasonal migrant and generalist species that ranges in a variety of closed and semi-open environments. We performed genetic and genomic analyses, complemented with the study of coloration and behavioural differentiation, to assess population divergence across the OVC. We found that the evolutionary histories of both R. megacephalum and P. melanonota have been shaped by this environmental barrier. However, these species responded in different and asynchronous manners to the establishment of the OVC and to past connections between the currently isolated South American forests, which can be mostly explained by their distinct ecologies and dispersal abilities. Our results support the fact that the biological attributes of species can make their evolutionary histories idiosyncratic.

Hitherto, the diversification of marine organisms in oceanic islands, especially those with low vagility, has received little direct empirical analysis using molecular markers. Here, we focus on such a case study, through applying a multilocus molecular approach to investigate the diversity and evolution of a group that lacks a planktonic larval stage, the isopod genus Dynamene, in Macaronesia and Northeast Atlantic. Sequences of two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S rRNA) and two nuclear (18S rRNA and 28S rRNA) loci were obtained from specimens of Dynamene edwardsi (Lucas, 1849), Dynamene magnitorata Holdich, 1968 and Dynamene bidentata (Adams, 1800) collected along the Northeast Atlantic and Macaronesia. Although no major phylogeographic structure was detected in D. bidentata and D. magnitorata, from five to nine deeply divergent lineages were evident within D. edwardsi. The divergent lineages displayed genetic distances comparable to those found among established species of peracarids. D. edwardsi exhibits a long, rich and complex phylogeographic history in Macaronesia, where the geodynamics of the islands possibly associated with founder effects and subsequent lack of gene flow among populations confounds patterns based on geographic proximity of targeted populations. Our findings collectively suggest a much larger role of oceanic islands in the diversification of marine invertebrates than previously anticipated. The work provides insights into the origins and dynamics of ongoing geographic segregation and associated deep divergence among sister evolutionary lineages in Macaronesia.

In the crucifer Boechera stricta, we tested the effects of rhizosphere microbes and plant population on herbivore resistance, the primary metabolome, and select secondary metabolites. Plant populations differed significantly in the concentrations of six glucosinolates (GLS), secondary metabolites known to provide herbivore resistance in the Brassicaceae. The population with lower GLS levels experienced similar to 60% higher levels of aphid (Myzus persicae) attack; no association was observed between GLS and damage by a second herbivore, flea beetles (Phyllotreta cruciferae). Rhizosphere microbiome (disrupted vs. intact native microbiome) had no effect on plant GLS concentrations. However, aphid number and flea beetle damage were respectively about three-and seven-fold higher among plants grown in the disrupted versus intact native microbiome treatment. These differences may be attributable to shifts in primary metabolic pathways previously implicated in host defence against herbivores, including increases in pentose and glucoronate interconversion among plants grown with an intact microbiome. Furthermore, native microbiomes with distinct community composition (as estimated from 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing) differed two-fold in their effect on host plant susceptibility to aphids. The findings suggest that rhizosphere microbes, including distinct native microbiomes, can play a greater role than population in defence against insect herbivores, and act through metabolic mechanisms independent of population.

Insular avifaunas are typically characterized by a low prevalence and diversity of haemosporidians, although the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes remain unclear. We investigated the parasite transmission network in an insular system formed by Eleonora's falcons (the avian host), louse flies that parasitize the falcons (the potential vector), and haemosporidians (the parasites). We found a great diversity of parasites in louse flies (16 Haemoproteus and 6 Plasmodium lineages) that did not match with lineages previously found infecting adult falcons (only one shared lineage). Because Eleonora's falcon feeds on migratory passerines hunted over the ocean, we sampled falcon kills in search of the origin of parasites found in louse flies. Surprisingly, louse flies shared 10 of the 18 different parasite lineages infecting falcon kills. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all lineages found in louse flies (including five new lineages) corresponded to Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites infecting Passeriformes. We found molecular evidence of louse flies feeding on passerines hunted by falcons. The lack of infection in nestlings and the mismatch between the lineages isolated in adult falcons and louse flies suggest that despite louse flies' contact with a diverse array of parasites, no successful transmission to Eleonora's falcon occurs. This could be due to the falcons' resistance to infection, the inability of parasites to develop in these phylogenetically distant species, or the inability of haemosporidian lineages to complete their development in louse flies.

Correlation and causation between the microbiome, Wolbachia and host functional traits in natural populations of drosophilid flies	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Drosophila; microbiome; mycophagous drosophilids; transcriptome	GUT MICROBIOTA; SPIROPLASMA; IMMUNE; HOMEOSTASIS; SEX; ENDOSYMBIONTS; REPRODUCTION; COEXISTENCE; DIVERSITY; FITNESS	Resident microorganisms are known to influence the fitness and traits of animals under controlled laboratory conditions, but the relevance of these findings to wild animals is uncertain. This study investigated the host functional correlates of microbiota composition in a wild community of three sympatric species of mycophagous drosophilid flies, Drosophila falleni, Drosophila neotestacea and Drosophila putrida. Specifically, we quantified bacterial communities and host transcriptomes by parallel 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and RNA-Seq of individual flies. Among-fly variation in microbiota composition did not partition strongly by sex or species, and included multiple modules, that is, sets of bacterial taxa whose abundance varied in concert across different flies. The abundance of bacteria in several modules varied significantly with multiple host transcripts, especially in females, but the identity of the correlated host transcriptional functions differed with host species, including epithelial barrier function in D. falleni, muscle function in D. putrida, and insect growth and development in D. neotestacea. In D. neotestacea, which harbours the endosymbionts Wolbachia and Spiroplasma, Wolbachia promotes the abundance of Spiroplasma, and is positively correlated with abundance of Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales. Furthermore, most correlations between host gene expression and relative abundance of bacterial modules were co-correlated with abundance of Wolbachia (but not Spiroplasma), indicative of an interdependence between host functional traits, microbiota composition and Wolbachia abundance in this species. These data suggest that, in these natural populations of drosophilid flies, different host species interact with microbial communities in functionally different ways that can vary with the abundance of endosymbionts.

This study presents 38 years of observations on their nesting success from coastal Maine. We document long-term declines in nest-box occupancy and fledging success. We show that nest-box occupancy was affected by proximity to other nest boxes and to buildings, and that it increased with time since mowing. The number of young fledged per nest, on the other hand, decreased in wet years and years with many cold days, and it increased with time since mowing. These local factors do not, however, explain the long-term decline in nesting success, which we tentatively attribute to anthropogenic effects on the wintering grounds or along the migration route.

Falcipennis canadensis (Spruce Grouse) inhabit conifer-dominated forests distributed throughout the northern US and Canada, and reach their southeastern range extent in the northeastern US, including Maine. We resurveyed 18 forest stands on Mount Desert Island, ME, that were comprised of Picea mariana (Black Spruce) and Larix laricina (Tamarack) and which were originally surveyed during 1992-1993. Our goal was to observe changes in Spruce Grouse occupancy and abundance between the 1990s and the present (2017). We conducted repeated callback surveys to detect territorial male Spruce Grouse within each stand during spring 2017, using a systematic survey design that covered the entirety of each stand and replicated methods used during the 1990s. We documented 7 individual Spruce Grouse, including 6 males and a single female. Single-season occupancy models for 2017 predicted Spruce Grouse stand occupancy of 0.226 (+/- 0.100 SE), with a survey-level detection probability for male Spruce Grouse of 0.857 (+/- 0.141 SE). Stand occupancy decreased from 8 stands in 1992-1993 to 4 in 2017, a 50% decline in the proportion of stands occupied. Further, the total number of males observed decreased from 32 (average between 1992 and 1993) to only 6 during our study, a >80% decline in apparent abundance. Our results suggest Spruce Grouse populations on Mount Desert Island have decreased and may be at risk of local extinction.

Wild Canid Distribution and Co-existence in a Natural-Urban Matrix of the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							FOXES UROCYON-CINEREOARGENTEUS; GRAY FOXES; RED FOXES; SPACE USE; COYOTES; LANDSCAPE; ECOLOGY; URBANIZATION; DYNAMICS; CONSERVATION	Although development and urbanization are typically believed to have negative impacts on carnivoran species, some species can successfully navigate an urban matrix. Sympatric carnivorans compete for limited resources in urban areas, likely with system-specific impacts to their distributions and activity patterns. We used automatically triggered wildlife cameras to assess the local distribution and co-existence of Canis latrans (Coyote), Vulpes vulpes (Red Fox), and Urocyon cinereoargenteus (Gray Fox) across the Pioneer Valley, MA, in relation to different levels of human development. We placed cameras at 79 locations in forested, altered, and urban land-use areas from September to November 2012 and accumulated 1670 trap nights. We determined site characteristics and detection rates for 12 other wildlife species for each camera location to develop a generalized linear model for the local distribution of each focal canid species across the study area. We also compared diel activity patterns among Coyotes, Red Foxes, and Gray Foxes, and calculated coefficients of overlap between each pair. The local distribution of Coyotes was positively associated with the detection rates of their prey and not associated with detection rates of sympatric carnivoran species. Red Foxes and Gray Foxes had negative relationships with the detection rate of Coyotes, and none of the 3 canid species showed a positive correlation with increased levels of urbanization. There was a high degree of temporal overlap in diel activity patterns and limited spatial overlap of our focal species, which suggests that any competition avoidance across our study area occurred at the spatial level. Coyotes fill the role of top predator in the Pioneer Valley, and likely have a negative impact on the local distributions of smaller canids, while their own local distributions seem to be driven by prey availability.

Fish were captured using gillnets during the spawn in late October and early November in 10-15 m of water. Spawning began when waters reached 17 degrees C, but activity was most intense between 11 degrees C and 13 degrees C. Spawning fish were 4-24 y old, and catches were typically comprised of 89.5% males. Male Lake Trout generally reached 457 mm (18 in; legal harvest size) by age 5. and since 2010, average growth of mature males was 5.8 mm per year. Length-at-capture and density have declined over the period of record but rose and fell over shorter intervals, likely in response to forage abundance, mainly Osmerus mordax (Rainbow Smelt).

The handful of pine barrens remaining in the Northeast provide valuable habitat to many threatened and endangered plant and animal (including insect) species, yet little is known about the bee fauna in this habitat. Here we present the results of the first faunal bee survey of the Ossipee Pine Barrens (OPB) in New Hampshire. We collected over 800 specimens from pan and sweep samples representing 95 species. We documented 1 species, Megachile mucida, for the first time in the state of New Hampshire and recorded 4 introduced species. In addition to general surveying, we surveyed landscapes with 4 different types of management for the OPB. Landscapes that incorporated both burning and mowing after burning into the management regime supported bee communites that had significantly greater abundance than all other treatments and greater species richness than all other landscapes, though not signficantly higher than those that were mowed without burning.

Surveys for Population Persistence and Bd at the Northeastern Range Edge of the Eastern Lesser Siren	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							FUNGUS BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS; SALAMANDERS SIREN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMPHIUMA-MEANS; MILITARY; CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS; BIODIVERSITY; AMPHIBIANS	Sirens are enigmatic, fully aquatic salamanders found in freshwater wetland habitats. Siren intermedia intermedia (Eastern Lesser Siren) occurs along the East Coast of the United States from Alabama to Virginia. Surveys near the northeastern range edge of the subspecies at Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia from 1995 to 1999 documented 53 Eastern Lesser Sirens in 5 wetlands. In 2015, 13 individuals were found, documenting persistence at 4 of these wetlands; none were found in 4 additional wetlands with habitat that appeared appropriate. The size distribution of captured individuals was similar for the 2 survey periods. Captured individuals in 2015 were screened for Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen ubiquitous in aquatic habitats of the southeast and mid-Atlantic. No Bd was detected on these individuals, despite the presence of Bd on other amphibians at Fort A.P. Hill. Further investigations of the Eastern Lesser Siren populations in this area would provide important information about the persistence of this species in the region and provide more insight into the biology of this elusive salamander.

Physicochemical Controls on Spatiotemporal Distribution and Benthic Mat Severity of Didymosphenia geminata in Pine Creek, an Unregulated Watershed in Northern Pennsylvania	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							DIATOM DIDYMOSPHENIA; COMMUNITIES; TRENDS; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT; SEDIMENT; QUEBEC; GROWTH; LOADS; LAKE	Didymosphenia geminata (Didymo) is a benthic freshwater diatom that has been globally expanding its range and extracellular stalk production in freshwater ecosystems. Didymo has been observed in reaches downstream of hypolimnetic reservoir releases in the northeastern US since 2007. This study focused on a newly observed (2013) Didymo occurrence in Pine Creek, a highly forested and unregulated watershed in north-central Pennsylvania. Study objectives included comparing contemporary distribution with historical data to provide insight on historical occurrence, quantifying physicochemical controls on Didymo distribution and benthic mat severity, and examining historical changes in water chemistry that might affect habitat suitability. At present, Didymo cellular distribution is limited to upper reaches of Pine Creek where median soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) is 2.7 mu g/L; median SRP was 4.8 mu g/L at sites where Didymo was absent. At the epicenter of distribution in Pine Creek where SRP was consistently <2 mu g/L, increased streamflow flashiness and water temperature were associated with decreased benthic mat severity. My results suggest SRP thresholds for Didymo proliferation may vary depending on whether streams are regulated by reservoirs with hypolimnetic releases. Mann-Kendall trends tests of a similar to 20-y water chemistry dataset show that orthophosphate and sulfate concentrations decreased while pH increased within Pine Creek, which may have implications for Didymo habitat suitability. Further research is warranted to determine whether improving water quality following the industrial era may facilitate Didymo colonization.

Because tree recruitment and mortality events are generally infrequent, long-time scales are needed to confirm trends in forests. We performed a 50-yr demographic census of a forest plot located on the southern edge of the Canadian boreal forest, a region currently experiencing forest die-back in response to direct and indirect effects of recent severe droughts. Here, we show that over the last 30 yr biomass, basal area, growth, and recruitment have decreased along with a precipitous rise in mortality across the dominant tree species. The stand experienced periods of drought in combination with multiple outbreaks of forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) and bark beetles. These insect disturbances interacted to increase mortality rates within the stand and decrease stand density. The interaction of endogenous and exogenous factors may shift forests in this region onto novel successional trajectories with the possibility of changes in regional vegetation type.

Creating a window of opportunity for establishing ecosystem engineers by adding substratum: a case study on mussels	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						aggregation; density dependent; dislodgement; disturbance; flume; Mytilus edulis; positive feedback; stable state	MYTILUS-EDULIS; ALTERNATIVE STATES; STABLE STATES; BLUE MUSSELS; WADDEN SEA; ATTACHMENT; BEDS; FEEDBACKS; DYNAMICS; IMPACT	Ecosystem engineers typically exert positive feedback on their environment, which enhances their performance. Such positive feedback is lacking in the establishment phase, when densities are too low and/or patches are too small. There is a strong need to unravel the mechanisms for overcoming the resulting establishment thresholds, both for ecological restoration purposes and to be able to use their services. In the present study, we question whether providing a transient substratum can be used as tool to overcome establishment thresholds, by creating a window of opportunity for initial settlement, using mussels (Mytilus edulis) as a model system. Combining field and flume experiments, we study how biogenic substratum enrichment in the form of a shell layer on a soft mudflat affects the critical dislodgement thresholds and, thus, the chances of mussel establishment at different mussel densities and aggregation states. Flume results showed that the presence of a shell layer reduced dislodgement of mussel patches in low-energy environments but was conditional for establishment in high-energy environments. That is, in high-energy environments with shells, aggregation into dumps enhanced dislodgement, while dislodgement was reduced with increasing overall mussel biomass and overall mussel patch weight. Without shells, dislodgement was always 100%. These findings agreed with our field studies, which showed that coarse shell material reduced mussel losses (by a factor of 3), reduced aggregation (by a factor of 2.4), and increased attachment strength (by a factor of 2.4). Overall, our results show that the local presence of biogenic substratum increases the chance of mussel establishment by enhancing the critical hydrodynamic dislodgement threshold. Thus, the local addition of a biogenic substratum may create a window of opportunity to initiate settlement in more dynamic environments, to shift at a local scale from a bare mudflat state into an established biogenic reef state. Our findings have clear implications for how to approach restoration and management of ecosystem engineers dominated systems. For instance, when positive feedback of ecosystem engineers is lacking, (1) the transient offering of suitable settling substratum may be a necessary step to overcome establishment thresholds, and (2) this becomes increasingly important with increasing abiotic stress.

Restoration is particularly difficult when human activities have pushed an area into a new state with self-reinforcing feedbacks. This study investigated a long-term restoration project in a dryland ecosystem of the Tengger Desert in northwestern China, initiated in 1956. We analyzed shrub and grass cover for 49 yr after the installation of restoration infrastructure that altered external conditions (i.e., using packed straw to reduce wind erosion) and system state (by planting shrubs). After 37-40 yr, the re-vegetation project was successful in restoring the system to a state similar to native vegetation, with high grass cover (30-50%), low shrub cover (8-10%), and a thick biological soil crust (biocrust). However, the shift to high grass cover did not begin until year 37, before which shrub cover was high (15-20%) and grasses were subdominant (usually <10%). The shift from shrub to grass dominance was abrupt, registering significant nonlinear changes over time and relative to a key driver of vegetation dynamics, estimated biocrust thickness. Biocrust thickness increased gradually over time, which reduced rainfall infiltration into deep soil and thus increased soil moisture available for the shallow-rooted grasses. The shift from the bare soil state to the steppe state exhibited a long time lag, suggesting that it can take decades to determine whether dryland restoration efforts succeed. The results indicate that persistence might be critical to forcing desired state transitions and that dryland restoration can proceed as a series of time lags, punctuated by abrupt changes in ecosystem state.

Yet managers often lack clear guidance on how to conserve or restore riparian vegetation structure and composition to promote wildlife biodiversity, due to the difficulty of balancing the needs of multiple species and taxonomic groups. We used independent multi-species occupancy models to assess the response of riparian bird and bumble bee assemblages, respectively, to variation in vegetation structure and composition in montane riparian corridors. We sought to identify vegetation characteristics associated with relatively high richness across each taxonomic group to define target conditions for habitat restoration. Riparian bird occupancy increased with more willow (Salix spp.) cover and less overstory cover, while bumble bee occupancy increased with greater flowering plant richness, more forb cover, and less shrub cover. Relatively distinct habitat preferences of bumble bees and riparian birds emphasize the value of managing for habitat heterogeneity to promote biodiversity across multiple taxonomic groups. Multi-species modeling distills the responses of numerous species down to a single estimate of a covariate effect for an assemblage of species and can provide land managers with empirically derived targets for habitat restoration that will benefit many species.

Here, we track changes through time in the oral dentition of Oreochromis hunteri, the endemic and only indigenous fish species inhabiting the East African crater Lake Chala (Kenya/ Tanzania), in relation to climate-driven lake-level fluctuations during the last 25,000 yr. Fossil teeth were recovered from six periods representing alternating high and low lake-level stands associated with late-Pleistocene and Holocene trends in rainfall and drought To construct a reference framework for morphological variation in fossil assemblages, we first analyzed the variability in oral tooth morphology within the modern-day fish population. These analyses established that, like other cichlids, O. hunteri gradually replace their bicuspid/tricuspid oral dentition with more unicuspid teeth as they grow. In the fossil assemblages, we found systematic and recurrent changes in the relative abundance of these oral tooth types, with a higher proportion of unicuspids during low-stands. Moreover, O. hunteri living during low-stands systematically developed unicuspid dentition at a smaller body size, compared with conspecifics living during high-stands. Considering that low-stand conditions created a sizable area of oxygenated soft-bottom habitat that is lacking during high-stands, we propose that the associated change in oral dentition reflects the fishes' exploitation of this new habitat either for feeding or for reproduction. The recurrent nature of the observed shifts provides evidence for the ability of O. hunteri to systematically adapt to local habitat change, and strongly suggests that morphological change in oral dentition promoted its long-term population persistence in an aquatic ecosystem presenting the dual challenge of being both sensitive to climate change (creating constantly shifting selective pressures) and isolated from surrounding populations (limiting gene flow). In Lake Chala, ancient climate-driven lake-level fluctuations did not directly promote speciation in O. hunteri, but the population bottlenecks they may have caused potentially contributed to its divergence from sister species Oreochromis jipe.

Prey obtain information about their risk environment not only from their immediate experiences with predators, but also from their previous experiences, especially if they occur during particularly sensitive windows in ontogeny. Embryonic development is often a key window when an individual's experiences can have lasting effects on behavior and fitness. The propensity of embryonic experiences with predation risk to affect prey performance, however, may vary across gradients of abiotic stress. Using a rocky intertidal system, we explored whether a dominant abiotic stressor-wave exposure-modifies the influence of embryonic experience with predation risk (from the green crab, Carcinus mamas) on prey (the carnivorous snail, Nucella lapillus) traits both at emergence and as one-year-olds exposed to current predation risk. We found that snails from wave-exposed, but not sheltered, populations emerged smaller from development and grew less in the absence of current risk as one-year-olds if they experienced risk as embryos. However, exposure to current predation risk reduced the growth and growth efficiency of one-year-old snails from both wave-exposed and sheltered populations. Our results demonstrate that increased environmental stress can modify predator-prey interactions and enhance prey reliance on early life experiences with predation risk, but that direct exposure to risk later in life can strongly affect prey performance across environmental stress gradients.

We examined den site selection and spring space use for black bears (Ursus americanus) at the individual level, and analyzed support for the anthropogenic risk avoidance and infanticide avoidance hypotheses. We obtained telemetry data for 94 individual bears (71 F and 23 M) and collected 162 den locations from Michigan (2009-2011 and 2013-2015), Missouri (2010-2016), and Mississippi (2008-2017), USA. Of 71 females, 37 were monitored during multiple reproductive states. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of reproductive state (female with cubs, female with yearlings, female alone, or male) on den distance to the nearest road, two road indexes (den emergence and spring), spring home range size, mean spring road distance, and a NDVI selection index. All black bears, except females with cubs, chose den locations farther from roads than available to them, supporting the anthropogenic risk avoidance hypothesis. Additionally, females with cubs displayed the smallest spring home ranges among females, as well as donned closer to roads and used areas closer to roads during spring than females with yearlings, supporting the infanticide avoidance hypothesis. The differential responses by the same females when having cubs or yearlings point to strategies to maximize reproductive success. By investigating behavior considering individual availability, we revealed patterns that might not be detected by population-level assessments.	[Gantchoff, M. G.; Belant, J.

Symbiotic endolithic microbes alter host morphology and reduce host vulnerability to high environmental temperatures	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						heat budget; mortality; Mytilus californianus; shell-boring endoliths; symbiosis; thermal stress	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BODY-TEMPERATURE; HEAT WAVES; MUSSEL; PARASITES; ECOLOGY; INFECTION; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; SHELL	Thermal stresses, such as those associated with global warming, have the potential to change the strength and even the direction of interspecific interactions. On rocky shores, bio-eroding microbial endoliths infect the mussel Mytilus californianus. Infestation by microbial endoliths can weaken the shell and lead to mechanical failure and death, increased vulnerability to predation, mechanical damage, etc. However, endolith infestation is associated with the loss of the dark-colored periostracum, exposing the underlying light gray prismatic layer of the shell and potentially reducing stressful heat gain during low tide. We explore the consequences of the mussel-endolith relationship on mussel tolerance to high environmental temperature through a series of experimental manipulations and comparative observations. Experimental sterilization of the shell surface reduces the rate of periostracum loss, suggesting that the change in shell surface color is indeed caused by microbes residing on/in the shell. Eroded shells absorbed less solar energy than shells with their periostracum intact, and mussel mimics with infested shells remained cooler on sunny days. Manipulation of shell color in the field resulted in higher mortality in black-painted mussels relative to gray-painted or naturally eroded mussels. Furthermore, following exceedingly hot weather, mortality was significantly lower for heavily infested, light-colored mussels than for lightly infested, dark-colored mussels. Thus, although shell-boring microbes have the potential to act as parasites under the majority of conditions experienced by mussels, they may be critical mutualists during periods of intense thermal stress. This context-dependent symbiosis may allow mussels to occupy higher shore levels than would otherwise be possible, and thus indirectly benefit the hundreds of species which use mussel beds as habitat.

Here, we assessed such pathways with a PSF experiment using soil conditioned for >= 12 yr from two grassland biodiversity experiments. Model plant communities differing in plant species and functional group richness (current plant diversity treatment) were grown in soils conditioned by plant communities with either low- or high-diversity (soil history treatment). Our results indicate that plant diversity can modify plant productivity through both diversity-mediated plant-plant and plant-soil interactions, with the main driver (current plant diversity or soil history) differing with experimental context. Structural equation modeling suggests that the underlying mechanisms of PSFs were explained to a significant extent by both abiotic and biotic pathways (specifically, soil nitrogen availability and soil nematode richness). Thus, effects of plant diversity loss on plant productivity may persist or even increase over time because of biotic and abiotic soil legacy effects.

Impacts of growing-season climate on tree growth and post-fire regeneration in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change; conifer seedlings; dendrochronology; growth-climate relationships; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Rocky Mountains; tree regeneration; tree rings	NORTHERN ROCKIES; DROUGHT; CONIFER; ESTABLISHMENT; WILDFIRE; DISTURBANCE; MORTALITY; RANGE; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY	We studied the impacts of climate variability on low-elevation forests in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains by quantifying how post-fire tree regeneration and radial growth varied with growing-season climate. We reconstructed post-fire regeneration and radial growth rates of Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii at 33 sites that burned between 1992 and 2007, by aging seedlings at the root-shoot boundary. We also measured radial growth in adult trees from 12 additional sites that burned between 1900 and 1990. To quantify the relationship between climate and regeneration, we characterized seasonal climate before, during, and after recruitment pulses using superposed epoch analysis. To quantify growth sensitivity to climate, we performed moving regression analysis for each species and for juvenile and adult life stages. Climatic conditions favoring regeneration and tree growth differed between species. Water deficit and temperature were significantly lower than average during recruitment pulses of ponderosa pine, suggesting that germination-year climate limits regeneration. Growing degree days were significantly higher than average during years with Douglas-fir recruitment pulses, but water deficit was significantly lower one year following pulses, suggesting moisture sensitivity in two-year-old seedlings. Growth was also sensitive to water deficit, but effects varied between life stages, species, and through time, with juvenile ponderosa pine growth more sensitive to climate than adult growth and juvenile Douglas-fir growth. Increasing water deficit corresponded with reduced adult growth of both species. Increases in maximum temperature and water deficit corresponded with increases in juvenile growth of both species in the early 20th century but strong reductions in growth for juvenile ponderosa pine in recent decades. Changing sensitivity of growth to climate suggests that increased temperature and water deficit may be pushing these species toward the edge of their climatic tolerances. Our study demonstrates increased vulnerability of dry mixed-conifer forests to post-fire regeneration failures and decreased growth as temperatures and drought increase. Shifts toward unfavorable conditions for regeneration and juvenile growth may alter the composition and resilience of low-elevation forests to future climate and fire activity.

Resilience to disturbance is a cross-scale phenomenon offering a solution to the disturbance paradox	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Cerambycidae; Coleoptera; Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment; Silviculture	MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; TEMPERATE FORESTS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; STABILITY; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; COMPLEXITY; RESPONSES; BEETLES	Resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to return to a previous state following disturbance. Ecological communities may demonstrate resilience after long periods of time. However, short-term outcomes of disturbance may be reduced functionality despite an increase in biodiversity, a phenomenon known as the disturbance paradox. Silvicultural management regimes are ecological disturbances that vary with the frequency of tree harvests, the age of the tree when harvested, spatial arrangement of harvest, and the area of forest removed. Therefore, they are expected to result in different levels of resilience among forest communities over time. We used the response of temperate hardwood forest beetle communities to different timber harvest treatments in a long-term research study to test predictions of ecosystem resilience. We also aimed to determine whether this system shows evidence of the disturbance paradox. We predicted that (1) communities following harvest differ from pre-harvest communities, (2) areas treated with evenaged management and uneven-aged management would show community trajectories back to pre-harvest communities, (3) the more concentrated disturbance of the even-aged management would lead to a lower community resilience, and (4) community change would be attributed to an increase in pest species using recently harvested wood. The communities did change after timber harvests, but while the dissimilarity between pre- and post-treatment communities was the same for the two treatments, the departure and return to the pre-harvest community state were along different community trajectories. Furthermore, communities in both treatments showed similar resilience by returning to pre-harvest community composition at the same rate. As predicted, the abundance of species most responsible for post-harvest community shifts were those that feed on living wood. This, along with a decrease in abundance of decaying wood decomposers, indicated that the disturbance paradox was playing out in this system.	[Hanna, L.; Kissick, A. L.; Mccroskey, E.; Holland, J.

Measuring function and structure of urban headwater streams with citizen scientists	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						citizen science; community-based monitoring; cotton strips; decomposition rate; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; headwater streams	ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; LEAF-LITTER; INVERTEBRATE COLONIZATION; LAND-USE; SCIENCE; BREAKDOWN; BURIAL; INDICATORS; VOLUNTEER	Headwater streams accumulate, process, and export organic materials for use in downstream environments. Decomposition of organic material, an important ecosystem function, may be sensitive to land cover changes in urbanizing regions since headwater stream processes tend to be tightly coupled with riparian and catchment characteristics. Headwaters represent 70-80% of total stream length in watersheds but are disproportionately converted to drainage infrastructure or buried with urban development. Cumulatively, this loss may result in substantial changes to physical and biological downstream processes. From a monitoring perspective, headwaters are largely ignored compared with fishable/navigable waterways for planning decisions, so their structural and functional variability is not well understood. Here, we engaged citizen scientists to contribute data on this variability and to evaluate the sensitivity of standardized cotton-strip decomposition rates to multiscale factors across headwaters with varying landscape conditions in the Greater Toronto Area (York Region), Canada. These factors included stream, riparian vegetation, and catchment characteristics. We expected decomposition rates to be similarly sensitive to local- and catchment-scale factors because of the strong links between headwater catchment and stream processes. We also expected a hump-shaped distribution of decomposition rates across a gradient of urban cover, with stimulating effects at low to moderate cover but deleterious effects at high urban cover. We found that decomposition rate was most sensitive to local-scale factors (e.g., strip burial, stream velocity, and both local upland riparian vegetation density and topography) rather than whole catchment properties. We did not find the expected hump-shaped distribution with urban cover and suggest that more mechanistic studies are needed for understanding cotton-strip decomposition to control for local factors in determining the scale at which decomposition rate is most sensitive to land cover change.

In a temperate pine forest in North Carolina, USA, where nitrogen (N) had been experimentally added for eight years, we combined DNA-based measures of fungal and bacterial biomass and composition with measures of seven extracellular enzymes (ecoenzymes). These measures were then correlated with soil chemistry. Our goals were to evaluate the relative sensitivity and repeatability of multiple structural and functional measures of community organization to long-term N deposition. Measurements were conducted at three litter/soil depths, corresponding to the litter, Oa, and mineral A horizons (max depth 10 cm) with ten spatial replicates per experimental plot. Soil chemistry differed significantly with soil depth and N amendment. Total biomass (soil DNA), as well as fungal and bacterial biomass (measured by qPCR), was greatest in the litter horizon and declined significantly with depth. Ecoenzyme activity patterns also changed with soil depth, transitioning from high levels of C, N, and P metabolizing activities in the litter horizon to increased oxidative activities at the lower depth. Under N amendment, soil pH decreased and nitrate concentrations increased in all three soil horizons. Correspondingly, the estimated microbial C use efficiency decreased in N-amended soils at all depths, despite differences in microbial biomass, community composition, and soil chemistry. Overall, bacterial composition was most responsive to nitrogen amendment, but the taxonomic context of the response varied with soil horizons in conjunction with shifts in soil chemistry and enzyme activities. While a single measure that would incorporate all of the C, N, and P metabolizing activities did not emerge, many measures correlated with each other, and/or with depth and/or N amendment.

Mixed-severity fire regimes are the most complex and least understood fire regimes, and variability of fire severity can occur at fine spatial and temporal scales, depending on previous disturbance history, topography, fuel continuity, vegetation type, and weather. During high fire weather in 2013, a complex of mixed-severity wildfires burned across multiple ownerships within the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of southwestern Oregon where northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) demographics were studied since 1990. A year prior to these wildfires, high-resolution, remotely sensed forest structural information derived from light detection and ranging (lidar) data was acquired for an area that fully covered the extent of these fires. To quantify wildfire impact on northern spotted owl nesting/roosting habitat, we fit a relative habitat suitability model based on pre-fire locations used for nesting and roosting, and forest structure variables developed from 2012 lidar data. Our pre-fire habitat suitability model predicted nesting/roosting locations well, and variable response functions followed known resource selection patterns. These forests had typical characteristics of old-growth forest, with high density of large live trees, high canopy cover, and complex structure in canopy height. We projected the pre-fire model onto lidar data collected two months post-fire to produce a post-fire suitability map, which indicated that >93% of pre-fire habitat that burned at high severity was no longer suitable forest for nesting and roosting. We also quantified the probability that pre-fire nesting/roosting habitat would burn at each severity class (unburned/low, low, moderate, high). Pre-fire nesting/roosting habitat had lower probability of burning at moderate or high severity compared to other forest types under high burning conditions. Our results indicate that northern spotted owl habitat can buffer the negative effects of climate change by enhancing biodiversity and resistance to high-severity fires, which are predicted to increase in frequency and extent with climate change. Within this region, protecting large blocks of old forests could be an integral component of management plans that successfully maintain variability of forests in this mixed-ownership and mixed-severity fire regime landscape and enhance conservation of many species.

Experimentally warmer and drier conditions in an Arctic plant community reveal microclimatic controls on senescence	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change; early snowmelt; microclimate; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; phenology; senescence; warming	GROWING-SEASON LENGTH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TUSSOCK TUNDRA; PHENOLOGICAL RESPONSES; SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; VEGETATION INDEX; FOREST PHENOLOGY; AIR-TEMPERATURE; SPATIAL SCALES; PRODUCTIVITY	The timing and duration of the plant growing season and its period of peak activity have shifted globally in response to climate change. These changes alter the period of maximum and potential total carbon uptake, especially in highly seasonal environments such as the Arctic. Earlier plant growth has been observed, and if plant senescence remains the same or is delayed, growing season extension will likely lead to greater carbon uptake and growth. We used phenology data from a multifactor climate change experiment to examine how altered seasonality influences the timing and rate-of-senescence and to compare direct observations of individual plant senescence with mathematical models of onset-of-senescence based on near-surface remote sensing. Our three-year experiment in an Arctic tundra ecosystem altered plant microclimates through factorial warming and earlier snowmelt treatments. We found that (1) early snowmelt and warmer temperatures led to earlier remotely sensed onset-of-senescence, but did not alter the rate-of-senescence, (2) the timing of color change for individual vascular plants did not change in response to the treatments, leading to a mismatch with remotely sensed phenology, and (3) cumulative, phonologically dependent microclimate metrics (e.g., soil cold degree-days) best predicted the onset-of-senescence. Our study highlights the complexity of observing and understanding controls over phenological shifts that affect plant growth and consequently ecosystem functions. Experimental studies that include multiple approaches to observe and model phenological changes and microclimate are critical to develop phenological forecasting models.

An evaluation of isotopic (delta H-2) methods to provide estimates of avian breeding and natal dispersal	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						breeding dispersal; deuterium; golden-winged warbler; natal dispersal; stable isotope analyses; Vermivora chrysoptera	LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; MIGRATORY BIRDS; STABLE-HYDROGEN; WINTERING GROUNDS; GENETIC-VARIATION; CONNECTIVITY; ASSIGNMENT; PHILOPATRY; DELTA-C-13; ABUNDANCE	Natal and breeding dispersal represents an important component of animal demography and metapopulation theory. This phenomenon also has implications for conservation and management because understanding movements of individuals potentially allows the identification of key habitats that may be acting as population sources or sinks. Intrinsic markers such as stable isotope abundance in tissues that can be associated with provenance can provide a coarse but pragmatic solution to understanding such movements. Different methodologies have been proposed to quantify natal and breeding dispersal by using stable isotope analyses of keratinous tissues (hair, feathers), each of them with their own advantages and limitations. Here, we compared results provided by four different methods to estimate dispersal (three already published and one novel) in animals using stable isotope measurements. We used a single large dataset of feather delta H-2 values from golden-winged warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) representing five different populations breeding in North America to compare model results. We propose one method as the most adequately supported by data, and we used this method to demonstrate how biological factors explaining dispersal status can be identified and geographical origins of immigrants inferred. Our results point to a generalized methodological approach to using stable isotope data to study immigration and dispersal in birds and other animals.

Uncovering mechanisms of bird seed dispersal in semiarid environments to help to restore them	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						bird censuses; camera trapping; DNA barcoding; frugivorous birds; oldfield restoration	LAND ABANDONMENT; ESTABLISHMENT; CONSERVATION; FRAGMENTATION; CONSEQUENCES; COLONIZATION; ECOSYSTEMS; FRUGIVORY; MAMMALS; LIMITS	Mediterranean semiarid areas are suffering a growing process of agricultural abandonment that represents a challenge for restoration. Limited seed arrival, drought, and scarce suitable microhabitats in oldfields make plant colonization difficult. Restoration through ecological succession can take advantage of increased seed dispersal through animal vectors, but precise knowledge of the factors involved (e.g., seed disperser behavior, rate of effective recruitment of dispersed seeds, and effectiveness of the applied restoration structures) is critical. Otherwise, efforts to foster the processes of interest may be misdirected. We propose and test a methodological approach based on the combination of ecological (bird censuses and camera trapping) and genetic tools (DNA barcoding), to assess seed dispersal of fleshy-fruited shrub species by birds toward oldfields in one of the driest areas of southeastern Spain. We assisted natural restoration with artificial bird attractors (perches and water troughs) in two abandoned areas with different ages. Furthermore, we provided microenvironments (rocks) and prevented herbivory (by fencing) to enhance plant recruitment. Results revealed strong differences among assessment techniques in the characterization of dispersal interactions. While bird censuses only informed about frugivores occurrence, camera trapping and barcoding enabled the quantification of species responses. Attractors proved to be effective in triggering a quantifiable seed arrival, but no subsequent plant establishment occurred. We highlight the importance of implementing different techniques to characterize and assess avian seed disperser performance. Water provision increased seed arrival, but our design failed to enhance plant recruitment. The next logical step in the restoration of Mediterranean old fields is the optimization of conditions for seed germination and successful plant establishment.

Simulating the effects of climate variability on waterbodies and wetland-dependent birds in the Prairie Pothole Region	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						downscaled model; forecasting; Pothole Complex Hydrologic Model; Prairie Pothole Region; time-series analyses; waterbodies	LAND-USE; NORTH-DAKOTA; WATER LEVELS; CONSERVATION; EXPANSION; IMPACTS; SHIFT; AREA; LAKE	Understanding how bird populations respond to changes in waterbody availability in the climatically variable Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America hinges on being able to couple hydrological and climate modeling to represent potential future landscapes. Model experiments run with the Pothole Complex Hydrologic Model using downscaled climate data (variables relating to precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration at 1/8 degrees spatial resolution under four general circulation climate models and two gas emissions scenarios) were used to forecast the abundances of six focal wetland-dependent bird species in the Missouri Coteau portion of the PPR, providing ensemble scenarios at a spatial scale relevant to resource management. Although the projected number of May ponds (waterbodies present during bird breeding season) fluctuated through time with some decadal periodicity (and with the number present in a given year reflecting abundance over the previous three years), the ensemble model average indicated an increase in the average number of waterbodies present by the turn of the next century. Overall, the model experiments conservatively projected an 11.75% increase in the number of waterbodies present by 2090-2099 compared to a baseline period from 1967 to 2005 in the PPR. Wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance were significantly associated with temporal patterns and decadal periodicity in waterbody dynamics. Because of the strong associations between wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance and the number of prairie potholes, projected waterbody increases are forecasted to result in an 11.97% overall increase in occurrence and 8.63% increase in abundance of the six focal species by the end of the 21st century; these results contrast with forecasted drought-associated declines in waterbodies and birds in the PPR. This integrated hydrological-climatological approach offers a means of assessing how wetland-dependent bird populations may respond to changes in wetland habitat availability due to a changing dimate. Our results provide information that can help managers decide how to mitigate the effects of climate shifts on the distribution of wetland habitat and biota.	[McIntyre, N.

The statistical modeling techniques commonly used to analyze these counts provide robust, long-term population trend estimates from heterogeneous community science data at regional, national, and continental scales. Here, we present a new modeling approach that increases the spatial resolution of trend estimates and reduces the computational burden of trend estimation, each by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the approach with data for the American Robin (Turdus migratorius) from Audubon Christmas Bird Counts conducted between 1966 and 2017. We show that aggregate regional trend estimates from the proposed method aligned well with those from the current standard method, and that spatial variation in trends was associated with winter temperatures and human population densities as predicted by ecological energetics. This technique can provide reasonable large-scale trend estimates for users interested in general patterns, while also providing higher-resolution estimates for examining correlates of abundance trends at finer spatial scales, which is a prerequisite for tailoring management plans to local conditions.

Management decisions made in one portion of a landscape may induce spatial and temporal shifts of wildlife use in another, creating tension among private, state, and federal lands with varying missions. Recent declines in migratory behavior have initiated studies focused primarily on spring migration, but the timing and benefits of autumn migration have received limited attention due to the difficulty in assessing the extreme asynchrony in autumnal events, although nutrition during this time period is crucial to winter survival and reproduction. Here, we used five years of data from 73 female elk (Cervus canadensis) which utilize a landscape managed by 4 federal agencies, a state, and private landowners, to identify the driving factors behind the initiation of fall migration in two subpopulations, one of which migrates to a protected area where hunting is prohibited. Most elk departed summer range prior to frost or snow, with 67% of elk that used the protected area migrating prior to the onset of archery hunting season (1 September), preemptively avoiding risk, while no elk from the other subpopulation left prior to archery season. However, departure from productive summer range prior to frost or snow, nearly two months before vegetation senescence, led to an important tradeoff. Early migrants gave up 0.30% of late summer-fall integrated NDVI (iNDVI) per day when they moved to the safety of the protected area, leading to an average difference of 15.81% in iNDVI between an individual departing on 30 August (the mean departure date) vs. an individual departing on 1 November. Our results suggest that in areas where migratory ungulates span multiple jurisdictions, the benefits of migratory behavior may be dramatically impacted by unevenly distributed anthropogenic disturbance. As this is a common scenario globally, our work highlights the urgent need to improve our understanding of subtle changes in migratory behavior, both spatially and temporally, which may erode the resilience of migration to future change.

They modify soil physical properties and support soil biological activities. Therefore, trees are hypothesized to control soil biodiversity in forested areas. We predicted that (1) experimental forest plantations with higher tree alpha-diversity have greater soil microbial alpha-diversity and (2) that plantations with more divergent tree community composition would have more divergent soil microbial assemblages (Whitaker's beta-diversity). We tested these predictions by measuring soil bacteria and fungi in a 7-yr-old tree biodiversity experiment. The experimental plantation contained 37 different tree assemblages, which were composed of one to four native species from temperate mixed deciduous forests. Further, there was a gradient of functional diversity nested within each level of species diversity. Soil samples were assessed for bacteria and fungi by amplicon sequencing. Tree alpha-diversity weakly, but significantly, affected bacterial alpha-diversity, without affecting fungal alpha-diversity. Tree community composition was weakly, but significantly, linked to soil bacterial and fungal assemblages. In these 7-yr-old experimental plantations, tree diversity was not the most influential driver of soil microbial diversity.

Demographic approaches to modeling species assemblages show promise because they seek to represent fundamental relationships between population dynamics and environmental conditions. In dryland rivers, rapidly changing climate conditions have shifted drought and flooding regimes with implications for fish communities. Our goals were to (1) develop a mechanistic multispecies demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes, and (2) evaluate demographic responses in population and community structure to changing flow regimes. Each fish species was represented by a stage-structured matrix, and species were coupled together into a multispecies framework through density-dependent relationships in reproduction. Then, community dynamics were simulated through time using annual flow events classified from gaged streamflow data. We parameterized the model with vital rates and flow-response relationships for a community of native and nonnative fishes using literature-derived values. We applied the simulation model to the Verde River (Arizona, USA), a major tributary within the Colorado River Basin, for the past half century (1%4-2017). Model validation revealed a match between model projections and relative abundance trends observed in a long-term fish monitoring dataset (1994-2008). At the beginning of the validation period (1994), model and survey observations showed that native species comprised approximately 80% of total abundance. Model projections beyond the survey data (2008-2017) predicted a shift from a native dominant to a normative dominant assemblage, coinciding with increasing drought frequency. Trade-offs between native and nonnative species dominance emerged from differences in mortality in response to the changing sequence of major flow events including spring floods, summer high flows, and droughts. In condusion, the demographic approach presented here provides a flexible modeling framework that is readily applied to other stream systems and species by adjusting or transferring, when appropriate, species vital rates and flow-event thresholds.

Both invasive taxa are implicated in declines of native amphibians in this region, but few long-term studies of communities exist. Further, field studies of invasive-native interactions are complicated by confounding habitat modifications and observation errors. We surveyed amphibians and measured habitat characteristics for 12 yr across 38 wetland sites within the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. We assessed the influence of invasive species, habitat, and their interactions on the distributions of five native amphibian species using a multispecies dynamic occupancy model that accounted for false-negative and false-positive detections. In general, habitat characteristics-such as within-pond vegetation cover, surrounding forest, and drought severity-were important for local persistence of native species when bullfrogs co-occurred. We also found evidence of a cumulative negative effect of bullfrogs and non-native fish (families Centrarchidae and Ictaluridae) on northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora) local persistence that was mediated by the dominance of invasive reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea). Non-native fish and bullfrogs had variable effects on native amphibian species, but neither invasive taxon appears to be causing declines in occupied sites within our study area. Moreover, species relationships with habitat differed when invaders were present, indicating that certain habitats may increase persistence of native amphibians in the invaded landscape.

In addition, it is unclear whether wetland buffers have similar-or stronger-effects on fertilizer and pesticide contamination than reducing the amount of cropped land within the larger landscape context around wetlands. Our study, conducted across 37 wetlands in eastern Ontario, Canada, addressed the following questions: (1) Does increasing buffer width, or increasing the amount of contiguous uncropped land within recommended buffer width guidelines, reduce nutrient and pesticide levels in agricultural wetlands? (2) Does increasing uncropped land cover in the broader landscape reduce nutrient and pesticide levels in agricultural wetlands? and (3) What is the relative importance of buffer size and landscape-scale uncropped cover for reducing nutrient and pesticide levels in agricultural wetlands? A rigorous site selection process was employed to minimize the correlation between buffer size and landscape-scale uncropped cover, minimize spatial gradients in these predictor variables, and minimize variation in potentially confounding variables. We obtained nutrient and pesticide data by collecting water samples from each wetland under similar weather conditions in June-July 2015. Nitrate concentrations were measured using ion chromatography, and atrazine and neonicotinoid (pesticide) concentrations using a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. We found that nitrate, atrazine, and neonicotinoid concentrations in study wetlands were unaffected by wetland buffer size. However, concentrations of each chemical decreased with uncropped land cover in the surrounding 150 to 300-m radius landscapes. To effectively protect water in agricultural wetlands from contamination by nitrate-based fertilizers and atrazine or neonicotinoid pesticides, we recommend either increasing the policy-recommended width of wetland buffers to at least 150 m, or abandoning the buffer paradigm in favor of landscape-scale conservation.

The design of these multi-species occupancy surveys affects statistical power to detect trends in occupancy because individual species vary in resource selection, detection probability, and rarity. We tested for differences in the ability of a large-scale monitoring program to detect changes in single-species occupancy of 13 medium-large mammal species captured on n = 183 cameras systematically placed across five national parks in the Canadian Rockies (similar to 21,000 km(2)). We focus the interpretation of our findings on three species at risk: grizzly bear, wolverine, and caribou. We found that statistical power to monitor trends in occupancy depends not only on the established elements associated with power (sampling size, effect size, and variation in estimates), but also on species-specific detection and occupancy probabilities. These two probabilities, however, affected power differently. For most species in our study, power is insensitive to detection probability. Increasing replicate-specific detection probability only improved power when the cumulative detection probability was below 0.80. Therefore, efficient species monitoring must consider that power no longer improves by increasing sample size or the replicate-specific detection probability once this threshold is reached. On the other hand, species with occupancy probabilities dose to 0.5 had lower statistical power than those with higher or lower occupancy, that is, power was higher for both rare and very common species. This pattern is due to the heretofore-underappreciated effect of the binomial variation in occupancy. The implications of these findings are species-specific. Grizzly bears, for example, had high detection and occupancy probabilities, resulting in high power to detect a population change. Conversely, wolverines had low detection probability and the power to detect change could be improved if detection probability was increased using lure or complimentary survey techniques. Caribou, however, with both low detection and occupancy probabilities, were likely too rare on the landscape to rely on camera-based occupancy for monitoring. Practitioners should be aware of these species-specific trade-offs and may need to tailor monitoring programs to prioritize particular species of conservation concern.

We investigated whether there were patterns in specific functional strategies during succession in the dry tropical forests of the Florida Keys, whose unique physical setting includes nutrient-stressed, salt-stressed, and water-limited environments. The study, which focused on ten traits, determined the leading trait dimensions by which species differentiate from one another in the study area. The general patterns of trait covariation at individual sites and among species were analyzed using principal component analysis. Trait niche overlap indices were calculated for all species sampled across all plots. Evidence for/against likely community assembly processes was tested using the coefficient of heterogeneity to determine whether variation within and among five key traits was clustered, random, or evenly distributed across young, old, or all measured forest stands. A combination of plant architecture, wood density, and three leaf traits (specific leaf area, leaf phosphorus, and leaf nitrogen) comprised a key set of functional traits that are important for understanding the community assembly process in dry tropical forest. Older forest stands were dominated by species with low specific area, low leaf nitrogen content, dense wood, and deeper and narrower canopies. Trees of old forests had leaves with lighter carbon isotope composition, suggesting that such individuals were making more efficient use of scarce water. Tests of trait distributions showed significant clustering across forests of all ages. When individual trait distributions in old stands were tested, they displayed either randomly or evenly distributed traits across trait niche space, indicating that resource partitioning was predominant in shaping community composition. Physical traits of trees in young communities are associated with resource acquisitive strategies, while old communities are dominated by species with traits that enhance survival in environments defined by competition or chronic resource scarcity.

We studied free-living soil nematode abundance and community structure in soil samples collected from alluvial fans in Death Valley between 2013 and 2018. Our objective was to establish the distribution and abundance of soil nematodes on alluvial fans with respect to soil properties, vegetation, and channels that reflect past and future water flows. The study period spanned an extreme drought for the region but also included a 2016 superbloom of spring annual plants that followed a strong El Nino event. We found that nematode communities were dominated by bacterial-feeding species and had higher densities under shrub canopies than in adjacent interplant soils. Nematode abundance was similar between areas on alluvial fans that were channelized by past water flows and adjacent desert pavement and does not appear to be linked to how water distributes on the fans following rainfall events. Nematode abundance increased during the superbloom in soils around annual plants. Across the study period, soil organic matter content was the only soil variable measured that was significantly and positively correlated to nematode abundance. Overall, nematodes in this extreme environment are adapted to drought, but they are highly dependent on the growth and distribution of both perennial and annual plants to supply the soil organic matter that their microbial food sources rely upon.

Previous studies hypothesized that the migration to deep waters was for hibernation. The findings of this study oppose this hypothesis. We showed that P. paucidens is physiologically active in deep waters during winter; that the carbon stable isotope ratio indicated that the species forages in winter and that there was a difference in food sources between summer and winter; that lipid content was highest in January; and that gene expression activity (as measured by the RNA/DNA ratio) remained constant throughout the year. Thus, P. paucidens individuals that migrate to the bottom are likely to forage in winter, but do not hibernate. Nutrients gained in winter were not reflected in individual growth but may have been allocated to gonadal growth and the production of gametes, suggesting that winter foraging by this species in deep sites contributes to obtain resources for reproductive investment. In addition, we found that both small individuals with no reproductive experience and relatively large females with reproductive experience overwintered, indicating that P. paucidens has a life-cycle that is longer than 1 yr in Lake Biwa.

To reveal the underlying mechanism from a plant-eye-view perspective, we examined the patterns of local species richness which was defined as the number of species around individuals of a target species within circles of different radii and their correlations with major plant functional traits in a tropical montane rainforest. In 2012, we established a 60-ha forest dynamics plot (FDP) in tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China. In 2013, we measured eight functional traits (specific leaf area [SLA], leaf dry matter content [LDMC], wood density, potential maximum height, leaf carbon content [LCC], leaf nitrogen content [LNC], leaf phosphorus content [LPC], and leaf potassium content) of all the species in the FDP. Based on all the mapped individuals that had a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm, we utilized individual species-area relationships function (ISAR(s)(r)) combined with the heterogeneous Poisson null model to quantify the patterns of local species richness at scales from 1 to 50 m. Regression analysis was used to determine which functional traits could influence the local diversity pattern. Results showed that the 123 ISAR(s)(r) curves were relatively similar and no species seemed to be extremely higher or lower than the average of all the ISAR(s)(r) curves. The percentage of species that behaved predominantly as accumulators or repellers or neutrally was 42.23%, 13.82%, and 43.9% at scale of <30 m, respectively. But at scales >= 30 m, more than 70% of all species behaved neutrally suggesting that facilitative interactions probably occurred when neighborhoods were <30 m apart. Among the eight measured traits, the SLA, LNC, and LPC were negatively associated with local species richness. Our results indicated that (1) the spatial community structure was not controlled by key species; (2) facilitative interactions played an important role in local diversity maintenance; (3) species with conservative functional trait syndromes were more likely to have relatively high local species richness in the tropical montane rainforest on Hainan Island, China.

Among soil parameters, labile organic carbon is considered to have a primary role in many soil functions related to productivity and environmental resilience. Our study aimed at assessing the suitability of different labile carbon fractions, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), hydrophilic DOC (Hy-DOC), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC, also referred to as Active Carbon), hot water extractable carbon (HWEC) and particulate organic matter carbon (POMC) as soil quality indicators in agricultural systems. To do so, we tested their sensitivity to two agricultural management factors (tillage and organic matter input) in 10 European long-term field experiments (LTEs), and we assessed the correlation of the different labile carbon fractions with physical, chemical and biological soil quality indicators linked to soil functions. We found that reduced tillage and high organic matter input increase concentrations of labile carbon fractions in soil compared to conventional tillage and low organic matter addition, respectively. POXC and POMC were the most sensitive fractions to both tillage and fertilization across the 10 European LTEs. In addition, POXC was the labile carbon fraction most positively correlated with soil chemical (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and cation exchange capacity), physical (water stable aggregates, water holding capacity, bulk density) and biological soil quality indicators (microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and soil respiration). We conclude that POXC represents a labile carbon fraction sensitive to soil management and that is the most informative about total soil organic matter, nutrients, soil structure, and microbial pools and activity, parameters commonly used as indicators of various soil functions, such as C sequestration, nutrient cycling, soil structure formation and soil as a habitat for biodiversity. Moreover, POXC measurement is relatively cheap, fast and easy. Therefore, we suggest measuring POXC as the labile carbon fraction in soil quality assessment schemes in addition to other valuable soil quality indicators.

Differential and additive effects of natural biotic and anthropogenic noise on call properties of Odontophrynus americanus (Anura, Odontophryinidae): Implications for the conservation of anurans inhabiting noisy environments	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Noise pollution; Road traffic noise; Auditory masking; Chorus noise; Acoustic communication; Advertisement call	FEMALE MATE CHOICE; ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION; BACKGROUND-NOISE; TRAFFIC NOISE; ADVERTISEMENT CALLS; SEXUAL SELECTION; FROG; TREEFROG; HABITAT; MASKING	Successful reproduction in most anurans is associated to acoustic communication and negative effects of auditory masking by natural biotic and anthropogenic noise are known in this group. However, the potential additive effect of both noise types has been scarcely studied. We examine in situ the acoustic variation of 135 males (n= 975 calls) of Odontophrynus americanus in areas from Central Argentina with (TN) and without traffic noise (N-TN) and in presence (Ch) or absence (N-Ch) of chorus. The effect of noise condition on four call properties (call duration [CD], intercall interval [ICI], pulse rate [PR] and dominant frequency [DF]) were analyzed using linear mixed models (LMM and GLMM). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the acoustical properties that best accounted for variation among all possible noise conditions (N-TN/N-Ch; N-TN/Ch; TN/N-Ch and TN/Ch). PR and DF showed significant higher values in TN than N-TN sites while a significant increase in ICI and a decrease in DF were found in chorus situation. Analyzing combined effects, PR significantly increased in N-TN/N-Ch condition and decreased under TN/Ch. ICI was significantly higher in N-TN/N-Ch condition. PCA showed a separation of males calling in noisy condition mainly associated to higher values of DF and CD. The acoustic variation observed in noisy environments could have implications in the reproductive strategies of the individuals although new studies should be conducted to analyze the effect of this variation on the recognition and choice by females. Our outcomes highlight the importance of conducting in situ behavioral studies considering the additive effects of different environmental noise sources.

Regardless of the unprecedented anthropogenic disturbances on natural flood regimes, there is limited understanding for the response of fish assemblages to flood pulses. Most studies documented the issue sorely on floodplain rivers or floodplain lakes, but the dynamics of fish communities in the transitional floodplains accounting for both lentic and lotic environments are rarely reported. Here we measure temporal (high and low water seasons) and spatial (lotic and lentic environments) patterns of fish assemblages in the transitional floodplain between the Yangtze River and Lake Caizi using taxonomic and functional group metrics. Our results demonstrated significantly variations in fish community composition among different environments between high and low water seasons. During flooding season in high water phase, we observed significantly patchy population recruitments of riverine fish species. Then in low water season, widespread lake residents dominated the lentic environments due to their higher environment tolerance. Benefitting from the functional group measurement, we identified three flooding related functional groups i. e., G2, G9 and G10 (consisting of riverine catfishes, gudgeons, and loaches), that may bear the brunt of natural flood pulses alterations. Despite the significant variations of richness in taxonomic diversity, we detected higher sensitivity of functional diversity, since three functional diversity indices were significantly higher in high water season. This findings demonstrated important functional recruitments triggered by flood pulses, highlighting a pressing need to sustain natural flood regime with hydrological connectivity for better conservation of fish assemblages in floodplain ecosystem.

Investigating the potential role of threshold responses to increasing extreme events could help elucidate the mechanisms conferring resilience to populations and ecosystems, since extreme events could have a higher impact than mean changes in ecological systems. Among the potential impacts of extreme climatic events, the assessment of mortality deserves particular attention for long-lived species. In the NE Atlantic, the vulnerability of birds was emphatically demonstrated in the winter of 2013/2014 when at least 54,982 individuals were reported dead in cumulative mass-mortality events. The aim of the present work is to uncover the link between extreme wind events and bird mortality for the 2004-2014 period in southern European waters to detect potential threshold responses. As extreme wind events can be estimated in different ways, we employed a multi threshold wind speed approach to assess which criteria yielded the strongest predictions. By focusing on a highly vulnerable species, the common guillemot Uria aalge, we hypothesized that bird mortality would be related to a cumulative effect of extreme wind events. At the weekly scale, cumulative patterns of extreme wind events and bird mortality were correlated following similar sigmoidal curves. The period of maximum mortality fell within the time frame of maximum extreme wind events during winter beginning of December-end of February). We identified a threshold response of bird mortality in relation to extreme wind events above which birds experienced consistent increased mortality, which was especially evident in the heavier winter e.g. 2013/2014). Our methodological approach provides insights on the definition of the number of extreme wind events that should serve as a warning signal to activate the coordination of local administrations and volunteers to anticipate the occurrence of mass-mortality events under future climatic scenarios.

Benthic diatoms as indicators of herbicide toxicity in rivers - A new SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR(herbicides)) index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Traits; Biomonitoring; Herbicide tolerance; Diatoms; Field effects	BARRIER-REEF CATCHMENTS; EVENT FLOW CONDITIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CYCLOTELLA-MENEGHINIANA; SCENEDESMUS-VACUOLATUS; AGRICULTURAL STREAMS; RELATIVE SENSITIVITY; PERIPHYTIC DIATOMS; LATES-CALCARIFER; PULSE EXPOSURE	Benthic diatom communities are used widely as indicators of river health due to their rapid response to changes in water quality. The ability for diatom-based indices to detect eutrophication has been well documented; however, an index designed specifically to detect herbicide impacts is yet to be established. This is required as herbicide contamination of rivers is common in agricultural regions and poses a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems. This study developed a new biomonitoring index (SPEAR(herbicides)) using benthic diatom communities to detect the toxic impacts of herbicides in rivers, and tested it across 14 rivers in the Great Barrier Reef catchment area, Australia. The new index uses diatom species traits to classify diatoms as either sensitive or tolerant to herbicides and calculates the fraction of sensitive taxa within a sample. The SPEAR(herbicides) index showed a decline in herbicide sensitive diatoms with increasing herbicide toxicity of the sites. The impacts of herbicide toxicity on the diatom community were only apparent after the wet season when aqueous herbicide concentrations typically peak and diatoms were able to recover during the dry season when herbicide concentrations were lower. SPEAR(herbicides) values had a negative relationship with the percentage of grazing and cropping in catchments but had a positive relationship with the percentage of conservation in catchments. SPEAR(herbicides) also had a negative relationship with co-occurring potential stressors such as nutrients and total suspended solids.

Recovery of benthic communities from small-scale shrimp trawling: Evidence from using ecological indices over a short temporal scale	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Environmental impact; Trawling; Benthos; Ecological indices; AMBI; M-AMBI; Saudi Arabia; Arabian Gulf	SEABED HABITATS; DISTURBANCE; IMPACT; SEDIMENT; FAUNA; DIVERSITY; FISHERIES; DEPLETION; QUALITY; WATERS	Mobile fishing gears are responsible of various direct effects on benthic communities. The most important (in volume and value) fishery in Saudi waters of the Arabian Gulf is the 6-month trawl season for the green tiger shrimp. The fleet is composed of hundreds of artisanal boats carrying out short-duration tows of small trawls. To study the impact of this trawl season on local benthic communities, two different methodologies were adopted in three areas of different trawling intensities. The first study design was aimed at the seasonal effect and the second design examined the immediate impact after the pass of a trawl. Both studies were evaluated using univariate ecological indicators (richness, diversity, AMBI, M-AMBI) and the multivariate species composition. The seasonal study revealed a cyclic dynamics of the benthic assemblages. Most of the univariate ecological descriptors decreased during the trawling season and increased during the off-season while species composition undertook a round trip in multivariate space, thus supporting the conclusion that the impact of trawling on the benthic ecosystem during the shrimp season is reverted during the trawl ban. Although our results confirm predictions of synthetic statistical models, they also show that the impact of trawling on benthic communities strongly depend on the existence of a trawl ban period.

Geocaching, an outdoor game that uses Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled devices to find hidden containers (geocaches) in certain locations, has been seldom used as a data source to assess CES. However, contrary to other crowdsourcing databases, geocaching allows to associate particular experiences to accurate locations. Furthermore, databases generated by geocachers provide an ideal case to compare revealed preferences (the frequency of visits to a specific geocache) with stated preferences (a posteriori evaluation of each location). We tested the relevance of geocaching databases as CES indicators using a dataset of 50 818 geocaches spread across continental Portugal, over eight land-use classes, with a focus on the montado (a high nature value farmland found in Southwestern Iberian Peninsula). We found that site visitation frequency was related with its availability, showing no revealed preference towards any land use. However, site evaluations by geocachers, measured either through the number of words describing the experience, the number of photos taken, or the number of votes for "favourite geocaches", showed marked differences in their stated preferences, with higher appreciation for open land uses in general, and montado in particular, especially when compared to other forested landscapes. Our results may contribute to the design of regional development and land-use management policies of this threatened landscape, since they show the system's strong potential as CES provider and, consequently, promoter of diversification of activities.

The current study examined the relationship between contamination loads, hydrological and morphological patterns and the distribution of macroinvertebrates and epipelic diatoms in the middle Parana River system to form part of the development of a pollution monitoring framework. Seven sampling sites were selected over three main river areas predominantly impacted by sewage effluent and agriculture activities. The sampling areas were the Parana, Colastine and Las Conchas rivers. In order to prevent dilution of pollutants and macroinvertebrate drift, sampling was performed during the base flow period of 2015 to determine pollution contaminated stretches of the river system. Results indicated that metals have been accumulated in river bottom sediments as a consequence of anthropogenic land use activities. Macroinvertebrate and epipelic diatom assemblages as bioindicators of anthropogenic pollution were evident downstream of urban sewage effluent discharges causing higher concentrations of Cr, As and Ni than the permitted threshold levels for bottom sediment.

Assessing Microbial Community Patterns During Incipient Soil Formation From Basalt	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; ASSEMBLY PROCESSES; BACTERIAL DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; CONVERGENCE; TAXA; DISTRIBUTIONS; ECOLOGY; HABITAT; IMPACT	Microbial dynamics drive the biotic machinery of early soil evolution. However, integrated knowledge of microbial community establishment, functional associations, and community assembly processes in incipient soil is lacking. This study presents a novel approach of combining microbial phylogenetic profiling, functional predictions, and community assembly processes to analyze drivers of microbial community establishment in an emerging soil system. Rigorous submeter sampling of a basalt-soil lysimeter after 2 years of irrigation revealed that microbial community colonization patterns and associated soil parameters were depth dependent. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated the presence of diverse bacterial and archaeal phyla, with high relative abundance of Actinomyceles on the surface and a consistently high abundance of Proteobacteria (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) at all depths. Despite depth-dependent variation in community diversity, predicted functional gene analysis suggested that microbial metabolisms did not differ with depth, thereby suggesting redundancy in functional potential throughout the system. Null modeling revealed that microbial community assembly patterns were predominantly governed by variable selection. The relative influence of variable selection decreased with depth, indicating unique and relatively harsh environmental conditions near the surface and more benign conditions with depth. Additionally, community composition near the center of the domain was influenced by high levels of dispersal, suggesting that spatial processes interact with deterministic selection imposed by the environment. These results suggest that for oligotrophic systems, there are major differences in the length scales of variation between vertical and horizontal dimensions with the vertical dimension dominating variation in physical, chemical, and biological features.

Recently, the archipelago has been hit by bleaching events for two consecutive years (summers of 2016-2017). Shallow coral communities have been reported as especially affected. In this study, using underwater transects, we assessed the status of shallow coral reef communities in Kume Island, at seven distinct locations in Shimajiri Bay, following reports from local fishermen and divers of heavy bleaching across the bay. Our data and analyses revealed that the benthic environment in the bay has algae as the main component, with an average coral cover of only 7.2%. Branching coral colonies, which used to be the most common morphology in Kume Island reefs, accounted for just 7.6% of the total coral cover. Notably, the genus Acropora was almost completely absent from our transects, although its recent presence was confirmed by dead colonies making up 4.12% of total transect coverage, suggesting that restoration efforts focused on this genus might be possible in the future. In order for these to be successful, however, a better understanding of the environmental situation at Kume Island is required, including the effects of human activities on coral reef communities.

Recent range expansion in Australian hummock grasses (Triodia) inferred using genotyping-by-sequencing	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Arid zone; Australia; biogeography; chloroplast; divergence dating; genotyping-by-sequencing; Poaceae; range expansion; SNPs; Triodia basedowii species complex	ARID ZONE; HETERONOTIA-BINOEI; SPECIES COMPLEX; DIVERSIFICATION; EVOLUTION; CLIMATE; HISTORY; LIZARD; BIOGEOGRAPHY; PLIOCENE	The Australian arid zone (AAZ) has undergone aridification and the formation of vast sandy deserts since the mid-Miocene. Studies on AAZ organisms, particularly animals, have shown patterns of mesic ancestry, persistence in rocky refugia and range expansions in arid lineages. There has been limited molecular investigation of plants in the AAZ, particularly of taxa that arrived in Australia after the onset of aridification. Here we investigate populations of the widespread AAZ grass Triodia basedowii to determine whether there is evidence for a recent range expansion, and if so, its source and direction. We also undertake a dating analysis for the species complex to which T. basedowii belongs, in order to place its diversification in relation to changes in AAZ climate and landscapes. We analyse a genomic single nucleotide polymorphism data set from 17 populations of T. basedowii in a recently developed approach for detecting the signal and likely origin of a range expansion. We also use alignments from existing and newly sequenced plastomes from across Poaceae for analysis in BEAST to construct fossil-calibrated phylogenies. Across a range of sampling parameters and outgroups, we detected a consistent signal of westward expansion for T. basedowii, originating in central or eastern Australia. Divergence time estimation indicates that Triodia began to diversify in the late Miocene (crown 7.0-8.8 million years (Ma)), and the T. basedowii complex began to radiate during the Pleistocene (crown 1.4-2.0 Ma). This evidence for range expansion in an arid-adapted plant is consistent with similar patterns in AAZ animals and likely reflects a general response to the opening of new habitat during aridification. Radiation of the T. basedowii complex through the Pleistocene has been associated with preferences for different substrates, providing an explanation why only one lineage is widespread across sandy deserts. Much of Australia is covered by an arid zone that has developed over the last 15 million years (Ma). The unique flora that inhabits that arid zone includes plants that have responded differently (expanding or contracting their ranges) to climate and landscape changes. Here we show that one widespread desert grass, Triodia basedowii, has recently (within the last 2 Ma) expanded across the arid zone. Surprisingly, we find evidence of an expansion origin in central or eastern Australia, while the bulk of the diversity in the group to which T.basedowii belongs exists in western Australia.

It remains unclear, however, how consistent, and therefore potentially predictable, such patterns of local adaptation are. One approach to this question is to measure patterns of local differentiation in functional traits and plasticity levels in invasive species in multiple regions. Finding consistent patterns of local differentiation in replicate regions suggests that these patterns are adaptive. Further, this outcome indicates that the invading species likely responds predictably to selection along environmental gradients, even though standing genetic variation is likely to have been reduced during introduction. We studied local differentiation in the invasive annual plant Erodium cicutarium in two invaded regions, California and Chile. We collected seeds from across strong gradients in precipitation and temperature in Mediterranean-climate parts of the two regions (10 populations per region). We grew seeds from maternal families from these populations through two generations and exposed the second generation to contrasting levels of water and nutrient availability. We measured growth, flowering time and leaf functional traits across these treatments to obtain trait means and plasticity measures. We found strong differentiation among populations in all traits. Plants from drier environments flowered earlier, were less plastic in flowering time and reached greater size in all treatments. Correlations among traits within regions suggested a coordinated evolutionary response along environmental gradients associated with growing season length. There was little divergence in traits and trait intercorrelations between regions, but strongly parallel divergence in traits within regions. Similar, statistically consistent patterns of local trait differentiation across two regions suggest that local adaptation to environmental gradients has aided the spread of this invasive species, and that the formation of ecotypes in newly invaded environments has been relatively consistent and predictable. Originally from Europe, Erodium cicutarium (redstem storksbill) spread across both North and South America. The plant grows in diverse habitats from deserts to mountaintops. Has it evolved to grow differently in different habitats during these invasions, and do such differences help it spread? By experimentally growing seeds from many sites in California and Chile, this study discovered strong local genetic differences: plants from dry areas live fast and die young', flowering weeks earlier than plants from wetter areas. Patterns of local differences among Chilean populations matched those in California, suggesting this species evolves in predictable ways as it spreads.

Some recent studies have used a network approach to investigate the interaction of epiphytes with host phorophytes at the community level. However, knowledge on commensalistic epiphyte-phorophyte network structure still lags behind with regard to other biotic interaction networks. Our goal was to provide a more complete overall perspective on commensalistic epiphyte-phorophyte interaction and its placement with respect to other better studied mutualistic interactions. We hypothesized that the intensity of the fitness effect of the different types of biotic interactions would determine the degree of specialization of the interacting organisms. Thus, commensalistic epiphyte-phorophyte interactions would have lower specialization than mutualistic interactions. We compiled and analysed the structural properties (nestedness, network specialization and modularity) of 12 commensalistic epiphyte-phorophyte networks and compared them with the same metrics to 11 ant-myrmecophyte, 86 pollination and 13 seed dispersal mutualistic networks. Epiphyte-phorophyte networks were nested and modular with regard to the corresponding null models and had greater nestedness than mutualistic networks, whereas specialization and modularity were significantly lower. Commensalistic epiphyte-phorophyte networks of interactions are both nested and modular, and hence, are structured in a similar way to most other types of networks that involve co-evolutionary interactions. Nevertheless, the nature and intensity of the ecological processes involved in the generation of these patterns is likely to differ. The lower values of modularity in commensalistic epiphyte-phorophyte networks are probably due to the low levels of specialization and the lack of co-evolutionary processes between the interacting partners. The goal of the study is to provide an overall perspective on epiphyte-phorophyte networks and their placement with respect to the networks of other more studied biotic interactions. The results showed that epiphyte-phorophyte networks are structured similarly to most other types of networks that involve co-evolutionary interactions as they were, in most cases, significantly nested and modular. It also confirmed that the interaction between vascular epiphytes and host phorophytes is predominantly generalist.

Competition, seed dispersal and hunting: what drives germination and seedling survival in an Afrotropical forest?	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Competition; plant-animal interactions; seed-dispersal; seed-germination; seed-predation	NATURAL COMMUNITIES; TROPICAL FOREST; TREE SEEDLINGS; RECRUITMENT; CONSEQUENCES; DEFAUNATION; DIVERSITY; PREDATION; DYNAMICS; PRIMATES	Disentangling the contributions of different processes that influence plant recruitment, such as competition and seed dispersal, is important given the increased human-mediated changes in tropical forest ecosystems. Previous studies have shown that seedling communities in an Afrotropical rainforest in southeastern Nigeria are strongly affected by the loss of important seed-dispersing primates, including Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes elioti) and drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus). Here we study how germination and survival of tree seedlings are affected by competition and reduced seed dispersal in three contiguous forest reserves, in southeastern Nigeria, with similar mature tree species composition and structure. We use an experimental design aimed at manipulating the effect of competition among seedlings in three protected and three hunted sites within the reserves. We use a total of sixty 5 x 5 m plots of three types: plots cleared of all seedlings, plots selectively cleared of all primate-dispersed seedlings and control plots. All seedlings were identified, measured, assigned to dispersal mode and tagged, and after 1 year we evaluated survival, mortality and new recruits. We found that in hunted sites germination of abiotically dispersed species was over four times higher in cleared plots compared to control plots, whereas germination of primate-dispersed species was the same, which indicated that dispersal limitation was the dominant force in seedling recruitment in hunted sites. This was supported by the fact that the germination of all dispersal modes in the selectively cleared plots in protected sites was similar to the control plots in the same sites, but germination of abiotically dispersed species was significantly lower than in cleared plots in hunted sites. Competition among seedlings was mostly evident from the fact that 75 % more seedlings of primate-dispersed species germinated in cleared compared to control plots in protected sites. We conclude that inter-seedling competition may be irrelevant to seedling recruitment in hunted sites, where dispersal limitation appears to be a much stronger force shaping the seedling plant community, and thus hunting indirectly reverses the importance of competition and dispersal limitation in structuring seedling communities. The dynamics in the seedling community in the forest understory play a central role in directing plant recruitment and the future composition and structure of the forest. In tropical forests large mammals have an important role as seed dispersers, but many of these mammals are threatened by human activities, including hunting. This experimental study in Nigerian rainforests reveals that hunting indirectly reverses the importance of inter-seedling competition and dispersal limitation. Thus, the loss of large mammals, such as apes and monkeys, is likely to change the future of the forests.

Ancestral remnants or peripheral segregates? Phylogenetic relationships of two narrowly endemic Euphrasia species (Orobanchaceae) from the eastern European Alps	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Alps; endemics; Euphrasia; peripheral segregate; polyploidy	ALPINE POPULATIONS; MOLECULAR EVIDENCE; POLYPLOID COMPLEX; GENOME SIZE; EVOLUTION; AFLP; SCROPHULARIACEAE; INFERENCE; ORIGIN; AREAS	Endemism in mountain ranges is considered to be the result of a number of factors, including restriction to refugia during Pleistocene climate fluctuations. However, isolation in glacial refugia cannot explain the origin of narrowly endemic taxa restricted to formerly heavily glaciated areas. Here, we investigate the phylogeny of two narrowly endemic species, Euphrasia inopinata and E. sinuata (Orobanchaceae), found exclusively in formerly heavily glaciated areas of the eastern European Alps. As both species are diploid and very similar to the widespread (allo)polyploid E. minima, we test whether the restricted distributions of E. inopinata and E. sinuata are relictual, i.e. the two species are ancestral diploid remnants of a polyploid complex, or whether they are derived, i.e. the two species are peripheral segregates of a more widespread diploid. Based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprint data it is shown that E. inopinata and E. sinuata, whose diploid ploidy level is confirmed for all analysed individuals via flow cytometry, are phylogenetically closely related to diploid E. alpina s. l. (series Alpinae) instead of E. minima (series Parviflorae). In addition, there is no evidence that these two diploid species participated in the formation of allotetraploid E. minima. Thus, E. inopinata and E. sinuata are interpreted as peripheral segregates of the widespread E. alpina s. l. Shifts in pollination system from allogamy in E. alpina s. l. to autogamy in E. inopinata and E. sinuata, genetic drift in small populations and geographic isolation at the periphery of the range of E. alpina s. str. probably contributed to the morphological and ecological differentiation of E. inopinata and E. sinuata. The origin of range-restricted diploid species confined to formerly heavily glaciated areas is little understood. Asuitable system to address this question is a group of two autogamous eyebright species, Euphrasia inopinata and E.sinuata, each known only from a few sites in the eastern European Alps. Previous hypotheses suggested these species to be either remnants of the diploid ancestor of the equally autogamous but widespread and polyploid E.minima or as peripheral segregates of a more widespread allogamous diploid species.

Measurements of soil pH may be used, however there are not sufficient measurements available to map soil pH nationwide on site level. Instead we developed a soil pH map based on vegetation data. Location Natural terrestrial areas in The Netherlands. Methods 271,693 vegetation plots were used to estimate average soil pH per plot with indicator values, based on field measurements, of plant species. By spatial interpolation average pH values between the plots, with the soil type, groundwater table and vegetation management type as ancillary explanatory variables we created a soil pH map. The map covers all terrestrial nature areas (all areas that are not built up areas, agricultural areas and infrastructural areas) in the Netherlands with a map resolution of 25 x 25 m(2) raster cells. Results The predicted pH of the map varied between 3.0 and 8.6 with standard errors between 0.13 and 0.93. Most of the standard errors range from 0.4 to 0.55, with an average just below 0.5 pH unit. Cross-validation shows that for 33% the difference between observed and predicted is between -0.1 and 0.1 pH-unit and for 83% the difference is between -0.5 and 0.5 pH-unit. Validation shows that the pH map is unbiased (mean error is almost zero), accurate (root mean squared error is 0.64) and nicely captures spatial patterns (r = 0.77). We applied the pH map to assess the impact of acidification on the abiotic quality of nature areas in the Netherlands. Conclusions The model fit in the predicted soil pH is in good resulting in a low standard error and a high correlation. The measures taken to prevent acidic deposition causing further acidifying of nature areas can be considered as successful.	[Wamelink, G. W. Wieger; Walvoort, Dennis J.

As part of biodiversity conservation efforts, grassland variation needs to be investigated at different spatial scales. We aimed to assess the landscape mosaic variation that occurred between 1988 and 2015 in the higher Mediterranean mountains. We investigated the recovery or land-degradation processes related to land use change, the effects of site condition, the impacts on grassland mosaic heterogeneity, and the threats to biodiversity. Location Sibillini Mountains (central Italy), over 1,650 m a.s.l. Methods We used two-step object-based supervised classification on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images to analyze changes in landscape patterns and vegetation cover on formerly low-intensity pastures, by assessing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index variation between 1988 and 2015. Twenty percent of the polygons obtained from segmentation were visually interpreted and assigned to five land cover classes. We generated a land use transition matrix and used Fourier Transforms to detect trends in variation of landscape mosaics and fragmentation. Results We observed prominent dynamics of the grassland mosaic leading to the homogenization of its structure through decreasing patch heterogeneity, especially on south-facing slopes. Grasslands shifted from open communities to dense pastures, with a reduction of scree and spread of tall grasses. The former trend could be understood as a recovery process reverting screes to conditions in equilibrium with local landform and climatic features, while the invasion of tall grasses is a land-degradation process that might lead to local species extinction and loss of habitat connectivity. Conclusions Pronounced changes in the large-scale landscape characteristics, mainly due to land use changes, of which scientists and managers of protected areas are not fully aware, are underway in the top mountain sectors of the study area.

We asked the following questions: (a) What is the composition of the seed bank and above-ground vegetation? (b) How do they develop over the course of succession within the two different restoration approaches? (c) What is the representation of target and undesirable species in the seed bank and above-ground vegetation? and (d) Could the seed bank serve as the source for target vegetation restoration? Location Trebon Basin, Czech Republic. Methods Three successional stages and two types of restoration approaches were considered. Bray-Curtis similarity was used for describing the similarity between above-ground vegetation and the seed bank. Representation of target (dry sandy grassland), desirable (woodland, wetland, mesic grassland) and undesirable (synanthropic) species was assessed. Results The type of restoration approach exhibited stronger effects on the above-ground vegetation than on the seed bank. The similarity between the seed bank and above-ground vegetation decreased during succession. Undesirable species formed the dominant species group in the seed bank regardless of successional stage and the type of restoration approach. Target species were represented especially in the above-ground vegetation of young successional stages. Only half of the number of target species appeared in the seed bank in comparison to above-ground vegetation and their number further rapidly decreased in older stages of succession. Conclusions The result showed that the seed bank of sand pits could be considered as a potential resource mainly for synanthropic species, but it cannot serve as the only source for the eventual restoration of the target vegetation of an open sandy dry grassland after potential clearing, once it becomes overgrown by forest. Consequently, maintaining young successional stages is desirable if we wish to support species typical of dry sandy grassland.

What is the relationship between soil extractable nitrogen and plant diversity in sandy and infertile soils? How does cattle grazing affect soil extractable nitrogen and how might this indirectly impact plant diversity via the N-plant diversity relationship? Location Grazed coastal grasslands on Naushon Island, off of Cape Cod, MA, USA. Methods We surveyed summer vegetation from 2014 to 2017 and analyzed soils for extractable nitrogen (N) in two grazed grasslands on Naushon Island. We also set up cattle enclosures and exclosures to manipulate grazing pressure and test how cattle grazing influenced plant diversity (species richness and Shannon's diversity) and extractable NH4+ and NO3-. In the enclosure experiment, cattle were enclosed for up to a week in the mid-summer of 2014, 2015, and 2016. For the exclosure experiment, we excluded cattle from areas from 2014 to 2017. Results In both the enclosure and exclosure experiments, higher grazing pressure corresponded to less negative change of plant species richness and Shannon's diversity from 2014 to 2017. Total extractable N had a weak positive correlation with plant diversity, but increasing extractable NO3- correlated with decreasing species richness (p = 0.001) and Shannon's diversity (p = 0.009). Neither the cattle enclosures nor exclosures were related to soil extractable N. Conclusions Cattle grazing may help prevent or slow losses of plant diversity that are occurring in many coastal grasslands, including Naushon Island. This effect does not seem to be regulated by cattle deposition of N in the soil or the N-plant diversity relationship. Our results of the N-plant diversity relationship differ from the mainstream understanding, perhaps due to Naushon's sandy and infertile soils.

Here, we ask how rotational and continuous grazing influences the composition, diversity, and biomass production of natural grasslands in southern Brazil. Location The study was conducted at four cattle farms within the south Brazilian grassland region (Campos Sulinos), in the upper area of the Camaqua river basin of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods On each farm, grassland that had previously been subjected to continuous grazing (freely grazed by cattle) was divided into two experimental units; one managed by rotational grazing and the other maintained under continuous grazing. In each experimental unit, 14 permanent plots were monitored over six years for species composition and species biomass. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models to evaluate the effects of grazing management strategies on composition dissimilarity, diversity indices, and plant biomass. Results Grasslands under a rotational grazing regime changed steadily over the period of evaluation. Total biomass and species distribution patterns greatly differed from those in plots subjected to continuous grazing, leading to changes in species richness, dominance, and composition, as well as to an increase in overall plant biomass. Conclusions Community changes during the six-year study period as a consequence of the distinct grazing treatments were evident. Grasslands under rotational grazing management benefitted from less selective grazing, enabling a more uniform growth of species within the communities, which in turn were richer at the end of the six-year experiment. In contrast, the proportion of grazing-resistant species or less-consumed species was higher under continuous grazing, where foraging by cattle appears to be more selective. Rotational grazing thus not only leads to higher species richness and diversity, but also to higher primary and, in consequence, secondary productivity.

This also applies to the Caatinga, a unique seasonally dry tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. It is considered one of the most threatened ecosystems of Brazil. To protect semi-arid regions from biodiversity loss, degradation, and desertification, sustainable management practices are urgently needed. However, the effect of different grazing intensities on plant diversity is not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined the effect of different grazing intensities on plant species composition, alpha and beta diversity. Location Vicinity of the Itaparica Reservoir, northeastern Brazil. Methods We assessed the effects of different grazing intensities (high, intermediate, no/low) on species composition, alpha and beta diversity of the tree and shrub, and the herb layer in a Caatinga area. Plant diversity of the tree and shrub layer was assessed on 45 study plots (each 20 m x 20 m), while the diversity of herbs was studied on a subset of 36 plots (four subplots, each 2 m x 2 m). Results In total, we recorded 140 plant taxa including morphospecies. Grazing at high intensities significantly reduced almost all measures of alpha and beta diversity (tree and shrub layer) compared to areas with no or low grazing. In contrast, species composition was not significantly related to grazing but instead to altitude, which serves as an indicator of reduced anthropogenic impact such as slash-and-burn agriculture or tree harvesting. Conclusion Overall, the study results show that the current livestock management has negative effects on plant diversity in Caatinga ecosystems. These results have been incorporated into guidelines provided to regional stakeholders including recommendations for adapted land-management practices that protect and foster the biodiversity of dry forests while sustaining local livelihoods.

Traditionally, species richness has been the most widely used approach, but previous studies suggest that it is one of the least effective. Alternative metrics such as complementarity algorithms have produced better results, for which they have been used in recent conservation studies. In this study, we assessed the performance of a new potential surrogate: rarity indices. Specifically, we tested rarity-weighted richness (RWR), index of summed rarity (ISR) and index of relative rarity (IRR), to determine if they are effective surrogates of biodiversity when solving the minimum-set coverage problem. We tested the rarity indices in 14 datasets spanning varying extents and grains, and found that rarity consistently outperformed species richness, even when accounting for the differences in rarity index performance. In some cases, rarity outperformed the complementarity solution, suggesting that it is a promising alternative surrogate that can be easily tested in situations where conservation action resources are limited. Rarity indices have been seldom assessed for their surrogacy effectiveness, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to test IRR and ISR in this context. Our results justify the need for future studies to elucidate the importance and applicability of rarity indices in conservation planning. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Spatiotemporal dynamics in habitat suitability of a large Arctic herbivore: Environmental heterogeneity is key to a sedentary lifestyle	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Species distribution modelling; Habitat suitability; Seasonality; Climate; Ungulate; Muskox	MUSKOX OVIBOS-MOSCHATUS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; ECOLOGICAL NICHE; SEASONAL-CHANGES; DIET SELECTION; BODY CONDITION; PLANT BIOMASS; SNOW; NITROGEN; MOVEMENT	Quantifying spatial and temporal variation in habitat suitability is crucial to understand changes in animal distribution and to inform conservation and management initiatives, especially for species occupying regions profoundly impacted by climatic and environmental change. A detailed understanding of the environmental conditions shaping seasonal habitat suitability of free-ranging muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), a key species in the Arctic tundra ecosystem, is currently lacking. We applied the maximum entropy modelling algorithm (MaxEnt) to build seasonal species distribution models (SDMs) over four years to quantify variation in habitat suitability in time and space. Suitable habitat was predicted based on location data from 27 GPS-collared adult female muskoxen in northeast Greenland and the spatial distribution of topographic variables and landcover within the study area. Overall, our results highlight distinct seasonal differences in both the spatial extent and distribution of suitable muskox habitat. Suitable space was smallest and spatially most clustered during autumn, and increased in extent and dispersion throughout the snow-covered period until peaking in summer. Nonetheless, the importance of environmental variables influencing habitat suitability was consistent across inter-annual and seasonal scales as habitat suitability was consistently predicted to be highest in vegetated, flat to moderately rugged terrain at low to medium elevation (<500-600 m.a.s.l.) close to the coast (<5-10 km). One year with extraordinary large amounts of snow differed from the general pattern, exhibiting markedly smaller areas of suitable habitat and higher spatial clustering. The results support the notion that adult female muskoxen are able to lead a relatively sedentary lifestyle due to the close proximity of suitable habitats across all seasons. However, above-average snow depths appear to be a potential bottleneck limiting access to suitable habitat, with consequences even beyond the snow-covered season. Our study provides the foundation for assessing potential future changes in habitat suitability and distribution of this key Arctic herbivore. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Semi-natural hay meadows are among the most important sources of flower resources for pollinators, but the resources are strongly affected by the timing of mowing. Management recommendations for hay meadows often prescribe late mowing on order to allow undisturbed flowering during most of the summer. Traditional practices, however, often include also earlier mowing. We investigate the link between the temporal variation of flower resources and traditional mowing practices of semi-natural hay meadows in a low-intensity agricultural landscape in Romania. In early August, we botanically surveyed meadows that were cut early, intermediately, or late in the season. We recorded all herb species, their phenological stage, and the number of reproductive units of each species. Data were analysed using DCA, LM and GLM. Plant species richness and composition are not affected by the time of mowing, but different sets of species flower in semi-natural grasslands with different mowing regimes. In August the proportion of species flowering and flower density are highest in the early-mown meadows due to re-flowering after mowing. Analyses of phenological stages indicate that late-mown meadows are the main pollen and nectar sources in July, whereas meadows mown early are the main resource from August to the end of the season. The results demonstrate that for pollinator conservation, heterogeneous mowing times within a landscape need to be encouraged when possible, and that strict focus on late mowing may lead to shortage of flower resources late in the summer. Studies of low-intensity agriculture has a great potential for learning about management methods that can be used in other parts of the world where traditional practices have been lost. Such studies can thereby contribute with important knowledge to manage global pollinator loss. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Some plant species have been shown to be important in community structure using network metrics; however, the roles of plant taxa, particularly rare species, are not well understood. Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcheri), a threatened endemic of Great Lakes shorelines, flowers late-June to early-August, when other floral resources may be less abundant or unavailable. We performed 10 min insect visitor observations on all insect pollinated plants in 44-10 m by 10 m plots at Sturgeon Bay, northern lower MI, USA, during C. pitcheri flowering and recorded plant species, number of open flowers, species of insect visiting, and number of visits by insects. Pitcher's thistle received 18.2% of all 600 recorded visits, 61.1% more than the next most visited plant. Pitcher's thistle also received visits from 22 of the 59 different insect species in the network, twice as many as the next most visited plant species. Species-level network analysis metrics showed that Pitcher's thistle was most generalized, with greatest species strength, betweenness, and connectance scores of any other plant taxon, demonstrating network topological importance. Pitcher's thistle received significantly more insect visits relative to its abundance that did any other plant species. Therefore, conservation of C pitcheri and of other rare taxa, particularly in xeric and low diversity systems, can be significant beyond species-level management and may extend to conservation of the plant-insect community.

Home range and habitat data for Hispaniolan mammals challenge assumptions for conservation management	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Dominican Republic; Evidence-based conservation; Hutia; Kernel density estimate; Solenodon; Telemetry	POPULATION-DENSITY; HUTIA PLAGIODONTIA; SELECTION; RODENTIA; CAPROMYIDAE; EXTINCTION; HEDGEHOGS; HISTORY; BIOLOGY; FOREST	Conservation decision-making for threatened species in human-modified landscapes requires detailed knowledge about spatial ecology, but robust data derived from tracking individual animals are often unavailable, with management decisions potentially based on unreliable anecdotal data. Existing data are limited for Hispaniola's two threatened nonvolant land mammals, the Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium) and Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus), with assumptions that hutias are better able to tolerate landscape disturbance. We collected spatial behaviour and habitat use data for Hispaniolan mammals during a multi-year field programme across undisturbed and modified habitats in southwestern Dominican Republic, using GPS units for hutias (11 individuals) and radiotelemetry for solenodons (22 individuals). Although significant differences exist in hutia home range estimates between different GPS error derivation strategies and estimated terrestrial/arboreal behaviour scenarios (95% KDE means = 23,582-28,612 m(2)), hutias almost exclusively use forest under all estimates (mean observations in forest across all strategies/scenarios = 90.3%, total range = 69.1-100%). Solenodons have larger estimated home ranges (95% KDE mean = 156,700 m(2)), with differences between wet and dry season estimates, and show much more variation in habitat use than hutias within the same landscape; animals regularly use both forested and modified habitats, being observed most frequently in forest (mean = 74.0%, range = 13.0-99.1%) but also occurring regularly in pasture (mean = 15.9%, range = 0-80.0%) and cropland (mean = 7.7%, range = 0-62.0%), and den in all three habitats. This new baseline on Hispaniolan mammal spatial ecology challenges anecdotal data, and suggests solenodons may be better able to tolerate disturbance and persist in modified landscapes.

However, some patches of original riparian vegetation are protected by traditional beliefs as 'Sacred Groves'. We assessed the role of Sacred Groves in maintaining landscape-scale bird assemblages by conducting 144 1-h point counts, distributed over 24 plots in eastern Guinea-Bissau. The plots were situated in three riparian habitat types with different levels of human modification (Sacred Grove, Young Secondary Forest, Annual Cultures) and the adjacent Wooded Savanna. We accumulated 4572 records of 174 species and compared total species richness, composition, and functional traits among the four habitat types. At the plot level, species richness was higher in Wooded Savannas and Annual Cultures compared to Secondary Forests and Sacred Groves. Bird communities in Wooded Savannas were similar to those in Annual Cultures and differed the most from those of Sacred Groves. Bird community composition in Young Secondary Forests was similar to that in Annual Cultures but showed a shift towards the community composition found in Sacred Groves. Certain traits were strongly specific to habitat type. For example, Sacred Groves were characterized by a high number of forest specialists and insectivorous birds. Our results suggest that the rapid successional dynamics in riparian habitats enable disturbance tolerant forest species to recolonize fallow areas after a relatively short period of time. However, Sacred Groves hold a distinct avifauna and their conservation may therefore be crucial for forest specialist species and the re-establishment of bird assemblages in fallow riparian areas. Our findings also stress the importance of respecting and strengthening traditional forms of nature protection. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Evaluating alternatives to reduce whale entanglements in commercial Dungeness Crab fishing gear	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article							EUBALAENA-GLACIALIS; MARINE MAMMALS; PUBLISHED ARTICLE; HUMPBACK WHALES; M. STELFOX; J. HUDGINS; DECISION; REPTILES; ELASMOBRANCHS; MANAGEMENT	Since 2014, the U.S. West Coast has experienced a sudden increase in reported whale entanglements with commercial fishing gear. The increase has been particularly acute in reported entanglements between Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and commercial Dungeness crab gear. The current rate of entanglements is alarming and could trigger consequences for the responsible fisheries under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA); it seems likely that some change in the social-ecological status quo will be necessary to avoid significant harm to either the fishing community or the whale population. Here, we compare management alternatives to reduce entanglements, thereby reducing conflicts between whales and fishermen, scoring these alternatives according to estimated cost to fishermen, likely technical effectiveness, and anticipated reaction of fishermen in response to the change. We analyze these alternatives quantitatively using a Multi-Criterion Decision Analysis, and provide the analytical code as a decision-aid tool for managers and policy makers to use when contemplating changes to the West Coast commercial Dungeness fishery. We find a small number of high-ranking policy options; most prominently among these are Galvanic Timed Releases, which minimize the time that crab-pot lines are in the water and thus reduce the likelihood of entanglement. In addition, we include in an appendix a detailed list of regulations affecting the commercial Dungeness fishery, thereby providing both a substantive and procedural roadmap for reducing fishery-whale conflict.

Livestock depredation by large carnivores in northern Botswana	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Livestock depredation; Conflict; Compensation; Panthera leo; Crocuta crocuta; Herding	LIONS PANTHERA-LEO; CONSERVATION AREA; CONFLICT; PATTERNS; AFRICA; RESERVE; LOSSES; SIZE	Human-carnivore conflict is a leading cause of large carnivore declines and minimizing these conflicts is vital to maintaining viable carnivore populations. Often, however, conservation agencies and governments do not have a proper understanding of conflicts prior to establishing mitigation programs or are unable to collect the appropriate data to verify claims of livestock loss. We investigated livestock depredation events in the Eastern Panhandle of the Okavango Delta, Botswana between October 2014 and December 2016 and compared these investigations with concurrent Problem Animal Control (PAC) information from the Botswana Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) compensation program. Only animals killed in livestock enclosures or while being herded qualify for reimbursement through the compensation program, but DWNP is typically unable to verify claims. We identified wildlife sign at the depredation event location and collected information from the livestock owner to determine the species responsible for the attack, time of the attack, the livestock lost, and the husbandry methods employed. In total, 116 livestock were killed and 13 more injured in 102 confirmed wild carnivore attacks. Most (90%) attacks occurred while livestock were unattended and freely grazing in multi-use, communal areas. Cows, oxen (castrated male cows) and calves (Bos taurus and B. t. indicus) were killed most often and African lions (Panthera leo) were responsible for 74% of investigated attacks, while African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) accounted for 13%, leopard (Panthera pardus) 8%, and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) 5%. Valuation of verified losses totaled -$30,000 over the study period. There were 50% more events reported to DWNP for compensation than we confirmed through independent investigations. In its current form, the compensation program does not seem sustainable, nor does it enable the verification of claims. While compensation programs should not be abandoned, programs designed to provide monetary reimbursement for losses caused by predators should require timely reporting and in-depth investigation of depredation events. Additional conflict mitigation strategies should target increasing livestock husbandry methods in the area, with a specific focus on herding. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Patterns of acoustical activity of bats prior to and 10 years after WNS on Fort Drum Army Installation, New York	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Acoustic monitoring; Myotis lucifugus; Myotis septentrionalis; Myotis sodalis; Relative activity; White-nose syndrome	WHITE-NOSE SYNDROME; BROWN BAT; MYOTIS; FATALITIES; SELECTION; VIRGINIA; CAPTURE; DISEASE; IMPACT	Previous acoustic surveys, netting, and count data have shown that overall bat activity patterns have shifted among most species between pre- and post-white-nose syndrome (WNS) years in much of North America where WNS has occurred. However, the significance of these changes is based on the species-specific susceptibility to WNS. We used acoustically recorded echolocation passes obtained at Fort Drum, New York to describe changes in bat activity pre-WNS (2004-2007) to post-WNS (2008-2018). We examined seasonal and yearly changes in bat activity as they relate to the presence of WNS at hibernacula near (<25 km) Fort Drum. A priori, we expected that overall activity for communal hibernating species would be less in years following WNS, and migratory bats or those hibernating bats that are less affected by WNS would show no response or a positive response, due to niche relaxation/competitive release. Our results indicated both an overall and seasonal decrease in activity for Myotis spp. post-WNS. For WNS-susceptible species, our results reflect the high level of mortality in regional winter hibernacula post-WNS and possibly variable reproductive effort and recruitment thereafter. Although migratory bats did show increases in post-WNS activity throughout the summer, we found little evidence that community displacement was occurring on a nightly level by any species. The continuous spread of WNS across North America has had strong negative effects on bat populations of affected species, and our research identifies how individual species (both impacted and non-impacted) respond to WNS.

Insect pest consumption by bats in macadamia orchards established by molecular diet analyses	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Fragment analyses; IPM; Molecular diet analyses; Bat; Ecosystem service; Agriculture	FREE-TAILED BATS; TADARIDA-BRASILIENSIS; ECONOMIC VALUE; HIGH-ALTITUDE; SOUTH-AFRICA; SERVICE; CROP; HETEROPTERA; VEGETATION; PREDATOR	The diet of insectivorous bat species is difficult to study and the least invasive tool to gain information on these predators' foraging preferences is the study of their faecal pellets. The aim of this study was to determine whether bats consumed insect pest species in macadamia orchards, with the additional goal of incentivising farmers to adopt a more integrated pest management approach (IPM). We used a molecular approach to provide insight into insectivorous bat diet, analysing pellets with fluorescent-labelled and species-specific primers (COI). Faecal pellets were collected from captured individuals or from trays installed underneath bathouses and roosts between July 2015 and April 2017 in the Levubu region, Limpopo, South Africa. Four of the main insect pests, two moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and two stinkbug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) species, were collected for species-specific primer development and assay optimisation. We extracted DNA from the faecal pellets and amplified the target regions of the four target pest species present. To verify the results of the fragment analyses we also sequenced all PCR products. All the species or families of bats from which pellets were collected foraged on at least one of the four major insect pests, with insect pest sequences obtained and confirmed from 57 out of 103 samples (55%). Bats consumed insect pests throughout the macadamia growing seasons and are much more generalist and presumably opportunistic feeders than previously assumed. Nearly all species and families of bats analysed foraged on both the Lepidopteran and Hemipteran insect pest species. In conclusion, bats appear to be important for pest control and we suggest that farmers should maintain or restore (semi-) natural vegetation inside and adjacent to their farms. Adding water sources and roosting opportunities, and minimizing pesticide treatments may furthermore promote bat activity. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major, Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula), mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked conifer stands.

Biodiversity conservation could therefore be a critical aspect of climate mitigation policies. There is, however, limited understanding of the role of individual species for this relationship, which could aid in focusing conservation efforts and forest management planning. This study characterizes the functional specialization and redundancy for 95% of all tree species (basal area weighted percentage) in a diverse tropical forest in the central Congo Basin and relates this to species' abundance, contribution to aboveground carbon, and maximum size. Functional characterization is based on a set of traits related to resource acquisition (wood density, specific leaf area, leaf carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content, and leaf stable carbon isotope composition). We show that within both mixed and monodominant tropical forest ecosystems, the highest functional specialization and lowest functional redundancy are solely found in rare tree species and significantly more in rare species holding large-sized individuals. Rare species cover the entire range of low and high functional redundancy, contributing both unique and redundant functions. Loss of species supporting functional redundancy could be buffered by other species in the community, including more abundant species. This is not the case for species supporting high functional specialization and low functional redundancy, which would need specific conservation attention. In terms of tropical forest management planning, we argue that specific conservation of large-sized trees is imperative for long-term maintenance of ecosystem functioning.

Within the genus Strobilanthes (Acanthaceae), which includes more than 50 periodical species, Strobilanthes flexicaulis on Okinawa Island, Japan, flowers gregariously every 6years. We investigated the life history of S.flexicaulis in other regions and that of closely related species together with their molecular phylogeny to reveal the evolutionary origin of periodical mass flowering. S.flexicaulis on Taiwan Island was found to be a polycarpic perennial with no mass flowering and, in the Yaeyama Islands, Japan, a monocarpic perennial with no mass flowering. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that a polycarpic perennial was the ancestral state in this whole group including S.flexicaulis and the closely related species. No distinctive genetic differentiation was found in S.flexicaulis among all three life histories (polycarpic perennial, monocarpic perennial, and periodical plant). These results suggest that among S.flexicaulis, the periodical mass flowering on Okinawa Island had evolved from the polycarpic perennial on Taiwan Island via the monocarpic perennial in the Yaeyama Islands. Thus, the evolution of life histories could have taken at the level of local populations within a species.

Here we examine the effect of warming and its interactions with resource availability on the population dynamics of the pyralid moth Plodia interpunctella, populations of which normally show generation cycles, a consequence of strong and asymmetric age-related competition. Warming by 3 degrees C above the standard culture temperature led to substantial changes in population density, age structure, and population dynamics. Adult populations were some 50% larger in warmed populations, probably because the reduced fecundity associated with warming leads to reduced larval competition, allowing more larvae to develop to adulthood. Warming also interacted with resource availability to alter population dynamics, with the generation cycles typical of this species breaking down in the 30 degrees populations when standard laboratory diet was provided but not when a reduced nutrient poor diet was used. Warming by 6 degrees led to either rapid extinction or the persistence of populations at low densities for the duration of the experiment. We conclude that even moderate warming can have considerable effects on population structure and dynamics, potentially leading to complete changes in dynamics in some cases. These results are particularly relevant given the large number of economically important species that exhibit generation cycling, in many cases arising from similar mechanisms to those operating in P.interpunctella.

However, the mechanisms underlying recognition and discrimination of genetically related or inbred individuals remain unclear. We investigated whether kinship and inbreeding information is related to low-frequency vocalizations, booms, produced by males during their courtship in the lekking houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata undulata). Based on a captive breeding program where the pedigree of all males is known, we investigated the similarity of booms' acoustic parameters among captive males more or less individually inbred and therefore genetically related with each other. In the wild, we investigated the relationship between the spatial distribution of males within leks and the similarity of acoustic parameters of their booms. In the captive population, we found (a) a relationship between the individual inbreeding level of captive males and their vocalization parameters; (b) that kin share similar frequency and temporal characteristics of their vocalizations. In the wild, we found no evidence for spatial structuring of males based on their acoustic parameters, in agreement with previous genetic findings on the absence of kin association within houbara bustard leks. Overall, our results indicate that genetic information potentially related to both the identity and quality of males is contained in their vocalizations.

However, when diversity estimates are based purely on measures of presence-absence, or even abundance, they do not directly assess in what way focal habitats support the life history needs of individual species making up biological communities. Here, we move beyond naive measures of occurrence and introduce the concept of informed diversity indices which scale estimates of avian species richness and community assemblage by two critical phases of their life cycle: breeding and molt. We tested the validity of the informed diversity concept using bird capture data from multiple locations in northern California and southern Oregon to examine patterns of species richness among breeding, molting, and naive (based solely on occurrence) bird communities at the landscape and local scales using linear regression, community similarity indices, and a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). At the landscape scale, we found a striking pattern of increased species richness for breeding, molting, and naive bird communities further inland and at higher elevations throughout the study area. At the local scale, we found that some sites with species-rich naive communities were in fact species-poor when informed by breeding status, indicating that naive richness may mask more biologically meaningful patterns of diversity. We suggest that land managers use informed diversity estimates instead of naive measures of diversity to identify ecologically valuable wildlife habitat.

While some factors lead to synchronous germination, others stimulate germination of only a small fraction of the resting stages. This suggests that habitat filters may act on the germination level and thus affect selection of blooming strains. Benthic seed banks of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii from the Baltic Sea are genetically and phenotypically diverse, indicating a high potential for adaptation by selection on standing genetic variation. Here, we experimentally tested the role of climate-related salinity and temperature as selection filters during germination and subsequent establishment of A.ostenfeldii strains. A representative resting cyst population was isolated from sediment samples, and germination and reciprocal transplantation experiments were carried out, including four treatments: Average present day germination conditions and three potential future conditions: high temperature, low salinity, and high temperature in combination with low salinity. We found that the final germination success of A.ostenfeldii resting cysts was unaffected by temperature and salinity in the range tested. A high germination success of more than 80% in all treatments indicates that strains are not selected by temperature and salinity during germination, but selection becomes more important shortly after germination, in the vegetative stage of the life cycle. Moreover, strains were not adapted to germination conditions. Instead, highly plastic responses occurred after transplantation and significantly higher growth rates were observed at higher temperature. High variability of strain-specific responses has probably masked the overall effect of the treatments, highlighting the importance of testing the effect of environmental factors on many strains. It is likely that A.ostenfeldii populations can persist in the future, because suitable strains, which are able to germinate and grow well at potential future climate conditions, are part of the highly diverse cyst population.

In spite of this, caterpillars with highly diverse life histories appear to lack resident microbiota. Gut physiology, endogenous digestive enzymes, and limited social interactions may contribute to this pattern, but the consequences of shifts in social activity and diet on caterpillar microbiota are largely unknown. Phengaris alcon caterpillars undergo particularly dramatic social and dietary shifts when they parasitize Myrmica ant colonies, rapidly transitioning from solitary herbivory to ant tending (i.e., receiving protein-rich regurgitations through trophallaxis). This unique life history provides a model for studying interactions between social living, diet, and caterpillar microbiota. Here, we characterized and compared bacterial communities within P.alcon caterpillars before and after their association with ants, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. After being adopted by ants, bacterial communities within P.alcon caterpillars shifted substantially, with a significant increase in alpha diversity and greater consistency in bacterial community composition in terms of beta dissimilarity. We also characterized the bacterial communities within their host ants (Myrmica schencki), food plant (Gentiana cruciata), and soil from ant nest chambers. These data indicated that the aforementioned patterns were influenced by bacteria derived from caterpillars' surrounding environments, rather than through transfers from ants. Thus, while bacterial communities are substantially reorganized over the life cycle of P.alcon caterpillars, it appears that they do not rely on transfers of bacteria from host ants to complete their development.

School sharks, Galeorhinus galeus, are targeted by commercial fisheries in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian stock has been depleted to below 20% of its virgin biomass, and the species is recorded as Conservation Dependent within Australia. Individuals are known to move between both countries, but it is disputed whether the stocks are reproductively linked. Accurate and unbiased determination of stock and population connectivity is crucial to inform effective management. In this study, we assess the genetic composition and population connectivity between Australian and New Zealand school sharks using genome-wide SNPs, while accounting for non-random kin sampling. Between 2009 and 2013, 88 neonate and juvenile individuals from Tasmanian and New Zealand nurseries were collected and genotyped. Neutral loci were analyzed to detect fine-scale signals of reproductive connectivity. Seven full-sibling groups were identified and removed for unbiased analysis. Based on 6,587 neutral SNPs, pairwise genetic differentiation from Tasmanian and New Zealand neonates was non-significant (F-ST=0.0003, CI95=[-0.0002, 0.0009], p=0.1163; D-est=0.00060.0002).

In this study, we evaluated the contribution of several mechanisms to the coexistence of two sympatric frugivores, using western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in a tropical rainforest of southeast Cameroon as a model system. We collected great ape fecal samples to determine and classify fruit species consumed; we conducted great ape nest surveys to evaluate seasonal patterns of habitat use; and we collected botanical data to investigate the distribution of plant species across habitat types in relation to their consumption traits (which indicate whether plants are preferred or fallback for either gorilla, chimpanzee, or both). We found that patterns of habitat use varied seasonally for both gorillas and chimpanzees and that gorilla and chimpanzee preferred and fallback fruits differed. Also, the distribution of plant consumption traits was influenced by habitat type and matched accordingly with the patterns of habitat use by gorillas and chimpanzees. We show that neither habitat selection nor fruit preference alone can explain the coexistence of gorillas and chimpanzees, but that considering together the distribution of plant consumption traits of fruiting woody plants across habitats as well as the pattern of fruit availability may contribute to explaining coexistence. This supports the assumptions of niche theory with dominant and subordinate species in heterogeneous landscapes, whereby a species may prefer nesting in habitats where it is less subject to competitive exclusion and where food availability is higher. To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate the contribution of plant consumption traits, seasonality, and habitat heterogeneity to enabling the coexistence of two sympatric frugivores.

Here, we compiled a database of plant species of Mount Kenya, a tropical mountain of East Africa, and divided these species into twelve groups depending on the life-form and phytogeographic affinity of each species. We inspected the species richness pattern of each group along the elevation gradient and also tested ERR of each group using Stevens' method. Our results showed that species richness of the total species showed a positively skewed (hump-shaped) pattern along the elevation gradient and different life-forms and phytogeographic affinities showed similar hump-shaped patterns as the total species. The average elevation range size of the total species and herbaceous species showed increasing patterns along the elevation gradient, while lycophytes and ferns, and woody species showed an obvious downward trend after peaking in the high elevation regions. We concluded that the widely distributed herbaceous species which also have broad elevation range sizes are more applicable to ERR, while the narrowly distributed woody species with small elevation range sizes occurring in the higher elevations could reverse ERR. Therefore, we concluded that the ERR is not consistent among different organisms in the same region.

Yet, rare cross-watershed transfers can also occur, whether mediated by (often historical) geological events or (often contemporary) human activities. We explored these events and their potential evolutionary consequences by analyzing patterns of neutral genetic variation (microsatellites) and adaptive phenotypic variation (male color) in wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata) distributed across two watersheds in northern Trinidad. We found the expected signatures of within-watershed gene flow; yet we also inferred at least two instances of cross-watershed gene flowone in the upstream reaches and one further downstream. The upstream cross-watershed event appears to be very recent (41 +/- 13years), suggesting dispersal via recent flooding or undocumented human-mediated transport. The downstream cross-watershed event appears to be considerably older (577 +/- 265years), suggesting a role for rare geological or climatological events. Alongside these strong signatures of both contemporary and historical gene flow, we found little evidence of impacts on presumably adaptive phenotypic differentiation, except perhaps in the one instance of very recent cross-watershed gene flow. Selection in this system seems to overpower gene flowat least on the spatiotemporal scales investigated here.

Recent work has focused on adaptation to distinct ecological niches as the main driver of clustering, but there remains debate about the role of recombination in that process. One view is that homologous recombination occurs too rarely for gene flow to constrain divergent selection. Another view is that homologous recombination is frequent enough in many bacterial populations that barriers to gene flow are needed to permit divergence. Niche-specific gene pools have been proposed as a general mechanism to limit gene flow. We use theoretical models to evaluate additional hypotheses that evolving genetic architecture, specifically the effect sizes of genes and gene gain and loss, can limit gene flow between diverging populations. Our model predicts that (a) in the presence of gene flow and recombination, ecological divergence is concentrated in few loci of large effect and (b) high rates of gene flow plus recombination promote gene loss and favor the evolution of niche-specific genes. The results show that changing genetic architecture and gene loss can facilitate ecological divergence, even without niche-specific gene pools. We discuss these results in the context of recent studies of sympatric divergence in microbes.

In the present study, our aim was to investigate if different clones of Solanum dulcamara (a relative of potato) collected in the wild differ in resistance and tolerance to infection by a common European isolate of P.infestans. We performed infection experiments with six S.dulcamara genotypes (clones) both in the laboratory and in the field and measured the degree of infection and plant performance traits. In the laboratory, the six evaluated genotypes varied from resistant to susceptible, as measured by degree of infection 20days post infection. Two of the four genotypes susceptible to infection showed a quadratic (concave downward) relationship between the degree of infection and shoot length, with maximum shoot length at intermediate values of infection. This result suggests overcompensation, that is, an increase in growth in infected individuals. The number of leaves decreased with increasing degree of infection, but at different rates in the four susceptible genotypes, indicating genetic variation for tolerance. In the field, the inoculated genotypes did not show any disease symptoms, but plant biomass at the end of the growing season was higher for inoculated plants than for controls, in-line with the overcompensation detected in the laboratory. We conclude that in S.dulcamara there are indications of genetic variation for both resistance and tolerance to P.infestans infection. Moreover, some genotypes displayed overcompensation. Learning about plant tolerance and overcompensation to infection by pathogens can help broaden our understanding of plant defense in natural populations and help develop more sustainable plant protection strategies for economically important crop diseases.

For social animals, urbanized environments may alter group social dynamics through modification of the external environment (e.g., resource distribution). This might lead to changes in how individuals associate or engage in group behaviors, which could alter the stability and characteristics of social groups. However, the potential impacts of urban habitat use, and of habitat characteristics in general, on the nature and stability of social associations remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify social networks and dynamics of group foraging behaviors of black-capped chickadees (N=82, Poecile atricapillus), at four urban and four rural sites weekly throughout the nonbreeding season using feeders with radio frequency identification of individual birds. Because anthropogenic food sources in urban habitats (e.g., bird feeders) provide abundant and reliable resources, we predicted that social foraging associations may be of less value in urban groups, and thus would be less consistent than in rural groups. Additionally, decreased variability of food resources in urban habitats could lead to more predictable foraging patterns (group size, foraging duration, and the distribution of foraging events) in contrast to rural habitats. Networks were found to be highly consistent through time in both urban and rural habitats. No significant difference was found in the temporal clumping of foraging events between habitats. However, as predicted, the repeatability of the clumping of foraging events in time was significantly higher in urban than rural habitats. Our results suggest that individuals living in urban areas have more consistent foraging behaviors throughout the nonbreeding season, whereas rural individuals adjust their tactics due to less predictable foraging conditions. This first examination of habitat-related differences in the characteristics and consistency of social networks along an urbanization gradient suggests that anthropic habitat use results in subtle modifications in social foraging patterns. Future studies should examine potential implications of these differences for variation in predation risk, energy intake, and information flow.

We hypothesized that Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have influenced the distribution of R.flavipes, and thus the evolutionary history of the species. We estimated contemporary and historical geographic distributions of R.flavipes by constructing Species Distribution Models (SDM). We also inferred the evolutionary and demographic history of the species using mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I and II) and nuclear (endo-beta-1,4-glucanase) DNA sequence data. To do this, genetic populations were delineated using Bayesian spatial-genetic clustering, competing hypotheses about population divergence were assessed using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), and changes in population size were estimated using Bayesian skyline plots. SDMs identified areas in the north with suitable habitat during the transition from the Last Interglacial to the Last Glacial Maximum, as well as an expanding distribution from the mid-Holocene to the present. Genetic analyses identified three geographically cohesive populations, corresponding with northern, central, and southern portions of the study region. Based on ABC analyses, divergence between the Northern and Southern populations was the oldest, estimated to have occurred 64.80 thousand years ago (kya), which corresponds with the timing of available habitat in the north. The Central and Northern populations diverged in the mid-Holocene, 8.63kya, after which the Central population continued to expand. Accordingly, phylogeographic patterns of R.flavipes in the southern Appalachians appear to have been strongly influenced by glacial-interglacial climate change.

One way to assess food requirements is to examine changes in body mass, because it indicates the amount of food acquired. In terms of body mass changes, our expectation is that nonbreeders will either (a) be in poorer condition than the breeders which potentially explains why they do not breed or (b) remain at a stable higher mass as they are unconstrained by the physiological costs associated with rearing chicks. Here, we interrogate body mass datasets of breeding and nonbreeding birds of two penguin species to assess these predictions and determine whether differences in mass exist between these two groups throughout the breeding season. The first dataset is from a wild Adelie penguin population, where bird mass was recorded automatically and breeding status determined from a resighting program. A second population of captive gentoo penguins were weighed regularly each breeding season. We demonstrate that although there were times in each year when breeders were heavier than their nonbreeding counterparts for both populations, the mass changes showed qualitatively similar patterns throughout the breeding season irrespective of breeding status. Heavier breeders at times during the breeding season are not unexpected but the overall similar pattern of mass change irrespective of breeding status is in contrast to expectations. It appears that breeding status per se and the constraints that breeding places on birds are not the only driver of changes in mass throughout the breeding season and, although not explicitly studied here, the role of hormones in driving changes in appetite could be key to explain these results. These results present a significant step toward understanding food requirements of nonbreeders in avian populations.

Restricted gene flow among isolated populations of lagoon species may promote their genetic divergence and may thus provide a first step toward speciation. In the present study, the population genetic structure of the lagoon cockle Cerastoderma glaucum has been investigated to clarify the complex phylogeographic pattern found in previous studies, to localize major genetic breaks, and to discuss their origin and maintenance. LocationThe Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, including the Baltic, North Sea, and Black Sea. MethodsA total of 204 C. glaucum individuals from 14 populations were genotyped using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). The genetic diversity, divergence, and structure were analyzed using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Phylogenetic relationships were inferred under a coalescent model using SVDquartets. ResultsThe RADseq approach allowed inferring phylogeographic relationships with an unprecedented resolution. Three deeply divergent lineages were identified within C. glaucum that are separated by many genetic barriers: one lineage in the Aegean-Black Sea region, one in the Ionian Sea, and the last one widely distributed from the Western Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea. The nested branching pattern displayed on the species tree largely agrees with the likely scenario of C. glaucum postglacial expansion from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea. Main conclusionThe genetic differentiations between geographically separated lagoons proved to be strong, highlighting the evolutionary influence of these naturally fragmented habitats. The postglacial expansion created complex patterns of spatial segregation of genetic diversity with allele frequency gradients in many outlier loci, but also discrepancies between the nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers that probably arose from genetic surfing of mitochondrial variation.

Variations in resource distribution leading to changes in spatial arrangements across landscapes are indicative of a habitat functional response. Our goal was to assess how resource availabilities influenced both second-order (i.e., home ranging behavior) and third-order (i.e., habitat or resource selection) selection by feral pigs (Sus scrofa) in an agricultural landscape. We defined agriculturally based seasons to estimate home range characteristics using autocorrelated kernel density estimation within each season. We then modeled home range size as a function of resource availability (i.e., resource selection analyses) to determine whether individual behaviors were predicted by shifts in home ranging behavior. Both home range analyses and resource selection analyses indicated seasonal differences in selection for agricultural resources as availabilities changed, suggesting second- and third-order selection is mechanistically linked through a habitat functional response.

In the present study, we sequence and annotate (through BLAST- and Gene Ontology-based approaches) the salivary transcriptome of the nonblood feeding hirudinid Whitmania pigra and assess the differential gene expression of anticoagulation factors (through both quantitative real-time PCR [qRT-PCR] and in silico-based methods) during feeding and fasting conditions. This was done in order to evince the diversity of putative anticoagulation factors, as well as estimate the levels of upregulation of genes immediately after feeding. In total, we found sequences with demonstrated orthology (via both phylogenetic analyses and BLAST-based approaches) to seven different proteins that have previously been linked to anticoagulatory capabilitieseglin C, bdellin, granulin, guamerin, hyaluronidase, destabilase I, and lipocalin. All of these were recovered from leeches both in the fasting and in the feeding conditions, but all show signs of upregulation in the feeding leeches. Interestingly, our RNA-seq effort, coupled with a hypergeometric test, indicated that the differentially expressed genes were disproportionately involved in three main immunological pathways (endocytosis, peroxisome regulation, and lysosome regulation). The results and implications of the finding of anticoagulants in this nonblood feeding leech and the putative upregulation of anticoagulation factors after feeding are briefly discussed in an evolutionary context.

Predatory lizards perceive plant-derived volatile odorants	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						foraging strategies; lizards; olfaction; plant indirect defense; tri-trophic interactions	TRAILING BEHAVIOR; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; CHEMICAL CUES; ATTRACTION; HERBIVORES; RESPONSES	Many lizards are olfactory foragers and prey upon herbivorous arthropods, yet their responses to common herbivore-associated plant volatiles remain unknown. As such, their role in mediating plant indirect defenses also remains largely obscured. In this paper, we use a cotton-swab odor presentation assay to ask whether lizards respond to two arthropod-associated plant-derived volatile compounds: 2-(E)-hexenal and hexanoic acid. We studied the response of two lizard species, Sceloporus virgatusand Aspidoscelis exsanguis, because they differ substantially in their foraging behavior. We found that the actively foraging A.exsanguisresponded strongly to hexanoic acid, whereas the ambush foraging S.virgatus responded to 2-(E)-hexenalan herbivore-associated plant volatile involved in indirect defense against herbivores. These findings indicate that S.virgatus may contribute to plant indirect defense and that a species' response to specific odorants is linked with foraging mode. Future studies can elucidate how lizards use various compounds to locate prey and how these responses impact plant-herbivore interactions.

The estimation of abundance of wildlife populations is an essential part of ecological research and monitoring. Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) models are widely used for abundance and density estimation, frequently through individual identification of target species using camera-trap sampling. 2. Generalized spatial mark-resight (Gen-SMR) is a recently developed SCR extension that allows for abundance estimation when only a subset of the population is recognizable by artificial or natural marks. However, in many cases, it is not possible to read the marks in camera-trap pictures, even though individuals can be recognized as marked. We present a new extension of Gen-SMR that allows for this type of incomplete identification. 3. We used simulation to assess how the number of marked individuals and the individual identification rate influenced bias and precision. We demonstrate the model's performance in estimating red fox (Vulpes vulpes) density with two empirical datasets characterized by contrasting densities and rates of identification of marked individuals. According to the simulations, accuracy increases with the number of marked individuals (m), but is less sensitive to changes in individual identification rate (delta). In our case studies of red fox density estimation, we obtained a posterior mean of 1.60 (standard deviation SD: 0.32) and 0.28 (SD: 0.06) individuals/km(2), in high and low density, with an identification rate of 0.21 and 0.91, respectively. 4. This extension of Gen-SMR is broadly applicable as it addresses the common problem of incomplete identification of marked individuals during resighting surveys.

Transoceanic migrations of Scopoli's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) across the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG) have been tracked from several breeding colonies isolatedly, and factors related to the variability in phenological schedules among different populations remain, therefore, not well-understood. Using light-level geolocator data, I examined the autumn (postbreeding) and spring (prebreeding) migratory passage dates through SoG of four populations of Scopoli's shearwater spread along the longitudinal breeding range of the species. Additionally, I also estimated the at-sea activity patterns (from immersion data) during both migratory passages, as well as the body size (from morphometric data) of the individuals of these populations. On average, Scopoli's shearwaters leave the Mediterranean (cross SoG) on 31 October1.8days on their autumn migrations and return on 03 March +/- 1.6days on their spring migrations. At the population level, there was a clear gradient in the timing of crossing SoG: birds from the westernmost populations (Murcia, SE Spain) were the first ones in leaving the Mediterranean while easternmost breeders (Paximada, Crete) were the last ones. In spring, only birds from the largest breeding population (Zembra, Tunisia) seemed to advance their return and crossed SoG significantly earlier than birds tracked at the remaining populations. In both passages, shearwaters from central and eastern populations spent more time flying than their conspecifics from the western Mediterranean. Scopoli's shearwater populations display a differential phenology and behavior in their migratory passages through SoG. The longitudinal gradient in body size already reported for the species could be an evolutionary response to an obvious trade-off between sharing common wintering grounds in the Atlantic Ocean and the temporal constraints of restoring physiological condition in those grounds.

Morphological matching between pollinators and plants is thought to reinforce pollinator fidelity, as the correct fit ensures that both parties benefit from the interaction. We investigated the influence of body size in a specialized pollination system (buzz-pollination) where bees vibrate flowers to release pollen concealed within poricidal stamens. Specifically, we explored how body size influences the frequency of buzz-pollination vibrations. Body size is expected to affect frequency as a result of the physical constraints it places on the indirect flight muscles that control the production of floral vibrations. Larger insects beat their wings less rapidly than smaller-bodied insects when flying, but whether similar scaling relationships exist with floral vibrations has not been widely explored. This is important because the amount of pollen ejected is determined by the frequency of the vibration and the displacement of a bee's thorax. We conducted a field study in three ecogeographic regions (alpine, desert, grassland) and recorded flight and floral vibrations from freely foraging bees from 27 species across four families. We found that floral vibration frequencies were significantly higher than flight frequencies, but never exceeded 400Hz. Also, only flight frequencies were negatively correlated with body size. As a bee's size increased, its buzz ratio (floral frequency/flight frequency) increased such that only the largest bees were capable of generating floral vibration frequencies that exceeded double that of their flight vibrations. These results indicate size affects the capacity of bees to raise floral vibration frequencies substantially above flight frequencies. This may put smaller bees at a competitive disadvantage because even at the maximum floral vibration frequency of 400Hz, their inability to achieve comparable thoracic displacements as larger bees would result in generating vibrations with lower amplitudes, and thus less total pollen ejected for the same foraging effort.

These declines mostly affected highland stream amphibians and have been primarily linked to chytridiomycosis, a deadly disease caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Since then, the majority of field studies on Bd in the Tropics have been conducted in midland and highland environments (>800m) mainly because the environmental conditions of mountain ranges match the range of ideal abiotic conditions for Bd in the laboratory. This unbalanced sampling has led researchers to largely overlook host-pathogen dynamics in lowlands, where other amphibian species declined during the same period. We conducted a survey testing for Bd in 47 species (n=348) in four lowland sites in Costa Rica to identify local host-pathogen dynamics and to describe the abiotic environment of these sites. We detected Bd in three sampling sites and 70% of the surveyed species. We found evidence that lowland study sites exhibit enzootic dynamics with low infection intensity and moderate to high prevalence (55% overall prevalence). Additionally, we found evidence that every study site represents an independent climatic zone, where local climatic differences may explain variations in Bd disease dynamics. We recommend more detection surveys across lowlands and other sites that have been historically considered unsuitable for Bd occurrence. These data can be used to identify sites for potential disease outbreaks and amphibian rediscoveries.

Impacts of invasive annuals on soil carbon and nitrogen storage in southern California depend on the identity of the invader	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						carbon sequestration; climate change; grassland; nitrogen availability; nutrient storage; sage scrub	COASTAL SAGE SCRUB; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; EXOTIC GRASSES; FIRE FREQUENCY; PLANT LITTER; GRASSLAND; DEPOSITION; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE	Non-native plant invasions can alter nutrient cycling processes and contribute to global climate change. In southern California, California sage scrub (hereafter sage scrub), a native shrub-dominated habitat type in lowland areas, has decreased to <10% of its original distribution. Postdisturbance type-conversion to non-native annual grassland, and increasingly to mustard-dominated invasive forbland, is a key contributor to sage scrub loss. To better understand how type-conversion by common invasive annuals impacts carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in surface soils, we examined how the identity of the invader (non-native grasses, Bromus spp.; and non-native forbs, Brassica nigra), microbial concentrations, and soil properties interact to influence soil nutrient storage in adjacent native and invasive habitat types at nine sites along a coast to inland gradient. We found that the impact of type-conversion on nutrient storage was contingent upon the invasive plant type. Sage scrub soils stored more C and N than non-native grasslands, whereas non-native forblands had nutrient storage similar to or higher than sage scrub. We calculate that >940t C km(-2) and >60t N km(-2) are lost when sage scrub converts to grass-dominated habitat, demonstrating that grass invasions are significant regional contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. We found that sites with greater total C and N storage were associated with high cation exchange capacities and bacterial concentrations. Non-native grassland habitat type was a predictor of lower total C, and soil pH, which was greatest in invasive habitats, was a predictor of lower total N. We demonstrate that modeling regional nutrient storage requires accurate classification of habitat type and fine-scale quantification of cation exchange capacity, pH, and bacterial abundance. Our results provide evidence that efforts to restore and conserve sage scrub enhance nutrient storage, a key ecosystem service reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

Here, we show, in a small Atlantic island (Raso) in the Cabo Verde Archipelago, using DNA metabarcoding, the extent of trophic dependence of the Endangered giant wall gecko Tarentola gigas on endemic populations of vertebrates, including one of the rarest bird species of the world, the Critically Endangered Raso lark Alauda razae. We found that the Raso lark (27%), Iago sparrow Passer iagoensis (12%), Bulwer's petrel Bulweria bulwerii (15%), and the Cabo Verde shearwater Calonectris edwardsii (10%) are the most frequent vertebrate signatures found in the feces of the giant wall gecko. This work provides the first integrative assessment of their trophic links, an important issue to be considered for the long-term conservation of these small and isolated island ecosystems.

In this study, we used a unique data set covering 46 vineyard plots in France (Champagne, Beaujolais and Languedoc winegrowing areas) with 883 flora surveys performed between 2006 and 2012. The three objectives of the present study were: (1) to characterize weed communities composition and structure (richness and abundance) in vineyards from three traditional winegrowing areas in France; (2) to evaluate the relative importance of spatial, temporal variables, environmental conditions and management practices on weed species composition and structure; (3) to determine whether or not weed composition and structure are affected by the same factors. The results of the study revealed that season (including timing of management practices) was the most important filter for weed communities in vineyards, opposing in each plot a spring community and a summer-autumn community. Furthermore, spatial variations between regions (latitude), soil types (pH) and inter-annual variations (2006 to 2012) were also seen to have a strong effect on species turnover. Farming practices explained an overall low variation in composition of weed communities but some species showed a high and consistent fit to contrasting practices. For example, herbicide applications (mostly glyphosate) promoted some species such as Malva sylvestris and Sorghum halepense whereas tillage in inter-rows selected typical annual weeds such as Cerastium glomeratum and Galium aparine. Farming practices had a much higher influence on species richness and abundance with equal effect of both herbicides and soil tillage for controlling weed species richness and abundance in inter-rows, but stronger effects of herbicides were observed on species abundance in the rows. Tillage along the rows and a combination of mowing and tillage along the inter-rows were associated to the highest level of weed richness and abundance. Our study suggests that grapevine growers have a limited ability to influence species composition (mostly determined by abiotic factors) but their choice of management can modulate the level of weed richness and abundance. Our results will contribute to guide farmers towards more integrated management practices, ensuring both an optimal management of the spontaneous vegetation in vineyards and allowing this vegetation to provide various ecosystem services.

Hedgerows have been repeatedly emphasized as landscape elements that provide nesting and food resources, connect fragmented habitats and could thus facilitate crop pollination. However, the beneficial and potentially also detrimental impacts of hedgerows on crop pollination remain poorly studied. Here, we analysed the effects of pollinators and herbivorous pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) on quantity and quality of strawberries from phytometer plants located at forest-connected hedgerows, isolated hedgerows and on grassy margins without any hedgerows. Higher pollinator abundance increased strawberry weight, whereas pollen beetle abundance reduced strawberry weight. Strawberry weight was significantly reduced by 29% at isolated hedgerows and 32% on grassy margins, compared to berries at connected hedgerows. Plants placed at forest-connected hedgerows produced more high quality strawberries with 90% classified as "marketable", whereas only 75% of strawberries from plants at isolated hedgerows, 48% of strawberries from plants on grassy margins and 41% of strawberries from self-pollinated control plants where classified as marketable. Consequently, increased habitat connectivity through hedgerows enhanced the commercial value of strawberries from 9.27 (sic) per 1000 strawberries for plants grown on grassy margins to 14.95 (sic) for plants located at forest-connected hedgerows. Correspondingly, pollinator abundance was highest on phytometer plants at forest-connected hedgerows, lowest on grassy margins and intermediate at isolated hedgerows. Pollen beetle abundance on phytometer plants was not affected by hedgerows. Our study highlights the importance of hedgerows and habitat connectivity for promoting pollination services in agricultural landscapes, with economically important benefits for crop quantity and quality.

Changes in water regimes largely compromised the survival of many aquatic organisms formerly abundant in rice fields, such as Odonata, inducing the introduction of new agricultural practices supposed to mitigate the negative impacts of intensive rice cultivation on biodiversity. For instance, the construction of a water retention structure (ditch) within paddies has been incentivized in Italy, in order to reduce the detrimental effects of drying periods on aquatic organisms. In this research, we investigate the effects of ditch occurrence and dimensions on Odonata diversity in rice fields, and furthermore we evaluate the response of these insects to vegetation height on paddy and canal banks, as an approximation of grass management intensity. Field surveys revealed that ditch occurrence may not be sufficient to improve the suitability of rice fields as breeding habitat for Odonata, especially for sensitive species. Paddies with ditches of larger dimensions supported more abundant adult populations than other field types, but no clear differences have been observed concerning larval stages. Conversely, the occurrence of a well-developed bank vegetation produced clear benefits for these insects in rice fields, while a not significant effect have been observed along irrigation canals. In order to achieve Odonata conservation in rice agroecosystems, together with the excavation of large ditches within paddies, the creation of a network of semi-natural wetlands should be encouraged, as well as the implementation of extensive grass management strategies on rice field and canal banks.

To effectively manage or promote biodiversity in heterogeneous environments such as intensive agrosystems, a thorough knowledge of the spatial and temporal scale of ecological factor effects is required. This study investigates the effects of ecological correlates on local wild bee diversity in semi-natural farmland habitats, and predicts changes in species richness according to local-scale and landscape-scale correlates to further guide bee conservation practices. Local floral richness, the proportion of semi-natural habitats in the landscape (1000 m radius) and the type of semi-natural habitats influenced bee richness at a field scale. However, the magnitude of the effect varied seasonally and according to local bee abundance. Model predictions showed that increasing floral richness on farms had a greater effect on bee richness than increasing the proportion of semi-natural habitats. While increasing the number of semi-natural habitats would be a more effective strategy for promoting bee diversity at the landscape scale, it may not be feasible in intensive farming systems.

The main insect pest in these orchards is the highly polyphagous South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus. Technical advisers recommend that farmers remove wild host plants of A. fraterculus around orchards, which is at odds with the need for forest conservation. We thus investigated whether the presence of Atlantic Forest remnants and A. fraterculus host plants surrounding commercial apple orchards affect A. fraterculus populations in apple orchards in Parana, southern Brazil. For this purpose, we monitored A. fraterculus using McPhail traps in a total of 67 100 m x 200 m apple orchard plots that differed in their adjacent landscape (forest with A. fraterculus host plants, forest without host plants, open areas). In total, we captured 6412 Anastrepha fruit flies during four growing seasons. At the time when the apple fruits were susceptible to A. fraterculus, the probability of occurrence (i.e. of presence or absence) of A. fraterculus did not differ among the adjacent landscape types and was not affected by the presence of specific host plants. Its abundance in traps where at least one individual was found was also not affected. In contrast, at the time when the apple fruits were absent or not susceptible to A. fraterculus, A. fraterculus probability of occurrence was significantly higher in plots adjacent to open area than in plots adjacent to native forest remnants and intermediate in plots adjacent to native forest remnants with A. fraterculus host plants. At that time, its probability of occurrence and its abundance increased only with the presence of Psidium cattleyanum in these forest remnants. These results indicate that forest remnants had a limited impact on A. fraterculus abundance in orchards and do not support the recommendation to indiscriminately remove wild host plants adjacent to apple orchards.

This combined effect could result in losses of over 100 million per year for the UK economy. We investigated whether incorporating floral resources within commercial polythene-clad tunnels could improve pollination services and aphid control and, hence, strawberry fruit quality. In a randomised block experiment (using 3 x 6 m plots), coriander (Coriandrum sativum) field forget-me-not (Myosotis arvensis) and corn mint (Mentha arvensis) plants were inserted in rows of commercially-grown strawberries. Their effect on numbers of naturally occurring flower visitors, aphids and aphid predators was compared. Counts of flower visitors, including visitors to sown flower species, were higher in coriander and mint plots. However strawberry flowers received more insect visits in control plots. Fruit from forget-me-not plots were lower in sugar than fruit from controls, while fruit from mint plots had fewer fertilised seeds than fruit from control plots. Strawberries from coriander plots did not differ from control fruit on any fruit quality measures. Crucially, proportions of marketable fruit did not differ across treatments. Aphid numbers did not differ between treatments even though coriander significantly increased the numbers of lacewing eggs laid on aphid-infested strawberry plants in coriander plots. Hence, although there were no negative effects on the proportions of marketable fruits with intercropping, the benefits received were limited. It might be that in a different growing season the effect would be more pronounced but this would need to be weighed up against the cost of implementing such interventions.

Insights from a deconstruction of mammal beta diversity from the Atlantic Forest of South America	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Community assembly; Distance decay; Dispersal limitation; Species loss; Species replacement	SPECIES-RICHNESS; METACOMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DISPERSAL MODE; TURNOVER; PATTERNS; NESTEDNESS; COMPONENTS; DISTANCE; DISSIMILARITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY	Space and environment are fundamental in influencing the community structure. However, their relative influences vary according to species' biological characteristics. Here we test whether differences in life-history traits mainly linked to dispersal abilities influence bat, rodent and marsupial beta diversity along spatial and environmental gradients. We expect bat beta diversity to be weakly related with space in comparison to dispersal-limited rodents and marsupials. Using data from communities distributed along the Atlantic Forest of South America, we calculated the total beta diversity and its turnover and nestedness components for each group. We estimated the strength of correlation of beta diversity and its components along spatial and environmental gradients, comparing their importance within and between groups. Space had the higher influence on rodent and marsupial beta diversity. For bats, both gradients influenced similarly their community composition. Between taxa, the influence of these gradients did not differ for rodents and marsupials, while bats presented a stronger relationship with environment compared to non-volant small mammals. Also, all groups presented a similar influence of the spatial gradients on their community structure, despite their differences in dispersal abilities. Our results suggest that differences in biological characteristics partially influence the community structure of these mammals, with their responses along space likely reflecting similar biogeographical dynamics affecting their distribution. Overall, our results improve the understanding of the processes structuring these communities, highlighting the benefits of comparative analyses within a beta diversity perspective to better understand the influence of multiple processes on the community assembly along geographical gradients.

However, the joint effects of habitat fragmentation and environmental conditions on taxonomic and functional diversity, for instance across elevational gradients, have largely been neglected so far. In this study, we compare whether taxonomic and functional indicators show similar or distinct responses to forest fragmentation across an elevational gradient. We based our analysis on a comprehensive data set of species-rich bird assemblages from tropical montane forest in the Southern Andes of Ecuador. We monitored birds over 2years in two habitat types (continuous and fragmented forest) at three elevations (i.e., 1000, 2000, and 3000m a.s.l) and measured nine morphological traits for each bird species on museum specimens. Bird species richness and abundance were significantly higher in fragmented compared to continuous forests and decreased towards high elevations. In contrast, functional diversity was significantly reduced in fragmented compared to continuous forests at low elevations, but fragmentation effects on functional diversity tended to be reversed at high elevations. Our results demonstrate that taxonomic and functional indicators can show decoupled responses to forest fragmentation and that these effects are highly variable across elevations. Our findings reveal that functional homogenization in bird communities in response to fragmentation can be masked by apparent increases in taxonomic diversity, particularly in diverse communities at low elevations.

If used correctly, they produce two parallel, non-overlapping, laminar water currents in which the animal can move freely and choose between the two currents. As climate change is affecting water temperature, and altered precipitation patterns are changing water salinity, two-current choice flumes are increasingly being used to test the choice between water currents of different temperatures and salinities. This inevitably means that water currents of different densities are being used simultaneously in the flume. Here, we investigated the tolerance range for density differences due to temperature and salinity in five common flume designs. Through dye tests and stepwise modifications of temperatures and salinities we determined the limits for laminar and non-overlapping flows. We also developed an automated method for quantifying the overlap precisely and objectively. The tolerance for density differences between the water currents where laminar and non-overlapping flows were maintained was surprisingly low, withstanding +/- 0.5 degrees C temperature differences, and +/- 0.1 PSU salinity differences, i.e. a maximum density difference of 0.28gL(-1). Above these very narrow limits we found a range where the flumes showed partly overlapping, stratified water currents that preclude easy determination of cue preference. We conclude that two-current choice flumes are not suitable for testing the behavioural choices of aquatic animals using water currents of anything other than minor differences in temperature and/or salinity.

Ontogenetic shifts in the nesting behaviour of female crocodiles	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Estuarine crocodile; Hidden Markov modelling; Nest-site selection; Parental investment; Telemetry	CROCODYLUS-POROSUS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; AMERICAN ALLIGATORS; LOGGERHEAD TURTLES; SITE SELECTION; GROWTH-RATES; BODY-SIZE; EXPERIENCE; AGE; CONSEQUENCES	Body size and age are crucial factors influencing reproductive capacity and success. As females grow, their reproductive investment and success often increase due to improved overall physiological condition and experience gained through successive reproductive events. While much of this work has been conducted on birds and mammals, surprisingly little is known on how body size affects nesting decisions in other long-lived vertebrates. We monitored the movements and nesting behaviour of 57 wild female estuarine crocodiles Crocodylus porosus over a 10-year period (and across consecutive nesting seasons) using externally mounted satellite tags, implanted acoustic transmitters and a network of submerged acoustic receivers. Applying Hidden Markov models to the telemetry-derived location data revealed that female nesting behaviours could be split into three distinct states: (i) ranging movements within home ranges and at nesting sites; (ii) migrations to and from nesting sites; (iii) and nesting/nest guarding. We found that during migration events, larger females migrated further and remained away from dry season territories for longer periods than smaller individuals. Furthermore, not only were migratory movements stimulated by increases in rainfall, larger females migrated to nest sites at lower rainfall thresholds than smaller females. We provide some of the first evidence of body size influencing nesting decisions in an ectothermic vertebrate, with shifts likely resulting from an increased willingness to invest in nest protection among larger and more experienced females.

Seed predation does not explain pine invasion success	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Biotic resistance; Invasive plants; Invasive traits; Pinus; Seed traits	POPULATION-LEVEL COMPENSATION; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; PLANT INVASIVENESS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; FRUIT SIZE; CONIFERS; DISPERSAL; FOREST; TRAITS	Why some non-native plant species invade, and others fail remains an elusive question. Plant invasion success has been associated with specific species traits. Yet, we have limited knowledge of the mechanisms relating these traits to invasion potential. General patterns of biotic resistance by seed predation may provide a mechanism that helps separate invasive from non-invasive plants. Seed predation is an important barrier against plant establishment for many plant species. It may, therefore, create a selective filter against non-native plant establishment based on plant traits related to seed predation rate. In two cafeteria-style seed predation experiments in a steppe ecosystem in Patagonia (Argentina) we provided seeds of 16 non-native Pinaceae covering a 300-fold variation in seed mass, a 200-fold variation in seed volume and 75-fold variation in seed toughness. Seed removal decreased with seed mass and seed volume. Seed toughness was not a significant predictor while seed volume was the best predictor of predators' preference. However, for species of this family small seed size is the most important predictor of species invasiveness. Our results show that seed predation does not explain Pinaceae invasive success. In our system, species that have smaller seeds (i.e., more invasive) are preferentially consumed by seed predators. Seed mass was not the best predictor of granivory rates, despite being the seed trait on which most studies have been focused. Our ability to predict future invasion and understand invasion success could benefit from other studies that focus on the mechanisms behind invasive traits.

Scale-dependent patterns of intraspecific trait variations in two globally invasive species	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Ecomorphology; Lepomis gibbosus; Procambarus clarkii; Geometric morphometrics; Stable isotopes	PREDATOR-INDUCED MORPHOLOGY; RED SWAMP CRAYFISH; PUMPKINSEED SUNFISH; TROPHIC POSITION; PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII; SPATIAL SCALE; FOOD; SPECIALIZATION; POPULATION; IMPACTS	Animal species often show substantial intraspecific trait variability (ITV), yet evidence for its flexibility across multiple ecological scales remains poorly explored. Gaining this knowledge is essential to better understand the different processes maintaining ITV in nature. Due to their broad geographic ranges, widespread invasive species are expected to display strong phenotypic variations across their distribution. Here, we quantified the scale-dependent patterns of morphological variability among invasive populations of two global freshwater invadersred swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii and pumpkinseed sunfish Lepomis gibbosusboth established in American and European lakes. We quantified patterns in body morphology across different ecological (Individual and Population) and spatial scales (Region). We then analyzed the scale-dependency of morphological variations among lake populations that span a diversity of abiotic and biotic conditions. Next, we used stable isotope analyses to test the existence of ecomorphological patterns linking morphology and trophic niche of individuals. We found that trait variations mainly accounted for at the regional and individual levels. We showed that populations of both species strongly differed between United States and Europe whereas habitat characteristics had a relatively minor influence on morphological variations. Stable isotope analyses also revealed that ecomorphological pattern for the trophic position of L. gibbosus was region-dependent, whereas no ecomorphological patterns were observed for P. clarkii. Overall, our study strongly supports the notion that the patterns of phenotypic variability among invasive populations are likely to modulate the ecological impacts of invasive species on recipient ecosystems.

The ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes (H/L ratio) may reflect a readiness to cope with infection through injury (via heterophils) rather than with a communicable disease (via lymphocytes). Since elevated H/L ratio constitutes a corticosterone-mediated response to external stressors, this trait is generally acknowledged as the robust measure of physiological stress in vertebrates. Here, I hypothesized that baseline H/L ratios of birds (as measured under normal physiological function) could be an important evolutionary trait shaped by species' ecology and life history. I predicted that H/L ratios should be determined by traits related to pathogen exposure (migratoriness, sociality, breeding latitude) and trade-offs between investment in reproduction (clutch size) and self-maintenance (longevity). I compiled published data on leucocyte profiles for nearly 250 bird species representing over half of all extant avian orders and nearly 30% of all extant avian families. Phylogenetically informed comparative methods were used to assess evolutionary associations of H/L ratios with ecological and life-history traits across the avian tree of life. Relatively strong phylogenetic signal and phylogenetic autocorrelation in avian H/L ratios indicated that most diversification in this trait occurred relatively early in bird radiation. Fluctuating selection and drift were identified as the major forces responsible for the evolution of H/L ratios in birds, while low H/L ratios were identified as an ancestral state in birds. Finally, phylogenetically informed Bayesian models showed that H/L ratios correlated negatively with longevity and positively with sociality and breeding latitude. This study was the first to describe the patterns of avian H/L ratio evolution in a broad phylogenetic framework. The results indicate that H/L ratios should not be merely recognized as a proxy for the intraspecific variation in physiological stress, but also as an important evolutionary trait, which probably have adaptive significance visible in a wider phylogenetic perspective.

A multi-faceted approach testing the effects of previous bacterial exposure on resistance and tolerance	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel; Drosophila melanogaster; ecological immunology; immune memory; immune priming; persistent infection; resistance; tolerance	DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; GENETIC-VARIATION; IMMUNE MEMORY; FLOUR BEETLE; TRADE-OFF; INFECTION; EVOLUTION; FECUNDITY; DEFENSE; ANTIBACTERIAL	Hosts can alter their strategy towards pathogens during their lifetime; that is, they can show phenotypic plasticity in immunity or life history. Immune priming is one such example, where a previous encounter with a pathogen confers enhanced protection upon secondary challenge, resulting in reduced pathogen load (i.e., resistance) and improved host survival. However, an initial encounter might also enhance tolerance, particularly to less virulent opportunistic pathogens that establish persistent infections. In this scenario, individuals are better able to reduce the negative fecundity consequences that result from a high pathogen burden. Finally, previous exposure may also lead to life-history adjustments, such as terminal investment into reproduction. Using different Drosophila melanogaster host genotypes and two bacterial pathogens, Lactococcus lactis and Pseudomonas entomophila, we tested whether previous exposure results in resistance or tolerance and whether it modifies immune gene expression during an acute-phase infection (one day post-challenge). We then asked whether previous pathogen exposure affects chronic-phase pathogen persistence and longer-term survival (28days post-challenge). We predicted that previous exposure would increase host resistance to an early stage bacterial infection while it might come at a cost to host fecundity tolerance. We reasoned that resistance would be due in part to stronger immune gene expression after challenge. We expected that previous exposure would improve long-term survival, that it would reduce infection persistence, and we expected to find genetic variation in these responses. We found that previous exposure to P.entomophila weakened host resistance to a second infection independent of genotype and had no effect on immune gene expression. Fecundity tolerance showed genotypic variation but was not influenced by previous exposure. However, L.lactis persisted as a chronic infection, whereas survivors cleared the more pathogenic P.entomophila infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses host tolerance to bacteria in relation to previous exposure, taking a multi-faceted approach to address the topic. Our results suggest that previous exposure comes with transient costs to resistance during the early stage of infection in this host-pathogen system and that infection persistence may be bacterium-specific.

White-nose syndrome (WNS) has caused rapid declines in several North America bat species by disrupting hibernation behaviour, leading to body fat depletion and starvation. However, some populations of Myotis lucifugus now persist with WNS by unknown mechanisms. We examined whether persistence of M.lucifigus with WNS could be explained by increased body fat in early winter, which would allow bats to tolerate the increased energetic costs associated with WNS. We also investigated whether bats were escaping infection or resistant to infection as an alternative mechanism explaining persistence. We measured body fat in early and late winter during initial WNS invasion and 8years later at six sites where bats are now persisting. We also measured infection prevalence and intensity in persisting populations. Infection prevalence was not significantly lower than observed in declining populations. However, at two sites, infection loads were lower than observed in declining populations. Body fat in early winter was significantly higher in four of the six persisting populations than during WNS invasion. Physiological models of energy use indicated that these higher fat stores could reduce WNS mortality by 58%-70%. These results suggest that differences in fat storage and infection dynamics have reduced the impacts of WNS in many populations. Increases in body fat provide a potential mechanism for management intervention to help conserve bat populations.

In such cases, identifying the presence of, and drivers of trait plasticity is useful for understanding the evolution of crypsis. Previous work suggests that cryptic pigmentation of freshwater isopods (Asellus aquaticus) has evolved in response to predation pressure by fish in habitats with varying macrophyte cover and coloration. However, macrophytes can potentially influence the distribution of pigmentation by altering not only habitat-specific predation susceptibility, but also dietary resources and abiotic conditions. The goals of this study were to experimentally test how two putative agents of selection, namely macrophytes and fish, affect the pigmentation of A.aquaticus, and to assess whether pigmentation is plastic, using a diet manipulation in a common garden. We performed two experiments: (a) in an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we investigated how different densities of predatory fish (0/30/60 three-spined stickleback [Gasterosteus aculeatus] per mesocosm) and macrophytes (presence/absence) affected the abundance, pigmentation and body size structure of isopod populations. (b) In a subsequent laboratory experiment, we reared isopods in a common garden experiment on two different food sources (high/low protein content) to test whether variation in pigmentation of isopods can be explained by diet-based developmental plasticity. We found that fish presence strongly reduced isopod densities, particularly in the absence of macrophytes, but had no effect on pigmentation or size structure of the populations. However, we found that isopods showed consistently higher pigmentation in the presence of macrophytes, regardless of fish presence or absence. Our laboratory experiment, in which we manipulated the protein content of the isopods' diet, revealed strong plasticity of pigmentation and weak plasticity of growth rate. The combined results of both experiments suggest that pigmentation of A.aquaticus is a developmentally plastic trait and that multiple environmental factors (e.g. macrophytes, diet and predation) might jointly influence the evolution of cryptic pigmentation of A.aquaticus in nature on relatively short time-scales.

Yet, while both mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs) are expected to increase under global warming, latitudinal differences in the effects of DTFs have not been documented. We tested whether low-latitude populations of an ectotherm deal better with greater DTF than high-latitude populations, especially at a high mean temperature close to the optimal temperature for growth where DTF causes exposure to extreme high temperatures. We evaluated the impact of DTFs when assessing the effect of gradual thermal evolution at the high latitude with a space-for-time substitution. We compared effects of both mean temperatures (20 and 24 degrees C) and DTFs (constant=0 degrees C, low=5 degrees C and high=10 degrees C) on growth rates between low-latitude and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common-garden experiment. DTFs, if anything, reduced growth and were generally stressful as indicated by reductions in body condition, antioxidant defence and metabolic rate, and increases in oxidative damage. Most negative effects of DTFs were only present at a mean of 24 degrees C when too high temperatures were reached during a daily cycle. Notably, while 4 degrees C warming was beneficial in terms of growth rate at both latitudes at a constant temperature regime, this changed in a negative effect at high DTF. Moreover, this modulating effect of the mean temperature by DTF differed between latitudes indicating local thermal adaptation. While 4 degrees C warming at low DTF still caused faster growth in low-latitude larvae, it already slowed growth in high-latitude larvae. This supports the emerging insight that warming would increase growth in high-latitude larvae in the absence of DTF, yet would decrease growth in the more realistic scenarios with DTF. In contrast, a space-for-time substitution approach suggested that under gradual thermal evolution, the evolved high-latitude larvae would no longer suffer a growth reduction in the presence of DTF. Our study provided important proof-of-principle that jointly integrating gradual thermal evolution and the expected increase in DTF generates opposing predictions of effects of global warming on this ectotherm.

These priority effects are likely to be affected by climate warming and the rate of intraspecific predation, that is cannibalism. In a laboratory experiment, we examined size-mediated priority effects in larvae of the univoltine damselfly, Lestes sponsa, at two different temperatures (21 and 23 degrees C). We created three size groups of larvae by manipulating hatching time: early hatched with a large size (extra-advanced), intermediate hatched with an intermediate size (advanced) and late hatched with a small size (non-advanced). Thereafter, we reared the larvae from these groups in non-mixed and mixed groups of 12 larvae. We found strong priority and temperature effects. First, extra-advanced larvae most often had higher survival, growth and development rates than non-advanced larvae in mixed groups, compared to groups that consisted of only extra-advanced larvae. Second, temperature increased growth and development rates and cannibalism. However, the strength of priority effects did not differ between the two experimental temperatures, because there was no statistical interaction between temperature and treatments. That is, the mixed and non-mixed groups of non-advanced, advanced and extra-advanced larvae showed the same relative change in life-history traits across the two temperatures. Non-advanced and advanced larvae had similar or higher growth rate and mass in mixed groups compared to non-mixed groups, suggesting that predation from advanced larvae in the mixed group released resources for the non-advanced and advanced larvae that survived despite cannibalism risk. Thus, a thinning effect occurred due to cannibalism caused by priority effects. The results suggest that a shift in the relative arrival of offspring can cause temperature-dependent priority effects, mediated through cannibalism, growth and development, which may change the size distribution and abundance of emerging aquatic insects.

The ubiquitous variation in the intensity of species interactions has important consequences for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of natural populations. Nevertheless, little is known about the processes causing this variation and their operational scales. Here, we examine how variation in the intensity of a consumer-resource interaction is related to resource timing, resource density and abundance of other resources. Using the butterfly consumer Phengaris alcon and its two sequential resources, the host plant Gentiana pneumonanthe and the host ants Myrmica spp., we investigated how butterfly egg-laying depended on focal host plant phenology, density and phenology of neighbouring host plants and host ant abundance. Butterflies preferred plants that simultaneously maximized the availability of both larval resources in time and space, that is, they chose early-flowering plants that were of higher nutritional quality for larvae where host ants were abundant. Both the probability of oviposition and the number of eggs were lower in plant individuals with a high neighbour density than in more isolated plants, and this dilution effect was stronger when neighbours flowered early. Our results show that plant-herbivore interactions simultaneously depend on the spatio-temporal distribution of a focal resource and on the small-scale spatial variation in the abundance of other herbivore resources. Given that consumers have negative effects on fitness and prefer certain timing of the resource organisms, this implies that processes acting at the levels of individuals, populations and communities simultaneously contribute to variation in consumer-mediated natural selection.

While it is typically thought that production is optimized at the individual-cell level, secreted compounds could also allow for optimization at the group level, leading to a division of labor where a subset of cells produces and shares the compound with everyone. Using mathematical modeling, we show that the evolution of such division of labor depends on the cost function of compound production. Specifically, for any trait with saturating benefits, linear costs promote the evolution of uniform production levels across cells. Conversely, production costs that diminish with higher output levels favor the evolution of specialization-especially when compound shareability is high. When experimentally testing these predictions with pyoverdine, a secreted iron-scavenging compound produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we found linear costs and, consistent with our model, detected uniform pyoverdine production levels across cells. We conclude that for shared compounds with saturating benefits, the evolution of division of labor is facilitated by a diminishing cost function. More generally, we note that shifts in the level of selection from individuals to groups do not solely require cooperation, but critically depend on mechanistic factors, including the distribution of compound synthesis costs.

While much effort has been spent examining the morphological pathways to elongation in these clades, quantitative investigations into the evolution of elongation in endothermic clades are lacking. We quantified body shape in 61 musteloid mammals (red panda, skunks, raccoons, and weasels) using the head-body elongation ratio. We also examined the morphological changes that may underlie the evolution toward more extreme body plans. We found that a mustelid clade comprised of the subfamilies Helictidinae, Guloninae, Ictonychinae, Mustelinae, and Lutrinae exhibited an evolutionary transition toward more elongate bodies. Furthermore, we discovered that elongation of the body is associated with the evolution of other key traits such as a reduction in body size and a reduction in forelimb length but not hindlimb length. This relationship between body elongation and forelimb length has not previously been quantitatively established for mammals but is consistent with trends exhibited by ectothermic vertebrates and suggests a common pattern of trait covariance associated with body shape evolution. This study provides the framework for documenting body shapes across a wider range of mammalian clades to better understand the morphological changes influencing shape disparity across all vertebrates.

The genetic consequences of such hybridization depend critically on the dynamics of the range expansion. Hybridization models during range expansion have been developed but assume dispersal to be independent from neighboring population densities. However, organisms may disperse because they are attracted by conspecifics or because they prefer depopulated areas. Here, through spatially explicit simulations, we assess the effect of various density-dependent dispersal modes on the introgression between two species. We find huge introgression from the local species into the invasive one with all dispersal modes investigated, even when the hybridization rate is relatively low. This represents a general expectation for neutral genes even if the dispersal modes differ in colonization times and amount of introgression. Invasive individuals attracted by conspecifics need more time to colonize the whole area and are more introgressed by local genes, whereas the opposite is found for solitary individuals. We applied our approach to a recent expansion of European wildcats in the Jura Mountains and the hybridization with domestic cats. We show that the simulations explained better the observed level of introgression at nuclear, mtDNA, and Y chromosome markers, when using solitary dispersal for wildcats instead of random or gregarious dispersal, in accordance with ecological knowledge. Thus, use of density-dependent dispersal models increases the predictive power of the approach.

Directional selection on body size but no apparent survival cost to being large in wild New Zealand giraffe weevils	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Alternative reproductive tactics; brentidae; exaggerated traits; mark-recapture; sexual selection; size-assortative mating	MALE MATE CHOICE; ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS; LIFETIME MATING SUCCESS; SEXUAL SELECTION; SPERM COMPETITION; FERTILIZATION SUCCESS; FEMALE ORNAMENTS; TRADE-OFFS; DANCE FLY; BEETLE	When an individual's reproductive success relies on winning fights to secure mating opportunities, bearing larger weapons is advantageous. However, sexual selection can be extremely complex, and over an animal's life the opportunity to mate is influenced by numerous factors. We studied a wild population of giraffe weevils (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis) that exhibit enormous intra and intersexual size variation. Males bear an elongated rostrum used as a weapon in fights for mating opportunities. However, small males also employ sneaking behavior as an alternative reproductive tactic. We investigated sexual selection on size by tracking individual males and females daily over two 30-day periods to measure long-term mating success. We also assessed how survival and recapture probabilities vary with sex and size to determine whether there might be a survival cost associated with size. We found evidence for directional selection on size through higher mating success, but no apparent survival trade-off. Instead, larger individuals mate more often and have a higher survival probability, suggesting an accumulation of benefits to bigger individuals. Furthermore, we found evidence of size assortative mating where males appear to selectively mate with bigger females. Larger and more competitive males secure matings with larger females more frequently than smaller males, which may further increase their fitness.

However, it remains unclear if the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between sex-specific traits required for behavioral isolation results mostly from physical linkage between signal and preference loci or from directional mate preferences. Here, we test this in the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis. These closely related species diverged with gene flow and have strongly differentiated songs and preference functions for the mate calling song rhythm. We map quantitative trait loci for signal and preference traits (pQTL) as well as for gene expression associated with these traits (eQTL). We find strong, positive genetic covariance between song traits and between song and preference. Our results show that this is in part explained by incomplete physical linkage: although both linked pQTL and eQTL couple male and female traits, major effect loci for different traits were never on the same chromosome. We suggest that the finely tuned, highly divergent preference functions are likely an additional source of LD between male and female traits in this system. Furthermore, pleiotropy of gene expression presents an underappreciated mechanism to link sexually dimorphic phenotypes.	[Blankers, Thomas; Hennig, R.

Two stochastic processes shape diverse senescence patterns in a single-cell organism	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Aging models; bacteria aging; biodemography; evolution of aging; heterogeneity; senescence	GENE-EXPRESSION; MORTALITY MODELS; LIFE-HISTORIES; HETEROGENEITY; VARIABILITY; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; BACTERIA; SEGREGATION; GROWTH	Despite advances in aging research, a multitude of aging models, and empirical evidence for diverse senescence patterns, understanding of the biological processes that shape senescence is lacking. We show that senescence of an isogenic Escherichia coli bacterial population results from two stochastic processes. The first process is a random deterioration process within the cell, such as generated by random accumulation of damage. This primary process leads to an exponential increase in mortality early in life followed by a late age mortality plateau. The second process relates to the stochastic asymmetric transmission at cell fission of an unknown factor that influences mortality. This secondary process explains the difference between the classical mortality plateaus detected for young mothers' offspring and the near nonsenescence of old mothers' offspring as well as the lack of a mother-offspring correlation in age at death. We observed that lifespan is predominantly determined by underlying stochastic stage dynamics. Surprisingly, our findings support models developed for metazoans that base their arguments on stage-specific actions of alleles to understand the evolution of senescence. We call for exploration of similar stochastic influences that shape aging patterns beyond simple organisms.

Pollination by wild bees yields larger strawberries than pollination by honey bees	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						agriculture; crop yield; honey bees; pollination; species richness; strawberry; wild bees	SPECIES RICHNESS; APIS-MELLIFERA; FRUIT-SET; POLLEN DEPOSITION; CROSS-POLLINATION; NATIVE BEES; DIVERSITY; INCREASES; HYMENOPTERA; VISITS	A diverse array of wild bee species may provide more effective pollination than the widely employed European honey bee (Apis mellifera L.). High species richness within crop pollinator assemblages has been linked to enhanced fruit and seed yields, but species richness is often confounded with abundance in studies of pollinator communities. We investigated the effects of bee diversity and species identity on pollen deposition and crop yield in the strawberry (Fragariaxananassa) variety Jewel through a field experiment that independently manipulated the species richness and abundance of flower visitors. We used a new pollen deposition measurement technique to determine the pollen contribution of individual bees in an assemblage of flower visits. We compared the performance of wild bee species and managed honey bees, as pollinators of strawberry. We also calculated the influence of species richness, visit frequency and visitor identity on fruit mass, using the fruit that developed from each sampled flower. Species richness of flower visitors did not influence floral pollen loads or strawberry mass. Honey bees and wild bees deposited the same amount of pollen per visited flower. However, strawberries that developed from flowers visited by wild bees were heavier than flowers visited by honey bees. In addition, flowers visited by a combination of wild and honey bees produced strawberries that weighed less than flowers receiving purely WB visits.Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that honey bee pollination results in lower yields than wild bee pollination in a strawberry crop. Consequently, if managed honey bees in strawberry fields displace wild pollinators, growers may obtain suboptimal yields. Management efforts aimed at the maintenance or enhancement of wild pollinator populations may therefore be a cost-effective way to increase both crop yield and biodiversity on strawberry farms.

Light availability is often regulated by forest management, thus understanding how these resources co-limit the regeneration success of tree species and populations with contrasting drought tolerances is essential for adaptive forest management and particularly for assisted migration. We studied biomass partitioning of 3-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and European black pine (Pinus nigra) seedlings in response to combined effects of light (22% and 40% shade), soil water availability (moist and dry conditions) and CO2 (ambient and elevated), and examined the responses of seedlings from Central Alpine and Mediterranean origin. Seedlings of nine populations with varying drought tolerances were grown in a common garden in the European Central Alps. Shoot height, vertical root length, shoot and root biomass of the plants were assessed at the end of the third growing season. Under 40% shade and dry conditions, P.sylvestris seedlings severely reduced shoot biomass, resulting in an increased specific shoot height (SSH) compared to seedlings under 22% shade and moist conditions. In contrast, P.nigra seedlings retained a constant shoot biomass under all treatment combinations. Seedlings from drier origin were generally larger, heavier and had longer vertical roots than those from wetter locations. In order to keep up shoot height, seedlings from wetter origins disproportionately increased SSH under shaded conditions compared to populations from drier origin.Synthesis and applications. Under high light availability, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and European black pine (Pinus nigra) seedlings were well adapted to dry conditions. Moderate shading, however, substantially reduced Scots pine but not black pine growth, and potentially amplified the vulnerability of Scots pine seedlings to drought. Optimising light conditions in forests, for example by thinning, may thus enhance early Scots pine regeneration in a drier future climate.

Age-dependent habitat relationships of a burned forest specialist emphasise the role of pyrodiversity in fire management	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						black-backed woodpecker; fire severity; forest management; habitat selection; landscape heterogeneity; Picoides arcticus; pyrodiversity; wildfire	SIERRA-NEVADA; SELECTION; ECOLOGY; CALIFORNIA; SURVIVAL; WILDFIRE; SIZE	Variation in fire characteristics, termed pyrodiversity, plays an important role in structuring post-fire communities, but little is known about the importance of pyrodiversity for individual species. The availability of diverse post-fire habitats may be key for fire-associated species if they require different resources at different life-history stages. We tested for age-specific habitat relationships in the black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire specialist. We used radio-telemetry to track fledgling and adult woodpeckers in burned forests and built resource selection functions to compare the effect of stand-, tree- and snag-level covariates between adults and fledglings. Fledgling black-backed woodpeckers selected habitat with more live trees than adults and used more heterogeneous habitats burned at lower severity, illustrating strong age-dependent effects on habitat selection. Within selected stands, fledglings were less likely to use snags and more likely to use live trees when compared to adults, but both age classes showed strong positive selection for larger-diameter trees (live and dead). Over the 60days after leaving their nests, fledglings showed an increasing propensity to use snags rather than live trees. Our results provide evidence that the predation-starvation hypothesis, which posits a trade-off between foraging efficiency and the need to minimise predation risk, plays a role in structuring the age-dependent habitat use of a burned forest specialist. Adult black-backed woodpeckers selected resources associated with food availability, but these resources occurred in relatively open, exposed habitat. Fledglings selected habitat that provided increased cover, perhaps as a strategy to reduce predation risk.Synthesis and applications. Globally, fires are increasing in severity and extent, leading to increased focus on fire-associated species that play keystone roles in facilitating biodiversity resilience. Our findings suggest that a diversity of patches burned at different severities may benefit post-fire specialists like the black-backed woodpecker at multiple life-history stages. The increasing prevalence of large, homogeneously high-severity megafires' may present an emerging threat even to post-fire specialists, and we urge land managers to consider opportunities to promote pyrodiversity in the face of novel fire regimes.

Conventional methods for enhancing connectivity in conservation planning do not always maintain gene flow	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						alpine plants; connectivity; gene flow; integer programming; landscape genetics; optimization; spatial prioritization; systematic conservation planning	LANDSCAPE; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; MODELS; SURROGATES; RESISTANCE; SELECTION; DISTANCE; HISTORY; DESIGN	Protected area systems need to conserve species in places with suitable habitat that are configured to facilitate gene flow. Since genetic data require considerable resources to obtain, many proxy methods have been developed to generate plans for protected area systems (prioritizations) that facilitate gene flow without needing genetic data. However, the effectiveness of such methodssuch as minimising fragmentation or enforcing contiguity among priority areasremains largely untested. We investigated the ability of prioritizations to maintain gene flow when they are generated using conventional methods for promoting connectivity. Using existing environmental, genetic, and occurrence datasets, we created maps of habitat suitability and resistance to gene flow for nine alpine plant species. Next, we generated multispecies prioritizations that secured 10% of the suitable habitat for each species and attempted to maintain gene flow by (a) penalizing fragmentation, (b) representing species in contiguous areas of suitable habitat, and (c) representing species in contiguous areas with minimal resistance to gene flow as modelled from genetic data. We found that prioritizations generated using fragmentation penalties failed to represent seven of the nine species in areas that would maintain high levels of gene flow. Similarly, prioritizations that represented species in contiguous areas of suitable habitat were unable to maintain high levels of gene flow for six speciespotentially because a few areas with high resistance can disrupt gene flow throughout an entire prioritization. Although prioritizations generated using genetic data successfully maintained gene flow, they also selected over three times more land than other prioritizations, suggesting that failing to account for gene flow when setting priorities may underestimate the scale of conservation action required. Synthesis and applications. We found that conventional methods for enhancing connectivity in conservation planning, such as spatially clustering priority areas or providing connected sections of suitable habitat, were generally unable to maintain high levels of gene flow. Our results suggest that conservation plans could be substantially improved by directly using genetic data, although whether this is a good choice for a particular situation will also depend on the costs of obtaining these data.

We linked transmission potential of multiple vector species to observed patterns of enzootic pathogen transmission by conducting longitudinal field surveillance of West Nile virus (WNv) infections in Culex spp. mosquitoes and avian host communities in the southeast U.S. We then used a temperature-dependent vectorial capacity model as a predictor of WNv infections in mosquitoes and birds using general linear mixed effects models. Two WNv-competent Culex spp. mosquitoes were present in our study sites, Culex restuans Theobald during the spring and Culex quinquefasciatus Say during the summer. Empirical evidence of WNv transmission was limited exclusively to time periods when night time temperatures were suitable for accelerated within-vector viral replication, susceptible avian hosts (i.e. hatch year birds) were abundant and Cx. quinquefasciatus was the primary Culex spp. vector in the mosquito community. Contrary to theoretical predictions, increased presence of competent vector species through time did not significantly increase the prevalence of infections in the WNv enzootic system. Synthesis and applications. We extend a common theoretical model to both estimate the transmission potential of a mosquito community for West Nile virus (WNv) and quantify the relative contribution of two Culex mosquito species (Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex restuans) to observed patterns of WNv in the southeast U.S. Our findings suggest that to reduce the risk of human exposure to WNv in urban environments, vector control should focus on the primary WNv vector, Cx. quinquefasciatus. Additionally, vector control may be more effective if it coincides with the onset of the avian breeding season, when most WNv amplification occurs. Moreover, our results highlight relevant knowledge gaps pertaining to WNv transmission by secondary mosquito species that coexist either in time or space with Cx. quinquefasciatus. A better understanding of secondary WNv vector species is greatly needed in order to appropriately gauge their role in pathogen transmission dynamics.

Hyperabundant herbivores limit habitat availability and influence nest site selection of Arctic-breeding birds	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arctic; habitat alteration; habitat availability; nest site selection; overabundant; Ross' goose; shorebird; snow goose	NORTH-AMERICAN SHOREBIRDS; LESSER SNOW GEESE; POPULATION DECLINES; DISTURBANCE; VEGETATION; TRENDS; DESTRUCTION; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; LEGACY	Understanding an organism's habitat selection and behavioural flexibility in the face of environmental change can help managers plan for future conservation of that species. Hyperabundant tundra-nesting geese are influencing Arctic environments through their foraging activities. Goose-induced habitat change in Arctic wetlands may influence the availability of habitat for numerous shorebird species that breed sympatrically with geese. We explore whether goose-induced habitat alteration affects shorebird breeding density and nest site selection. Using habitat data collected at sites with High, Moderate and Low goose influence, and samples collected during two periods separated by 11years, we document the habitat characteristics influenced by geese. We describe the habitat characteristics preferred by shorebirds and relate their availability to goose influence and shorebird density. Finally, we examine whether shorebird nest site selection has changed over time and whether shorebirds select nest sites differently in habitat influenced by geese. We document spatial and temporal changes in sedge meadow habitat and lateral concealment relating to goose influence. The availability of sedge meadow habitat and the degree of lateral concealment declined with increasing goose influence, and also declined at two sites over the 11years of the study. Densities of both cover- and open-nesting shorebirds were highest where goose influence was lowest. At sites with Low goose influence, cover-nesting shorebirds selected nest sites with more sedge meadow and concealment than at sites with Moderate and High goose influence, presumably because these high-quality sites were more available. Synthesis and applications. Intensive foraging by a colony of hyperabundant geese is limiting the availability of preferred nesting habitat and densities of sympatric-nesting shorebirds. Where goose-induced habitat alteration is pronounced shorebird species that select concealed nest sites are nesting in areas with lower concealment and less sedge meadow. Studies examining the degree to which these effects scale up to impact the population sizes of declining shorebirds should be considered a future research priority. Moreover, management strategies for geese should incorporate the habitat needs of sympatric species and reinvigorate efforts for goose population reduction in order to achieve the population targets articulated by management agencies.

Winter Precipitation and Summer Temperature Predict Lake water Quality at Macroscales	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; ICE COVER; LAND-USE; RESPONSES; NUTRIENT; TRENDS; PHOSPHORUS; IMPACTS; PATTERNS; NITROGEN	Climate change can have strong effects on aquatic ecosystems, including disrupting nutrient cycling and mediating processes that affect primary production. Past studies have been conducted mostly on individual or small groups of ecosystems, making it challenging to predict how future climate change will affect water quality at broad scales. We used a subcontinental-scale database to address three objectives: (1) identify which climate metrics best predict lake water quality, (2) examine whether climate influences different nutrient and productivity measures similarly, and (3) quantify the potential effects of a changing climate on lakes. We used climate data to predict lake water quality in similar to 11,000 north temperate lakes across 17 U.S. states. We developed a novel machine learning method that jointly models different measures of water quality using 48 climate metrics and accounts for properties inherent in macroscale data (e.g., spatial autocorrelation). Our results suggest that climate metrics related to winter precipitation and summer temperature were strong predictors of lake nutrients and productivity. However, we found variation in the magnitude and direction of the relationship between climate and water quality. We predict that a likely future climate change scenario of warmer summer temperatures will lead to increased nutrient concentrations and algal biomass across lakes (median similar to 3%-9% increase), whereas increased winter precipitation will have highly variable effects. Our results emphasize the importance of heterogeneity in the response of individual ecosystems to climate and are a caution to extrapolating relationships across space.	[Collins, S. M.; Oliver, S.

BayGEN employs a hierarchical framework with data, process, and parameter layers. In the data layer, precipitation occurrence at each site is modeled using probit regression using a spatially distributed latent Gaussian process; precipitation amounts are modeled as gamma random variables; and minimum and maximum temperatures are modeled as realizations from Gaussian processes. The latent Gaussian process that drives the precipitation occurrence process is modeled in the process layer. In the parameter layer, the model parameters of the data and process layers are modeled as spatially distributed Gaussian processes, consequently enabling the simulation of daily weather at arbitrary (unobserved) locations or on a regular grid. All model parameters are endowed with weakly informative prior distributions. The No-U Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, is used to maximize the model likelihood function and obtain posterior samples of each parameter. Posterior samples of the model parameters propagate uncertainty to the weather simulations, an important feature that makes BayGEN unique compared to traditional weather generators. We demonstrate the utility of BayGEN with application to daily weather generation in a basin of the Argentine Pampas. Furthermore, we evaluate the implications of crop yield by driving a crop simulation model with weather simulations from BayGEN and an equivalent non-Bayesian weather generator.

Quantification and Prediction of Nighttime Evapotranspiration for Two Distinct Grassland Ecosystems	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; BOUNDARY-LAYER; HEAT WAVES; SAP FLOW; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; ALPINE GRASSLAND; EDDY COVARIANCE; FILTER ROUTINE; TRANSPIRATION; LYSIMETER	Evapotranspiration (ET) is, after precipitation, the second largest flux at the land surface in the water cycle and occurs mainly during daytime. Less attention has been given to water fluxes from the land surface into the atmosphere during nighttime (i.e., between sunset and sunrise). The nighttime ET (ETN ) may be estimated based on models that use meteorological data; however, due to missing experimental long-term data, the verification of ETN estimates is limited. In this paper, the amount of ETN for two grassland ecosystems was determined from highly temporally resolved and precise weighing lysimeter data. We found that annual ETN ranged between 3.5% and 9.5% of daytime annual ET (ETD) and occurred mainly during wet soil and canopy surface conditions, which suggests that ETN is largely related to evaporation. ETN was positively correlated with wind speed. Dew formation, ranging from 4.8% to 6.4% of annual precipitation, was in absolute terms larger than ETN. The prediction of ETN with the Penman-Monteith model improved if the aerodynamic and surface resistance parameters were based on vegetation height observations and the nighttime stomatal resistance parameter was assumed to be zero. The occurrence of hot days during the observation period showed to increase average ETN rates. Our results suggest that ETN can be observed with precision weighing lysimeters, was a not negligible component in the water balance of the grassland ecosystems, and thus needs more attention when simulating land surface hydrological processes.

An Unstable Monoterpene Alcohol as a Pheromone Component of the Longhorned Beetle Paranoplium gracile (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cerambycidae; Aggregation-sex pheromone; Male-produced pheromone; Terpenoid; p-Mentha-1,3-dien-8-ol; alpha,alpha,4-Trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene-1-methanol		We report the identification of p-mentha-1,3-dien-8-ol, an unstable monoterpene alcohol, as a male-produced aggregation-sex pheromone component of the cerambycid beetle Paranoplium gracile (Leconte) (subfamily Cerambycinae, tribe Oemini), a species endemic to California. Headspace volatiles from live males contained a blend of nine cyclic terpenoids that were not detected in analogous samples from females. Volatiles produced by male Eudistenia costipennis Fall, also in the tribe Oemini, contained the same suite of nine compounds. Four compounds, dehydro-p-cymene, p-mentha-1,3-dien-8-ol, p,alpha,alpha-trimethylbenzyl alcohol, and an unidentified compound were found to elicit responses from antennae of P. gracile females in coupled gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD) assays, whereas only p-mentha-1,3-dien-8-ol elicited responses from antennae of males. In field assays, p-mentha-1,3-dien-8-ol stabilized with the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) attracted P. gracile of both sexes, indicating it functions as an aggregation-sex pheromone, as with other pheromones identified from its subfamily, the Cerambycinae. Adding four of the other compounds found in headspace samples to the dienol lure had no effect on attraction. Because of the instability of p-mentha-1,3-dien-8-ol, it seems likely that at least some of the compounds seen in the extracts of volatiles from both species are artefacts, rather than being components of the pheromone.

Walp. To understand the mechanism underpinning this behavior, we studied the responses of M. sjostedti to headspace volatiles from conspecifics in a four-arm olfactometer. Both male and female M. sjostedti were attracted to male, but not to female odor. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses revealed the presence of two distinct compounds in male M. sjostedti headspace, namely (R)-lavandulyl 3-methylbutanoate (major compound) and (R)-lavandulol (minor compound); by contrast, both compounds were only present in trace amounts in female headspace collections. A behavioral assay using synthetic compounds showed that male M. sjostedti was attracted to both (R)-lavandulyl 3-methylbutanoate and (R)-lavandulol, while females responded only to (R)-lavandulyl 3-methylbutanoate. This is the first report of a male-produced aggregation pheromone in the genus Megalurothrips. The bean flower thrips is the primary pest of cowpea, which is widely grown in sub-Saharan Africa. The attraction of male and female M. sjostedti to these compounds offers an opportunity to develop ecologically sustainable management methods for M. sjostedti in Africa.

We previously reported that d-pinitol, a cyclitol found in fresh leaves of A. julibrissin, solely elicits moderate oviposition responses from females. However, the aqueous neutral/amphoteric fraction of the fresh leaf extract containing d-pinitol weakly induces oviposition. Moreover, the aqueous neutral/amphoteric/basic fraction was significantly more active than the neutral/amphoteric fraction in eliciting responses, indicating that some basic compounds are involved in stimulating oviposition. High-resolution mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance measurements revealed that the aqueous basic faction contains N,N,N-trimethylglycine (trivial name: glycine betaine) in alkali metal salt form. The average concentration of this quaternary ammonium compound in fresh leaves was estimated to be 0.012% w/w in high performance liquid chromatography analyses. The authentic N,N,N-trimethylglycine induced oviposition at concentrations greater than 0.001% (w/v) and slightly enhanced female responses to the aqueous neutral fraction and authentic d-pinitol. However, its analogues, N,N-dimethylglycine, N-methylglycine, and glycine as well as its precursor choline were inactive. These results demonstrate that N,N,N-trimethylglycine, together with d-pinitol, serves as an stimulant of E. mandarina for oviposition on the leaves of A. julibrissin.

However, little is known about the effect of such negative incidences on their subsequent host-searching behavior. We tested this effect in a tritrophic system of maize plants (Zea mays), common armyworms (hosts), tobacco cutworms (nonhosts), and parasitoid wasps, Cotesia kariyai. We used oviposition inexperienced C. kariyai and negative-experienced individuals that had expressed oviposition behavior toward nonhosts on nonhost-infested maize leaves. We first observed the olfactory behavior of C. kariyai to volatiles from host-infested plants or nonhost-infested plants in a wind tunnel. Negative-experienced wasps showed significantly lower rates of taking-off behavior (Step-1), significantly longer duration until landing (Step-2), and lower rates of landing behavior (Step-3) toward nonhost-infested plants than inexperienced wasps. However, the negative-experience did not affect these three steps toward host-infested plants. A negative experience appears to have negatively affected the olfactory responses to nonhost-infested plants. The chemical analyses suggested that the wasps associated (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, a compound that was emitted more in nonhost-infested plants, with the negative experience, and reduced their response to nonhost-infested plants. Furthermore, we observed that the searching duration of wasps on either nonhost- or host-infested plants (Step-4) was reduced on both plant types after the negative experiences. Therefore, the negative experience in Step-4 would be nonadaptive for wasps on host-infested plants. Our study indicated that the density (i.e., possible encounters) of nonhost species as well as that of host species in the field should be considered when assessing the host-searching behavior of parasitoid wasps.

Development of Monitoring Techniques for Endangered Spring Endemic Invertebrates: An Assessment of Abundance	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						density estimates; endangered invertebrates; power analysis; springsnails; survey design	NORTH-AMERICAN SPRINGSNAIL; STATISTICAL POWER; PAGE SPRINGSNAIL; LIFE-HISTORY; PYRGULOPSIS; CONSERVATION; HYDROBIIDAE; POPULATIONS; CRUSTACEA; ACCURACY	We monitored Roswell springsnail (Pyrgulopsis roswellensis), Koster's springsnail (Juturnia kosteri), and Noel's amphipod (Gammarus desperatus), three endangered aquatic invertebrates, from 2014 through 2017 at Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Chaves County, New Mexico. We initiated the effort to develop baseline abundance estimates in a rigorous, repeatable framework, and to inform long-term monitoring efforts. Surveys were focused on three spring systems. Density estimates for the two species of springsnails combined ranged from 7870 +/- 1693 SE snails per m(2) (CV = 22%) to 39,704 +/- 10,035 SE snails per m(2) (CV = 25%) in the three systems combined. Noel's amphipod density estimates ranged from 144 +/- 42 SE individuals per m(2) (CV = 29%) to 404 +/- 109 SE individuals per m(2) (CV = 27%). We can detect a proportional change (alpha = 0.1, power = 0.8) in density ranging from 30% to 60% in Bitter Creek, Sago Springs, and the Snail Unit. We predicted increases in statistical power that could be gained from increases in survey effort. Because of seasonal changes in density in some systems, year-to-year evaluation of trends must be focused on a given season. Likewise, seasonal changes in spring flows may impact density estimates. We provide estimates of density, precision, and power that can inform future efforts to monitor both species status and restoration efforts.

Using Long-Term Population Monitoring Data to Prioritize Conservation Action among Rare Plant Species	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						count-based population viability analysis; plant conservation; population monitoring; rare plant; resource prioritization	ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY; EXTINCTION; DYNAMICS; RISKS	The decline and extinction of native plant species is a global conservation crisis, and there is a need for rapid prioritization of our conservation efforts. In the USA, the two main systems used to identify at-risk species, Threatened and Endangered (T&E) status and conservation status ranks by Nature Serve (G- and S-ranks), are categorical and typically assessed with large-scale criteria, thus are not ideal to aid practitioners in developing priorities at smaller scales. Our goal was to develop a continuous risk assignment for plant species using monitoring data collected at a smaller scale so that limited conservation resources can be better prioritized among at-risk species. To do this, we modified a count-based population viability analysis to produce two regional, species-level viability metrics: a regional growth rate and a regional 50-y probability of extinction. Our validation exercises confirmed these metrics could reliability place 24 rare forb species along a continuous scale of viability. We identified nine species (37.5% of those analyzed) in need of conservation effort in northern Illinois. The challenges we faced developing these metrics and our solutions are discussed more generally to improve rare plant species monitoring practices. Overall, this method is an innovative expansion of the use of population size monitoring data to inform conservation beyond the population.

This region possesses several attributes that contribute to landscape resilience, including topographic variability, high species diversity, geological heterogeneity, and landscape connectivity. However, individual communities within the region may have different levels of resiliency. We used a 19-year study of forest change in two adjacent Cumberland Plateau communities to test for differences in ecological resistance to species loss. We found that the study area experienced a net loss of 7 species, with more species disappearing from the cove (-9 species) than the upland (-3 species). In the cove forest, the smallest size classes experienced significant species loss, with a mean loss of 4.8 and 6.0 species for sapling size classes, leading to a skewed size distribution with the majority of woody species represented by large adults. Upland communities maintained their structure, possibly due to a greater prevalence of stem and root sprouting species. From these results, we conclude that the upland community was more resistant to species loss and better maintained its structure compared to the cove community. Differential change between two adjacent communities highlights that the purported landscape resilience of the southern Cumberland Plateau may vary between its two most dominant communities.

Understanding the relationship this forest has with not only climate factors but also with past human activity is important. This study aims to analyze the species composition and structure of sessile oak forests that form the xeric limit populations as well as examine the effect environmental factors have on them. The work was focused on the southernmost sessile oak forest, the Montseny Massif populations, which have a marked environmental Mediterranean influence. The sessile oak forest types were defined from field inventories and a cluster analysis classified the inventoried stands into five forest types. The compositional differences among the forest types were the result of past land uses and the intensity of forestry activity 50 y ago. Furthermore, the species composition is influenced by environmental factors, because more hydric stress promotes Mediterranean species. The study concludes that sessile oak are recovering from past forestry activity.

On the surface of the southern Cumberland Plateau in Tennessee, abandoned agricultural and home sites are characterized by unusual assemblages of tree species and ground cover, as well as light artifact scatters. To better understand the legacies of past land use on soil properties and forest composition in this region, we intensively sampled three home sites that were abandoned more than 70 y ago and compared them to adjacent forest controls. The home sites had significantly higher concentrations (soil A horizons) for eight of the fourteen elements studied. After examining our plots in ordination space by soil variables, we found that surface soil calcium and phosphorus concentrations were negatively associated to control plots and were the best indicators of intensive human disturbance. Sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum) had the highest importance value in the control forest, and the 23rd highest importance value at the home sites. There were 34 different species encountered at the home sites, including many species usually found at lower elevations in limestone-derived soils (e.g., Celtis occidentalis, Juglans nigra, Viburnum rufidulum, Fraxinus spp.). We recovered historic artifacts and charcoal from surface soils at all three sites, and prehistoric artifacts were found at two sites. Abandoned home sites are common throughout the eastern deciduous forest and evidence from this study indicates that land use legacies continue to influence forest dynamics several decades after anthropogenic inputs ceased.

Variation in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) transcription profiles among and within eight population crosses from British Columbia, Canada	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Chinook salmon; local adaptation; population genetics; transcriptomics	POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; ATLANTIC SALMON; GENE-EXPRESSION; NATURAL-SELECTION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; LOCAL ADAPTATION; QUANTITATIVE PCR; EVOLUTION; WILD; TIME	Phenotypic differences among populations within a species have been reported for a variety of traits, ranging from life history to physiology to gene transcription. Population-level phenotypic variation has been attributed to genetic differences resulting from genetic drift and/or local adaptation as well as environmental differences resulting from plasticity. We studied population- and family-level variation in gene transcription for 22 fitness-related genes, comprising immune, growth, metabolic, and stress processes in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We created hybrid Chinook salmon families from eight populations and treated them with an immune stimulus, a handling stress challenge, and held some as a no-treatment control group. Population effects, sire effects, and narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) were calculated for each candidate gene within each treatment group. We expected population to have a significant effect on gene transcription for many of our genes; however, we found a population effect for transcription at only one immune gene at rest. The limited number of significant population effects on gene transcription, combined with significant additive genetic variance within each population does not support the expectation of past strong selection pressures acting on heritable transcription profiles among populations. Instead, our results indicate that Chinook salmon likely adapt to their local environment through transcriptional plasticity rather than fixed differences. The expectation for fixed population-level differences in gene transcription at fitness-related genes, reflecting accepted models of local adaptation is high; however, comparisons among multiple populations using half-sibling breeding designs are rare. Our work fills an important gap in our growing understanding of the process of among and within-population divergence.

Higher contribution of globally rare bacterial taxa reflects environmental transitions across the surface ocean	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						dispersal; environmental transitions; global surface ocean; Malaspina expedition; marine prokaryotic communities; rare bacteria; spatial abundance distribution	PLANKTONIC BACTERIA; LIFE-STYLES; SEED BANK; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; MICROBES; ECOLOGY; SHAPE	Microbial taxa range from being ubiquitous and abundant across space to extremely rare and endemic, depending on their ecophysiology and on different processes acting locally or regionally. However, little is known about how cosmopolitan or rare taxa combine to constitute communities and whether environmental variations promote changes in their relative abundances. Here we identified the Spatial Abundance Distribution (SpAD) of individual prokaryotic taxa (16S rDNA-defined Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) across 108 globally-distributed surface ocean stations. We grouped taxa based on their SpAD shape ("normal-like"- abundant and ubiquitous; "logistic"- globally rare, present in few sites; and "bimodal"- abundant only in certain oceanic regions), and investigated how the abundance of these three categories relates to environmental gradients. Most surface assemblages were numerically dominated by a few cosmopolitan "normal-like" OTUs, yet there was a gradual shift towards assemblages dominated by "logistic" taxa in specific areas with productivity and temperature differing the most from the average conditions in the sampled stations. When we performed the SpAD categorization including additional habitats (deeper layers and particles of varying sizes), the SpAD of many OTUs changed towards fewer "normal-like" shapes, and OTUs categorized as globally rare in the surface ocean became abundant. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms behind microbial rarity and dominance requires expanding the context of study beyond local communities and single habitats. We show that marine bacterial communities comprise taxa displaying a continuum of SpADs, and that variations in their abundances can be linked to habitat transitions or barriers that delimit the distribution of community members.

Extant landraces are surviving genetic archives, keeping signatures of the selection processes experienced by them until settling in their current niches. This study intends to establish relationships between genetic diversity of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) landraces collected in Spain and the climate of their collection sites. A high-resolution climatic data set (5 x 5 km spatial, 1-day temporal grid) was computed from over 2,000 temperature and 7,000 precipitation stations across peninsular Spain. This data set, spanning the period 1981-2010, was used to derive agroclimatic variables meaningful for cereal production at the collection sites of 135 barley landraces. Variables summarize temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, potential vernalization and frost probability at different times of the year and time scales (season and month). SNP genotyping of the landraces was carried out combining Illumina Infinium assays and genotyping-by-sequencing, yielding 9,920 biallelic markers (7,479 with position on the barley reference genome). The association of these SNPs with agroclimatic variables was analysed at two levels of genetic diversity, with and without taking into account population structure. The whole data sets and analysis pipelines are documented and available at . We found differential adaptation of the germplasm groups identified to be dominated by reactions to cold temperature and late-season frost occurrence, as well as to water availability. Several significant associations pointing at specific adaptations to agroclimatic features related to temperature and water availability were observed, and candidate genes underlying some of the main regions are proposed.

These taxa respond to light on the skin of their elongate hind-bodies and tails by withdrawing under cover to avoid detection by predators. Here, we investigated tail phototaxis in sea snakes (Hydrophiinae), the only reptiles reported to exhibit this sensory behaviour. We conducted behavioural tests in 17 wild-caught sea snakes of eight species by illuminating the dorsal surface of the tail and midbody skin using cold white, violet, blue, green and red light. Our results confirmed phototactic tail withdrawal in the previously studied Aipysurus laevis, revealed this trait for the first time in A. duboisii and A. tenuis, and suggested that tail photoreceptors have peak spectral sensitivities between blue and green light (457-514 nm). Based on these results, and an absence of photoresponses in five Aipysurus and Hydrophis species, we tentatively infer that tail phototaxis evolved in the ancestor of a clade of six Aipysurus species (comprising 10% of all sea snakes). Quantifying tail damage, we found that the probability of sustaining tail injuries was not influenced by tail phototactic ability in snakes. Gene profiling showed that transcriptomes of both tail skin and body skin lacked visual opsins but contained melanopsin (opn4x) in addition to key genes of the retinal regeneration and phototransduction cascades. This work suggests that a nonvisual photoreceptor (e.g., Gq rhabdomeric) signalling pathway underlies tail phototaxis, and provides candidate gene targets for future studies of this unusual sensory innovation in reptiles.

In this study, we use broad geographical and taxonomic sampling (2,219 individuals) to establish the distribution of species, hybrids and cryptic genetic variation within the conifer genus Picea (spruce) across western North America. We demonstrate that the six species of spruce in this region are distinguishable based on their genetic composition, and that the more closely related Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii) and white spruce (P. glauca) have generated numerous and widespread hybrids. These hybrids occur in the central Rocky Mountains, well to the south of the well-established region of admixture in Canada. Additionally, we provide evidence for subdivision within Engelmann spruce, manifested as a southern Rocky Mountains form, and a northern Rocky Mountain and Cascade mountains (western) form. In the intervening central Rocky Mountains region (forests in Wyoming and adjacent states) we found primarily individuals with admixed ancestry. Following their origin, these species of spruce have interacted repeatedly and in different geographical contexts. Multiple pairs of species have been shown to hybridize, yet the species persist and retain distinguishable compositions. At the same time, large geographical areas exist where hybrids are pervasive. Consequently, spruce provide a case study for the maintenance of species boundaries, particularly for how widespread hybridization need not lead to the collapse and loss of species.

We use composite species distribution modelling to identify suitable habitats for 18 members of the North American Atlantic Coastal Plain Flora (ACPF) since the Last Glacial Maximum and project these into the future. We then use Scirpus longii (Cyperaceae), a globally imperiled ACPF sedge with many of the characteristics of extinction vulnerability, as a case study. We integrate phylogeographical and population genetic analyses and species distribution modelling to develop a broad view of its current condition and prognosis for conservation. We use genotyping-by-sequencing to characterize the genomes of 142 S. longii individuals from 20 populations distributed throughout its range (New Jersey to Nova Scotia). We measure the distribution of genetic diversity in the species and reconstruct its phylogeographical history using the snapp and rase models. Extant populations of S. longii originated from a single refugium south of the Laurentide ice sheet around 25 ka. The genetic diversity of S. longii is exceedingly low, populations exhibit little genetic structure and the species is slightly inbred. Projected climate scenarios indicate that nearly half of extant populations of S. longii will be exposed to unsuitable climate by 2070. Similar changes in suitable habitat will occur for many other northern ACPF species-centres of diversity will shift northward and Nova Scotia may become the last refuges for those species not extinguished.

Unlike most hosts studied to date, butterflies largely acquire their nutrients from larval feeding, leaving relatively little opportunity for nutritive contributions by the adult's microbiota. This provides an opportunity to measure whether hosting gut microbiota comes at a net nutritional price. Because host and bacteria may compete for sugars, we hypothesized that gut flora would be nutritionally neutral to adult butterflies with plentiful food, but detrimental to semistarved hosts, especially when at high density. We held field-caught adult Speyeria mormonia under abundant or restricted food conditions. Because antibiotic treatments did not generate consistent variation in their gut microbiota, we used interindividual variability in bacterial loads and operational taxonomic unit abundances to examine correlations between host fitness and the abdominal microbiota present upon natural death. We detected strikingly few relationships between microbial flora and host fitness. Neither total bacterial load nor the abundances of dominant bacterial taxa were related to butterfly fecundity, egg mass or egg chemical content. Increased abundance of a Commensalibacter species did correlate with longer host life span, while increased abundance of a Rhodococcus species correlated with shorter life span. Contrary to our expectations, these relationships were unchanged by food availability to the host and were unrelated to reproductive output. Our results suggest the butterfly microbiota comprises parasitic, commensal and beneficial taxa that together do not impose a net reproductive cost, even under caloric stress.

No conclusive studies on aldehyde emissions by such engines have been found in the literature available. This work measured the aldehyde emissions from a P7 diesel cycle engine (EURO V), which was tested on an engine test bench according to ETC (European Transient Cycle) and ESC (European Stationary Cycle) cycles using fuels with 5, 7 and 20% v/v of biodiesel and 10 and 500ppm of sulphur. The results showed that biodiesel participation in the mixture did not significantly affect the aldehyde emissions of the tested engine and that the emission level generated in the ETC cycle is higher than that obtained with the ESC cycle. The diesel content in the blend was weakly and negatively correlated with the pollutant emissions, and the inverse pattern was observed for biodiesel. This finding indicates that an increase in biodiesel content causes a slight increase in pollutant emissions. Regarding the sulphur content, positive correlations between the sulphur content and particulate matter, NOx, CO and total hydrocarbon emissions were observed. When comparing the test cycles, the results were significantly different, with higher values for the ETC cycle.

An alternative adaptation strategy for beech forests to improve drought tolerance and economic outcome consists in the admixtion of silver fir (Abies alba). To explore potentially suitable areas for mixing under future climate conditions, species distribution models (SDMs) represent a useful tool, but should be accompanied by economic analyses and uncertainty evaluations to serve as a solid decision basis for forest management. Therefore, in this study, we apply state-of-the-art SDMs, review uncertainties resulting from different modeling approaches, estimate the economic value of pure and mixed beech and fir stands, and discuss managerial implications of the results in Germany. Our model results projected widespread beech declines for Germany, while silver fir distributions remained largely constant. The degree of decline varied significantly between the investigated climate scenarios and resulted in associated economic losses between -180 and-4000 billion euros. With regard to the uncertain magnitude of climate change and the risk of high economic losses, we recommend an adaptation of beech forests in its projected hot spots of decline and find silver fir to be an environmentally suitable mixing species. The combination of ecological, economic, and uncertainty analyses used here represents a promising set of tools to evaluate climate change effects and assist in the regional adaptation of forests.

BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						sharpness; puncture; Viperidae; dentition; feeding	VENOM COMPONENTS; SHARK TEETH; MECHANICS; PENETRATION; CROTALUS; STRIKES; SHAPE; FORM	It makes intuitive sense that you need a sharp tool to puncture through a tough material. The typical approach to evaluating sharpness in biological puncturing tools is to treat morphological measurements as a proxy for puncture ability. However, there are multiple approaches to measuring sharpness, and the relative influence of morphology on function remains unclear. Our goal is to determine what aspects of tip morphology have the greatest impact on puncture ability, using (a) viper fangs and (b) engineered punches to isolate the effects of different sharpness measures. Our results indicate that tip included angle is the strongest predictor of puncture performance in both viper fangs and engineered punches. For puncture tools with small included angles, sharpness index (based on the radius of curvature) also affects puncture ability. Finally, we found that punches serve as good predictors of fang performance at small angles and sharpness index values.	[Crofts, S. B.; Anderson, P. S.

Long-term evidence on cooperation and cultural differences in public goods dilemmas	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						human cooperation; public goods game; cultural differences; long-term cooperation; observer effect; laboratory context	MEASURING SOCIAL PREFERENCES; ALTRUISTIC PUNISHMENT; GAME	It is hard to isolate human cooperation features outside the prevalent experimental laboratory context in a controlled setting. Since cooperation rates are very context-sensitive, a new setting-a public goods game in an online game-is analysed. This unique dataset addresses multiple critical issues: it is more realistic, individuals have an intrinsic motivation to play, there are no observer effects, and data are available for more than 18 000 individuals playing over 10 months. Participants come from 10 countries, which allows us to test for cultural influences on cooperation. We find small differences in cooperation rates between countries, ranging from 8.5% (Argentina) to 14.1% (Greece). Moreover, cooperation remains stable over long periods of time. Different cultural, economic and religious backgrounds do not seem to have a discernible influence on cooperation rates. Instead, individual differences seem to play a larger role. Finally, cooperation levels may be lower than suggested by experiments from the classical laboratory context.

Cryptic habitat use of white sharks in kelp forest revealed by animal-borne video	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						animal-borne video and environmental data collection systems (AVEDs); biologging; foraging; camera tags	PREDATION RISK	Traditional forms of marine wildlife research are often restricted to coarse telemetry or surface-based observations, limiting information on fine-scale behaviours such as predator-prey events and interactions with habitat features. We use contemporary animal-attached cameras with motion sensing dataloggers, to reveal novel behaviours by white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, within areas of kelp forest in South Africa. All white sharks tagged in this study spent time adjacent to kelp forests, with severalmoving throughout densely kelp-covered areas, navigating through channels and pushing directly through stipes and fronds. We found that activity and turning rates significantly increased within kelp forest. Over 28 h of video data revealed that white shark encounters with Cape fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, occurred exclusively within kelp forests, with seals displaying predator evasion behaviour during those encounters. Uniquely, we reveal the use of kelp forest habitat by white sharks, previously assumed inaccessible to these large predators.	[Jewell, Oliver J.

To date, however, the findings reported are inconclusive, partly due to the need to evaluate this question over a broad time horizon. In this paper, the question is examined taking into account an extended study period (2002-2014) and applying an order-m data panel method that provides more robust findings than those reported in previous research. The results show that, in general, public-sector provision of the waste collection service is more efficient than private alternatives.

While this approach provides SOC estimates at specific sampling points, geo-statistical or interpolation techniques are required to infer continuous spatial information. UAS-based proximal or remote sensing has the potential to provide detailed and spatially explicit spectral sampling of the topsoil at the field or even watershed scale. However, the factors affecting the quality of spectral acquisition under outdoor conditions need to be considered. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of two portable hyperspectral sensors (STS-VIS and STS-NIR), and two small-form multispectral cameras with narrow bands in the VIS-NIR region (Parrot Sequoia and Mini-MCA6), to predict SOC content. We collected spectral data under both controlled laboratory and outdoor conditions, with the latter being affected by variable illumination and atmospheric conditions and sensor-sample distance. We also analysed the transferability of the prediction models between different measurement setups by aligning spectra acquired under different conditions (laboratory and outdoor) or by different instruments. Our results indicate that UAS-compatible small-form sensors can be used to reliably estimate SOC. The results show that: (i) the best performance for SOC estimation under outdoor conditions was obtained using the VIS-NIR range, while the addition of the SWIR region decreased the prediction accuracy; (ii) prediction models using only the narrow bands of multispectral cameras gave similar or better performances than those using continuous spectra from the STS hyperspectral sensors; and (iii) when used in outdoor conditions, the micro hyperspectral sensors substantially benefitted from a laboratory model calibration followed by a spectral transfer using an internal soil standard. Based on this analysis, we recommend VIS-NIR portable instruments for estimating spatially distributed SOC data. The integration of these sensors in UAS-mapping devices could represent a cost-effective solution for soil research and precision farming applications when high resolution data are required.

A Retrospective Comparison of Water Quality Treatment in a Bioretention Cell 16 Years Following Initial Analysis	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						stormwater management; green infrastructure; bioretention; biofilter; sustainable drainage systems; water quality; low impact development; nitrogen; phosphorus	POLLUTANT REMOVAL; URBAN CHARLOTTE; PERFORMANCE; NUTRIENT; NITROGEN; MEDIA; FLOW	One of the most popular stormwater practices in (sub-)urban North Carolina is bioretention. While bioretention has been researched intensively to determine the most efficient designs, few long-term studies have attempted to assess the performance of older bioretention. However, previous research and design guidance for bioretention has predicted long-term water quality treatment. This study compared discharged concentrations and loads of nitrogen and phosphorus from a bioretention cell (1) post-construction and (2) following 17 years of treatment. A conventionally-drained bioretention cell with lateral underdrains in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA, was first monitored post-construction for 10-months from 2002-2003 and, again following continuous use, for 14 months from 2017-2018. Estimated mass load reductions during the initial monitoring period were 40% for total nitrogen (TN) and 65% for total phosphorus (TP). Mass load reductions were increased 17 years after construction, with reductions of 72% and 79% for TN and TP, respectively. Plant growth, death, and decay over the 17-year life of the bioretention cell are hypothesized to have contributed additional nitrogen assimilation and carbon to the fill media, serving as a catalyst for nitrogen treatment. Phosphorus removal remained relatively unchanged between the two monitoring periods. Filter media samples indicated the top 20 cm of filter media were nearing phosphorus saturation, but with 1.2 m of filter media, lower depths would most likely continue to provide treatment. If designed, built, and maintained correctly, bioretention appears to provide sustained treatment of stormwater runoff for nitrogen and phosphorus for nearly two decades, and likely longer.

Policy-makers have formulated ecological protection measures to facilitate sustainable development. However, traditional conservation planning mainly focuses on protecting specific green spaces, with limited consideration of the connectivity among green spaces from a habitat network perspective. Using citizen science data and occupancy modelling, we predicted habitat suitability, built habitat networks and identified key habitat patches based on their contribution to the functional connectivity of the habitat network for three focal water, forest, and open-habitat bird species. Based on the habitat requirement, small waterbodies and intermediate forest and open-habitat cover facilitate preserving water, forest and open-habitat birds. In regards to the network analysis, we found that key habitat patches with a high conservation priority were generally characterized by a relatively large patch size and/or located at critical positions in the habitat network (at central positions in the habitat network, or near large patches). We suggest that key habitat patches in restricted built-up areas are converted to protected areas or are kept as cropland under future urban planning. We emphasize the usefulness of the focal species concept in urban biodiversity conservation. Our study offers conservation recommendations from a habitat network perspective for urban planners to safeguard urban biodiversity and ecosystem health.

Based on an analysis of parameters and data from 74 cadastral areas in the Zitava River basin in Slovakia, a set of criteria (geometrical, ownership/social, environmental, erosion, and morphology) and weights for them have been identified and combined into composite indices/criteria for designing a ranking system for LC prioritization and evaluation. However, they are universally applicable/adaptable, and are not limited to a particular territory or country.

We examined the effects of soil tillage intensities in vineyard inter-rows on the activity density and diversity of spiders (Araneae) and springtails (Collembola), their potential preys, and assessed whether these effects are altered by non-crop elements in the surrounding landscape. We collected data in 16 vineyards in Austria; eight were periodically mechanically disturbed (PMD), eight had permanent green cover (PGC). The study vineyards were embedded in landscapes ranging from structurally simple to complex. Both, spiders and springtails were collected with pitfall traps. Data analyses using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) showed different effects of soil tillage intensities on spiders and springtails and an interaction with semi-natural elements (SNEs) in the surrounding landscape. Activities of springtails were higher under PMD than under PGC while spider activity density remained unaffected. Spider family Shannon diversity was lower under PMD than under PGC, while springtail species Shannon diversity was unaffected by tillage. Under PMD, spider activity and family diversity decreased with increasing SNEs in the surroundings indicating spider emigration away from vineyards.

Removal of intertidal grazers by human harvesting leads to alteration of species interactions, community structure and resilience to climate change	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Environmental change; Ecosystem management; MPA; Conservation; Herbivory	TAKE MARINE RESERVES; CORALLINE ALGAE; BODY-SIZE; TROPHIC CASCADES; KELP CANOPIES; TURF ALGAE; MANAGEMENT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; POPULATION; ABUNDANCE	Extreme fluctuations in abiotic conditions can induce a biological stress response (e.g. bleaching) detrimental to an organism's health. In some instances, organisms can recover if conditions are alleviated, such as through co-occurrence with other species that confer protection. Biodiverse, multitrophic communities are increasingly recognised as important promoters of species persistence and resilience under environmental change. On intertidal shores, the role of grazers as top-down determinants of algal community structure is well recognised. Similarly, the harvesting of grazers for human consumption is increasingly prevalent with potential to greatly alter the community dynamics. Here, we assess how differences in harvesting pressure of grazers under three management regimes (no-take; managed access; open-access) alters the trophic interactions between grazers, and algal communities. Grazer density and body size frequencies were different among regimes leading to changes in the photosynthetic performance and recovery of crustose coralline algae (CCA) post-bleaching, as well as their presence altering the strength of interactions between species. The exclusion of grazers from patches using cages led to different emergent communities and reduced negative correlations between taxa. The absence of larger grazers (> 9 cm) at the managed access site led to macroalgal overgrowth of bleached CCA negatively affecting its recovery, whereas no-take or open-access led to a moderated algal growth and a shift from competitive to facilitative interactions between algal species. Given that CCA play an important role in the population growth and development of other species, the choice of management measure should be carefully considered before implementation, depending on objectives.

Despite these efforts, several non-indigenous species continue to be transferred via hull-fouling worldwide. In this study we designed a disturbance gradient with three commercial antifouling paints applied to PVC settling plates with different concentrations of copper oxide and allowed colonization of fouling communities in four marinas located at the Madeira Archipelago (NE Atlantic). Overall, the antifouling treatments were effective in decreasing the diversity of fouling communities and spatial variability across marinas was observed. Increasing exposure to metal pollutants decreases both species cover and total diversity, independently of their native or NIS condition. However, evidences found suggest that long-term effects of copper based antifouling coatings can be modulated by metal-resistant species allowing a secondary substrate for the epibiosis of other species to establish.

However, significant knowledge gaps remain in relation to sediment dynamics, especially linking suspended sediments, sedimentation and turf-bound sediments. To examine these links, a series of different methods for quantifying suspended sediments, sedimentation and the accumulation of turf sediments were compared, simultaneously, on an inner-shelf reef. We revealed that the amount and composition of sediment quantified using different methods varied markedly, with commonly employed measures of sedimentation failing to accurately reflect patterns of sediment accumulation in turfs. Our results highlighted the propensity for turfs to trap and retain sediments, with turfs accumulating approximately 2.6 times more sediment than traps, and 6 times more sediment than SedPods, over a seven-day period. This study highlights the major, but often overlooked, role that algal turfs can play in sediment dynamics on coral reefs.

When nutrient levels increase, usually due to human activity, the symbiosis of dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae) with scleractinian corals can break down. Although gorgonian corals dominate many Caribbean reefs, the impact of enrichment on them and their algae is understudied. We exposed two gorgonian species, Pseudoplexaura porosa and Eunicea tourneforti, to elevated concentrations of either ammonium (10 mu M or 50 mu M) or phosphate (4 mu M). Enrichment with 10 mu M ammonium increased chlorophyll content and algal density in both species, whereas the host biochemical composition was unaffected. Exposure to 50 mu M ammonium only reduced the quantum yield in P. porosa and mitotic indices in both species. Conversely, algal carbon and nitrogen content within E. tourneforti increased with 4 mu M phosphate exposure. These gorgonian species coped with short-term nutrient enrichment, furthering our understanding of the success of Caribbean gorgonians.

This study tests different allometric models to estimate the total tree height from the stem diameter in an ecotone zone between ombrophilous and seasonal forests in the Brazilian state of Roraima, in northern Amazonia. Stem diameter and total height were measured directly in 65 recently fallen trees (live or dead). Linear and nonlinear regressions were tested to represent the D: H relation in this specific ecotone zone. Criteria for model selection were the standard error of the estimate (S-yx) and the adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)), complemented by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Analysis of residuals of the most parsimonious nonlinear models showed a tendency to overestimate the total tree height for trees in the 20-40 cm diameter range. Application of our best fitted model (Michaelis-Menten) indicated that previously published general equations for the tropics that use diameter as the independent variable can either overestimate tree height in the study area by 10-29% (Weibull models) or underestimate it by 8% (climate-based models). We concluded that our site-specific model can be used in the ecotone forests studied in Roraima because it realistically reflects the local biometric relationships between stem diameter and total tree height. Studies need to be expanded in peripheral areas of northern Amazonia in order to reduce uncertainties in biomass and carbon estimates that use the tree height as a variable in general models.

The present work focused on the performance of inventory techniques in the Amazon region to evaluate wood volume stocks with higher levels of accuracy while maintaining sampling intensity fixed. Two sampling processes were assessed: simple random sampling and two-stage cluster sampling. The processes were evaluated through the allocation of sampling units with different dimensions, and the effectiveness of the generated estimators was analyzed as a function of stand density and basal area. Simple random sampling resulted in the smallest errors, reaching 9% when all species were sampled together. The method depicted forest phytosociological parameters with greater sensitivity, whereas two-stage cluster sampling produced the least accurate estimators and presented slower responses to variation in phytosociological parameters.

However, there is little understanding of mechanisms that govern changes in the location and composition of boundaries. At smaller scales, investigation of detailed soil and vegetation characteristics can clarify the linkages between soil properties and vegetation patterns.ObjectivesThe aims were to examine the relationship between vegetation patterns and soil properties, and to explore mechanisms that govern changes in the location and composition of boundaries.MethodsIn a 50-ha grassland fenced for more than 10years, where a recovery process had been initiated and annual grasses dominated in most saline-alkaline areas, we quantitatively characterized the spatial gradients across the visually identified physiognomic boundary between annual patches and perennial patches at a fine spatial scale.ResultsFine-scale vegetation and soil boundaries were well-defined and statistically characterized by a high rate of change compared to immediately adjacent areas. Plant characteristics were markedly influenced by soil properties. The alteration of salinity and alkalinity were the most important factors explaining the plant patterns across patch boundaries. Successional processes of colonization were involved in perennial encroachment in the annual patches.ConclusionsUnderlying soil properties primarily determine the plant patterns of the boundary; plant succession caused by interspecific competition is superimposed on the plant-soil feedback loop maintaining soil nutrient conditions. These processes alter the characteristics and locations of patch boundaries in response to changing disturbance regimes. Our findings offer insight into how boundaries may respond to changes in environmental conditions and drive landscape-level dynamics.

Hence, despite growing interest and recognition of the importance of protecting landscape connectivity, the practical utility of predictions derived from connectivity models remains unclear.ObjectivesThe difficulties in validations are mainly related to the unavailability of independent data and lack of appropriate, easily applied statistical frameworks. Here, we present a case study where two independently collected datasets were used to validate resistance-based landscape connectivity models and movement corridors identified by these models.MethodsWe used annual aerial counts to evaluate the connectivity model, and a field survey to assess the performance of predicted corridors. We applied these two independent datasets to validate a previously developed connectivity model for the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) in the Borderland region between Kenya and Tanzania.ResultsThe results of this study confirm that the resistance-based connectivity model is a valid approach for predicting movement corridors for the African elephant. We show that high connectivity values are a strong predictor of the presence of large numbers of the elephants across the years. The probability of observing elephants increased with increasing connectivity values, while accounting for seasonality is an important factor for accurately predicting movements from connectivity models.ConclusionMovement corridors derived from resistance-based connectivity models have a strong predictive power and can be successfully used in spatial conservation prioritization.

Spatiotemporal patterns of cheatgrass invasion in Colorado Plateau National Parks	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bromus tectorum; Cheatgrass; Plant invasion; Wildfire; Remote sensing; GIS; Spatial modeling	BROMUS-TECTORUM L.; 2 ANNUAL GRASSES; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PLANT INVASIONS; FIRE CYCLE; SOIL; WATER; PRECIPITATION; GERMINATION	ContextExotic annual grasses are transforming native arid and semi-arid ecosystems globally by accelerating firecycles that drive vegetation state changes. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), a particularly widespread and aggressive exotic annual grass, is a key management target in national parks of the western United States due to its impacts on wildfire and biodiversity loss. Cheatgrass is known for its high interannual variability and can grow in a wide range of conditions.ObjectivesThe objectives were to (1) map the presence and persistence of cheatgrass in national park units across a 11-year period using remote sensing, and (2) identify the biophysical parameters that correlate with cheatgrass persistence.MethodsWe used remote sensing and GIS tools to develop a systematic model to characterize the status and environmental correlates of cheatgrass invasions in seven national park units in the western United States.ResultsOn average cheatgrass covered 3.8% of park areas, each park ranging from 0.8 to 24.8% coverage. Where cheatgrass was detected, persistent populations across time (hotspots) made up on average 13% of cheatgrass areas. Hotspots were found in areas with deeper plant-available water, lower elevations, colder mean winter temperatures, flatter slopes, higher soil clay content, and lower mean fall precipitation.ConclusionStudy results identified spatiotemporal patterns of plant invasions and key environmental drivers that influence invasionpatterns. GIS tool development and analysis from this study were used to generate invasion maps for each park, which can be used to mitigate wildfire and biodiveristy loss.	[Bishop, Tara B.

To explore the ecological functions of EFNs, a factorial combination experiment of ant (access or exclusion) and EFNs (with or without) at the plant level was created in two populations. The role of EFNs in the attraction of ants and flying pollinators, the defensive role of ants against foliar herbivores, the effects of ants on pollinator visitation and the effects of ant-pollinator interactions on fruit production in one or both populations were assessed. Ants were common on the ant-access plants with EFNs, but absent from the ant-access plants without EFNs. Foliar herbivory was independent of ant and EFN treatments and their interactions. The visitation frequency of flying pollinators (honeybees and syrphid flies) and fruit set were significantly higher for plants with EFNs than plants without EFNs, but were not affected by ant treatments or their interactions with EFN treatments. These results suggest that EFNs in S. javanica attracted both ants and flying pollinators, but ants did not present a defensive role against herbivores, did not deter flying pollinators from visiting inflorescences and had no effects on fruit production. In addition, ants were not significant pollen vectors.

Lolium rigidum (Poaceae) is an alien species that has become naturalized on the sandy coasts of Japan; however, it exhibits extensive morphological variation, leading to speculation that several taxa of Lolium have become naturalized. Here, we compared the morphology, reproductive biology and genetic structure of this Lolium species by growing individuals from different locations in the same environment to clarify whether the observed morphological variation is genetically based or is caused by intraspecific variation as a result of environmental differences. Principle component analyses of 11 morphological traits separated the study species into two types. Bagging experiments showed that one type exhibited an outcrossing life history, whereas the other type selfed exclusively. Nuclear DNA microsatellite analyses supported this distinction between these morphological types, with no intermediate individuals being found. The outcrossing type exhibited high genetic diversity, whereas the selfing type exhibited almost no polymorphism, reflecting the differences in their breeding systems. Moreover, both types differed from the economically important outcrossing species Lolium multiflorum and Lolium perenne. These two types of Lolium are expected to have different introduction histories and invasive potential on the coasts of Japan. In conclusion, it is important to distinguish between these types through additional biological studies to design effective control measures.

Global Opportunities to Increase Agricultural Independence Through Phosphorus Recycling	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						phosphorus; manure; fertilizer; waste; trade; phosphate	SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES; ANTHROPOGENIC PHOSPHORUS; LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION; ANIMAL PRODUCTION; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; P FERTILIZER; FOOD; FLOWS; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCE	Food production hinges largely upon access to phosphorus (P) fertilizer. Most fertilizer P used in the global agricultural system comes from mining of nonrenewable phosphate rock deposits located within few countries. However, P contained in livestock manure or urban wastes represents a recyclable source of P. To inform development of P recycling technologies and policies, we examined subnational, national, and global spatial patterns for two intersections of land use affording high P recycling potential: (a) manure-rich cultivated areas and (b) populous cultivated areas. In turn, we examined overlap between P recycling potential and nation-level P fertilizer import dependency. Populous cultivated areas were less abundant globally than manure-rich cultivated areas, reflecting greater segregation between crops and people compared to crops and livestock, especially in the Americas. Based on a global hexagonal grid (290-km(2) grid cell area), disproportionately large shares of subnational "hot spots" for P recycling potential occurred in India, China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa. Outside of China, most of the remaining manure-rich or pulous cultivated areas occurred within nations that had relatively high imports of P fertilizer (net P import:consumption ratios >= 0.4) or substantial increases in fertilizer demand between the 2000s (2002-2006) and 2010s (2010-2014). Manure-rich cultivated grid cells (those above the 75th percentiles for both manure and cropland extent) represented 12% of the global grid after excluding cropless cells. Annually, the global sum of animal manure P was at least 5 times that contained in human excreta, and among cultivated cells the ratio was frequently higher (median = 8.9). The abundance of potential P recycling hot spots within nations that have depended on fertilizer imports or experienced rising fertilizer demand could prove useful for developing local P sources and maintaining agricultural independence.

Grassland Bird and Butterfly Responses to Sericea Lespedeza Control via Late-Season Grazing Pressure	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							EASTERN MEADOWLARKS; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; NESTING ECOLOGY; CONSERVATION; PERFORMANCE; HABITAT; FIRE; MANAGEMENT; ABUNDANCE; HETEROGENEITY	Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) is a high-tannin, late season invasive forb species that reduces biodiversity in tallgrass prairie ecosystems. The largest tallgrass prairie remnant exists in the Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma, where the most common grazing management practice involves prescribed fire in early spring followed by intensive stocking with yearling beef cattle from April to July. Sericea has continued to spread under this management regime. From 2013 to 2016, in Kansas Flint Hills tallgrass prairie, we tested the effects of using spring burning with early-season steer grazing, followed by late-season sheep grazing (Steer-I-Sheep) compared to spring burning followed by steer grazing only (Steer) on sericea vigor, grassland birds, and pollinators. Density and nest success of Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodrannts savannarum) and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were not negatively affected by Steer-I-Sheep relative to Steer treatments, whereas there was evidence of a negative effect in these same metrics for Dickcissels (Spiro americana). Abundance of butterflies and their nectar sources were similar between treatments but abundance of grassland specialist butterfly species was low, overall. Comprehensively, Steer-I-Sheep effectively controls the spread of sericea but may not create habitat for all tallgrass prairie wildlife species.

Presence of both Active and Inactive Colonies of Prairie Dogs Contributes to Higher Vegetation Heterogeneity at the Landscape Scale	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							PLANTS	Black-tailed prairie dogs are herbivorous rodents known to have large effects on grassland landscapes in North America. They have considerable impacts on prairie plant communities as the result of repeated clipping of vegetation that can reduce preferred forage species and may indirectly result in increased abundance of disturbance-tolerant species. We investigated plant communities within three different habitat types: Active and inactive prairie dog colonies, and adjacent suitable, but unoccupied, control areas in the Northern Great Plains of Montana, U.S.A. Plant species richness did not vary markedly between the three habitat types. However, plant composition measured as cover of plant life forms (forbs, shrubs, and graminoids), which was further divided into native status (native or introduced), and plant species indicators (plant species associated with a specific habitat) did vary distinctly between the three habitat types. Differences in plant composition between the habitat types suggests black-tailed prairie dog activities result in greater diversity of plant microhabitats at a landscape scale, and prairie dogs are an important component of the overall ecosystem in the Northern Great Plains of North America.

A Comparison of Bat Activity in a Managed Central Hardwood Forest	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							HABITAT USE; SITE OCCUPANCY; AREAS; ABUNDANCE; SELECTION; MODELS; STAND	Bats exploit forest resources based on species-specific adaptations, resulting in differences in activity across forested landscapes. Forest management practices alter forests, impacting species differently and presumably affecting bat activity. Application of forest management that promotes species-specific bat conservation requires further understanding of bat response to silvicultural practices. We surveyed timber harvest treatments on two Indiana State Forests to compare bat activity across forest management treatments, in forests adjacent to harvests, and at locations across the harvest-forest gradient from May to July in 2013 and 2014. We used Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter SM2BAT+ detectors and Kaleidoscope Pro analysis software to survey bats in relation to four treatment types: clear cut, patch cut, shelterwood preparatory cut, and intact forest. Detectors were deployed at two points within each treatment and three points on the forested periphery of treatments and recorded for three consecutive nights. We examined bat activity using N-mixture models that estimate abundance and probability of detection for an open population and used Akaike's Information Criterion to select the best models. Based on identification of acoustic calls, eastern red bats and hoary bats were more active in harvest treatments than control treatments. Big brown, eastern red, and ui-colored bats were most active at harvest edges. Northern long-eared and Indiana/little brown bats were most active at harvest edges and in adjacent forest and hoary bats were most active at harvest centers. Differences in bat activity across these managed forests suggest bat assemblages benefit from management that employs an array of silvicultural methods, provides edge habitat, and maintains adjacent forest stands. Our results can be used to predict effects of forest management practices on species-specific bat activity to maximize bat usage of forests.

Pattern of scorpion diversity across a bioclimatic dry-wet gradient in Neotropical forests	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arachnida; Beta diversity; Macroecology; Metacommunity; Species composition	ATLANTIC RAIN-FOREST; ARACHNIDA SCORPIONES; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; MICROHABITAT USE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISTURBANCE; INSECTS; IMPACTS	Understanding large-scale patterns of biological diversity is one of the most important issues in ecology. Parameters of scorpion assemblages may serve as a proxy to understand how arthropods respond to bioclimatic changes by adjusting their spatially structured distribution. We analysed how scorpion species richness, abundance, and composition respond to climatic variations found along a longitudinal gradient between wet (Atlantic Forest) and dry (Caatinga hypo and hyperxerophilic) forests in Brazil. A total of 20 sites were sampled four times along a 712 km longitudinal wet-dry bioclimatic gradient in north-eastern Brazil. We recorded 2653 scorpions from 12 species, belonging to five genera and two families. Environmental variables associated with precipitation and temperature had a strong effect on scorpion distribution, resulting in a distinct faunal composition at both extremes of the gradient. Species composition presented a turnover along the bioclimatic gradient, with beta diversity increasing towards the drier sites. The increase of dryness coincide with increases in temperature, moisture reduction, and a general environmental harshness. Our study, therefore, indicates that species sensitivity to climatic variation determines scorpion distribution in Neotropical forests.	[Lira, Andre F. A.; Albuquerque, Cleide M.

Under a functional perspective, studies have shown that environmental alterations can affect organisms' traits that are related to their performance, fitness and ecological functions. In the present study, we evaluated how the diversity and functional traits of two distinct bat guilds are affected by an elevational gradient in Atlantic forest, southeastern Brazil. Indices regarded to functional diversity and to dominant functional traits (Rao Quadratic Entropy - RaoQ and Community Weighted Mean - CWM) were calculated for both bat guilds: understory and open-space bat faunas. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were applied to verify the relation of each metric with elevation, and the presence of non-linear relationships were tested. Results showed that each guild of the bat community reacted differently to the elevational gradient, with statistically significant results of RaoQ for understory bats and of CWM for both guilds (for aspect ratio) or for only one bat guild (mass for understory bats and wing load for open-space bats). Our results illustrate how an environmental gradient can impose different selective pressures in each bat guild and how the distinct bat groups are affected by elevation. This is the first study considering functional aspects of open-space bats in the Neotropics.

Blue grama grass genotype affects palatability and preference by semi-arid steppe grasshoppers	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Dominant species; Shortgrass steppe; Herbivory; Genetic diversity; Cultivar; Accession	BOUTELOUA-GRACILIS; FORAGE PRODUCTION; NITROGEN; TRAITS; HERBIVORES; RESISTANCE; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; DEFENSES; PLANTS	The semi-arid shortgrass steppe ecosystem of North America is dominated by blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis), a species with substantial intraspecific variability, ecological significance, and economic value. Yet no studies have addressed within species differences in blue grama palatability or insect herbivore preference with respect to plant traits. We performed an experimental study to test the palatability and preference of two blue grama genotypes, wild type versus cultivar, by grasshopper herbivores in the Gomphocerinae subfamily. We found strong evidence that cultivar blue grama was more palatable than wild type and that grasshoppers preferred cultivar plants. Although we could not detect differences in silica content between the two types, we found that cultivar plants were larger, had lower water content, and surprisingly, had reduced nutrient value (greater C:N). These results suggest that intraspecific variation in blue grama size and water content could influence feeding choices by this group of grasshoppers. Conservation managers will have to consider such variation when considering how remnant and restored prairies might be affected by these arthropod herbivores.

In selecting flowers for forage, pollinators rely on multi-modal flower signals and innate preferences. However, pollinators are known for their flexible foraging behavior which varies with experience and numerous cues, such as the presence of competitors and floral resource availability. The shared use of flowers by many pollinators leads to high rate of parasite transmission among pollinators, and flowers can be seen as hot-spots of parasite dispersal. Throughout the animal kingdom, behavioral adaptations enable avoidance of parasite exposure. Bumblebees are known to avoid contaminated flowers, however nothing is known regarding the impact of parasite presence on overall pollinator visitation. In this study, we measured the effect of a larval honey bee parasite, the fungus Ascosphaera apis causing chalkbrood disease, on hymenopteran pollinator visitation of several plant species in a natural setting. Several contaminated flowering plant species suffered not only the subsequent reduction of visitation by honey bees but also the subsequent reduction of their overall pollinator visitation. Two plant species with similar flower architecture were the least impacted by the presence of the spores. This study highlights the negative impact of the presence of pollinator parasites for plants and its possible consequences for floral evolution.

Optimizing release strategies: a stepping-stone approach to reintroduction	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						reintroductions; translocations; Bayesian multievent model; Marmota vancouverensis; monitoring; mark-recapture; post-release survival; release strategy	VANCOUVER-ISLAND; TRANSLOCATION STRATEGIES; SURVIVAL; WILD; CONSERVATION; RATES; POPULATION; LESSONS; MARMOTA; INDIVIDUALS	Evaluation of alternative management strategies enables informed decisions to accelerate species recovery. For reintroductions, post-release survival to reproductive age is a key parameter influencing population growth. Here, we trial a 'stepping-stone' method to maximize the success of captive-bred animals when the availability of more suitable wild-born release candidates is limited. Our approach makes use of relatively safe and established wild populations to prepare captive-bred individuals for eventual translocation to a final release destination, thus building resilience through establishment of multiple populations over time. We developed a novel multievent model integrating encounter history and biotelemetry data to evaluate reintroduction strategies for the critically endangered Vancouver Island marmot Marmota vancouverensis. We compared post-release survival of 176 individuals (52 wild-born, 47 captive-bred marmots released directly to destinations, and 77 captive-bred marmots released with a stepping-stone approach). Survival estimates to prime breeding-age (PBA), were then used to quantify expected success of potential release strategies. Our analysis indicates that post-release survival varies by source population and release method, as well as age, season, year, and years since release. Conditional on an objective of maximizing survival to PBA, our results suggest that using wild-born marmots for translocations as often as possible, and stepping-stone captive-bred marmots prior to final release, will result in the best outcomes. There was a 0.86 probability that survival to PBA was greater for captive-bred marmots released as yearlings using a stepping-stone approach (survival to PBA mode = 0.13, 95% CRI = 0.05-0.30) than for captive-bred animals that were directly released to destination sites as one-year-olds (survival to PBA mode = 0.04, 95% CRI = 0.01-0.24). Consequently, the stepping-stone approach yields much higher population establishment or growth potential than previous release strategies that used captive-bred marmots. Optimizing the combination of release candidates, sites and timing can thereby increase the effectiveness of reintroductions.	[Lloyd, N.

Effects of artificial illumination on drinking bats: a field test in forest and desert habitats	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Chiroptera; foraging; habituation; Israel; Italy; light pollution; urbanization; water	PIPISTRELLUS-KUHLII; AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION; ECHOLOCATION CALLS; INSECTIVOROUS BATS; CHIROPTERA; COMMUNITY; IMPACTS	Bats show pronounced and often-adverse reactions to artificial illumination at night (ALAN) when commuting, roosting or foraging. ALAN also affects bat drinking activity, at least when lighting occurs over short intervals. We tested whether continuous illumination of drinking sites over 4-h periods would lead bats to tolerate ALAN and resume drinking in the course of the night. We conducted our experiments in forest (Italy) and desert (Israel) sites to test whether in the latter habitat, where water is scarce, a greater motivation to drink might lead to less adverse bat reactions. We recorded 6853 drinking buzzes and 1647 feeding buzzes from 17 species and one species group. In the forest sites, species that hunt in open spaces or along forest edges showed little (P. pipistrellus and H. savii) or no (P. kuhlii and N. leisleri) drinking activity decrease, while those associated with forest interiors (Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus and bats in the genus Myotis) exhibited a strong negative response. In the desert sites, all studied species reduced drinking activity, yet in the desert populations of P. kuhlii we recorded stronger adverse reactions only far from human settlements. The harsh reactions that the desert bat species showed towards ALAN rule out any effect of a greater motivation to drink. Illumination had no effect on foraging by most species, except in the forest sites, where Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri increased foraging when the light was on, and in the desert sites, where Hypsugo bodenheimeri decreased foraging in such situations. The progressive human encroachment that is taking place in many world regions on both forests and especially deserts, where few sites for drinking are available, may jeopardize bat populations also through increased exposure to ALAN.

Evaluating support for rangeland-restoration practices by rural Somalis: an unlikely win-win for local livelihoods and hirola antelope?	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Beatragus hunteri; elephant; endangered species; habitat degradation; rangeland; restoration; tree encroachment; antelope	LANDSCAPE CHANGE; BUSH ENCROACHMENT; REGRESSION TREES; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITY; ATTITUDES; WILDLIFE; AFRICA; ELEPHANTS; SAVANNA	In developing countries, governments often lack the authority and resources to implement conservation outside of protected areas. In such situations, the integration of conservation with local livelihoods is crucial to species recovery and reintroduction efforts. The hirola Beatragus hunteri is the world's most endangered antelope, with a population of <500 individuals that is restricted to <5% of its historical geographic range on the Kenya-Somali border. Long-term hirola declines have been attributed to a combination of disease and rangeland degradation. Tree encroachment-driven by some combination of extirpation of elephants, overgrazing by livestock, and perhaps fire suppression-is at least partly responsible for habitat loss and the decline of contemporary populations. Through interviews in local communities across the hirola's current range, we identified socially acceptable strategies for habitat restoration and hirola recovery. We used classification and regression trees, conditional inference trees, and generalized linear models to identify sociodemographic predictors of support for range-restoration strategies. Locals supported efforts to conserve elephants (which kill trees and thus facilitate grass growth), seed and fertilize grass, and remove trees, but were opposed to livestock reduction. Locals were ambivalent toward controlled burns and soil ripping (a practice through which soil is broken up to prevent compaction). Livestock ownership and years of residency were key predictors of locals' perceptions toward rangeland-restoration practices. Locals owning few livestock were more supportive of elephant conservation, and seeding and fertilization of grass, while longer term residents were more supportive of livestock reduction but were less supportive of elephant conservation. Ultimately, wildlife conservation outside protected areas requires long-term, community-based efforts that are compatible with human livelihoods. We recommend elephant conservation, grass seeding and fertilization, manual tree removal and resting range from livestock both to enhance the potential for hirola recovery and to build positive rapport with local communities in the geographic range of this critically endangered species.

Native parasitic nest fly impacts reproductive success of an island-endemic host	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Caribbean; island-endemic birds; myiasis; Neotropics; parasite-host interaction; Philornis; Buteo ridgwayi; parasitism	PHILORNIS-DOWNSI; DARWINS FINCH; RIDGWAYS HAWK; LOS-HAITISES; EXTINCTION; FOREST; CONSERVATION; FIPRONIL; MUSCIDAE; DIPTERA	Parasitic nest flies Philornis spp. are a driving force threatening the extinction of bird species endemic to Neotropical islands such as the Galapagos, where introduced Philornis downsi negatively impacts reproductive success of naive avian hosts. Elsewhere in the Neotropics, such as in the Caribbean region where Philornis nest flies are native, effects of Philornis on host productivity are poorly known. We manipulated parasitism by the native Hispaniolan nest fly Philornis pici on a critically endangered endemic host, Ridgway's hawk Buteo ridgwayi, to study the impact of nest fly myiasis on hawk breeding success with the goal of providing a management option for endangered species until broad-scale solutions can be found. Our treatment protocol was enough to reduce P. pici abundance by 89% and increase probability of fledging by 179% for treated nestlings. Our results indicate that parasitism by nest flies decreases survival and fledging success of nestling Ridgway's hawks and is a possible factor in the decline of the species. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first quantitative evidence of nest fly impact on survival or productivity in a non-passerine host.	[Hayes, C.

Lower levels of glucocorticoids in crop-raiders: diet quality as a potential 'pacifier' against stress in free-ranging Asian elephants in a human-production habitat	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Elephas maximus; crop-raiding; elephant-human conflict; stress hormones; faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM); Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI); dietary C; N ratio; diet quality	AFRICAN ELEPHANTS; RAIDING ELEPHANTS; LOXODONTA-AFRICANA; HORMONES; CONSERVATION; RISK; VARIABILITY; POPULATION; DIVERSITY; HERBIVORY	Overlapping habitats and sharing of resources between elephants and people has led to intense elephant-human conflicts, especially crop depredation by elephants, across elephant-range countries. While raiding agricultural crops, elephants face numerous threats from people through chase, injury and the risk of death which could enhance the associated energetic costs, ultimately elevating their stress levels. We hypothesized that crop-raiders (in the human-production habitat) would show higher faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels, a proxy of stress-response, as compared to nonraiders (in protected forests). To study this, 208 faecal samples were collected from crop-raiding elephants in a human-production habitat and 394 samples from nonraiding elephants in protected forests during 2013 and 2015. Contrary to our expectation, fGCM levels were significantly higher in nonraiding than in crop-raiding elephants of both sexes. As one of the possible factors for lower fGCM in elephants inhabiting the human-production habitat, the influence of benefits obtained from foraging here was assessed. For this, the difference in vegetation greenness (standing biomass) between the human-production habitat and the protected forests was analysed from remotely-sensed Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), and further confirmed by measuring dietary quality (faecal nitrogen (N) content and C:N ratio as proxies for crude protein). Interestingly, higher NDVI values (greater biomass availability), higher N content and lower faecal C:N ratio (indicating higher protein content in the diet) of elephants in the human-production habitat suggested enhanced nutritional levels here as compared to protected forests. Further, there were significant correlations between faecal C:N ratio (positive) or N content (negative) and fGCM levels. These findings suggest that crop-raiding comes with the benefits of a superior quality diet which may help in reducing human-induced stress-response in elephants inhabiting or foraging within human-production habitats.

Sustainable close encounters: integrating tourist and animal behaviour to improve rhinoceros viewing protocols	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						conservation tourism; disturbance; ecotourism; evidence-based management; information-theoretic; rhinoceros; sustainable tourism; Diceros bicornis	WILDLIFE; HABITUATION; DISTURBANCE; MANAGEMENT; RESPONSES	Tourism may benefit conservation, but some wildlife viewing practices threaten the sustainability of both business and conservation initiatives. In north-west Namibia, conservation-oriented tourism provides tourists with an opportunity to encounter the critically-endangered black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis on foot. We used 123 tourist-rhinoceros encounters and employed a statistical modeling approach to: (1) identify the characteristics of human-rhinoceros encounters that caused rhinoceros disturbance and displacement; and (2) design rhinoceros-human encounter guidelines that improve sustainability. A model-averaging, information-theoretic approach identified tourist approach distance, viewing time and individual encounter exposure as the most significant predictors of rhinoceros disturbance level. A suite of rhinoceros viewing scenarios were modeled for acceptable disturbance risks, and adopted as a rhinoceros viewing policy. The policy reduced encounter displacements by 80% while maintaining a 95% positive feedback rating from guests. We demonstrate an evidence-based, policy-oriented management approach can help improve tourism's contribution towards the conservation of an endangered species.	[Muntifering, J.

Impacts of fisheries on elasmobranch reproduction: high rates of abortion and subsequent maternal mortality in the shortnose guitarfish	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						batoids; reproductive disruption; fishing stress; conservation physiology; bycatch; Zapteryx brevirostris; bycatch mortality	PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS-RESPONSE; PELAGIC SHARKS; POSTRELEASE SURVIVAL; CAPTURE; BYCATCH; CHONDRICHTHYANS; CONSERVATION; TRADE; RAYS	The fate of bycatch species released back into the water is crucial to estimate population status and consequent decisions to implement adequate management measurements for elasmobranchs. The shortnose guitarfish, Zapteryx brevirostris, is an endemic species of the Southwest Atlantic. It is currently listed as 'Vulnerable' both in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Brazilian red lists. Although this species displays high tolerance to capture and transportation by fishers from the capture site to the fish market, a significant reduction in survival rates is observed during the reproductive period. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine post-capture and post-commercial transportation consequences in pregnant females obtained as bycatch from artisanal fisheries in Southern Brazil. Results showed high abortion rates and reduced maternal survival after abortion, with all abortions occurring within 28 h of monitoring in laboratory. Stress plasma markers were also evaluated, to determine the physiological consequences of capture-induced parturition to pregnant females. Results showed alteration in all markers measured (plasma urea, pH, lactate, phosphorus, and potassium) with values for dead pregnant females being different from non-pregnant females and those which survived capture and subsequent abortions. The mortality caused by fisheries bycatch may prove difficult to manage, with immediate release and specific handling protocols for pregnant females implemented through environmental education environmental education and fishermen training programs, potential options to maintain adequate maternal survival and recruitment for this species.

Biotic and abiotic filters, such as nutrients and disturbances (for example, herbivory or fire), may influence the distinct vegetation on termite mounds; however, seed dispersal has not yet been evaluated as a filter in this ecosystem. This study examined the effects of seed dispersal, particularly animal seed dispersal, on the distinct woody plant community on termite mounds in a mopane woodland in north-western Namibia. We compared the functional traits of woody plants related to dispersal, as well as responses to resource availability and disturbance, between plant communities on and those off termite mounds. We conducted vegetation surveys of woody plants in 13 paired mound-savannah plots and measured their functional traits. Soil samples were also collected from 10 of the 13 plots for soil chemical analysis to compare the differences between mound and savannah plots. Drupe-type fruits and dispersal by animals, including mammals and birds, were more dominant in plant communities on termite mounds, whereas pod and winged fruits and wind-dispersed species were typical in matrix communities. Termite mounds were rich in soil nutrients compared with the surrounding matrix, and soil phosphorus was associated with mound soil. We conclude that dispersal mechanisms contribute to the distinct and diverse woody plant community on termite mounds. Seed dispersal by animals is likely to be more common in the distinct woody plant community of the mounds, whereas the community in the surrounding matrix was characterised by wind dispersal.

The magnitude of these pools is related to fire regime attributes. Climate change is expected to alter boreal fire regimes, leading to changes in the amount of stored carbon. Quantifying these changes is of importance to understanding and managing global carbon budgets. We investigate how fire return interval (FRI) interacts with seasonal variation in fire intensity and severity to affect carbon stocks and fluxes in the boreal black spruce forests of Quebec, Canada. A size-class structured population model of stand dynamics was coupled with an established model of boreal carbon dynamics and linked to a simplified representation of fire regime that simulates the occurrence of fires and their direct effects on canopy tree mortality, surface fuels combustion and regeneration. We simulated carbon stocks and fluxes under seven levels of FRI and two fire seasons: spring and summer. We tested for an effect of these fire regime parameters on equilibrium mean C stocks. All dead organic matter and biomass carbon stocks were sensitive to FRI between 60 and 300years. These C stocks were lower for summer fires that occurred under shorter FRIs. Net primary production was highest at FRIs between 150 and 300years. Total C stocks were highest for FRIs from 150 to 700years, varying little over this range. There was a small but significant difference of C pool sizes between stands with even and uneven tree-diameter distributions. This difference was greatest for FRIs of 150years or less. Reductions in equilibrium C storage are forecasted for nearly 27% of the study region under expected end-of-century climates.

This study uses multiple sedimentary proxies from Rio Seco Lake, a remote alpine lake in the Sierra Nevada, southeastern Spain, to reconstruct recent environmental and ecological changes in the lake and catchment. Two main climatic periods can be distinguished during the past 180years: Period One (1820 to similar to 1920s) characterized by colder and wetter conditions than the more recent Period Two (similar to 1920s to the present), characterized by warmer and drier conditions. Independent proxies such as subfossil chironomid assemblages, n-alkane indices, pollen data and/or spectrally inferred chlorophyll-a concentrations indicate a longer ice-cover period, colder water temperature and more pronounced accumulation of snow in the catchment during Period One than in Period Two, likely producing water stress for catchment plant growth because of the low rate of ice melting in Period One. As temperature increases and precipitation decreases from the 1920s onwards, a wider development of wetland plants is observed, which is associated with the longer warm season that contributed to snow and ice melting in the catchment. This continuing temperature rise and precipitation decrease over the past 60-years by similar to 0.24 degrees C per decade and -0.92mm/y, respectively, lead to an important increase in chlorophyll-a and changes in lake biotic assemblages. Major chironomid community structure changes to warmer water taxa were recorded, resulting in a 2 degrees C increase in mean July air temperature inferred by chironomids from similar to 1950 onwards. An inferred increase in primary production for the past few decades is consistent with higher temperatures, while wider development of wetland plants is associated with longer warm season. The coherence between independent environmental proxies, each associated with distinct mechanistic linkages to climatic shifts, strengthens our interpretations of a recent warming trend and an intensification of summer drought in this high-mountain area leading to distinct changes in the lake and its catchment. The impact of this climate change on the summits of Sierra Nevada and its influence transcends its geographical limits because these systems provide ecosystem services to a vast area.

Subterranean termites (Reticulitermes spp.) likely influence nutrient cycling within their endemic range in the temperate Holarctic through the translocation of elements from wood to soil by lining their below-ground biogenic structures with frass (feces). We designed a study to follow the frass' by comparing concentrations of 18 elements (Al, B, Ba, C, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, P, Si, Sr, and Zn) in substratesfood before and after digestion (wood and frass), as well as soil with and without direct termite manipulation (shelter tubes and soil core samples)associated with 18 subterranean termite colonies. Fourteen elements were more concentrated in frass than wood, and only Cr and Fe were lower in frass. The shelter tube-to-soil contrasts indicate that termites decrease levels of Al, Ba, Co, and Cr while increasing C and Ca in soil. Therefore, Reticulitermes likely modulate element flows by returning organic C and base cations to weathered, acidic Ultisols of southeastern US forests. Research on the ecological role of subterranean termites outside of the built environment is showing the scale of impact these cryptic superorganism ecosystem engineers can have on temperate forest functions.

However, changing ungulate herbivory regimes may be altering recruitment success and resilience of aspen forests. The objective of this observational studywas to quantify the impacts of ungulate herbivory on aspen recruitment potential. We sampled 36 aspen dominant stands on the Fishlake National Forest in Utah for browse of apical meristems, suckering density (< 180 cm in height), and recruitment density (>= 180 cm). Our analysis indicated that for each 10% of apical meristems browsed, annual vertical and radial growth rates and recruitment density were reduced by 1.2 cm, 0.02 mm, and 17 ha(-1), respectively. In contrast, aspen suckering density increased by 1 230 suckers ha-1, with each 10% browse of apical meristems. This suggests that ungulates contribute to aspen suckers persisting in the understory for longer periods and may alter recruitment success of aspen stands. Aspen that were under high ungulate browse pressure were associated with lower growth rates and persisted for twice as long in the understory. For example, a 5-yr-old sucker was predicted to be 115 cm without browse of apical meristems and 60 cm with 100% browse of apical meristems. Further, aspens of the same height with 100% browse of apical meristems were nearly 4 yr older on average than aspens with no evidence of browse of apical meristems. Approximately 34% of aspen suckers had persisted in the understory , 100 cm for >= 6 yr, and 7% of suckers had persisted in the understory for >= 10 yr. Our results suggest that high rates of meristem removal are correlated with increased aspen suckering yet reduced aspen growth and recruitment. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management.

We compared late-cut hayfields and continuously grazed pastures at low to moderate cattle densities for providing suitable breeding habitat in eastern Canada for the nationally threatened Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus). To examine the quality of both habitats, we conducted point counts and monitored 87 nests during the 2015 and 2016 breeding seasons. Bobolink abundance and daily survival rate (DSR) of nests were modeled sequentially by habitat and sex as a function of vegetation structure, prey availability, and agricultural management. Year and habitat were the strongest predictors of abundance. When analyzed separately for pastures and hayfields, vegetation height was most important for female abundance in pastures while pasture size was most important for males. Nests in hayfields had significantly higher daily survival (DSR = 0.98 +/- 0.01) than nests in pastures (DSR = 0.94 +/- 0.01). Nesting success was highest in hayfields with taller vegetation, while in pastures, no microhabitat variable showed a clear relationship with DSR. Within pastures, cattle stocking densities of <= 1 animal units (AU) . ha(-1) were not related to DSR. This study provides evidence that late-cut hay is of highest quality, but that small-scale beef farms with low to moderate stocking densities are suitable targets for conservation efforts of Bobolinks in eastern North America.

We investigated the impacts of oil and gas development on space use of bobwhite using a multiseason approach. We captured and monitored bob-white in the breeding season (1 April-30 September, n = 135 individuals) and nonbreeding season (1 October-31 March, n = 30 coveys) andmodeled their habitat selection in a resource-utilization function (third order, within home range selection) and resource-selection function (second order, home range selection) format. Generally, energy infrastructure effects on bobwhite were neutral, but breeding season bobwhite did select for areas near low-traffic roads (beta= -0.31 +/- 0.15 SE). In the nonbreeding season, coveys selected for areas within their homerangewith a limited viewshed (i.e., areas with limited visibility of anthropogenic structures; beta= -0.03 +/- 0.02 SE). Selection differed between sexes for well pads (t = -2.12, P= 0.04) but was otherwise similar. At the level of home range selection, bobwhite exhibited a preference for areas with a low density of oil and gas wells and a high density of low-traffic roads during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons (breeding: beta(well) = -0.14 +/- 0.02, beta(road) = 0.26 +/- 0.27; nonbreeding: beta(well) = -0.08 +/- 0.03, beta(road) = 0.16 +/- 0.03). As a generalist species, bobwhite appear to be largely tolerant of energy infrastructure and associated disturbances at moderate levels of development but may be sensitive to high densities of oil and gas pads.

Variable soil water, precocious germination and emergence, and the presence of soil fungal pathogens often reduce plant establishment. Novel restoration treatments that increase soil water during early forb life stages, delay germination and emergence to coincide with favorable spring conditions, and reduce mortality from soil fungal pathogens may benefit native forb restoration. We compared the efficacy of three novel treatments-snow fencing, plant protection fabric, and seed coatings-to improve establishment of a forb species native to the Great Basin, basalt milkvetch (Astragalus filipes Torr. ex A. Gray). We replicated treatments plus a notreatment control at three sites in the Great Basin in a randomized complete block design over 2 yr. To evaluate the efficacy of our restoration treatments, we measured germination, seedling emergence, establishment, and second-yr survival. The effects of snow fencing and plant protection fabric varied by site and life stage and were likely influenced by thewet spring conditions across sites, particularly the two northern sites. Snow fencing increased establishment and second-yr survival at one site. Plant protection fabric did not benefit any life stage at any site. Seed coatings increased seedling emergence at all sites but did not affect establishment or survival. Overall, second-yr survival remained low across all sites and treatments. Our study indicates that our treatments can positively affect basalt milkvetchemergence, establishment, and survival, but additional management actions are needed to improve long-term restoration success of native forbs.

Patterns of Big Sagebrush Plant Community Composition and Stand Structure in the Western United States	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						age; Artemisia tridentata; climate; cover; plant functional type; sagebrush	VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS; FUNCTIONAL TYPES; DRY REGIONS; PRECIPITATION; ECOHYDROLOGY; CLIMATE; SHRUB; CONSERVATION; WYOMINGENSIS; COMPETITION	Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) plant communities are found in western North America and comprise a mix of shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Climate, topography, and soil water availability are important factors that shape big sagebrush stand structure and plant community composition; however, most studies have focused on understanding these relationships at sites in a small portion of the big sagebrush region. Our goal was to characterize detailed stand structure and plant composition patterns and identify environmental variables related to those patterns by sampling 15 sites distributed across the western United States. In each site, we characterized stand structure at the individual shrub level and at the site level. We quantified size distributions and assessed relationships among canopy volume, age, and height. We also characterized functional type cover and species composition and related those to climatic, topographic, and edaphic variables. Mean big sagebrush age ranged from 21 (+/- 8) to 57 (+/- 22) yr at individual sites, mean height ranged from 0.23 (+/- 0.12) to 0.67 (+/- 0.23) m, and mean canopy volume ranged from 0.03 (+/- 0.04) to 0.62 (+/- 0.51) m(3). Bare ground and litter contributed the most cover (mean = 64%), followed by big sagebrush (mean = 39% of vascular plant cover). There was a negative relationship between big sagebrush cover and grass and forb cover. Species composition was related to both climate and elevation, likely because these variables influence water availability. Although our study was limited to 15 field sites, our detailed descriptions of widely distributed sites provide insight into the magnitude of variability in big sagebrush plant community structure.

Although traditionally used as a widespread land management tool in the past, its continued use could be under threat due to public perceptions pertaining to risks from burns getting out of control, as well as the impacts of smoke pollution and ecological damage. To determine the attitudes of rural practitioners and residents toward use of fire as a land management tool, this paper reports the results, analysis, and interpretation to a survey question: "Do you feel fire is a good option for managing rural land?", along with an analysis of key attitudes toward the use of fire as a land management tool. The survey was undertaken with 696 respondents consisting of (rural land managers, rural populace, and rural fire personnel) within New Zealand. The survey identified differing perceptions about the suitability of prescribed fire use by land-based sectors. Five constructs explained the attitudes toward use of fire as a land management tool: benefits of fire use, the tradition of fire as a tool, regulations and liabilities, smoke impacts from fire, and the risks from knowledge loss and changing land use. Results showed that a person's high agreement with the construct concerning negative smoke impacts resulted in less agreement that fire was a good option for use in rural land management in New Zealand. Main demographics influencing a positive attitude toward the use of fire included gender (male), their current use of fire, and larger land area managed. For prescribed fire to continue to be a useful tool, an improved understanding of current management practices and clear guidelines around best practice in using fire in New Zealand to manage land are required, with particular emphasis on limiting smoke impacts.

As wildfire frequency increases across these areas of the United States, it is imperative to understand how these disturbances affect beneficial invertebrate communities. We examined bee (Hymenoptera), spider (Araneae), and vegetative communities 1 yr before and 1 yr after a large wildfire swept across an intact grassland in eastern Oregon. Several sites were left unburned after the fire, and a before-after-control-impact study design was used to assess changes within the communities. Fire had no effect on bee or spider abundance, or spider diversity or richness; however, fire significantly increased native bee diversity and richness. In addition, composition of both native bee and spider communities differed significantly between burned and unburned areas 1 yr after the fire. Sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae) and several bee species (primarily large, generalist species) were associated with burned sites. Invasive annual grass and biological soil crust cover decreased significantly in burned sites, butmaximum vegetation height and litter cover did not differ significantly among treatments. Forb abundance increased in burned sites; however, species richness of forbs in burned and unburned sites did not differ significantly 1 yr after the fire. Several forbs were indicative of burned areas including non-native species, such as Douglas' knotweed (Polygonum douglasii) and Russian thistle (Salsola tragus), and native species such as Canadian horseweed (Conyza canadensis), hoary tansyaster (Machaeranthera canescens), and tall willowherb (Epilobium brachycarpum). This study demonstrates that both invertebrate and plant communities show strong short-term responses to wildfire, and our results can be used to inform management of rare habitat and biodiversity in rangelands impacted by wildfire in arid grasslands.

Control of Non-migrating Bar Morphodynamics on Survival of Populus nigra Seedlings during Floods	WETLANDS			English	Article						Non-migrating bar; Uprooting; Burial; Riparian vegetation; Seedlings	GRAVEL-BED RIVER; LOIRE RIVER; VEGETATION CONTROLS; EARTH SURFACE; FLOW; ESTABLISHMENT; RECRUITMENT; SALICACEAE; SUCCESSION; STREAMFLOW	Populus nigra seedling survival to flood stresses during their first stage of development was analyzed in the Loire River, France. We related bar dynamics (assessed from bathymetrical, topographical, flow velocity, scour chains, and sediment grain size surveys) to seedling survival. The study highlights (i) the influence of flood succession and flood stages on seedling survival after establishment, (ii) the spatial distribution of fluvial processes at the bar scale and their relative contribution to seedling mortality, (iii) threshold values for each process. At the bar scale, 28% of mortality is explained by uprooting associated with erosion of sediments. To a lesser extent, uprooting by drag force applied on the stems and burying by sediments also contribute to seedling mortality. The majority of seedling mortality is ultimately due to a combination of erosion and burial (50.6%) during flood events. The relative contribution of each process depends on the combination and phasing of erosion and deposition processes, sediment supply (quantity and grain size), and flow velocity governed by hydrological variations. Based on the results of this study we hypothesize that the survival of seedlings during floods may be a function of local processes involved in bar dynamics.	[Wintenberger, C.

In the US portion of the PPR, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has established Waterfowl Production Areas (WPAs) in an effort to enhance waterfowl production. Most WPAs have an area of protected upland surrounding wetlands that can act as a buffer to reduce the transport of contaminants, including pesticides. We assessed the extent that neonicotinoid insecticides occurred in the ponded water of wetlands within WPAs located along a gradient of agricultural influence throughout west-central Minnesota. Of the five neonicotinoids we tested for, two were not detected. However, at least one of the other three, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam, were detected in 29% of our wetland water samples. Additionally, both the occurrence and total concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in sites with higher surrounding crop use. Neonicotinoid insecticides, if persistent for long periods of time, have the potential to affect aquatic-invertebrate communities within PPR wetlands. Our research indicates that areas often perceived as protected may still be at risk to neonicotinoid contamination, emphasizing the importance of maintaining effective grassland buffers around wetlands.

Methane Cycling Contributes to Distinct Patterns in Carbon Stable Isotopes of Wetland Detritus	WETLANDS			English	Article						Methane; Stable isotopes; Wetlands; Decomposition; Food webs	ORGANIC-MATTER; COASTAL WETLANDS; FOOD WEBS; DECOMPOSITION; SIGNATURES; RESPONSES; PATHWAYS; BALANCE; ENERGY	Increasing global temperatures are changing the balance between carbon sequestration and its microbial processing in wetlands, making the tracking of these processes important. We used detrital carbon stable isotopes (C-13) to trace aerobic decomposition and CH4 production in two experiments conducted in Alaskan wetlands. In laboratory bottle incubations, larger decreases in detritus delta C-13 corresponded to higher net CH4 and CO2 production rates. Because net CH4 production was the stronger predictor and its effect was negative, we hypothesize that decreases in C-13 trace concurrent CH4 production and oxidation. In a field experiment, decreases in detritus delta C-13 were not correlated with aerobic decomposition rates, but were positively correlated with CH4 production potentials as estimated from bottle incubations. We hypothesize that the positive relationship reflects only CH4 production, rather than concurrent production and oxidation. Although CH4 production rates were correlated with changes in detrital C-13 in both experiments, the direction of this relationship differed between laboratory and field with important consequences for the scale of ecological experiments. Our study demonstrates that CH4 cycling can create distinct patterns in C-13 of wetland detritus. Future studies should conduct explicit mass balance experiments to clarify mechanisms and determine the importance of scale in shaping isotopic patterns.
