Jonathan			The interaction of phylogeny and community structure: Linking the community composition and trait evolution of clades	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						beta-diversity; competition; environmental filtering; mammals; phylogenetic scale; trait evolution	ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; FUNCTIONAL TRAIT; SPATIAL SCALES; NULL MODEL; BODY-SIZE; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; NICHE; TREE; RELATEDNESS	Aim Community phylogenetic studies use information about the evolutionary relationships of species to understand the ecological processes of community assembly. A central premise of the field is that the evolution of species maps onto ecological patterns, and phylogeny reveals something more than species traits alone about the ecological mechanisms structuring communities, such as environmental filtering, competition, and facilitation. We argue, therefore, that there is a need for better understanding and modelling of the interaction of phylogeny with species traits and community composition. Innovation We outline a new approach that identifies clades that are ecophylogenetically clustered or overdispersed and assesses whether those clades have different rates of trait evolution. Ecophylogenetic theory would predict that the traits of clustered or overdispersed clades might have evolved differently, in terms of either tempo (fast or slow) or mode (e.g., under constraint or neutrally). We suggest that modelling the evolution of independent trait data in these clades represents a strong test of whether there is an association between the ecological co-occurrence patterns of a species and its evolutionary history. Main conclusions Using an empirical dataset of mammals from around the world, we identify two clades of rodents whose species tend not to co-occur in the same local assemblages (are phylogenetically overdispersed) and find independent evidence of slower rates of body mass evolution in these clades. Our approach, which assumes nothing about the mode of species trait evolution but instead seeks to explain it using ecological information, presents a new way to examine ecophylogenetic structure.

Mitonuclear discordance occurs in the small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus, with one mitochondrial haplogroup (HGI) more common in the cold climate region of China relative to another form (HGII) despite strong nuclear gene flow, providing a promising model to investigate climatic adaptation of mitochondrial genomes. We hypothesized that cold adaptation through HGI may be involved, and considered mitogenome evolution, population genetic analyses, and bioassays to test this hypothesis. In contrast to our hypothesis, chill-coma recovery tests and population genetic tests of selection both pointed to HGII being involved in cold adaptation. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HGII is nested within HGI, and has three nonsynonymous changes in ND2, ND5 and CYTB in comparison to HGI. These molecular changes likely increased mtDNA copy number, cold tolerance and fecundity of SBPH, particularly through a function-altering amino acid change involving M114T in ND2. Nuclear background also influenced fecundity and chill recovery (i.e., mitonuclear epistasis) and protein modelling indicates possible nuclear interactions for the two nonsynonymous changes in ND2 and CYTB. The high occurrence frequency of HGI in the cold climate region of China remains unexplained, but several possible reasons are discussed. Overall, our study points to a link between mtDNA variation and organismal-level evolution and suggests a possible role of mitonuclear interactions in maintaining mtDNA diversity.

A mechanistic understanding of repellent function against mammalian herbivores	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						Browse; Foraging decisions; Forestry; Ungulate; Wildlife damage	VARIED DIETS; DEER; SELECTION; EFFICACY; FLAVOR; ODORS; PREFERENCE; AVERSIONS; DAMAGE; SHEEP	BackgroundBrowsing repellents are widely used to deter large herbivores from consuming plants of ecological, economic and aesthetic importance. Understanding how these repellents function on a behavioural mechanistic level is critical to predicting effectiveness. Here, we illustrate how these mechanisms can be tested, by exposing a model mammalian herbivore, the fallow deer, to different concentrations of a commercial chemical repellent (HaTe2) in two-choice feeding trials.ResultsThe repellent acted as a defensive chemical for the food by both reducing visitation and the amount consumed. Deer favoured the less defended feeders before ingesting any food, suggesting that the repellent altered olfactory and/or visual cues. Deer also consumed less of the more defended food when choosing between low and high repellent feeders than no and low repellent feeders, indicating that the repellent modified flavour and/or sensation. Repellent effectiveness declined with increased exposure, suggesting that consumption had no negative post-ingestive effects, and thus, deterrence was not caused by a conditioned aversion or irritation. Instead, this pattern suggests that deer learned, through repeated sampling of repellent-treated food, that there was no adverse physiological effect of ingesting it.ConclusionsThese results imply that HaTe2 repellent will not be effective over prolonged periods or in the absence of alternative untreated food. Understanding the mechanisms driving repellent function using two-choice trials could help practitioners decide whether a particular repellent is likely to be effective against mammalian herbivory in their management scenario.

Here we try to assess whether the large lineage richness found in a New Guinean clade of mayflies (Ephemeroptera), namely the Thraulus group (Leptophlebiidae) could be associated with the recent orogenic processes, by applying a combination of phylogenetic, biogeographic and ecological shift analyses. New Guinean representatives of the Thraulus group appear monophyletic, with the possible exception of a weakly-supported early-diverging clade from the Sunda Islands. Dating analyses suggest an Eocene origin of the Thraulus group, predating by several million years current knowledge on the origin of other New Guinean aquatic organisms. Biogeographic inferences indicate that 27 of the 28 inferred dispersals (96.4%) occurred during the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene, while only one dispersal (3.6%) took place during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. This result contrasts with the higher number of altitudinal shifts (15 of 22; 68.2%) inferred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. Our study illustrates the role played by-potentially ecological-diversification along the elevation gradient in a time period concomitant with the establishment of high-altitude ecological niches, i.e., during orogenesis of the central New Guinean mountain range. This process might have taken over the previous main mode of diversification at work, characterized by dispersal and vicariance, by driving lineage divergence of New Guinean Leptophlebiidae across a wide array of habitats along the elevation gradient. Additional studies on organisms spanning the same elevation range as Thraulus mayflies in the tropics are needed to evaluate the potential role of the ecological opportunity or taxon cycles hypotheses in partly explaining the latitudinal diversity gradient.

In the Arctic, a high diversity of parasitoids relative to potential hosts suggests that parasitoids may exert strong selection pressure on arthropods, but the extent to which these interspecific linkages drive arthropod population dynamics remains unclear. Wolf spiders are dominant and ecologically important arctic predators that experience high rates of egg sac parasitism by wasps. We investigated potential changes in egg sac parasitism rates at two rapidly warming sites in Greenland: a high-arctic site (18 years of data, 1,088 egg sacs) and a low-arctic site (5 years of data, 538 egg sacs). While up to 13% of egg sacs were parasitized annually in the low-arctic site, we found no evidence of it at the high-arctic site despite the presence of congeneric parasitoid species at both locations. The surprising lack of parasitism in the north suggests that populations of this widespread spider species have different eco-evolutionary histories and may respond differentially to climate change.

The Canary Islands archipelago is a geographical area with an important overlap of high cetacean diversity and maritime traffic, including high-speed ferries. Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), currently listed as a vulnerable species, are severely impacted by ship strikes. Nearly 60% of sperm whales' deaths are due to ship strikes in the Canary Islands. In such cases, subcutaneous, muscular and visceral extensive hemorrhages and hematomas, indicate unequivocal antemortem trauma. However, when carcasses are highly autolyzed, it is challenging to distinguish whether the trauma occurred ante-or post-mortem. The presence of fat emboli within the lung microvasculature is used to determine a severe " in vivo" trauma in other species. We hypothesized fat emboli detection could be a feasible, reliable and accurate forensic tool to determine ante-mortem ship strikes in stranded sperm whales, even in decomposed carcasses. In this study, we evaluated the presence of fat emboli by using an osmium tetroxide (OsO4)-based histochemical technique in lung tissue of 24 sperm whales, 16 of them with evidence of ship strike, stranded and necropsied in the Canaries between 2000 and 2017. About 70% of them presented an advanced autolysis. Histological examination revealed the presence of OsO4-positive fat emboli in 13 out of the 16 sperm whales with signs of ship strike, and two out of eight of the "control" group, with varying degrees of abundance and distribution. A classification and regression tree was developed to assess the cut off of fat emboli area determining the high or low probability for diagnosing ship-strikes, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 100%. The results demonstrated: (1) the usefulness of fat detection as a diagnostic tool for "in vivo" trauma, even in decomposed tissues kept in formaldehyde for long periods of time; and (2) that, during this 18-year period, at least, 81% of the sperm whales with signs of ship strike were alive at the moment of the strike and died subsequently. This information is highly valuable in order to implement proper mitigation measures in this area.

Over 50,000 capture events and likely over 10,000 deaths are estimated to occur in the Italian waters alone. However, current knowledge on the interaction of sea turtles with fishing gears and the implementation of mitigation measures are still poor to hinder the decline of turtle populations in the Mediterranean. In this basin, where fisheries are multispecies, multi-gears and multinational, making demersal fishing activities profitable while preserving sea turtles is a challenge. This study aimed to develop bycatch reducer devices (BRDs) and alternative fishing gears to mitigate the impact of demersal fishing gears on sea turtles: (a) hard and flexible turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were tested in bottom trawling to immediately exclude turtles from the net; (b) visual deterrents (ultraviolet LEDs) were used to illuminate set nets and to alter turtle visual cues, avoiding entanglement during depredation activity. The results showed the different devices did not affect the commercial catch, while bycatch reduction was instead evident. Thus, the study highlights that introducing mitigation measures to reduce sea turtle bycatch in the Mediterranean, where the bycatch of vulnerable species seems as a global issue, can be possible at least in certain areas and periods. Considering fishermen reticence to change the gear traditionally used, determining the optimal gear configuration to minimize commercial loss while reducing bycatch, is the main issue while introducing new technologies. Therefore, a global effort should be done to introduce BRDs in different areas and fisheries of the Mediterranean.

The distribution of many native and invasive species has been predicted to change under future climate. We performed species distribution modelling of invasive alien plants (IAPs) to identify hotspots under current and future climate scenarios in Nepal, a country ranked among the most vulnerable countries to biological invasions and climate change in the world. Location Nepal. Methods We predicted climatically suitable niches of 24 out of the total 26 reported IAPs in Nepal under current and future climate (2050 for RCP 6.0) using an ensemble of species distribution models. We also conducted hotspot analysis to highlight the geographic hotspots for IAPs in different climatic zones, land cover, ecoregions, physiography and federal states. Results Under future climate, climatically suitable regions for 75% of IAPs will expand in contrast to a contraction of the climatically suitable regions for the remaining 25% of the IAPs. A high proportion of the modelled suitable niches of IAPs occurred on agricultural lands followed by forests. In aggregation, both extent and intensity (invasion hotspots) of the climatically suitable regions for IAPs will increase in Nepal under future climate scenarios. The invasion hotspots will expand towards the high-elevation mountainous regions. In these regions, land use is rapidly transforming due to the development of infrastructure and expansion of tourism and trade. Main conclusions Negative impacts on livelihood, biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as economic loss caused by IAPs in the future, may be amplified if preventive and control measures are not immediately initiated. Therefore, the management of IAPs in Nepal should account for the vulnerability of climate change-induced biological invasions into new areas, primarily in the mountains.

Enrichment of Lignin-Derived Carbon in Mineral-Associated Soil Organic Matter	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							LITTER DECOMPOSITION; SUBSTRATE QUALITY; IRON REDUCTION; STABILIZATION; FOREST; BIODEGRADATION; ACCUMULATION; OXIDATION; DEGRADATION; DISSOLUTION	A modern paradigm of soil organic matter proposes that persistent carbon (C) derives primarily from microbial residues interacting with minerals, challenging older ideas that lignin moieties contribute to soil C because of inherent recalcitrance. We proposed that aspects of these old and new paradigms can be partially reconciled by considering interactions between lignin decomposition products and redoxsensitive iron (Fe) minerals. An Fe-rich tropical soil (with C-4 litter and either C-13-labeled or unlabeled lignin) was pretreated with different durations of anaerobiosis (0-12 days) and incubated aerobically for 317 days. Only 5.7 +/- 0.2% of lignin C-13 was mineralized to CO2 versus 51.2 +/- 0.4% of litter C. More added lignin-derived C (48.2 +/- 0.9%) than bulk litter- derived C (30.6 +/- 0.7%) was retained in mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM; density >1.8 g cm(-3)), and 12.2 +/- 0.3% of lignin-derived C vs 6.4 +/- 0.1% of litter C accrued in clay-sized (<2 mu m) MAOM. Longer anaerobic pretreatments increased added lignin-derived C associated with Fe, according to extractions and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Microbial residues are important, but lignin-derived C may also contribute disproportionately to MAOM relative to bulk litter-derived C, especially following redox-sensitive biogeochemical interactions.

The study area consisted of a riverbank filtration transect fed by the river Lek, a branch of the lower Rhine, and exhibiting up to 60-year travel time. More than 18,000 profiles were detected. Hierarchical clustering revealed that 43% of the 15 most populated clusters were characterized by intensity trends with maxima in the 1990s, reflecting intensified human activities, wastewater treatment plant upgrades and regulation in the Rhine riparian countries. Tentative structure annotation was performed using automated in silico fragmentation. Candidate structures retrieved from ChemSpider were scored based on the fit of the in silico fragments to the experimental tandem mass spectra, similarity to openly accessible accurate mass spectra, associated metadata, and presence in a suspect list. Sixty-seven unique structures (72 over both ionization modes) were tentatively identified, 25 of which were confirmed and included contaminants so far unknown to occur in bank filtrate or in natural waters at all, such as tetramethylsulfamide. This study demonstrates that many classes of hydrophilic organics enter riverbank filtration systems, persisting and migrating for decades if biogeochemical conditions are stable.

Insights into Livestock-Related Microbial Concentrations in Air at Residential Level in a Livestock Dense Area	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; REAL-TIME PCR; AMBIENT ENDOTOXIN CONCENTRATIONS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; PARTICULATE MATTER; BIOAEROSOLS; BACTERIA; FARMS; SWINE	Microbial air pollution from livestock farms has raised concerns regarding public health. Little is known about airborne livestock-related microbial levels in residential areas. We aimed to increase insights into this issue. Air measurements were performed in 2014 and 2015 at 61 residential sites in The Netherlands. Quantitative-PCR was used to assess DNA concentrations of selected bacteria (commensals: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus spp.; a zoonotic pathogen: Campylobacter jejuni) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (tetW, mecA) in airborne dust. Mixed models were used to explore spatial associations (temporal adjusted) with livestock-related characteristics of the surroundings. DNA from commensals and AMR genes was detectable even at sites furthest away from farms (1200 m), albeit at lower levels. Concentrations, distinctly different between sites, were strongly associated with the density of farms in the surroundings especially with poultry and pigs. C. jejuni DNA was less prevalent (42% of samples positive). Presence of C. jejuni was solely associated with poultry (OR: 4.7 (95% CI: 1.7-14), high versus low poultry density). Residential exposure to livestock-related bacteria and AMR genes was demonstrated. Identified associations suggest contribution of livestock farms to microbial air pollution in general and attribution differences between farm types. This supports the plausibility of recent studies showing health effects in relation to residential proximity to farms.	[de Rooij, Myrna M. T.; Hoek, Gerard; Schmitt, Heike; Heederik, Dick J.

Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as C-male/C-female (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important. Interspecies variation in maternal pollutant transfer may lead to negative effects scaling from an offspring to population level.

The application of piecewise regressions has been advocated as a rigorous statistical technique to identify such thresholds within SARs, but a large variety of piecewise models remains untested. We explore the prevalence and number of thresholds in SARs and examine whether the currently widely used method for detecting the small island effect (SIE) is robust. Location Global. Taxon We consider all multicellular taxa based on the criteria of datasets selection. Methods We apply 15 regression models, including linear regression and piecewise regressions with two and three segments to 68 global island datasets that are sourced from the literature. Results The number of area thresholds in SARs varied among groups and correlated positively with area range of a studied system. Under the AIC or AIC(c) criterion, three-segment piecewise models were more prevalent, whereas under the BIC criterion, two-segment piecewise models were more prevalent. From the results of Aegean Sea isopods, West Indies herpetofauna, and Australian Islands mammals, we found evidence that the traditional criteria for detection of SIEs are not robust. Main conclusions Our study demonstrates that (a) to detect an SIE, the comparison should use as many models as possible, including not only variants with and without a left-horizontal part, but also those with two and more segments; (b) naive use of the traditional two-segment piecewise regressions may cause poor estimations of both slope and breakpoint values; (c) the number of thresholds increases with the area range of a studied system; (d) conservation biologists and applied ecologists should determine the number of area thresholds when estimating the precise species-area patterns and making management strategies in fragmented landscapes.

To aid conservation of those species, knowledge on the variability of mortality rates is essential. Unfortunately, however, individual-based multiyear data sets that are required for that have only rarely been collected for free-ranging long-lived mammals. Here, we used a five-year data set comprising activity data of 1,445 RFID-tagged individuals of two long-lived temperate zone bat species, Natterer's bats (Myotis nattereri) and Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii), at their joint hibernaculum. Both species are listed as being of high conservation interest by the European Habitats Directive. Applying mixed-effects logistic regression, we explored seasonal survival differences in these two species which differ in foraging strategy and phenology. In both species, survival over the first winter of an individual's life was much lower than survival over subsequent winters. Focussing on adults only, seasonal survival patterns were largely consistent with higher winter and lower summer survival but varied in its level across years in both species. Our analyses, furthermore, highlight the importance of species-specific time periods for survival. Daubenton's bats showed a much stronger difference in survival between the two seasons than Natterer's bats. In one exceptional winter, the population of Natterer's bats crashed, while the survival of Daubenton's bats declined only moderately. While our results confirm the general seasonal survival pattern typical for hibernating mammals with higher winter than summer survival, they also show that this pattern can be reversed under particular conditions. Overall, our study points toward a high importance of specific time periods for population dynamics and suggests species-, population-, and age class-specific responses to global climate change.

The Limpopo National Park (LNP) is a 10,000 km(2) conservation area in southern Mozambique and key to protecting savannas in the region. Fire is an important factor in LNP's landscapes, but little is known about its role in the park's ecology. In this study, we explored the interaction between fire frequency (FF), landscape type, and vegetation. To assess the FF, we analyzed ten years of the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burned area product (2003-2013). A stratified random sampling approach was used to assess biodiversity across three dominant landscapes (Nwambia Sandveld-NS, Lebombo North-LN, and Shrubveld Mopane on Calcrete-C) and two FF levels (low-twice or less; and high-3 times or more, during 10 years). Six ha were sampled in each stratum, except for the LN versus high FF in which low accessibility allowed only 3 ha sampling. FF was higher in NS and LN landscapes, where 25% and 34% of the area, respectively, burned more than three times in 10 years. The landscape type was the main determinant of grass composition and biomass. However, in the sandy NS biomass was higher under high FF. The three landscapes supported three different tree/shrub communities, but FF resulted in compositional variations in NS and LN. Fire frequency had no marked influence on woody structural parameters (height, density, and phytomass). We concluded that the savannas in LNP are mainly driven by landscape type (geology), but FF may impose specific modifications. We recommend a fire laissez-faire management system for most of the park and a long-term monitoring system of vegetation to address vegetation changes related to fire. Fire management should be coordinated with the neighboring Kruger National Park, given its long history of fire management. Synthesis: This study revealed that grass and tree/shrub density, biomass, and composition in LNP are determined by the landscape type, but FF determines some important modifications. We conclude that at the current levels FF is not dramatically affecting the savanna ecosystem in the LNP (Figure 1). However, an increase in FF may drive key ecosystem changes in grass biomass and tree/shrub species composition, height, phytomass, and density.

We investigated the impacts of experimental whole-ecosystem warming on the Sphagnum moss microbiome, focusing on N-2 fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs). To characterize the microbiome response to warming, we performed next-generation sequencing of small subunit (SSU) rRNA and nitrogenase (nifH) gene amplicons and quantified rates of N-2 fixation activity in Sphagnum fallax individuals sampled from experimental enclosures over 2 years in a northern Minnesota, USA bog. The taxonomic diversity of overall microbial communities and diazotroph communities, as well as N-2 fixation rates, decreased with warming (p < 0.05). Following warming, diazotrophs shifted from a mixed community of Nostocales (Cyanobacteria) and Rhizobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) to predominance of Nostocales. Microbiome community composition differed between years, with some diazotroph populations persisting while others declined in relative abundance in warmed plots in the second year. Our results demonstrate that warming substantially alters the community composition, diversity, and N-2 fixation activity of peat moss microbiomes, which may ultimately impact host fitness, ecosystem productivity, and C storage potential in peatlands.

Microbial communities in these habitats are, thus, subjected to distinct environmental conditions. Understanding how these conditions influence marine lake microbial composition and function can be illuminating since global phenomena such as ocean acidification are predicted to profoundly affect the marine environment. Here we investigated the archaeal community composition and putative function in three biotopes (water, sediment, the sponge Biemna fortis) in three distinct habitats (Kakaban and Haji Buang Lakes and the surrounding open-water habitat of Berau, Indonesia). Both biotope and habitat were shown to be important predictors of variation in archaeal composition and higher taxon abundance, but habitat only proved to be a significant factor for water and sediment. The compositional differences among habitats were mainly driven by differences in sediment archaea. These differences were not only prevalent at a higher taxonomic level, but also at the level of OTU identity, suggesting a degree of environmental specialization of distinct Cenarchaeum symbiosum phylotypes. There were also differences in the abundance of predicted relative gene counts among biotopes and habitats with functions that favour the adaptation to stressful environmental conditions enriched in samples from marine lakes.

Dispersal kernels may be scalable: Implications from a plant pathogen	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						dispersal; epidemiology; long-distance dispersal; modelling; modified power distribution; Puccinia; scaling; SEIR; wheat	PRIMARY DISEASE GRADIENTS; DISTANCE SEED DISPERSAL; SPATIAL SCALE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK; SPORE DISPERSAL; GREGORY MODEL; AREA SOURCES; PART I	Aim Understanding how spatial scale of study affects observed dispersal patterns can provide insights to spatiotemporal population dynamics, particularly in systems with significant long-distance dispersal (LDD). We aimed to investigate the dispersal gradients of two rusts of wheat with spores of similar size, mass and shape, over multiple spatial scales. We hypothesized that a single dispersal kernel could fit the dispersal from all spatial scales well, and that it would be possible to obtain similar results in spatiotemporal increase of disease when modelling based on differing scales. Location Central Oregon and St. Croix Island. Taxa Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Triticum aestivum. Methods We compared empirically derived primary disease gradients of cereal rust across three spatial scales: local (inoculum source and sampling unit = 0.0254 m, spatial extent = 1.52 m) field-wide (inoculum source = 1.52 m, sampling unit = 0.305 m and spatial extent = 91.4 m) and regional (inoculum source and sampling unit = 152 m, spatial extent = 10.5 km). We then examined whether disease spread in spatially explicit simulations depended upon the scale at which data were collected by constructing a compartmental time-step model. Results The three data sets could be fit well by a single power law dispersal kernel. Simulating epidemic spread at different spatial resolutions resulted in similar patterns of spatiotemporal spread. Dispersal kernel data obtained at one spatial scale can be used to represent spatiotemporal disease spread at a larger spatial scale. Main Conclusions Organisms spread by aerially dispersed small propagules that exhibit LDD may follow similar dispersal patterns over a several hundred- or thousand-fold expanse of spatial scale. Given that the primary mechanisms driving aerial dispersal remains constant, it may be possible to extrapolate across scales when empirical data are unavailable at a scale of interest.

The effectiveness of detecting taxa corresponded well with an inshore-offshore gradient in sampling (i.e., distance from shore). Nevertheless, each method (i.e., littoral multihabitat sampling, kick and sweep sampling, and deep water dredging) contributed to some degree to overall taxa richness and species composition. Sampling in different depth zones characterized different assemblages, and consequently, inshore-offshore position was at least as important determinant of assemblage structure as longitudinal position of sampling sites in the river. Although we found significant congruency in the spatial variability of assemblages among the sampling methods, the relationships were only moderate. Our study on the large Danube River confirms studies from smaller rivers in other geographic regions that littoral monitoring provides higher taxa richness and more responsive changes to longitudinal gradients than deep water samples. Nevertheless, it also shows that sampling in different depth zones provides supplementary information on assemblage structure. Understanding changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages related to differences in sampling method is crucial to improve the bioassessment and environmental management of large rivers.

Yet, in heterogeneous forests, ecosystem function of different strata could be associated with traits or evolutionary relationships differently. Here, we integrate phylogenies and traits to evaluate the effects of elevational diversity on above-ground biomass across forest strata and spatial scales. Community-weighted means of height and leaf phosphorous concentration and functional diversity in specific leaf area exhibited positive correlations with tree biomass, suggesting that both positive selection effects and complementarity occur. However, high shrub biomass is associated with greater dissimilarity in seed mass and multidimensional trait space, while species richness or phylogenetic diversity is the most important predictor for herbaceous biomass, indicating that species complementarity is especially important for understory function. The strength of diversity-biomass relationships increases at larger spatial scales. We conclude that strata- and scale- dependent assessments of community structure and function are needed to fully understand how biodiversity influences ecosystem function.

Productivity does not correlate with species and functional diversity in Australian reforestation plantings across a wide climate gradient	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						Australian woodlands; biodiversity; community-weighted mean; ecological restoration; ecosystem function; functional divergence; functional evenness; functional richness; functional traits	ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; TREE PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; TRAIT; RESTORATION; GROWTH; MECHANISMS; RICHNESS; EVENNESS; ECOLOGY	Aim Understanding biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationships in forest systems is crucial for effective forest management and restoration, yet testing these relationships is often limited by biased diversity patterns in forestry plantings (biased towards commercially valuable species) and uncontrollable diversity in mature natural forests. Multispecies reforestation plantings present a valuable opportunity to investigate BEF relationships in woody systems, especially across large environmental gradients. Location Reforestation plantings across the arable region of Australia. Time period 1951-2012. Major taxa studied Three hundred and sixty-four woody plant species. Methods We examined relationships between productivity and diversity using inventory data from 977 plots in 386 multispecies reforestation plantings. Diversity was estimated using observed species richness and three functional diversity indices calculated from four functional traits: specific leaf area, wood density, seed mass and maximum attainable height. We modelled how plot-level biomass accumulation (a productivity proxy) correlated with these diversity indices, as well as age since planting, plant density and three environmental variables: solar radiation, moisture availability and soil sand content. These models were fitted across Australia and, separately, within eight groups of plantings with similar environmental conditions. Results We found no correlation between diversity and productivity, regardless of the diversity metric or spatial scale used (continent-wide or within environment groups). Instead, productivity was best explained by local environmental conditions and plant density. Main conclusions A positive relationship between diversity and productivity was not evident in planted forests across a wide range of Australian woodland and forest systems, at least in the first few decades of growth. Our findings suggest that the positive relationship between diversity and productivity commonly reported in experimental settings should not be assumed for all systems and conditions.

Why Are Whimbrels Not Advancing Their Arrival Dates Into Iceland? Exploring Seasonal and Sex-Specific Variation in Consistency of Individual Timing During the Annual Cycle	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						flexibility; consistency; annual cycle; whimbrel; individual; environmental change; timing; phonology	DISTANCE MIGRATION; STRATEGIES; BIRDS; CONSEQUENCES	The timing of annual events is key for organisms that exploit seasonal resources, as deviations from optimal timing might result in considerable fitness costs. Under strong time selection, individuals likely have fewer suitable strategies available than when selection is more relaxed, hence both consistency and flexibility might be advantageous depending on the life history or annual cycle stage. For migrants using both the arctic and the tropics during their annual cycle, the faster warming at higher latitudes than elsewhere in the range may lead to mismatches with local environmental conditions. Additionally, while individuals might already be limited in responding to changes at each stage, the potential degree of a given response will likely also be limited by responses at previous stages of the annual cycle. Contrary to other migratory waders breeding in Iceland, Icelandic whimbrels Numenius phaeopus islandicus have not changed arrival dates during the past 30 years, suggesting high individual consistency in spring arrival timing and a potential limitation in responding to a changing environment. After repeatedly tracking 12 individual Icelandic whimbrels at least twice throughout their annual cycle between 2012 and 2018, we investigated individual consistency of spring arrival date and other annual stages and migration strategy, and explored differences between sexes and seasons. Individuals were more consistent on timing of spring than autumn migration, and the most consistent stage was departure from the wintering sites. Timing of laying was the stage that varied the most, and no overall significant difference between sexes was observed, except on spring stopover duration. While lower consistency in laying dates might allow individuals to track the advancement of spring, consistency at departure from the wintering sites, stopover duration, and arrival into Iceland might limit the degree of advancement. Transgenerational changes in the migratory behavior of other wader species allows population level responses to a changing phenology, but seems unlikely for Icelandic whimbrels, given the stable dates of spring arrival in this population. Under continuing advancement of spring onset, it is thus important to acquire information on the timing of spring arrival of recruits and on the ontogeny of migration to understand how migratory schedules are defined and might influence responses of long-distance migrants to environmental change.

Tympanate moths perform evasive behavior in response to echolocation calls of bats, but they also utilize ultrasonic signals mostly generated by males close to an intended female mate in the context of courtship. Unlike calling songs used to advertise the presence and sexual attractiveness of the signaler, courtship songs need not always be acoustically conspicuous. Male courtship songs are predominantly soft but sufficient for detection by a nearby potential mate. Quiet courtship songs are thought to effectively avoid being eavesdropped by gleaning bats, acoustic parasitoids, and conspecific competitors, i.e., rival males. However, males of some moth species generate loud courtship songs. In the present study, the duration of courtship song, in addition to the sound level of the song was predicted to affect the likelihood of being perceived by eavesdroppers. Loud and lengthy courtship songs, which are easily exploited by eavesdroppers, would be expected to rarely evolve, because a female receiver close to a male emitting a conspicuous song would also be exposed to strong predation pressure. This study explored the relationship between the peak sound level and the duration of single song bouts in 26 moth species from the following families: Noctuidae, Erebidae, Crambidae, Pyralidae, and Geometridae. The softest and loudest songs with mean peak sound levels of 64 and 129 dB peSPL had mean durations of 1,900 and 312 ms, respectively, whereas the shortest and longest songs with mean durations of 110 and 8,839 ms had mean peak sound levels of 102 and 74 dB peSPL, respectively. The peak sound level and duration of courtship song exhibited a significant negative relationship across species. Although the energetic cost of producing song and the size of the sound-producing organ might also affect the relationship, the data support the conclusion that acoustic moths have adaptively evolved ultrasonic courtship songs with properties between "soft-and-long" and "loud-and-short" to avoid eavesdroppers.

Gamma (gamma) radiation is an environmentally important type of ionizing radiation as it can damage macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids due to its high frequency, short wavelength, and high energy photons. Here, we investigate whether short-term gamma-radiation changes the biochemical composition of primary producers and if radiation-induced changes affect higher trophic levels. Two phytoplankton species were exposed to two doses of gamma-radiation and compared to a control. The metabolic profile and total protein content of the algae were measured at five time points within 24 h. Additionally, we measured carbon incorporation rates of Daphnia magna fed with the exposed algae. Gamma radiation had a significant effect on phytoplankton biochemical composition, although these effects were species-specific. The changes in phytoplankton biochemical composition indicate that gamma-radiation induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). D. magna incorporated more carbon when fed with algae previously exposed to gamma-radiation; this could be due to radiation-induced changes in nutritional quality, algal anti-grazing defenses, or chemical feeding stimuli.

We assessed the adequacy and suitability of studies in reliably estimating the global snow leopard (Panthera uncia) population. We compiled a dataset of all the peer-reviewed published literature on snow leopard population estimation. Metadata analysis showed estimates of snow leopard density to be a negative exponential function of area, suggesting that study areas have generally been too small for accurate density estimation, and sampling has often been biased towards the best habitats. Published studies are restricted to six of the 12 range countries, covering only 0.3-0.9% of the presumed global range of the species. Re-sampling of camera trap data from a relatively large study site (c.1684 km(2)) showed that small-sized study areas together with a bias towards good quality habitats in existing studies may have overestimated densities by up to five times. We conclude that current information is biased and inadequate for generating a reliable global population estimate of snow leopards. To develop a rigorous and useful baseline and to avoid pitfalls, there is an urgent need for (a) refinement of sampling and analytical protocols for population estimation of snow leopards (b) agreement and coordinated use of standardized sampling protocols amongst researchers and governments across the range, and (c) sampling larger and under-represented areas of the snow leopard's global range.

We investigate how estimates of survival and individual growth, along with predictions about future population size, change with additional years of monitoring and data collected, using as a model system freshwater populations of marble (Salmo marmoratus), rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) living in Western Slovenian streams. Fish were sampled twice a year between 2004 and 2015. We found that in 3 out of 4 populations, a few years of data (3 or 4 sampling occasions, between 300 and 500 tagged individuals for survival, 100-200 for growth) provided the same estimates of average survival and growth as those obtained with data from more than 15 sampling occasions, while the estimation of the range of survival (i.e., the difference, over all sampling occasions considered, between maximum and minimum survival estimated in a sampling occasion) required more sampling occasions (up to 22 for marble trout), with little reduction of uncertainty around the point estimates. Predictions of mean density and variation in density over time did not change with more data collected after the first 5 years (i.e., 10 sampling occasions) and overall were within 10% of the observed mean and variation in density over the whole monitoring program.

However, evidence that populations may show different responses to the climate and environmental conditions is growing. Whether this differential sensitivity may arise even among neighboring populations remains elusive. We compared the trends of two neighboring populations of the Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni, using data from a 12-year survey of 158 colonies in Sicily, Italy; the two populations inhabiting a lowland and an highland area, respectively. Population trends were modeled through the TRIM algorithms implemented in R (package rtrim). A reversed U-shaped population trend was observed in the lowland, while the highland population showed oscillations around a stable trend. Sahel rainfall 2 years before each annual survey significantly affected population variation in the lowland, while rainfall in March and an index of primary productivity in the breeding areas affected population variation in the highland. This suggests that the population in the lowland may be limited mainly by winter survival in Sahel, because the lowland may be an optimal breeding area for this species. In contrast, the highland population, which occupies a different part of the climatic niche of the species, may be limited mainly by reproductive output, because rainfall in March and the primary productivity in May could represent prey availability immediately before and during the breeding months. Overall, our findings suggest that population-specific environmental sensitivity might occur even over small (<100 km) geographical scales, highlighting the need for population-specific conservation strategies.

We used a spatial simulation model and an empirical case study to assess the conditions under which the loss of seed dispersers has a detectable effect on a species' spatial pattern. Our simulation experiments suggested that detecting spatial change following disperser loss will be difficult, except when rates of fruit removal are initially high and then completely disappear. To contextualize the simulation modeling, we used spatial point pattern analyses to characterize the spatial pattern of two large-seeded species (Leucopogon nutans, a fire-killed seeder shrub and Macrozamia riedlei, a long-lived, resprouting cycad) in the jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of southwestern Australia. The plant species' primary disperser, the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), was absent from one of the sites we considered, but present at the other two. There was no detectable difference for either plant species in the strength of aggregation between sites with and without emu. However, even if disperser loss may not greatly affect local spatial structure for most plant species, it is likely to be important for long distance dispersal and genetic structuring of populations, so accurate characterization of the dispersal kernel is critical, especially in terms of plant emigration.

Among them, sponges are one of the major components, yet population connectivity of none of their many Antarctic species has been studied. To investigate gene flow, local adaptation and resilience to near-future changes caused by global warming, we sequenced 62 individuals of the sponge Dendrilla antarctica along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and the South Shetlands (spanning ~900 km). We obtained information from 577 double digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq)-derived single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), using RADseq techniques for the first time with shallow-water sponges. In contrast to other studies in sponges, our 389 neutral SNPs data set showed high levels of gene flow, with a subtle substructure driven by the circulation system of the studied area. However, the 140 outlier SNPs under positive selection showed signals of population differentiation, separating the central-southern WAP from the Bransfield Strait area, indicating a divergent selection process in the study area despite panmixia. Fourteen of these outliers were annotated, being mostly involved in immune and stress responses. We suggest that the main selective pressure on D. antarctica might be the difference in the planktonic communities present in the central-southern WAP compared to the Bransfield Strait area, ultimately depending on sea-ice control of phytoplankton blooms. Our study unveils an unexpectedly long-distance larval dispersal exceptional in Porifera, broadening the use of genome-wide markers within nonmodel Antarctic organisms.

In some cases, single large-effect genes have been found to underlie important traits; however, complex traits are expected to be under polygenic control and elucidation of multiple gene interactions may be required to fully understand the genetic basis of the trait. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of the ocean- and river-maturing ecotypes in anadromous Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus). In Pacific lamprey, the ocean-maturing ecotype is distinguished by advanced maturity of females (e.g., large egg mass) at the onset of freshwater migration relative to immature females of the river-maturing ecotype. We examined a total of 219 adult Pacific lamprey that were collected at-entry to the Klamath River over a 12-month period. Each individual was genotyped at 308 SNPs representing known neutral and adaptive loci and measured at morphological traits, including egg mass as an indicator of ocean- and river-maturing ecotype for females. The two ecotypes did not exhibit genetic structure at 148 neutral loci, indicating that ecotypic diversity exists within a single population. In contrast, we identified the genetic basis of maturation ecotypes in Pacific lamprey as polygenic, involving two unlinked gene regions that have a complex epistatic relationship. Importantly, these gene regions appear to show stronger effects when considered in gene interaction models than if just considered additive, illustrating the importance of considering epistatic effects and gene networks when researching the genetic basis of complex traits in Pacific lamprey and other species.

Genome-scale sampling suggests cryptic epigenetic structuring and insular divergence in Canada lynx	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						DNA methylation; ecological epigenetics; population differentiation	INTRAGENIC DNA METHYLATION; BODY-SIZE; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION; COMPUTATION; SPECIATION; LANDSCAPE	Determining the molecular signatures of adaptive differentiation is a fundamental component of evolutionary biology. A key challenge is to identify such signatures in wild organisms, particularly between populations of highly mobile species that undergo substantial gene flow. The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) is one species where mainland populations appear largely undifferentiated at traditional genetic markers, despite inhabiting diverse environments and displaying phenotypic variation. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate both neutral genetic structure and epigenetic differentiation across the distributional range of Canada lynx. Newfoundland lynx were identified as the most differentiated population at neutral genetic markers, with demographic modelling suggesting that divergence from the mainland occurred at the end of the last glaciation (20-33 KYA). In contrast, epigenetic structure revealed hidden levels of differentiation across the range coincident with environmental determinants including winter conditions, particularly in the peripheral Newfoundland and Alaskan populations. Several biological pathways related to morphology were differentially methylated between populations, suggesting that epigenetic modifications might explain morphological differences seen between geographically peripheral populations. Our results indicate that epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation, are powerful markers to investigate population differentiation in wild and non-model systems.

Polistes paper wasps are popular study models, as workers retain the ability to reproduce: such totipotency is likely representative of the early stages of social evolution. Polistes is thought to have originated in the tropics, where seasonal constraints on reproductive options are weak and social groups are effectively perennial. Yet, most Polistes research has focused on nontropical species, where seasonality causes family groups to disperse; cofoundresses forming new nests the following spring are often unrelated, leading to the suggestion that direct fitness through nest inheritance is key in the evolution of helping behaviour. Here, we present the first comprehensive genetic study of social structure across the perennial nesting cycle of a tropical Polistes-Polistes canadensis. Using both microsatellites and newly developed single nucleotide polymorphism markers, we show that adult cofoundresses are highly related and that brood production is monopolized by a single female across the nesting cycle. Nonreproductive cofoundresses in tropical Polistes therefore have the potential to gain high indirect fitness benefits as helpers from the outset of group formation, and these benefits persist through the nesting cycle. Direct fitness may have been less important in the origin of Polistes sociality than previously suggested. These findings stress the importance of studying a range of species with diverse life history and ecologies when considering the evolution of reproductive strategies.

Effects of climate change on habitat and connectivity for populations of a vulnerable, endemic salamander in Iran	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Threatened species; Neurergus kaiseri; Habitat loss; Connectivity; Conservation	KAISERI CAUDATA SALAMANDRIDAE; NEURERGUS-KAISERI; LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION; CONSERVATION STATUS; PSEUDO-ABSENCES; PROTECTED AREAS; CIRCUIT-THEORY; MOUNTAIN NEWT; BIODIVERSITY	Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the biggest threats to amphibian populations and anthropogenic climate change may exacerbate these. The response of Iran's amphibians to climate change is uncertain and yet making an accurate prediction of how the species will respond is critical for conservation. We assessed how expected future climate scenarios before the years 2050 and 2070 might influence the geographic distribution and habitat connectivity of the Lorestan Mountain Newt (Neurergus kaiseri). We examined presence data (2010-2018) of the species according to environmental and anthropogenic factors, and created an ensemble model of habitat suitability based on eight species distribution models (SDMs). Then, we used the concept of circuit theory to estimate potential linkages between the habitat patches. We applied the ensemble calibrated models and quantified spatial connectivity to assess the influence of climate change on the species range for the years 2050 and 2070 under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of three general circulation models (GCMs). Models using current climate predicted that 6.8% of the 267,609 km(2 )study area has suitable conditions for the species, but only about 7% of these climatically suitable landscapes are covered by conservation areas. Temperature and precipitation-related climatic variables made the largest contribution to the distribution model. Under projected climate conditions, we found a decline of 56-98% of the suitable habitat and predicted a potential for distributional shifts towards higher elevations by 2050 and 2070. Although there is relatively good connectivity between many habitat patches today, models predict that suitable areas available to the newt will become increasingly fragmented under projected climate change scenarios. Our findings support the hypothesis that projected climatic shifts will negatively influence suitable habitats of amphibians and likely cause upward shifts in elevation in range of some species. Identifying potentially suitable habitats and important linkages between habitat patches under different climate scenarios are crucial steps in conservation planning for the Lorestan Mountain Newt.

Here we assessed the near threatened Rothschild's giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) in Uganda. We applied individual-based photographic surveys to generate abundance estimates for all extant populations, using either mark-recapture estimates or complete enumeration, and reviewed available historical records to reconstruct the population history of giraffe in Uganda. Although anecdotal evidence from the early 20th century suggests giraffe were widely distributed and abundant, the earliest quantitative estimates from the 1960's suggest a countrywide population of nearly 1,800 individuals across five major populations. Between the 1960's and the 1990's, giraffe numbers in Uganda declined by approximately 90%; such that at the nadir in the early 1990's, there were fewer than 100 giraffe and three of five populations went locally extinct. Multiple lines of evidence attribute this decline to increased illegal hunting caused by widespread political and social instability. Populations rebounded from mid 1990's to the mid 2010's with current national estimates of approximately 1,400 adult/subadult individuals, mostly attributed to the growth of a single population in northern Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP). Our recent mark-recapture estimates for northern MFNP indicate the adult/subadult population size is 1,318 (+/- 27.6 SE) giraffe - accounting for over 90% of the current total population in Uganda, thereby creating an "all the eggs in one basket" risk. Recent conservation measures by management authorities seek to spread this risk by translocating individuals from MFNP to several other locations to reinforce existing populations or create new populations. The increase in the northern MFNP giraffe population suggests that it can serve as a source for these translocations, and the understanding of historical distribution can be used to inform future reintroduction and reinforcement efforts.

We present a detailed account of the expansion of P. annua across its 30 years of establishment (1985/1986, 1986/1987, 1987/1988, 1989/1990 and 1991/1992 - historic data, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 - our own observations) and how this relates to the historical human activity at this site. We also evaluate the first stages of the control effort, i.e. tussock removal by hand. For a subset of the removed tussocks we also removed soil in order to assess the importance of the soil seed bank in the course of this invasion. The population showed a spatio-temporal dynamic increase in area from 1985/1986 to 1987/1988 growing season followed by a decrease in area noted in 1989/1990 and subsequent increase in area and diversity of occupied habitats. Analysis of distribution dynamics did not show a significant difference in the number of tussocks recorded in the 2014/2015 austral summer between cartogram squares occupied in 1991/1992 or earlier, and those occupied just in 2014/2015. There was, however, a high correlation in the number of tussocks per square between the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 census. Field observations conducted in 2015/2016 within the whole Point Thomas Oasis indicated that on 6 out of 51 sites cleared during the 2014/2015 austral summer, P. annua had re-established, mostly on sites where no soil was collected. Of the soil samples removed from beneath tussocks, seed germinated in 19% of the samples (160 seedlings in total). These results indicate that the strategy of soil seed bank formation has been very effective in extreme Antarctic conditions, providing a 'temporal rescue effect' which has enabled the survival of the population, and hinders the effective eradication of this invasive species.

Effects of eucalyptus plantations on avian and herb species richness and composition in North-West Spain	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biodiversity; Native forests; Eucalyptus plantations; Spain; Species nestedness; Species spatial turnover	TREE PLANTATIONS; LAND-USE; SOIL; HABITAT; FOREST; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; POPULATIONS; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY	Eucalyptus plantations have been established in many areas of the world due to their fast growth and profitability. In NW Spain, Eucalyptus plantations now cover a larger area than native forests. Although Eucalyptus plantations have been shown to affect biodiversity, relatively few studies have compared their effect on multiple taxonomic groups and different aspects of biodiversity. We compared herb and bird species richness and bird abundance between 14 paired patches of native deciduous forest and Eucalyptus plantations in a heterogeneous agro-forest region of NW Spain. We also investigated whether Eucalyptus plantations contribute to shifts in community composition by analysing species nestedness and turnover. We found that species richness of both herbs and birds was consistently lower in Eucalyptus plantations compared to native forests. Furthermore, the abundances of bird species characteristic of agricultural, forest, scrubland and other habitats, were all much lower in Eucalyptus plantations than in native forests. Herb and bird communities were also significantly dissimilar between the two habitats, but as a result of different ecological processes. Species turnover explained variation between habitats in herb composition, such that species present in native forests were typical for both farmland and forest habitats, whereas those present in Eucalyptus plantations were typical for scrub and farmland habitats. In contrast, bird assemblages showed a significant nested subset pattern, with fewer species in Eucalyptus plantations compared to native forests. In total, the relative abundance of cavity-nesting forest birds was at least 64% higher in native forests. Our results show that Eucalyptus plantations cannot replace native forests as they harbour different herb species and only a subset of the bird species found in native forests. Considering the current rate of increase of Eucalyptus plantations and the fragmentation of native forests in NW Spain, a lack of conservation of native forests could result in future loss of biodiversity in general and forest specialist species in particular.

Forest land-use history affects outcomes of habitat augmentation for amphibian conservation	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Amphibians; Complex life cycles; Land-use history; Occupancy; Vernal pools	POOL-BREEDING AMPHIBIANS; COARSE WOODY DEBRIS; SPOTTED SALAMANDERS; AGRICULTURAL LAND; USE LEGACIES; SOIL CARBON; RECOVERY; COVER; SUCCESSION; EMIGRATION	Historical land use (especially agriculture) has seldom been considered in the development of conservation programs for amphibians, a group in global decline. Habitat augmentation (e.g., wetland creation) is a growing conservation strategy to stem population declines in regions affected by habitat loss, but such actions are often implemented indiscriminately of landscape contexts that may mediate conservation outcomes for species with complex life cycles (i.e., distinct larval, juvenile, and adult stages). We examined the contribution of variation in quantity of larval (aquatic) and quality of juvenile/adult (terrestrial) habitat to the distribution of two pool-breeding and forest-dependent amphibian species in upland forest patches with histories that ranged from former agricultural lands (secondary forests) to never having been deforested (legacy forests). Using area-constrained visual encounter surveys in two consecutive years with contrasting precipitation conditions (extreme drought and extreme rainfall), we estimated forest patch occupancy probabilities of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) at a study area in central New York State, USA, and characterized terrestrial microhabitats in 29 population "neighborhoods" (9.3 ha) that varied in larval habitat availability (0-10 constructed vernal pools) and extent of secondary versus legacy forest. Terrestrial amphibian habitat in secondary forests featured shallower leaf litter, denser understory vegetation, and fewer cover object refuges than in legacy forests. The presence of wood frogs was solely affected by breeding pool densities whereas that of the longer-lived and less dispersive spotted salamanders depended on both quantity of larval habitat and quality of terrestrial habitat, with higher levels of occurrence in legacy forests and, during the drought year, where pool densities were greater. These results suggest that larval habitat augmentation can boost populations of amphibians with complex life cycles, but climate variation and land-use legacies mediate conservation outcomes for long-lived habitat specialists.

However, in order to improve breeding programs, an assessment of the genetic diversity of the founder individuals is required to avoid genetic problems such as inbreeding, fixation of deleterious alleles, or loss of allelic diversity due to genetic drift. In this research, we assessed the genetic diversity of the founder individuals from three Wildlife Management Units (UMA) dedicated to the reproduction of Dermatemys mawii in southeast Mexico, and from three wild populations using ten microsatellite markers. Dermatemys mawii is a freshwater turtle that is critically endangered due principally to fragmentation, loss, degradation, and contamination of its habitat, in addition to hunting for human consumption. Furthermore, genetic relationships among UMAs and wild populations, as well as within each kind of group, were investigated by means of Bayesian analysis (STRUCTURE software) and discriminant analysis of principal component (DAPC). Genetic diversity in wild populations could be considered as medium, and are less than values observed for UMAs. Genetic diversity for UMAs and wild populations were discussed considering origin of individuals, translocation between UMAs, habitat quality among other factors. Genetic structure analysis highlighted an evident separation between UMAs and wild populations (Bayesian and DAPC analyses), and the hierarchical analysis of structure among UMAs reflected the origin and relationship among them, whereas geographical situation of wild populations is the best explanation for its hierarchical structure. In light of our results, some conservation and management recommendations are provided for this endangered freshwater turtle. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using N-mixture models to estimate abundance and temporal trends of black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis L.) populations from aerial counts	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Aerial survey; Black rhinoceros; Dynamic N-Mixture models; South Africa	PILANESBERG NATIONAL-PARK; SERENGETI WILDEBEEST; HIERARCHICAL-MODELS; DYNAMICS; CONSERVATION; PRECISION; INFERENCE; BIAS; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT	Inaccurate estimates of animal populations may lead to flawed management interventions, therefore, it is essential to understand the status and population trend of a species in order to plan its management efficiently. Aerial surveys are considered a useful method for estimating the population size of large conspicuous animals inhabiting large areas, but raw count data from aerial surveys usually underestimate population sizes due to imperfect detection. The use of N-mixture models with aerial count data provides a useful tool to estimate the population sizes while taking detection probability into account. As a study case we used aerial surveys conducted for monitoring black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) in Madikwe Game Reserve and Pilanesberg Nature Reserve (South Africa) during 1999-2015, and we analysed data with a dynamic extension of the N-mixture model. We estimated 0.078-0.098 and 0.139 -0.142 individuals/km(2) , respectively, and we found evidence for density dependence in both reserves with a carrying capacity of 0.122 (0.102-0.142) individuals/100 km(2) . Based on simulations used to assess precision of the estimates, root-mean-square error model (RMSE) estimates was significantly smaller than those for the raw maximum counts. The N-mixture models provide a promising approach to estimate population size, trends and demographic characteristics of large conspicuous mammals such as black rhinoceroses. Such analysis can provide estimates that are more accurate than raw counts. In addition, use of model covariates that affect a species' population parameters can provide useful information for their conservation and management. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Linear right-of-ways (e.g. roadsides, power line corridors) are believed to be a significant source of milkweed and represent a valuable target for restoration efforts. Although many current mowing practices in these habitats are detrimental for monarchs because mowing occurs too frequently or is poorly timed, strategic mowing could be beneficial for monarch reproduction if it produces young milkweed at the right time of season. To address this, forty-nine paired experimental and control plots containing common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) were established along habitat adjacent to a two-lane highway in southern Ontario. Experimental plots were mowed once per season and followed one of eight mowing treatments that occurred between mid-June and early August. Milkweed characteristics and the presence of monarchs at all life stages were monitored within plots from late June through September. Overall, mowed plots had higher egg abundance than unmowed controls. Within mowed plots, egg abundance/plant was highest in plots mowed between the 2nd and 3rd weeks of July. At this latitude (43 degrees N), mowing past this window was less effective and would have resulted in high mortality of developing monarchs. Our results suggest that mowing common milkweed once before egg laying peaks could maximize monarch butterfly reproduction in managed landscapes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Gaoligong, China	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Budorcas taxicolor; Law enforcement; Public education and propaganda on conservation; 3D map-based interview survey; Mt. Gaoligong	PROTECTED AREAS; CITIZEN DATA	Getting enough financial support for conservation in China has been a problem, to the point that about 1/3 of its nature reserves are poorly funded and lack effective management. Thus, preserving wildlife habitats under these circumstances represents a challenging mission. As a measure to promote conservation, in recent years the Chinese government issued very strict laws and regulations together with extensive public education and propaganda directives. To evaluate the effectiveness of such particular approach, an assessment of Mishmi Takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in Mt. Gaoligong National Nature Reserve was carried out. Using data collected by interviewing local residents, literature review and field survey, we analyzed the dynamic profiles of population size and distribution alteration of this endangered species in China. The temporal comparison of the profiles was organized in 3 periods: pre-1980s (before the setting up of the reserve), 1980-2000 and after the 2000s. The results indicate that, after the creation of the park, takin individuals were sighted more frequently within the reserve areas and the distribution range increased. Main anthropogenic disturbances came from hunting, which was banned in 1980, as well as from the depletion and collection of natural resources. These findings demonstrate a representative case of successful conservation policy in the particular social and political context of China, implemented with authoritative legislation coupled with education and awareness plans, under very constrained financial and manpower resources support. Moreover, this study highlights an economic and convenient, yet effective survey method ideal for research in remote regions characterized by access difficulties due to high mountains, deep valleys, and harsh environment such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Hengduan Mountains.

Conserving bees in destroyed landscapes: The potentials of reclaimed sand mines	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Bee conservation; Bee decline; Habitat restoration; Land use; Wild bees; Ground nesters	FLORAL RESOURCES; POLLINATOR DIVERSITY; HONEY-BEES; WILD BEES; HYMENOPTERA; RESTORATION; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; INCREASE	Sand mines represent anthropogenically impacted habitats found worldwide, which bear potential for bee conservation. Although floral resources can be limited at these habitats, vegetation free patches of open sandy soils and embankments may offer good nesting possibilities for sand restricted and other bees. We compared bee communities as found in three reclaimed sand mines and at adjacent roadside meadows in Maryland, USA, over two years. Both sand mines and roadsides hosted diverse bee communities with 111 and 88 bee species, respectively. Bee abundances as well as richness and Shannon diversity of bee species were higher in sand mines than at roadsides and negatively correlated with the percentage of vegetational ground cover. Species composition also differed significantly between habitats. Sand mines hosted a higher proportion of ground nesters, more uncommon and more 'sand loving' bees similar to natural sandy areas of Maryland. Despite the destruction of the original pre-mining habitat, sand mines thus appear to represent a unique habitat for wild bees, particularly when natural vegetation and open sand spots are encouraged. Considering habitat loss, the lack of natural disturbance regimes, and ongoing declines of wild bees, sand mines could add promising opportunities for bee conservation which has hitherto mainly focused on agricultural and urban habitats.

Leaves are important organs for photosynthesis, and leaf size is closely related to photosynthetic potential. Leaf size has different physical measures, such as leaf length, area, and fresh or dry weight. However, it has not been reported whether these leaf size measures follow TPL and whether the estimates of the TPL exponent reflect basic topological constraints. Considering that the variation of leaf size can affect the photosynthetic capacity of leaves and plant competitive abilities in communities, we examined the effects of different physical dimensions of leaf size (including leaf length, area, and fresh and dry weight) on the estimate of the scaling exponent and the goodness of fit of TPL for 101 bamboo species, varieties, forms, and cultivars, using 90-100 leaves for each type of plant. All leaf size measures follow TPL. However, the goodness of fit increases with the physical dimension of the leaf size measure (e.g., from 1D leaf length to 3D leaf weight). Interestingly, no significant differences in the estimates of the TPL exponent were detected among any of the physical dimensions (1D to 3D) because the 95% confidence intervals of the differences between any two groups of bootstrap replicates of the exponents of TPL obtained from different leaf size measures did not include 0. In other words, the TPL exponents of leaf size measures from the different physical dimensions could be deemed identical. We found that leaf dry weight provides the best fit of TPL and the most reliable estimate of the exponent among the four leaf size measures used in this study, perhaps because it is the best representative of the energy allocated to individual leaves.

In this study, we tested the validity of the SGE in predicting leaf area using 20 bamboo species, 12 species of Rosaceae, 5 species of Lauraceae, and 5 species of Oleaceae. We find that c-values in leaf length for 20 bamboo species are all smaller than zero, whereas, for most tree species, c-values are larger than zero. Using c-values, there was a strong correlation (>0.99 for most of the species investigated) between actual and predicted leaf area. Also, using the SGE to fit the leaf profile data, the predicted leaf width approaches its actual value, whereas the predicted length is larger than or smaller than its actual value (for bamboo species and most tree species, respectively). Although c-values ranged from -15% to zero for bamboo species and from zero to 17% for tree species, the mean percent error in leaf area for most species did not exceed 5%. These findings indicate that leaves exhibit more variation in length than in width, i.e., leaf area is fairly conservative despite considerable variation in leaf shape. Given that the SGE adequately describes the areas of leaves with complex forms (e.g., several species of Rosaceae), our data indicate that the SGE is a useful tool for describing leaf morphometrics and may open a door for the study of leaf shape evolution.

In this study, connectivity between core habitat areas was mapped and prioritized for the potential corridors among elephant populations in two separated regions in Thailand. The step selection function modeling approach was employed to estimate resistance surfaces based on elephant occurrence data. Connectivity maps were created based on the estimated resistance surfaces by employing the least-cost path and circuit theory through a proposed analytical method. As the results of resistance modeling, the averaged model showed that four of fifteen covariates were positively associated with the selection of the steps. The predictors consist of landcover, elevation, terrain ruggedness, and distance to the nearest cell of specific landcover. The connectivity maps indicated multiple potential connectivity pathways, bottlenecks, and varied important linkages between core areas in both regions. This gave an alternative opportunity in acquiring information of landscape connectivity for providing aid in conservation planning at landscape-level. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Large carnivores; Human-wildlife conflict; Human dimensions; Albania; Macedonia	PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; WOLVES; BEARS; REINTRODUCTION; COEXISTENCE; PATTERNS; UMBRELLA; HUNTERS	We tested differences in attitudes towards bears, wolves and lynx among the rural public in Albania and Macedonia through information collected from a questionnaire survey (n = 759). Wolves were the species with the least positive attitudes among the rural public and had the lowest support for conservation compared with bears and lynx. In addition, conflict perception of wolves was higher than for bears and lynx. We argue that, based on species specific differences in public attitudes, conservation initiatives and management plans for large carnivores should deal with wolves separately from bears and lynx, as lower public support for wolves might jeopardise the conservation of the two other large carnivores. Bears and lynx can be potentially treated together in conservation initiatives based on the similar levels of public support for conservation, however, from a conflict-management point of view, all three species need to be addressed separately.

This national-scale study provides insights into Norwegians' quality perceptions of municipal green space, visit frequency and motivations for engaging in different activities. We applied regression analysis to investigate how various factors affect the outcome variables, quality perceptions and visit frequency from a sample of the Norwegian adult population. Results reveal that Norwegians perceive their green spaces as having good quality, and higher quality perceptions have a positive influence on green space visits. Half of the respondents visited green spaces out of intrinsic motives in high-quality environments providing fresh air, experiences of nature and quietness. It is essential, however, to take into account that less reported activity mirrors groups of respondents who least often visit green spaces.

The year-round odds ratio (OR) was 1.005 on the current day with a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 for all-cause mortality. For cardiovascular mortality and stroke, the ORs were 1.007 and 1.008 on the current day, respectively. Meanwhile, during a lag of six days, the cumulative effects of haze on relative risk of mortality, respiratory mortality and all-cause mortality was in the range of 2 similar to 11%. Moreover, we found a significant seasonal pattern in the associations for respiratory mortality: significant associations were observed in spring and fall, while for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiac and stroke, significant associations were observed in winter. Moreover, increasing temperature would decrease risks of mortalities in winter taking fall as the reference season. We concluded that in summer, temperature acted as a direct enhancer of air pollutants; while in winter and spring, it was an index of the diameter distribution and composition of fine particles.

The fact that women in older age groups are able to achieve a similar performance as men has been documented in swimming. In ultra-marathon running, knowledge is still limited. The aim of this study was to analyze sex-specific performance in ultra-marathon running according to age and distance. All ultra-marathon races documented in the online database of the German Society for Ultra-Marathon from 1964 to 2017 for 50-mile races (i.e., 231,980 records from 91,665 finishers) and from 1953 to 2017 for 100-mile races (i.e., 107,445 records from 39,870 finishers) were analyzed. In 50-mile races, race times were 11.74 +/- 1.95 h for men and 12.31 +/- 1.69 h for women. In 100-mile races, race times were 26.6 +/- 3.49 h for men and 27.47 +/- 3.6 h for women. The sex differences decreased with older age and were smaller in 100-mile (4.41%) than in 50-mile races (9.13%). The overall age of peak performance was 33 years for both distances. In summary, women reduced the performance difference to men with advancing age, the relative difference being smaller in 100-mile compared to 50-mile races. These findings might aid coaches and ultra-marathon runners set long-term training goals considering their sex and age.

Response of the Native Springtail Parisotoma insularis to Diesel Fuel-Contaminated Soils Under Field-Realistic Exposure Conditions at Subantarctic Macquarie Island	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Petroleum hydrocarbon; Toxicity; Sensitivity; Invertebrate; Environmental guidelines	FOLSOMIA-CANDIDA; MARION-ISLAND; TOXICITY; COLLEMBOLA; BIOAVAILABILITY; COMMUNITIES; SEQUESTRATION; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; RISK	A number of sites contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons from past fuel spills are currently undergoing remediation on subantarctic Macquarie Island (under the jurisdiction of Tasmania, Australia). To assess the environmental risks these spills pose, and to establish remediation targets and guideline values, toxicity data for a range of native biota are required. The availability of data for local biota is limited, especially for soil invertebrates, which are critical to soil health. To examine the response of naturally occurring soil invertebrate communities to fuel contamination, intact soil cores from a range of soil types were collected along an organic carbon (OC) gradient. Organic carbon was factored into the toxicity assessment due to its toxicity-modifying potential. Soil cores were spiked with Special Antarctic Blend diesel, to mimic a fresh fuel spill at the soil surface. Springtails were the most abundant taxa, with the community heavily dominated by the native species Parisotoma insularis. This species was sensitive to fuel contamination (EC20 48 mg/kg, CI 5-188), irrespective of soil organic content. This study is the first to derive critical effect concentrations (CECs) for a subantarctic springtail species and provides important data that will be incorporated into future derivation of site-specific soil quality guideline values for fuels for Macquarie Island soils and the broader subantarctic region.

Common Cerambycid Pheromone Components as Attractants for Longhorn Beetles (Cerambycidae) Breeding in Ephemeral Oak Substrates in Northern Europe	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Semiochemical; (R)-2-Methyl-1-butanol; (R)-3-Hydroxy-2-hexanone; Monitoring; Biodiversity; Red List	HOST-PLANT VOLATILES; SAPROXYLIC BEETLES; SEX-PHEROMONE; COLEOPTERA CERAMBYCIDAE; AGGREGATION PHEROMONES; TRAPS; PHENOLOGY; EFFICACY; ECOLOGY	Longhorn beetles are ecologically important insects in forest ecosystems as decomposers of woody substrates, microhabitat engineers, and as components of forest food webs. These species can be greatly affected both positively and negatively by modern forestry management practices, and should be monitored accordingly. Through headspace sampling, coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and field bioassays, we identified two compounds, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone, that constitute aggregation-sex pheromone attractants of three cerambycid species which breed primarily in different types of fresh, recently dead oak wood in Northern Europe: Pyrrhidium sanguineum (L.), Phymatodes alni ssp. alni (L.), and Phymatodes testaceus (L.) (Cerambycinae: Callidiini). Analyses of headspace volatiles collected from live insects indicated that the male-produced aggregation-sex pheromone of P. sanguineum is a 1-15:100 blend of (R)-2-methyl-1-butanol and (R)-3-hydroxy-2-hexanone, whereas the corresponding ratios for P. alni were 70-110:100. In field bioassays, adult P. sanguineum and P. alni were significantly attracted to multiple blends with varying ratios of the two compounds. When tested individually, the compounds were minimally attractive. In contrast, adult P. testaceus exhibited nonspecific attraction to both of the individual compounds and to different blends, despite the hydroxyketone not being part of its pheromone, which consists of (R)-2-methyl-1-butanol alone. Overall, our results suggest that a blend of 50:100 of racemic 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-hydroxy-2-hexanone is appropriate for parallel, cost-efficient pheromone-based monitoring of all three species. In particular, these species could serve as useful indicators of how modern forestry practices affect a whole guild of saproxylic insects that require ephemeral deadwood substrates for successful breeding.

Simultaneously, herbivores utilize volatile cues to identify appropriate hosts. Despite extensive efforts to understand sources of variation in plant communication by VOCs, we lack an understanding of how ubiquitous belowground mutualists, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), influence plant VOC emissions. In a full factorial experiment, we subjected plants of two milkweed (Asclepias) species under three levels of AMF availability to damage by aphids (Aphis nerii). We then measured plant headspace volatiles and chemical defenses (cardenolides) and compared these to VOCs emitted and cardenolides produced by plants without herbivores. We found that AMF have plant species-specific effects on constitutive and aphid-induced VOC emissions. High AMF availability increased emissions of total VOCs, two green leaf volatiles (3-hexenyl acetate and hexyl acetate), and methyl salicylate in A. curassavica, but did not affect emissions in A. incarnata. In contrast, aphids consistently increased emissions of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and benzeneacetaldehyde in both species, independent of AMF availability. Both high AMF availability and aphids alone suppressed emissions of individual terpenes. However, aphid damage on plants under high AMF availability increased, or did not affect, emissions of those terpenes. Lastly, aphid feeding suppressed cardenolide concentrations only in A. curassavica, and AMF did not affect cardenolides in either plant species. Our findings suggest that by altering milkweed VOC profiles, AMF may affect both herbivore performance and natural enemy attraction.

The ArcGIS-compatible Python package radproc attempts to reduce this gap. Radproc provides an automated raw data processing workflow for nationwide, freely available German weather radar climatology (RADKLIM) and operational (RADOLAN) composite products. Raw data are converted into a uniform HDF5 file structure used by radproc's analysis and data quality assessment functions. This enables transferability of the developed analysis and export functionality to other gridded or point-scale precipitation data. Thus, radproc can be extended by additional import routines to support any other German or non-German precipitation dataset. Analysis methods include temporal aggregations, detection of heavy rainfall and an automated processing of rain gauge point data into the same HDF5 format for comparison to gridded radar data. A set of functions for data exchange with ArcGIS allows for visualisation and further geospatial analysis. The application on a 17-year time series of hourly RADKLIM data showed that radproc greatly facilitates radar data processing and analysis by avoiding manual programming work and helps to lower the barrier for non-specialists to work with these novel radar climatology datasets.

DEA is an analytical method used to compare the efficiencies and performances of several items. In DEA, for sustainable technology analysis, the items of DEA can be the technological keywords or international patent classification (IPC) codes in patent documents. In this paper, the proposed method is used to find the relative performance of different patent keywords using comparison and evaluation. We apply this methodology to compare the technological efficiencies between patent keywords for sustainable technology analysis. We apply the additive model and directional distance function of DEA to develop the proposed methodology for building the technological structure of target technology. In addition, we forecast the future trend of target technology using the SSM and find the area of sustainable technology by its result. The SSM is well suited for time series forecasting on technology analysis. We extract the IPC codes from patent documents for the SSM. In our research, we combine the results of DEA and the SSM to find the area of technological sustainability. To illustrate the validity and performance of our research, we conduct a case study using the patent documents used and registered by Apple.

Urban residents may be willing to pay for some of these ecosystem services. Indeed, studies investigating the formation of housing prices through hedonic pricing analysis have shown that UGS can influence housing prices. Hedonic pricing analysis puts housing units at the center of analysis. In this study, we investigate whether an alternative perspective provides additional insights into the effects of UGS on pricing. The proposed approach puts UGS into the center of analysis by applying an analysis of buffer zones to housing prices, thus, linking approaches from urban economics and landscape ecology. Such an analysis could deepen our understanding of the effects of UGS on housing prices by analyzing price-distance slopes around UGS-thus supporting more informed decisions on efficient UGS management and urban planning. Our results using a case study on Leipzig, Germany, demonstrate that the size of UGS affects price-distance slopes around them. We conclude that further investigations should be fathomed to unleash the potential of applying the analysis of buffer zones around UGS as a method to inform sustainable UGS design in cities.

However, there is a lack of information about the exact population size and its conservation status. We estimated the population size of D. cinnabari using remote sensing data. The age structure was inferred using a relationship between crown projection area and the number of branch sections. The conservation importance of each sub-population was assessed using a specially developed index. Finally, the future population development (extinction time) was predicted using population matrices. The total population size estimated consists of 80,134 individuals with sub-populations varying from 14 to 32,196 individuals, with an extinction time ranging from 31 to 564 years. Community forestry controlled by a local certification system is suggested as a sustainable land management approach providing traditional and new benefits and enabling the reforestation of endemic tree species on Socotra Island.

In this study, we used the random forest (RF) model to map the distribution of SOC and pH in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and estimate SOC and pH changes from 1982 to 2012 in Liaoning Province, Northeast China. A total of 10 covariates (elevation, slope gradient, topographic wetness index (TWI), mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), visible-red band 3 (B3), near-infrared band 4 (B4), short-wave infrared band 5 (B5), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land-use data) and a set of 806 (in 1982) and 973 (in 2012) soil samples were selected. Cross-validation technology was used to test the performance and uncertainty of the RF model. We found that the prediction R-2 of SOC and pH was 0.69 and 0.54 for 1982, and 0.63 and 0.48 for 2012, respectively. Elevation, NDVI, and land use are the main environmental variables affecting the spatial variability of SOC in both periods. Correspondingly, the topographic wetness index and mean annual precipitation were the two most critical environmental variables affecting the spatial variation of pH. The mean SOC and pH decreased from 18.6 to 16.9 kg(-1) and 6.9 to 6.6, respectively, over a 30-year period. SOC distribution generated using the RF model showed a decreasing SOC trend from east to west across the city in the two periods. In contrast, the spatial distribution of pH showed an opposite trend in both periods. This study provided important information of spatial variations in SOC and pH to agencies and communities in this region, to evaluate soil quality and make decisions on remediation and prevention of soil acidification and salinization.

However in China, aside from anecdotal claims that urban residential buildings are generally short-lived, there are no recent official statistics, and empirical data are extremely limited. We present a system dynamics model where survival analysis is used to characterise the dynamic interplay between new construction, aging, and demolition of residential buildings in urban China. The uncertainties associated with building lifetime were represented using a Weibull distribution, whose shape and scale parameters were calibrated based on official statistics on floor area up to 2006. The calibrated Weibull lifetime distribution allowed us to estimate the dynamic stock turnover of Chinese urban residential buildings for 2007 to 2017. We find that the average lifetime of urban residential buildings was around 34 years, and the overall residential stock size reached 23.7 billion m(2) in 2017. The resultant age-specific sub-stocks provide a baseline for the overall stock, which-along with the calibrated Weibull lifetime distribution-can be used in further modelling and for analysis of policies to reduce the whole-life embodied and operational energy and CO2 emissions in Chinese residential buildings.

Local snow melt and temperature-but not regional sea ice-explain variation in spring phenology in coastal Arctic tundra	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Arctic tundra; climate change; phenology; sea ice; snow melt; spring; temperature; vegetation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLANT PHENOLOGY; LONG-TERM; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; TROPHIC MISMATCH; TIME-SERIES; RESPONSES; VEGETATION; GROWTH; SENSITIVITY	The Arctic is undergoing dramatic environmental change with rapidly rising surface temperatures, accelerating sea ice decline and changing snow regimes, all of which influence tundra plant phenology. Despite these changes, no globally consistent direction of trends in spring phenology has been reported across the Arctic. While spring has advanced at some sites, spring has delayed or not changed at other sites, highlighting substantial unexplained variation. Here, we test the relative importance of local temperatures, local snow melt date and regional spring drop in sea ice extent as controls of variation in spring phenology across different sites and species. Trends in long-term time series of spring leaf-out and flowering (average span: 18 years) were highly variable for the 14 tundra species monitored at our four study sites on the Arctic coasts of Alaska, Canada and Greenland, ranging from advances of 10.06 days per decade to delays of 1.67 days per decade. Spring temperatures and the day of spring drop in sea ice extent advanced at all sites (average 1 degrees C per decade and 21 days per decade, respectively), but only those sites with advances in snow melt (average 5 days advance per decade) also had advancing phenology. Variation in spring plant phenology was best explained by snow melt date (mean effect: 0.45 days advance in phenology per day advance snow melt) and, to a lesser extent, by mean spring temperature (mean effect: 2.39 days advance in phenology per degrees C). In contrast to previous studies examining sea ice and phenology at different spatial scales, regional spring drop in sea ice extent did not predict spring phenology for any species or site in our analysis. Our findings highlight that tundra vegetation responses to global change are more complex than a direct response to warming and emphasize the importance of snow melt as a local driver of tundra spring phenology.

Interactions between soil heterogeneity and freezing: Implications for grassland plant diversity and relative species abundances	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; community; diversity; edaphology; frost stress; niche theory; productivity; spatial environmental heterogeneity; vegetation	BIOMASS RESPONSES; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ELEVATED CO2; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; PRECIPITATION; CONSEQUENCES; BIODIVERSITY; MANIPULATION	Plant stress resulting from soil freezing is expected to increase in northern temperate regions over the next century due to reductions in snow cover caused by climate change. Within plant communities, soil spatial heterogeneity can potentially buffer the effects of plant freezing stress by increasing the availability of soil microsites that function as microrefugia. Moreover, increased species richness resulting from soil heterogeneity can increase the likelihood of stress-tolerant species being present in a community. We used a field experiment to examine interactions between soil heterogeneity and increased freezing intensity (achieved via snow removal) on plant abundance and diversity in a grassland. Patches of topsoil were mixed with either sand or woodchips to create heterogeneous and homogeneous treatments, and plant community responses to snow removal were assessed over three growing seasons. Soil heterogeneity interacted significantly with snow removal, but it either buffered or exacerbated the snow removal response depending on the specific substrate (sand vs. woodchips) and plant functional group. In turn, snow removal influenced plant responses to soil heterogeneity; for example, adventive forb cover responded to increased heterogeneity under ambient snow cover, but this effect diminished with snow removal. Our results reveal that soil heterogeneity can play an important role in determining plant responses to changes in soil freezing stress resulting from global climate change. While the deliberate creation of soil microsites in ecological restoration projects as a land management practice could increase the frequency of microrefugia that mitigate plant community responses to increased freezing stress, the design of these microsites must be optimized, given that soil heterogeneity also has the potential to exacerbate freezing stress responses.

For example, negative relationships between ectotherm body size and temperature are common both across natural thermal gradients and in small-scale experiments. However, it is unknown if short-term body size responses are representative of long-term responses. Moreover, to understand population responses to warming, we must recognize that individual responses to temperature may vary over ontogeny. To enable predictions of how climate warming may affect natural populations, we therefore ask how body size and growth may shift in response to increased temperature over life history, and whether short-and long-term growth responses differ. We addressed these questions using a unique setup with multidecadal artificial heating of an enclosed coastal bay in the Baltic Sea and an adjacent reference area (both with unexploited populations), using before-after control-impact paired time-series analyses. We assembled individual growth trajectories of similar to 13,000 unique individuals of Eurasian perch and found that body growth increased substantially after warming, but the extent depended on body size: Only among small-bodied perch did growth increase with temperature. Moreover, the strength of this response gradually increased over the 24 year warming period. Our study offers a unique example of how warming can affect fish populations over multiple generations, resulting in gradual changes in body growth, varying as organisms develop. Although increased juvenile growth rates are in line with predictions of the temperature-size rule, the fact that a larger body size at age was maintained over life history contrasts to that same rule. Because the artificially heated area is a contemporary system mimicking a warmer sea, our findings can aid predictions of fish responses to further warming, taking into account that growth responses may vary both over an individual's life history and over time.

Flipping (full inversion to 1-3 m) is a practice used on New Zealand's South Island West Coast to eliminate water-logging in highly podzolized sandy soils. Flipping results in burial of SOC formed in surface soil horizons into the subsoil and the transfer of subsoil material low in SOC to the "new" topsoil. The aims of this study were to quantify changes in the storage and stability of SOC over a 20-year period following flipping of high-productive pasture grassland. Topsoils (0-30 cm) from sites representing a chronosequence of flipping (3-20 years old) were sampled (2005/07) and re-sampled (2017) to assess changes in topsoil carbon stocks. Deeper samples (30-150 cm) were also collected (2017) to evaluate the changes in stocks of SOC previously buried by flipping. Density fractionation was used to determine SOC stability in recent and buried topsoils. Total SOC stocks (0-150 cm) increased significantly by 69 +/- 15% (179 +/- 40 Mg SOC ha(-1)) over 20 years following flipping. Topsoil burial caused a one-time sequestration of 160 +/- 14 Mg SOC ha(-1) (30-150 cm). The top 0-30 cm accumulated 3.6 Mg SOC ha(-1) year(-1). The chronosequence and re-sampling revealed SOC accumulation rates of 1.2-1.8 Mg SOC ha(-1) year(-1) in the new surface soil (0-15 cm) and a SOC deficit of 36 +/- 5% after 20 years. Flipped subsoils contained up to 32% labile SOC (compared to < 1% in un-flipped subsoils) thus buried SOC was preserved. This study confirms that burial of SOC and the exposure of SOC depleted subsoil results in an overall increase of SOC stocks of the whole soil profile and long-term SOC preservation.

Wildfire severity reduces richness and alters composition of soil fungal communities in boreal forests of western Canada	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						disturbance; functional groups; global change; mycorrhizas; saprotrophs; Taiga Plains; understory	JACK PINE STANDS; NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; INTERIOR ALASKA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIRE SEVERITY; RESILIENCE; WOOD	Wildfire is the dominant disturbance in boreal forests and fire activity is increasing in these regions. Soil fungal communities are important for plant growth and nutrient cycling postfire but there is little understanding of how fires impact fungal communities across landscapes, fire severity gradients, and stand types in boreal forests. Understanding relationships between fungal community composition, particularly mycorrhizas, and understory plant composition is therefore important in predicting how future fire regimes may affect vegetation. We used an extreme wildfire event in boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories to test drivers of fungal communities and assess relationships with plant communities. We sampled soils from 39 plots 1 year after fire and 8 unburned plots. High-throughput sequencing (MiSeq, ITS) revealed 2,034 fungal operational taxonomic units. We found soil pH and fire severity (proportion soil organic layer combusted), and interactions between these drivers were important for fungal community structure (composition, richness, diversity, functional groups). Where fire severity was low, samples with low pH had higher total fungal, mycorrhizal, and saprotroph richness compared to where severity was high. Increased fire severity caused declines in richness of total fungi, mycorrhizas, and saprotrophs, and declines in diversity of total fungi and mycorrhizas. The importance of stand age (a surrogate for fire return interval) for fungal composition suggests we could detect long-term successional patterns even after fire. Mycorrhizal and plant community composition, richness, and diversity were weakly but significantly correlated. These weak relationships and the distribution of fungi across plots suggest that the underlying driver of fungal community structure is pH, which is modified by fire severity. This study shows the importance of edaphic factors in determining fungal community structure at large scales, but suggests these patterns are mediated by interactions between fire and forest stand composition.

Plasticity in elk migration timing is a response to changing environmental conditions	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; forage; GPS; phenology; range; snow; telemetry; ungulate; Yellowstone	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ANIMAL MIGRATION; POPULATION DECLINES; HABITAT USE; MULE DEER; PATTERNS; WILDEBEEST; PHENOLOGY; BENEFITS; MOVEMENT	Migration is an effective behavioral strategy for prolonging access to seasonal resources and may be a resilient strategy for ungulates experiencing changing climatic conditions. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), elk are the primary ungulate, with approximately 20,000 individuals migrating to exploit seasonal gradients in forage while also avoiding energetically costly snow conditions. How climate-induced changes in plant phenology and snow accumulation are influencing elk migration timing is unknown. We present the most complete record of elk migration across the GYE, spanning 9 herds and 414 individuals from 2001 to 2017, to evaluate the drivers of migration timing and test for temporal shifts. The timing of elk departure from winter range involved a trade-off between current and anticipated forage conditions, while snow melt governed summer range arrival date. Timing of elk departure from summer range and arrival on winter range were both influenced by snow accumulation and exposure to hunting. At the GYE scale, spring and fall migration timing changed through time, most notably with winter range arrival dates becoming almost 50 days later since 2001. Predicted herd-level changes in migration timing largely agreed with observed GYE-wide changes-except for predicted winter range arrival dates which did not reflect the magnitude of change detected in the elk telemetry data. Snow melt, snow accumulation, and spring green-up dates all changed through time, with different herds experiencing different rates and directions of change. We conclude that elk migration is plastic, is a direct response to environmental cues, and that these environmental cues are not changing in a consistent manner across the GYE. The impacts of changing elk migration timing on predator-prey dynamics, carnivore-livestock conflict, disease ecology, and harvest management across the GYE are likely to be significant and complex.

Here we develop a high-resolution, spatially explicit model of coral dynamics on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Our model accounts for biological, ecological and environmental processes, as well as spatial variation in water quality and the cumulative effects of coral diseases, bleaching, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster cf. solaris), and tropical cyclones. Our projections reconstruct coral cover trajectories between 1996 and 2017 over a total reef area of 14,780 km(2), predicting a mean annual coral loss of -0.67%/year mostly due to the impact of cyclones, followed by starfish outbreaks and coral bleaching. Coral growth rate was the highest for outer shelf coral communities characterized by digitate and tabulate Acropora spp. and exposed to low seasonal variations in salinity and sea surface temperature, and the lowest for inner-shelf communities exposed to reduced water quality. We show that coral resilience (defined as the net effect of resistance and recovery following disturbance) was negatively related to the frequency of river plume conditions, and to reef accessibility to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, reef resilience was substantially lower within no-take marine protected areas, however this difference was mostly driven by the effect of water quality. Our model provides a new validated, spatially explicit platform for identifying the reefs that face the greatest risk of biodiversity loss, and those that have the highest chances to persist under increasing disturbance regimes.

The climate sensitivity of carbon, timber, and species richness covaries with forest age in boreal-temperate North America	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive management; biodiversity; boreal-temperate ecotone; carbon; climate change; ecosystem services; forest age; forest growth; species richness; timber production	OLD-GROWTH FORESTS; LAND-USE HISTORY; SOIL CARBON; STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; HARDWOOD FORESTS; FIRE DISTURBANCE; TRADE-OFFS; MANAGEMENT	Climate change threatens the provisioning of forest ecosystem services and biodiversity (ESB). The climate sensitivity of ESB may vary with forest development from young to old-growth conditions as structure and composition shift over time and space. This study addresses knowledge gaps hindering implementation of adaptive forest management strategies to sustain ESB. We focused on a number of ESB indicators to (a) analyze associations among carbon storage, timber growth rate, and species richness along a forest development gradient; (b) test the sensitivity of these associations to climatic changes; and (c) identify hotspots of climate sensitivity across the boreal-temperate forests of eastern North America. From pre-existing databases and literature, we compiled a unique dataset of 18,507 forest plots. We used a full Bayesian framework to quantify responses of nine ESB indicators. The Bayesian models were used to assess the sensitivity of these indicators and their associations to projected increases in temperature and precipitation. We found the strongest association among the investigated ESB indicators in old forests (>170 years). These forests simultaneously support high levels of carbon storage, timber growth, and species richness. Older forests also exhibit low climate sensitivity of associations among ESB indicators as compared to younger forests. While regions with a currently low combined ESB performance benefitted from climate change, regions with a high ESB performance were particularly vulnerable to climate change. In particular, climate sensitivity was highest east and southeast of the Great Lakes, signaling potential priority areas for adaptive management. Our findings suggest that strategies aimed at enhancing the representation of older forest conditions at landscape scales will help sustain ESB in a changing world.

Advances in mechanistic understanding and prediction are greatly limited by an inability to detect in situ where trees are likely to die in order to take timely measurements and actions. Thus, algorithms of early warning and detection of drought-induced tree stress and mortality could have major scientific and societal benefits. Here, we leverage two consecutive droughts in the southwestern United States to develop and test a set of early warning metrics. Using Landsat satellite data, we constructed early warning metrics from the first drought event. We then tested these metrics' ability to predict spatial patterns in tree physiological stress and mortality from the second drought. To test the broader applicability of these metrics, we also examined a separate drought in the Amazon rainforest. The early warning metrics successfully explained subsequent tree mortality in the second drought in the southwestern US, as well as mortality in the independent drought in tropical forests. The metrics also strongly correlated with spatial patterns in tree hydraulic stress underlying mortality, which provides a strong link between tree physiological stress and remote sensing during the severe drought and indicates that the loss of hydraulic function during drought likely mediated subsequent mortality. Thus, early warning metrics provide a critical foundation for elucidating the physiological mechanisms underpinning tree mortality in mature forests and guiding management responses to these climate-induced disturbances.

Yet, such analyses are frequently restricted spatially and applied along single slopes or mountain ranges. Since we know little on the response of intraspecific leaf traits to elevation across the globe, we here perform a global meta-analysis of leaf traits in 109 plant species located in 4 continents and reported in 71 studies published between 1983 and 2018. We quantified the intraspecific change in seven morpho-ecophysiological leaf traits along global elevational gradients: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf area (LA), nitrogen concentration per unit of area (Narea), nitrogen concentration per unit mass (Nmass), phosphorous concentration per unit mass (Pmass) and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13). We found LMA, Narea, Nmass and delta C-13 to significantly increase and SLA to decrease with increasing elevation. Conversely, LA and Pmass showed no significant pattern with elevation worldwide. We found significantly larger increase in Narea, Nmass, Pmass and delta C-13 with elevation in warmer regions. Larger responses to increasing elevation were apparent for SLA of herbaceous compared to woody species, but not for the other traits. Finally, we also detected evidences of covariation across morphological and physiological traits within the same elevational gradient. In sum, we demonstrate that there are common cross-species patterns of intraspecific leaf trait variation across elevational gradients worldwide. Irrespective of whether such variation is genetically determined via local adaptation or attributed to phenotypic plasticity, the leaf trait patterns quantified here suggest that plant species are adapted to live on a range of temperature conditions. Since the distribution of mountain biota is predominantly shifting upslope in response to changes in environmental conditions, our results are important to further our understanding of how plants species of mountain ecosystems adapt to global environmental change.

Recent evidence suggests that oviparous reptiles often select nest sites where the landscape has been altered by anthropogenic activity, whereas natural nest sites are less often used. We leverage a long-term study of snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) to identify natural nest sites and anthropogenic nest sites and to compare habitat variables among nest site types. Natural and anthropogenic nest sites did not differ in average canopy closure, distance to nearest water, substrate composition, or aspect. However, anthropogenic nest sites had less ground-level vegetation and greater soil brightness, and were 3.3 degrees C warmer than natural nests during incubation. We used the Schoolfield model of poikilotherm development to assess differences in development rate between natural and anthropogenic nests. Because of the difference in temperature, embryos in anthropogenic nests were predicted to have undergone nearly twice as much development as embryos in natural nests during incubation. We outline why the evolution of fast embryonic development rate cannot compensate indefinitely for the low temperature incubation regimes that become increasingly prevalent at northern range margins, thereby underlining why maternal nest site choice of relatively warm anthropogenic sites may help oviparous reptiles persist in thermally constrained environments. Future research should aim to quantify both the thermal benefits of anthropogenic nest sites, as well as associated fitness costs (e.g., increased adult mortality) to elucidate whether anthropogenic disturbance of the landscape can be an ecological trap or serve a net benefit to some reptiles in northern environments.

However, empirical studies of the SGH are often hindered by confounding resource and non-resource stress gradients. Nepenthes pitcher plants trap animal prey using modified-leaf pitfall traps which are also inhabited by organisms known as inquilines. Inquilines may assist pitchers in the digestion of trapped prey. This interaction is known as a digestive mutualism and is both mutualistic and facilitative by definition. Inquiline species may also facilitate each other via processing chain commensalisms. We used in vitro experiments to examine the isolated effect of resource stress on the outcomes of two facilitative interactions: (i) digestive mutualism-facilitation of pitcher nutrient sequestration by two inquiline dipteran larvae, culicids and phorids; (ii) processing chain commensalism-facilitation between these two inquiline taxa. The net nutritional benefit of phorids on N. gracilis was found to conform more to a monotonic rather than hump-shaped SGH model. However, the effect of culicids on N. gracilis and the effects of culicids and phorids on each other were weak. These findings provide compelling evidence that changes in facilitation along an isolated resource stress gradient conform to the predictions of the monotonic SGH model rather than that of the revised hump-shaped model, and highlight the importance of isolating stress gradients in empirical tests of the SGH.

This is potentially more complex for omnivores whose diets span a wide range of food resources. We conducted seasonal field samplings in Patagonian lakes and analyzed the relationship between seston (SES) quality parameters and the delta N-15 and N-15 of an omnivorous copepod, Boeckella gracilipes (Bg). We also performed a 7-day laboratory starvation experiment, an extreme form of nutritional stress, to investigate if lack of food led to changes in delta N-15(Bg) values. Our field results showed that increasing values of the seston carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N-SES), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and delta N-15(SES) were related to higher delta N-15(Bg) values. C:N-SES and Chl a were also positively related to N-15; yet, C:N-SES alone explained 70% of the variation. C:N-SES values correlated with the presence of mixotrophic algae and ciliates that are key food resources for B. gracilipes. In our laboratory starvation experiment, the delta N-15(Bg) values increased significantly, pointing to use of internal N sources; yet, the change associated with starvation was less pronounced than that related to C:N-SES changes in the field, suggesting depletion of the substrate pool in the former. We found that N-15 values of omnivorous species consuming a low-quality diet would be higher than that from a conspecific with a high-quality diet; though fasting animals would show intermediate values.

Foraging strategies of individual silky pocket mice over a boom-bust cycle in a stochastic dryland ecosystem	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Generalists; Intraspecific competition; Niche variation hypothesis; Perognathus flavus; Specialists	NORTHERN CHIHUAHUAN DESERT; NICHE VARIATION HYPOTHESIS; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION; DISCRIMINATION FACTORS; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; SMALL MAMMALS; SPECIALIZATION; DIET	Small mammals use multiple foraging strategies to compensate for fluctuating resource quality in stochastic environments. These strategies may lead to increased dietary overlap when competition for resources is strong. To quantify temporal contributions of high (C-3) versus low quality (C-4) resources in diets of silky pocket mice (Perognathus flavus), we used stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) analysis of 1391 plasma samples collected over 2years. Of these, 695 samples were from 170 individuals sampled >= 3 times across seasons or years, allowing us to assess changes in dietary breadth at the population and individual levels across a boom-bust population cycle. In 2014, the P. flavus population increased to 412 captures compared to 8 captures in prior and subsequent years, while populations of co-occurring small mammals remained stable. As intraspecific competition increased, the population-wide dietary niche of P. flavus did not change, but individual specialization increased significantly. During this period, similar to 27% (41/151) of individuals sampled specialized on C-3 resources, which were abundant during the spring and previous fall seasons. Most of the remaining individuals were C-3-C-4 generalists (64%) (96/151), and only 9% (14/151) specialized on C-4 resources. In 2015, P. flavus population density and resource availability declined, individual dietary breadth expanded (84% generalists), no C-3 specialists were found, and specialization on C-4 resources increased (16%). Our results demonstrate a high degree of inter-individual plasticity in P. flavus foraging strategies, which has implications for how this species will respond to environmental change that is predicted to decrease C-3 resources in the future.

Interspecific competition for frugivores: population-level seed dispersal in contrasting fruiting communities	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Altitudinal gradient; Crataegus monogyna; Frugivory; Fruit removal; Neighbourhood effects	CONSEQUENCES; PATTERNS; PLANTS; TRACKING; BIRDS; TREES; FACILITATION; CONSISTENCY; COEXISTENCE; DIVERSITY	Indirect interactions among plant species mediated by frugivorous animals can be central to population and community dynamics, since the successful seed dispersal of species may depend on facilitative or competitive interactions with heterospecific plants. Yet, empirical evidence on these interactions is very scarce and mostly available at small spatial scales, within populations. Because lipid-rich fruits are known to be preferred by migratory birds, here we test our prediction of competitive inferiority of a carbohydrate-rich fruited species (the hawthorn Crataegus monogyna) compared to lipid-rich co-fruiting species in a Mediterranean region where the bulk of seed dispersal relies on migratory birds. We assessed avian seed dispersal in both relative (fruit removal rate) and absolute terms (seed dispersal magnitude) in seven hawthorn populations distributed across an altitudinal gradient encompassing three contrasting fruiting contexts: hawthorn is scarce in the lowlands, common in the midlands, and the dominant fruit species in the highlands. We found evidence of seed dispersal reduction due to interspecific competition in the lowland populations, where lipid-rich fruits dominate. Besides, DNA barcoding analysis of bird-dispersed seeds revealed that only a small subset of the local frugivore assemblages consumed hawthorn fruits in the lowland communities. Instead, the consumers of hawthorn fruits resembled the local frugivore assemblages where hawthorn fruits were more dominant and frugivore choices more limited. Our study suggests mechanisms by which the rarity or dominance of plant species might be jointly influenced by environmental constraints (here, precipitation along the altitudinal gradient) and frugivore-mediated indirect interactions among plants hindering or facilitating seed dispersal.

Soil-mediated impacts of an invasive thistle inhibit the recruitment of certain native plants	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Biological invasions; Recruitment; Seeds; Seedlings; Soil microbes	BELOW-GROUND ENEMIES; FUNGAL PATHOGENS; CANADA THISTLE; FEEDBACK; COMMUNITY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; BIOTA; ACCUMULATION; POPULATION	Invasive plants may outcompete and replace native plant species through a variety of mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that soil microbial pathways such as pathogen accumulation may have a considerable role in facilitating competition between native and invasive plants. To assess microbe-mediated pathways of invasion, we tested the impacts of invaded and non-invaded field soils on plant establishment using naturally occurring populations of the common Eurasian invader Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) in Southern Ontario, Canada. Linked field and greenhouse experiments were used to quantify differences in the germinability and early growth rates of native plant species, depending on exposure to the microbial community in invaded or non-invaded soils. The invaded microbial community significantly reduced early growth rates for two of the seven native species surveyed, and decreased seed germination for another. In contrast, the germination and growth of invasive Cirsium were not affected by its own soil microbial community. These results demonstrate that the invasion of C. arvense can reduce the performance of some native plant species through changes to the soil microbial community. Different effects on different species suggest that this invader may also change the relative importance of certain natives in the invaded community. If these effects influence plant abundance in the field, microbially mediated interactions in the soil may aid the invasion of C. arvense and facilitate the disruption of invaded communities.

However, whether the positive ITV-abundance relationship holds in heterogeneous local environments remains uncertain. Using an individual-based trait dataset encompassing three leaf traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry mass content) of 20,248 individuals across 80 species in an environmentally heterogeneous subtropical forest in eastern China, ITV for each trait of each species was estimated by rarefaction. Resource-based niche breadth and marginality (the absolute distance between the mean resource states used by a species and the mean plot-wise resource states) were estimated simultaneously by the K-S method and the outlying mean index, respectively. Species with moderate ITV were often locally abundant, while species with large or small ITV were locally rare. This unimodal relationship between ITV and species abundance persisted when traits were analyzed separately and for all tree size classes. There was also a hump-backed relationship between niche breadth and marginality, and ITV was positively associated with niche breadth. The combined results suggest either a trade-off between the benefit from expanding niche breadth to adapt to multiple habitats and the disadvantage of reducing competitive ability, or a scarcity of favorable resources. Our results do not support the traditional thought that ITV positively correlates with species abundance in heterogeneous local environments. Instead, our study suggests that moderate-rather than large-intraspecific trait variability increases species abundance at local scales.

Herbivory regulates the establishment of a native species of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in a tidal estuary of the USA	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Plant population; Non-native; Restoration; Recovery; Blue crab	CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS RATHBUN; JUVENILE BLUE CRABS; VALLISNERIA-AMERICANA; WILD CELERY; ECOSYSTEMS; WATERFOWL; ABUNDANCE; SURVIVAL; BIOMASS; DIET	Herbivores are a diverse group of fauna that shape the distribution and composition of plant communities. In some cases, herbivory may prevent the re-establishment of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), such as Vallisneria americana, into systems. The goal of this study was to investigate the role and nature of herbivory on V. americana transplants with camera and transect surveys of grazing intensity and with field and laboratory grazing experiments using a suspected herbivore, the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Camera surveys recorded C. sapidus clipping and consuming shoots of V. americana for the first time. Grazing intensity surveys in low-salinity regions of the lower Chesapeake Bay indicated that the majority of V. americana transplants (50-75%) were clipped off at their base within one week of planting. Field and laboratory experiments demonstrated that C. sapidus clips and consumes V. americana as well as other rapidly colonizing, non-native SAV. Analysisof the gut contents of C. sapidus caught in SAV beds in the Chesapeake Bay revealed that SAV comprised 16% of their stomach contents, suggesting low levels of C. sapidus herbivory occurred over a wide area. Callinectes sapidus is yet another animal documented to consume SAV for some portion of their diet. These results also suggest that herbivores or omnivores, including C. sapidus, can serve as bottlenecks to recovery of SAV, like V. americana, in some areas. Herbivores may not serve as bottlenecks in other environments or to other SAV with more rapid plant growth or higher recruitment levels that may overcome grazing pressure.	[Johnson, A. J.; Orth, R.

While recent research revealed that aboveground insect herbivory generally impacts the outcome of PSFs, no study tested to what extent the intensity of herbivory affects the outcome. This, however, is essential to estimate the contribution of PSFs to plant performance under natural conditions in the field. Here, we tested PSF effects both with and without exposure to aboveground herbivory for four common grass species in nine grasslands that formed a gradient of aboveground invertebrate herbivory. Without aboveground herbivores, PSFs for each of the four grass species were similar in each of the nine grasslands-both in direction and in magnitude. In the presence of herbivores, however, the PSFs differed from those measured under herbivory exclusion, and depended on the intensity of herbivory. At low levels of herbivory, PSFs were similar in the presence and absence of herbivores, but differed at high herbivory levels. While PSFs without herbivores remained similar along the gradient of herbivory intensity, increasing herbivory intensity mostly resulted in neutral PSFs in the presence of herbivores. This suggests that the relative importance of PSFs for plant-species performance in grassland communities decreases with increasing intensity of herbivory. Hence, PSFs might be more important for plant performance in ecosystems with low herbivore pressure than in ecosystems with large impacts of insect herbivores.

Since then, genetic diversity has improved, the frequency of morphological and biomedical correlates of inbreeding depression have declined, and the population size has increased. Nevertheless, the panther population remains small and isolated and faces substantial challenges due to deterministic and stochastic forces. Our goals were 1) to comprehensively assess the demographics of the Florida panther population using long-term (1981-2015) field data and modeling to gauge the persistence of benefits accrued via genetic introgression and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of various potential genetic management strategies. Translocation and introduction of female pumas (Puma concolor stanleyana) from Texas, USA, substantially improved genetic diversity. The average individual heterozygosity of canonical (non-introgressed) panthers was 0.386 +/- 0.012 (SE); for admixed panthers, it was 0.615 +/- 0.007. Survival rates were strongly age-dependent (kittens had the lowest survival rates), were positively affected by individual heterozygosity, and decreased with increasing population abundance. Overall annual kitten survival was 0.32 +/- 0.09; sex did not have a clear effect on kitten survival. Annual survival of subadult and adult panthers differed by sex; regardless of age, females exhibited higher survival than males. Annual survival rates of subadult, prime adult, and old adult females were 0.97 +/- 0.02, 0.86 +/- 0.03, and 0.78 +/- 0.09, respectively. Survival rates of subadult, prime adult, and old adult males were 0.66 +/- 0.06, 0.77 +/- 0.05, and 0.65 +/- 0.10, respectively. For panthers of all ages, genetic ancestry strongly affected survival rate, where first filial generation (F1) admixed panthers of all ages exhibited the highest rates and canonical (mostly pre-introgression panthers and their post-introgression descendants) individuals exhibited the lowest rates. The most frequently observed causes of death of radio-collared panthers were intraspecific aggression and vehicle collision. Cause-specific mortality analyses revealed that mortality rates from vehicle collision, intraspecific aggression, other causes, and unknown causes were generally similar for males and females, although males were more likely to die from intraspecific aggression than females. The probability of reproduction and the annual number of kittens produced varied by age; evidence that ancestry or abundance influenced these parameters was weak. Predicted annual probabilities of reproduction were 0.35 +/- 0.08, 0.50 +/- 0.05, and 0.25 +/- 0.06 for subadult, prime adult, and old adult females, respectively. The number of kittens predicted to be produced annually by subadult, prime adult, and old adult females were 2.80 +/- 0.75, 2.67 +/- 0.43, and 2.28 +/- 0.83, respectively. The stochastic annual population growth rate estimated using a matrix population model was 1.04 (95% CI = 0.72-1.41). An individual-based population model predicted that the probability that the population would fall below 10 panthers within 100 years (quasi-extinction) was 1.4% (0-0.8%) if the adverse effects of genetic erosion were ignored. However, when the effect of genetic erosion was considered, the probability of quasi-extinction within 100 years increased to 17% (0-100%). Mean times to quasi-extinction, conditioned on going quasi-extinct within 100 years, was 22 (0-75) years when the effect of genetic erosion was considered. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the probability of quasi-extinction and expected time until quasi-extinction were most sensitive to changes in kitten survival parameters. Without genetic management intervention, the Florida panther population would face a substantially increased risk of quasi-extinction. The question, therefore, is not whether genetic management of the Florida panther population is needed but when and how it should be implemented. Thus, we evaluated genetic and population consequences of alternative genetic introgression strategies to identify optimal management actions using individual-based simulation models. Releasing 5 pumas every 20 years would cost much less ($200,000 over 100 years) than releasing 15 pumas every 10 years ($1,200,000 over 100 years) yet would reduce the risk of quasi-extinction by comparable amount (44-59% vs. 40-58%). Generally, releasing more females per introgression attempt provided little added benefit. The positive effects of the genetic introgression project persist in the panther population after 20 years. We suggest that managers contemplate repeating genetic introgression by releasing 5-10 individuals from other puma populations every 20-40 years. We also recommend that managers continue to collect data that will permit estimation and monitoring of kitten, adult, and subadult survival. We identified these parameters via sensitivity analyses as most critical in terms of their impact on the probability of and expected times to quasi-extinction. The continuation of long-term monitoring should permit the adaptation of genetic management strategies as necessary while collecting data that have proved essential in assessing the genetic and demographic health of the population. The prospects for recovery of the panther will certainly be improved by following these guidelines. (c) 2019 The Authors.

However, a full understanding of the general pattern of ecosystem belowground processes in response to soil acidification due to the impacting factors remains elusive. We conducted a meta-analysis of soil acidification impacts on belowground functions using 304 observations from 49 independent studies, mainly including soil cations, soil nutrient, respiration, root and microbial biomass. Our results show that acid addition significantly reduced soil pHby 0.24 on average, with less pH decrease in forest than non-forest ecosystems. The response ratio of soilpH was positively correlated with site precipitation and temperature, but negatively with initial soil pH. Soil base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+) decreased while non-base cations (Al3+, Fe3+) increased with soil acidification. Soil respiration, fine root biomass, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen were significantly reduced by 14.7%, 19.1%, 9.6% and 12.1%, respectively, under acid addition. These indicate that soil carbon processes are sensitive to soil acidification. Overall, our meta-analysis suggests a strong negative impact of soil acidification on belowground functions, with the potential to suppress soil carbon emission. It also arouses our attention to the toxic effects of soil ions on terrestrial ecosystems.

The objective of this study was to assess the survival rate of artificial nests along an edge associated with a highway and in the interior of a tabuleiro forest. The study was performed at the Sooretama Biological Reserve, on the margins of federal highway BR-101, between September and October 2015. A total of 168 artificial nests with a Common quail (Coturnix coturnix) egg in each nest were placed along six sampling transects, at distances of 2, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 m from the highway toward the forest interior. We used logistic regression and estimated daily survival rate (DSR) using the "Nest Survival" function in the program MARK to estimate artificial nest survival and assessed the effect of the distance from the highway. The artificial nest survival rate was significantly higher on the highway margins than at other distances. The results show that artificial nests located up to 25 m from the highway have a greater success probability (over 95%) and a significant decrease in success probability more than 50 m from the highway. Although we cannot rule out other nonroad-specific edge effects on artificial nest predation, our results suggest that the impacts of the highway (e.g., noise, vibration, visual stimuli) cause predators to avoid the road's surroundings (up to 25 m into the forest) when selecting their feeding sites, which partially supports the predation release hypothesis.

Historically, the natural flood cycle of the Rio Grande prevented contact between the two subspecies of pocket gophers. Flood control measures completed in the 1930s permitted contact, thus establishing the hybrid zone between the pocket gophers and the contact zone between their lice (without hybridization). Since that time, the pocket gopher hybrid zone has stabilized, whereas the northern chewing louse species has replaced the southern louse species at a consistent rate of similar to 150 m/year. The 0.2-0.8 width of the replacement zone has remained constant, reflecting the constant rate of chewing louse species turnover on a single gopher and within a local pocket gopher population. In contrast, the full width of the replacement zone (northernmost G. centralis to southernmost G. aurei) has increased annually. By employing a variety of metrics of the species replacement zone, we are better able to understand the dynamics of interactions between and among the chewing lice and their pocket gopher hosts. This research provides an opportunity to observe active species replacement and resulting distributional shifts in a parasitic organism in its natural setting.

Genetic diversity, admixture, and hatchery influence in Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) throughout western New York State	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						effective population size; gene flow; genetic structure; hatchery introgression; relatedness; salmonid	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; BROWN TROUT; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; SALMON POPULATIONS; BAYESIAN METHODS; N-E; STOCKING; WILD	Although Brook Trout are distributed across most of eastern North America, population numbers have declined in many regions due to habitat loss, climate change, and competition with non-native species. In New York State, Brook Trout habitat has been substantially reduced, with many areas showing complete extirpation of Brook Trout populations, predominantly in the western portion of the state. Small, fragmented populations are at risk of genetic diversity loss, inbreeding depression, and reduced fitness, leading to a greater potential for local extirpation. Genetic monitoring is a practical tool that can facilitate further conservation-decision making regarding small populations. In this study, we used 12 microsatellite loci to examine 3,436 sampled Brook Trout, representing 75 sites from the Allegheny, Erie/Niagara, Genesee, Oswego, Lake Ontario, and Susquehanna drainage basins throughout western New York State. Three Brook Trout hatchery strains were also genetically characterized to evaluate the degree of hatchery introgression between wild populations and hatchery strains stocked in the region. Overall, estimates of genetic diversity varied widely: Allelic richness ranged from 2.23 to 7.485, and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.402 to 0.766. As observed for Brook Trout in other regions, we found a high degree of genetic differentiation among populations, with all comparisons except one showing significant F-ST values. Hatchery introgression was found to be minimal, with estimates ranging from 1.96% to 3.10% of wild individuals exhibiting membership proportions to a hatchery strain cluster exceeding 10% (q >= 0.10). Results from this investigation can be used to prioritize management efforts for Brook Trout in western New York State and act as a baseline to monitor future population trends.

Begging behavior as an honest signal of need and parent-offspring association during the postfledging dependency period	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						begging; honest signaling; parent-offspring conflict; postfledging parental care; roseate tern; Sterna dougallii	ROSEATE TERNS; RECOGNITION; CALLS; CARE; SEX; INDEPENDENCE; EVOLUTION; CONFLICT; GROWTH; ADULT	Honest signaling mechanisms can function to appropriate care to hungry offspring and avoid misdirected care of unrelated offspring. Begging, the behavior by which offspring solicit food and parental care, may be an honest signaling mechanism for need, as well as association of parents and offspring. Roseate terns (Sterna dougallii) exhibit prolonged parental care during the postbreeding staging period, offering an ideal system in which to study begging as an honest signaling mechanism. We conducted focal sampling during two premigratory staging seasons (2014 and 2015) at Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts, USA to determine whether postfledging tern begging behavior was an honest signal for need and parent-offspring association. Based on honest signaling theory, we expected begging behavior to be highest during times of high perceived need, and we expected to see a decrease in begging behavior as young terns became increasingly independent of the care-giving parent. Also, we predicted that young terns would be more likely to beg at parents than nonparents. We found that young roseate terns begged at their parents more often than nonparents; however, they did not always beg at parents. Model predictions of begging probability showed a linear relationship between begging and time of day and date of season, such that begging increased with time of day and decreased with date of season, respectively. Our results provide evidence for honest parent-offspring interactions and are inconsistent with parent-offspring conflict theory but suggest that begging may play a complex role in postfledging parent-offspring interactions.

Some animals change their patterns of resource selection in space and time to optimize the trade-off between risks and benefits. We examine the circadian variation in resource selection of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor) within a human-modified landscape, an environment of varying suitability. We used GPS data from 48 swamp wallabies to compare the use of landscape features such as woodland and scrub, housing estates, farmland, coastal areas, wetlands, waterbodies, and roads to their availability using generalized linear mixed models. We investigated which features were selected by wallabies and determined whether the distance to different landscape features changed, depending on the time of the day. During the day, wallabies were more likely to be found within or near natural landscape features such as woodlands and scrub, wetlands, and coastal vegetation, while avoiding landscape features that may be perceived as more risky (roads, housing, waterbodies, and farmland), but those features were selected more at night. Finally, we mapped our results to predict habitat suitability for swamp wallabies in human-modified landscapes. We showed that wallabies living in a human-modified landscape selected different landscape features during day or night. Changing circadian patterns of resource selection might enhance the persistence of species in landscapes where resources are fragmented and disturbed.

The Qinling-Daba Mountains (QDM) located in central China form an important geographic barrier between southern subtropical and northern temperate regions, and exhibit complex topography, climatic, and ecological diversity. Surprisingly, few phylogeographic analyses and studies of plant speciation in this region have been conducted. To address this issue, we investigated the genetic divergence and evolutionary histories of three closely related tree peony species (Paeonia qiui, P. jishanensis, and P. rockii) endemic to the QDM. Forty populations of the three tree peony species were genotyped using 22 nuclear simple sequence repeat markers (nSSRs) and three chloroplast DNA sequences to assess genetic structure and phylogenetic relationships, supplemented by morphological characterization and ecological niche modeling (ENM). Morphological and molecular genetic analyses showed the three species to be clearly differentiated from each other. In addition, coalescent analyses using DIYABC conducted on nSSR variation indicated that the species diverged from each other in the late Pleistocene, while ecological niche modeling (ENM) suggested they occupied a larger area during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) than at present. The combined genetic evidence from nuclear and chloroplast DNA and the results of ENM indicate that each species persisted through the late Pleistocene in multiple refugia in the Qinling, Daba, and Taihang Mountains with divergence favored by restricted gene flow caused by geographic isolation, ecological divergence, and limited pollen and seed dispersal. Our study contributes to a growing understanding of the origin and population structure of tree peonies and provides insights into the high level of plant endemism present in the Qinling-Daba Mountains of Central China.

Most studies have dealt with distributions over a single season or annually without considering seasonality. However, animal distributions and their drivers can differ among seasons because many animals migrate to suitable climates and areas with abundant prey resources. We aim to clarify seasonality in bird distributions and their drivers. Location Japan. Methods We examined the effects of climate (annual mean temperature, snow depth), topography (elevation), and land use (extent of surrounding habitat) on bird species richness, in the breeding and wintering seasons separately, using nationwide data (254 forest and 43 grassland sites, respectively). We separately analyzed the species richness of all species, residents, short-, and long-distance migrants in forests and grasslands. Results In the breeding season, the annual mean temperature negatively affected all groups (except for forest and grassland residents), and the extent of surrounding habitat positively affected many groups. By contrast, in the wintering season, temperature positively affected all groups (except for forest residents), and the extent of surrounding habitat positively affected only grassland long-distance migrants. In both seasons, the species richness of forest and grassland residents was high in regions of moderate and high temperature, respectively. Moreover, snow depth negatively affected all forest groups in the wintering season. Mapping expected species richness suggested that regions with different climates served as habitats for different groups during different seasons. Main conclusions All regions were important bird habitats depending on the season, reflecting the contrasting effects of temperature across seasons. In the breeding season, surrounding land use was also an important driver. To understand the seasonal role that each region and environment plays in maintaining species/communities, a large-scale study considering both environmental seasonality and species distribution is needed.

Acacia dealbata invasion in Chile: Surprises from climatic niche and species distribution models	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Acacia dealbata invasion; invasion management strategies; niche modeling; potential distribution models; south-central Chile	POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS; TREE INVASIONS; RANGE; CONSERVATISM; PREDICTION; SHRUBS; SHIFT; RISK	Aim Tree invasions are a threat to biodiversity conservation, and although it is hard to predict the future spread of invasive tree species, there are tools available which could allow some estimations. The magnitude of spatial spread (a proxy of invasiveness) can be predicted from species climatic requirement (climatic niche) and can be represented by species distribution models (SDMs). We aimed to assess whether Acacia dealbata conserves its niche in the new environment of south-central Chile, and also, to estimate the invasive stage of the species. Location South-central area of Chile, between the O'Higgins (34 degrees 0 '' 0 ' S) and Aysen Regions (47 degrees 0 '' 0 ' S). Methods We used a combination of global, native, and regional data to improve the estimation of the potential distribution of A. dealbata, which has been considered one of the most invasive species of the genus, being registered in at least 34 countries in all the Continents. Results Our results show that A. dealbata does not conserve its niche in the study area, invading areas with climatic conditions different from those of the native range. It is also not at equilibrium with the environment. According to the global versus regional SDM comparisons, populations present in south-central Chile present different invasion stages. There are some stable populations, but there are other populations colonizing new areas, occupying unsuitable habitats and some of them are adapting to new climatic conditions. Climatic factors, such as precipitation seasonality, could be acting behind the expansion to new environments, and biotic factors or dispersal limitations could be preventing the species to colonize suitable areas. Main conclusions The invasion process of A. dealbata is far from stabilizing, and management options should focus on prevention, avoiding, for example, the introduction of the species to Patagonia where the species has not spread yet. More research is needed to complement our results and enhance the development of effective management strategies.

The young (neonates, young-of-the-year, and juveniles) of many coastal shark species occupy a diverse range of habitats and areas where they experience environmental variability, including acute and seasonal shifts in local salinities and temperatures. Although the location and functioning of essential shark habitats has been a focus in recent shark research, there is a paucity of data from the South Pacific. In this study, we document the temporal and spatial distribution, age class composition, and environmental parameters of young bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in the Rewa, Sigatoka, and Navua Rivers, Fiji's three largest riverine systems. One hundred and seventy-two young bull sharks were captured in fisheries-independent surveys from January 2016 to April 2018. The vast majority of the captures were neonates. Seasonality in patterns of occurrence of neonate individuals suggests a defined parturition period during summer. Environmental parameters between the Rewa and the Sigatoka River differed significantly, as did the recorded young bull sharks abundance. According to the surveys, young bull sharks occur in all three rivers with the Rewa River likely representing essential habitat for newly born bull sharks. These results enhance the understanding of bull shark ecology in Fiji and provide a scientific basis for the implementation of local conservation strategies that contribute to the protection of critical habitats.

Evidence of strong stabilizing effects on the evolution of boreoeutherian (Mammalia) dental proportions	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Boreoeutheria; dentition; diet; life history; phylogenetic signal	PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; MORPHOGENETIC FIELDS; TOOTH DEVELOPMENT; FEEDING ECOLOGY; LIFE-HISTORY; BODY-SIZE; MOLAR; DENTITION; DIET	The dentition is an extremely important organ in mammals with variation in timing and sequence of eruption, crown morphology, and tooth size enabling a range of behavioral, dietary, and functional adaptations across the class. Within this suite of variable mammalian dental phenotypes, relative sizes of teeth reflect variation in the underlying genetic and developmental mechanisms. Two ratios of postcanine tooth lengths capture the relative size of premolars to molars (premolar-molar module, PMM), and among the three molars (molar module component, MMC), and are known to be heritable, independent of body size, and to vary significantly across primates. Here, we explore how these dental traits vary across mammals more broadly, focusing on terrestrial taxa in the clade of Boreoeutheria (Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria). We measured the postcanine teeth of N = 1,523 boreoeutherian mammals spanning six orders, 14 families, 36 genera, and 49 species to test hypotheses about associations between dental proportions and phylogenetic relatedness, diet, and life history in mammals. Boreoeutherian postcanine dental proportions sampled in this study carry conserved phylogenetic signal and are not associated with variation in diet. The incorporation of paleontological data provides further evidence that dental proportions may be slower to change than is dietary specialization. These results have implications for our understanding of dental variation and dietary adaptation in mammals.

Duma florulenta (lignum) is a keystone species that facilitates biodiversity in the floodplains and wetlands of Australia's dryland river systems. This paper explores spatial genetic structure of lignum and investigates factors influencing dispersal and gene flow within and among river catchments of the northern Murray-Darling Basin. Location Northern Murray-Darling Basin, eastern Australia. Methods A total of 122 individual plants from subpopulations located on rivers in four adjacent catchments were genotyped using 10 microsatellite markers. Microsatellite data were then analyzed using population genetic techniques to evaluate levels of gene flow and genetic structure and identify factors influencing dispersal. Results Results suggest high levels of gene flow between lignum subpopulations of the northern Murray-Darling Basin. AMOVA revealed small but significant differences between subpopulations, and STRUCTURE analysis did not detect meaningful structure when sampling information was not provided. However, when sampling information was supplied using the LOCPRIOR model, three genetic clusters were identified. All Lower Balonne subpopulations were assigned to cluster 1 while a number of the other subpopulations showed mixed ancestry. Weak relationships were identified between pairwise genetic distance and geographic as well as river distance, although the R-2 value of the former was only half that of the latter. Main conclusions Patterns of genetic variation suggest frequent long-distance overland gene flow largely as a result of the movement of seeds via floodwater. Therefore, maintenance of natural variability in flow regime is key both to maintain conditions favorable to recruitment and to promote dispersal and gene flow across the landscape. However, given future climate change projections persistence may be more reliant on the species ability to endure long periods of drought between flood events.

Using stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in eggs of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis), glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), we investigated the trophic ecology of prebreeding seabirds nesting at Prince Leopold Island, Nunavut, and its relationship with sea-ice conditions. The seabird community of Prince Leopold Island had a broader isotopic niche during lower sea-ice conditions, thus having a more divergent diet, while the opposite was observed during years with more extensive sea-ice conditions. Species' trophic position was influenced by sea ice; in years of lower sea-ice concentration, gulls and kittiwakes foraged at higher trophic levels while the opposite was observed for murres and fulmars. For murres and fulmars over a longer time series, there was no evidence of the effect of sea-ice concentration on species' isotopic niche. Results suggest a high degree of adaptation in populations of high Arctic species that cope with harsh and unpredictable conditions. Such different responses of the community isotopic niche also show that the effect of variable sea-ice conditions, despite being subtle at the species level, might have larger implications when considering the trophic ecology of the larger seabird community. Species-specific responses in foraging patterns, in particular trophic position in relation to sea ice, are critical to understanding effects of ecosystem change predicted for a changing climate.

Here, we use data collected from 1997 to 2013 to explore effects of changing environmental conditions on bird-blowfly interactions in northern New Mexico. The objectives of this study were to examine what climate variables influence blowfly prevalence and intensity and to determine whether blowflies and climate variables affect bird fledging success. We examined how temperature, precipitation, and drought affect two parasitic blowflies and their hosts, Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) and Ash-throated Flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens). We found that blowfly prevalence did not change over time. Blowfly intensity increased over time in bluebird nests, but not in flycatcher nests. More blowflies result in slightly higher fledging success in bluebirds, but not flycatchers. There was a significant interaction between blowflies and precipitation on bluebird fledging success. For flycatchers, there was a significant interaction between blowflies and temperature and between blowflies and drought severity on fledging success. Given that the southwest is projected to be hotter and have more frequent and prolonged droughts, we predict that flycatchers may be negatively impacted by blowflies if these trends continue. Future work should focus on investigating the role of both blowflies and climate on fledging success. Climate patterns may negatively impact host fitness through altered parasite pressure.

We studied density and biomass variation of a threatened medicinal herb, Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora, to examine the effect of harvest on plant performance. The study covered two regions with contrasting harvest situations-one with open-access and another protected from commercial harvesting. Four populations from each region were compared along an elevation gradient (3,800-4,800 m). Also, we conducted in situ interviews with 165 and 38 medicinal and aromatic plant users in open-access and protected regions, respectively, to assess the collection and use patterns of the target species. The quantity harvested per household for traditional healthcare use was similar in both regions. We found no evidence of trade-driven collection in the protected region but in the open-access region a trade-based annual collection of 35-465 kg dried rhizomes per household had a strong negative effect on both density and biomass. In the protected region, the effect of harvest intensity on plant density was positive for vegetative and negative for reproductive individuals, whereas in the open-access region, the effect was negative for both vegetative and reproductive individuals. The results indicated that a low harvest intensity had no adverse impact on N. scrophulariiflora populations; however, quantification of the optimum level of harvest remains to be explored. Shrub vegetation appeared to buffer the harvest impact on plant density, possibly through the retention of additional moisture. To maintain population viability, we suggest regulating harvest, for example, by introducing rotational harvest systems, ensuring that a sufficient number of reproductive individuals are left as a source of propagules in each harvested population and that populations are given time to recover between harvests.

Nest quality may contribute to the builder's extended phenotype and serve as an ornament during mate choice. We examined male and female nest choice in the common goby (Pomatoschistus microps), a benthic fish with male-only parental care where females deposit eggs in male-built nests. Using prebuilt nest models, we independently manipulated two candidate nest quality traits: (a) nest entrance width with a role in oxygen ventilation, and (b) extent of sand cover with a role in camouflage. In simultaneous choice trials, male gobies exhibited no preference for any nest model type. This suggests that initial characteristics of a nesting substrate have minor importance for males, which usually remodel the nest. Females were given a choice between two males occupying either entrance- or cover-manipulated nests. The same pair of males was then exposed to a second female but now with alternated nest types assigned. Most females were consistent in choosing the same, typically the heavier male of the two regardless of nest properties. However, the females that chose the same nest regardless of the male preferred low over high sand coverage and narrow over wide nest entrance. Our results indicate that females base their mating decision on a combination of male phenotype and nest traits. While we found no indication that females are attracted to highly decorated nests, our study is the first in fishes to disentangle a preference for narrow (and thus more protective) nest entrances independent of nest coverage.

However, the effects of NLEs on crop yield have rarely been measured. Here, we investigated how different bordering structures, such as agricultural roads, field-to-field borders, forests, hedgerows, and kettle holes, influence agricultural yields. We hypothesized that (a) yield values at field borders differ from mid-field yields and that (b) the extent of this change in yields depends on the bordering structure. We measured winter wheat yields along transects with log-scaled distances from the border into the agricultural field within two intensively managed agricultural landscapes in Germany (2014 near Gottingen, and 2015-2017 in the Uckermark). We observed a yield loss adjacent to every investigated bordering structure of 11%-38% in comparison with mid-field yields. However, depending on the bordering structure, this yield loss disappeared at different distances. While the proximity of kettle holes did not affect yields more than neighboring agricultural fields, woody landscape elements had strong effects on winter wheat yields. Notably, 95% of mid-field yields could already be reached at a distance of 11.3 m from a kettle hole and at a distance of 17.8 m from hedgerows as well as forest borders. Our findings suggest that yield losses are especially relevant directly adjacent to woody landscape elements, but not adjacent to in-field water bodies. This highlights the potential to simultaneously counteract yield losses close to the field border and enhance biodiversity by combining different NLEs in agricultural landscapes such as creating strips of extensive grassland vegetation between woody landscape elements and agricultural fields. In conclusion, our results can be used to quantify ecocompensations to find optimal solutions for the delivery of productive and regulative ecosystem services in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes.

Species composition and community structure of small pest rodents (Muridae) in cultivated and fallow fields in maize-growing areas in Mayuge district, Eastern Uganda	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						community structure; composition; cultivated fields; fallow land; richness; rodents; species diversity	MASTOMYS-NATALENSIS SMITH; PLAGUE-ENDEMIC REGION; AFRICAN PYGMY MICE; SMALL MAMMALS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; NATIONAL-PARK; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; HABITAT	Pest rodents remain key biotic constraints to cereal crops production in the East African region where they occur, especially in seasons of outbreaks. Despite that, Uganda has scant information on rodents as crop pests to guide effective management strategies. A capture-mark-recapture (CMR) technique was employed to study the ecology of small rodents, specifically to establish the species composition and community structure in a maize-based agro ecosystem. Trapping of small rodents was conducted in permanent fallow land and cultivated fields, with each category replicated twice making four study grids. At each field, a 60 x 60 m grid was measured and marked with permanent trapping points spaced at 10 x 10 m, making a total of 49 trapping points/grids. Trapping was conducted monthly at 4-week interval for three consecutive days for two and half years using Sherman live traps. Eleven identified small rodent species and one insectivorous small mammal were recorded with Mastomys natalensis being the most dominant species (over 60.7%). Other species were Mus triton (16.1%), Aethomys hendei (6.7%), Lemniscomys zebra (5.2%), Lophuromys sikapusi (4.8%), Arvicanthis niloticus (0.9%), Gerbilliscus kempi (0.1%), Graphiurus murinus (0.1%), Steatomys parvus (0.1%), Dasymys incomtus (0.1%), and Grammomys dolichurus (0.1%). Spatially, species richness differed significantly (p = 0.0001) between the studied field habitats with significantly higher richness in fallow land compared with cultivated fields. Temporally, total species richness and abundance showed a significant interaction effect over the months, years, and fields of trapping with significantly (p = 0.001) higher abundances during months of wet seasons and in the first and third year of trapping. In terms of community structure, higher species diversity associated more with fallow field habitats but also with certain rare species found only in cultivated fields. Synthesis and applications. Based on these findings, management strategies can be designed to target the key pest species and the most vulnerable habitats thus reducing the impact they can inflict on field crops.

These common habitats frequently experience seasonal water table variations resulting in periodically air-exposed sediments. However, the influence of these events on both the system scale carbon balance and in-pond environmental conditions remains poorly studied. We took advantage of an extraordinarily warm and dry summer to quantify the CO2 efflux from air-exposed sediments and water surfaces in desiccating ponds on oland, Sweden. Simultaneously, we modelled metabolism and measured environmental variables within the ponds. We found that air-exposed sediments had high CO2 effluxes greatly exceeding that from the water surfaces. Sediment water content influenced the temperature and strongly regulated the CO2 efflux gradually approaching zero as water evaporated. Within the desiccating ponds, respiration was generally higher than gross primary production, but was lower compared to the same ponds with higher water table. These findings highlight the role of periodically air-exposed pond sediments as sites of highly active carbon processes. Not only is this important for the system-scale carbon in ponds, but it may also influence the destiny of buried carbon in lakes subject to climate changes. The environmental conditions within desiccating ponds, most notably high water temperatures and poor oxygen conditions, further iterate the dynamics and extreme nature of ponds.

The invasive bivalve, Corbicula fluminea, is known to affect stream biogeochemistry and may influence methane cycling via bioturbation and respiration. Response of methanogenesis rate, potential rate of methanotrophy, and net methane flux to Corbicula density was tested using intact sediment core incubations. Potential methanotrophy decreased and net methane flux increased with Corbicula density in sediment cores. However, the magnitude of this effect decreased at the highest Corbicula densities tested here. Response of sediment pore water methane concentration to Corbicula density was tested using in situ cage enclosures in a randomized block design over a 50m stream reach. Block effect was the most significant predictor of in situ pore water methane concentration, and Corbicula density had a positive, marginally significant, interaction with the block effect, indicating that Corbicula's effect on methane concentration varies with in situ conditions. Our study shows that Corbicula influences methane cycling processes in the laboratory, apparently via their impact on dissolved oxygen, but this effect depends on stream conditions in the field. Further study is needed to evaluate mechanisms of this relationship more fully.

Measured estimates of semi-natural terrestrial NPP in Great Britain: comparison with modelled values, and dependence on atmospheric nitrogen deposition	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Net primary production; Nitrogen deposition; Modelling; Grass; Bracken; Shrubs; Long-term change	NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; BRACKEN FRONDS; SOIL-NITROGEN; CARBON-CYCLE; RESPONSES; GRASSLANDS; VEGETATION; ECOSYSTEMS	Plant growth in nitrogen (N)-limited, unfertilised terrestrial ecosystems should respond to additional N inputs from atmospheric deposition (N-dep). We investigated this for sites in Great Britain (GB) by compiling 796 estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) from measured biomass production over the period 1932-2014, although the great majority were for 1990 onwards. The sites were largely vegetated with shrubs, grass and bracken, and had a wide range of N-dep (0.5-3.3gN m(-2)a(-1) in 2000). The measured NPP estimates were compared with calculated values from the biogeochemical ecosystem model N14CP, which predicts that NPP depends strongly upon N-dep. The measured and modelled average total NPP values (gCm(-2) a(-1)) from all data were 387 (standard deviation, SD=193) and 377 (SD=72) respectively. Measured and modelled averages for vegetation classes followed the sequence: broadleaved trees similar to needle-leaved trees >herbs (rough grassland+bracken) similar to shrubs. After averaging measured values for sites in individual model grid cells (5kmx5km) with 10 or more replicates, the measured and modelled NPP values were correlated (n=26, r(2)=0.22, p=0.011), with a slope close to unity. Significant linear relationships were found between measured ln NPP and cumulative N-dep for both herbs (n=298, p=0.021) and shrubs (n=473, p=0.006), with slopes comparable to those predicted with the model. The results suggest that semi-natural NPP in GB depends positively upon N-dep, in a manner that agrees quantitatively with N14CP predictions. Calculations with the model, using modelled temporal variation in N-dep, indicate that fertilisation by N-dep caused average increases in semi-natural NPP over the period 1800 to 2010 of 30% for shrubs, 71% for herbs, and 91% for broadleaved trees. Combined with previous published results for forests, our findings suggest a general and widespread vegetation response to fertilisation by N-dep.

Quantifying hydrologic alteration in an area lacking current reference conditions-The Mississippi alluvial plain of the south-central United States	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						environmental flows; hydrologic alteration; Mississippi Alluvial Plain; reference conditions	ALTERED FLOW REGIMES; RANDOM FORESTS; CLASSIFICATION	Quantifying hydrologic alteration in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain (MAP) of the south-central United States is particularly difficult because of the lack of current reference, or even relatively undisturbed, streams and associated streamflow data. Impacts, such as water withdrawals for agriculture, weirs, dams, channelization, and other forms of regulation, within the MAP increased substantially beginning around 1960 suggesting that streamflow has since been altered. Using historical streamflow and climate data and explanatory variables, the U.S. Geological Survey developed random forest regression models to estimate expected reference monthly streamflows (pre-1960) at 76 sites in the MAP and two adjacent Level III Ecoregions. To compensate for the lack of current reference stream sites in the study area, the pre-1960 streamflow data were used as a surrogate to estimate current streamflow conditions without anthropogenic influence (inferring current reference conditions). Overall, nearly every site within the study area had less zero-flow days than what historically has been observed and there were more low-pulse spells. However, the frequency of floods remained relatively consistent.

Storm effects on nitrogen flux and longitudinal variability in a river-reservoir system	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						dams; flood; flux; high-frequency spatial sampling; nitrogen; storm	WATER-QUALITY; SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY; DENITRIFICATION; SEDIMENT; REMOVAL; DAMS; LAKE	Sustainable management of the nitrogen (N) cycle remains a considerable global challenge that has major implications for aquatic ecosystems. Dams play a critical yet often neglected role in addressing this challenge as they increase hydraulic residence time and denitrification potential. However, during storm events when the majority of N loading occurs, less is known about the effects dams have on N fate and transport processes. Here, we examined the flux of N species and phosphorus (P) and longitudinal profiles of nitrate (NO3-) along a sixth-order river-reservoir system at baseflow and across the falling limb of a multiday, 1-year storm hydrograph. During the storm event, the reservoir reduced total NO3- flux by 19.1% and P flux by 12.7%. On the contrary, ammonium (NH4+) fluxes were 200% higher downstream of the dam in comparison with fluxes into the reservoir, indicating that there was a substantial net export of NH4+ from the reservoir during the storm event. Longitudinally along the river to reservoir transition, a breakpoint of statistical significance was identified, highlighting the sharp contrast between NO3- concentrations within the river and reservoir. Results suggest that frequent storm events such as the one presented here can greatly alter N removal processes in river-reservoir systems. Overall, this study highlights the need to better understand the role that storm events play in river-reservoir N cycling dynamics.

NP-1 reach is a bypassed section with near natural flow conditions, whereas the downstream reach NP-2 is subjected to daily pulsed flow discharge (i.e., hydropeaking) from an upstream hydropower station. Significant differences in home range size (95% kernel estimates) and seasonal movement pattern between study reaches were found. Mean home range size was (mu +/- SE) 112.1 +/- 11.5 m in the bypassed reach NP-1 and increased significantly in the hydropeaking reach NP-2 up to 237.9 +/- 37.2 m. There was a large individual variability in fish home range size within reaches. Most of the seasonal differences in fish movement among reaches were associated with the spawning season. Pulsed discharge events in NP-2 during daytime in summer (lasting about 3 hr and increasing water flow from 1 to 20 m(3)/s) did not cause significant displacements in either upstream or downstream direction during the duration of the event. Our results highlight the importance of habitat connectivity in hydropeaking streams due to the need of brown trout to move large distances among complementary habitats, necessary to complete their life cycle, compared with unregulated or more stable streams.

Modelling changes in trout habitat following stream restoration	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						aquatic habitat; brown trout; foraging positions; hydrodynamic modelling; River2D; stream restoration; weighted usable area	BROWN TROUT; RIVER RESTORATION; ATLANTIC SALMON; CLASSIFICATION; PERSPECTIVE; MORPHOLOGY; SUCCESS; FISHES; REACH; TIME	Stream restoration was implemented on the Upper Arkansas River near Leadville, Colorado, to improve brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations. Metals pollution and channel disturbance associated with historic mining, land use, and water development degraded aquatic and riparian habitat. Changes in instream habitat quality following restoration were investigated with a before-after-control-impact study design. Baseline, as-built, and effectiveness surveys were conducted in 2013, 2014, and 2016, respectively. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling with River2D was used to estimate weighted usable area (WUA) for adult, juvenile, fry, and spawning brown trout across a range of flows. WUA was calculated from habitat suitability curves for velocity, depth, and channel substrate. Foraging positions (FP) and habitat heterogeneity were also evaluated as indices of habitat quality. All results were analysed with analysis of variance. At impact sites, WUA increased by 12.2% from 2013 to 2014 but decreased by 10.2% from 2014 to 2016, whereas FP increased by 24.8% from 2013 to 2014 but decreased by 26.1% from 2014 to 2016. Spawning habitat increased 53.3% from 2014 to 2016 at impact sites. The 15.4% increase in depth variability from 2013 to 2016 indicates that habitat heterogeneity was enhanced at impact sites. No changes in WUA, FP, or habitat heterogeneity were observed at control sites. Although changes in WUA and FP suggest that initial habitat improvements were not sustained, increased spawning habitat and depth heterogeneity suggest otherwise. Our results highlight the value of monitoring strategies that utilize multiple lines of evidence to evaluate restoration effectiveness, inform adaptive management, and improve restoration practices.

Most studies regarding their ecological impacts are based on large dams and provide little information about the far more abundant effects of small hydropower dams. Our aim was to characterize the ecological effects of a small hydropower dam and run-of-the-river reservoir on the structure of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in the Pandeiros River located in the neotropical savanna of Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in sites directly affected by the dam and reservoir would show a different taxonomic structure compared with those in free-flowing sites. We expected to find sensitive native species associated with the free-flowing sites, whereas resistant and non-native invasive taxa were expected in impounded sites. We also explored associations between the presence of native and non-native invasive taxa to each habitat type. We found that the structure of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages was significantly different between free-flowing and impounded sites. Also, we found that the dam and reservoir facilitated colonization of non-native invasive species (Corbicula fluminea and Melanoides tuberculata) because only in those sites they were found in high abundance, in contrast to the free-flowing sites. Although the environmental conditions imposed by the impoundment altered the structure of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, the effects were limited to sites closest to the dam. Our results highlight the necessity of understanding physical habitat changes caused by the presence and management of run-of-the-river dams and reservoirs.

Soil, individual ramets of P. lobata and S. angulatus plants were sampled monthly from quadrats set on homogenous stands from two riparian sites along Tama River, Japan for over a year. Soil nutrients, above-ground (AGB) and below-ground biomass (BGB), tissue nutrient, and nonstructural carbohydrate contents were estimated, and resource allocations to different organs were calculated. Flooding frequency directly affected the substrate characteristics of the sites; the frequently flooded site had coarser particle and less nutrient content. There were significant differences between the BGB and the AGB of both P. lobata and S. angulatus between the sites. However, the BGB:AGB ratio of these species were statistically similar regardless of the substrate conditions. Although the biomass of S. angulatus were much reduced in coarse habitat, the total amount of nutrient uptake by P. lobata was not affected by habitat the condition. Concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and starch in root tissues of S. angulatus were less in frequently inundated soil. The results of this study suggest that inundation frequency directly affects the substrate condition of a riverbank habitat, which in turn affects plant growth, and invasive plant species growing in such habitat respond differently to substrate condition in terms of growth and nutrient uptake.

A comparison of riparian vegetation sampling methods along a large, regulated river	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						data variability; line-point intercept; long-term monitoring; ocular quadrat estimates; riparian vegetation; species richness; vegetation sampling methods	FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; COLORADO RIVER; GRAND-CANYON; RESTORATION; COMMUNITIES; RICHNESS; ARIZONA; STREAMS; PLANTS	Monitoring riparian vegetation cover and species richness is an important component of assessing change and understanding ecosystem processes. Vegetation sampling methods determined to be the best option in other ecosystems (e.g., desert grasslands and arctic tundra) may not be the best option in multilayered, species rich, heterogeneous riparian vegetation. This study examines the strengths and weaknesses of two common vegetation sampling methods, line-point intercept and ocular quadrat estimates. Permutational analysis of variance analyses indicate that cover estimates among observers did not differ significantly for either line-point intercept or ocular quadrat estimates. Line-point intercept cover estimates resulted in lower coefficient of variation among observers than ocular quadrat estimates, but the ocular quadrat estimates recorded significantly more species. Line-point estimates of cover were generally larger than ocular quadrat estimates. Ocular quadrat estimates are appropriate when assessment of richness is important, in areas with heterogeneous geomorphology and hydrology where fine-scale measurements are most useful, and in areas where continuous sampling transects are impracticable. Line-point intercept estimates are useful when minimum variation among observers is necessary, continuous transects are logical and practicable for the sampling area, woody cover does not present a logistical complication, and species richness is not a priority.

Therefore, to accurately evaluate the impact of air pollution on human health, the concomitant behaviors of various air pollutants should be investigated. In this study, the peculiarities of the temporal co-existence of allergenic pollen (alder, birch, grass, and mugwort), fungal spores (Alternaria and Cladosporium), and hazardous air pollutants (ground-level ozone and particulate matter, PK10) collected in Poznan (western Poland) from 2005 to 2016 were analyzed with particular attention to their relation with air temperature. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the daily concentrations of certain airborne particles (pollen, fungal spores, and ozone) significantly increased on days with high mean temperatures. However, high temperatures occurring during earlier stages of development for grass and mugwort, prior to pollen release, decreased the overall quantity of pollen produced and released during the season. Furthermore, the daily concentration of PK10 decreased with increasing temperature. As a result, the co-exposure of alder pollen and PK10 was limited to a narrow temperature range (4-10 degrees C) and mainly recorded during February and March. In most cases, a characteristic pattern was observed: The co-occurrence of air pollutants increased with the temperature. When birch and grass pollen co-occurred with other air pollutants, the temperature was significantly higher (by 2.0 to 8.0 degrees C) than when only pollen grains were observed. In general, high temperatures favored the simultaneous occurrence of pollen grains, fungal spores, and ozone, which was most pronounced during hot days in June and August. Such conditions should therefore be considered the most hazardous for people suffering from allergic airway diseases.

These substances are toxic to aquatic biota and can cause cell rupture. These harmful effects make the treatment of tannery wastewater difficult. Phytoplankton species are community components that are rarely considered in the biodegradation of organic compounds. However, in association with bacteria, these organisms can improve the biodegradation of pollutants by different mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of non-axenic cultures of Chlorella vulgaris containing Lactobacillus casei and Synechococcus sp. containing Rhizobium rosettiformans and Sphingomonas koreensis to biodegrade tannic acid (TA). Cultures in BG-11 medium containing TA (250mgL(-1)) were incubated under a photoperiod or in the dark and monitored for 96h. The cultures with added TA grew more than the control cultures under both the photoperiod and dark conditions. A reduction in the TA concentration and the TA metabolite gallic acid was observed under both conditions. Ellagic acid was identified and demonstrated resistance to biodegradation under the evaluated conditions, and neither of the other metabolites was detected. BG-11 culture medium is poor in organic material; therefore, microalgae and cyanobacteria contribute to bacterial metabolism. Under experimental conditions, phytoplankton species seem to contribute to the biodegradation of tannin residues, and in natural environments, they may aid in the bioremediation of sites contaminated by these pollutants.

Several continental-wide surges in poaching have occurred since the latter half of the twentieth century, and the latest surge occurred from 2007 to 2012. The behavioral responses of elephants to poaching risk has not been studied widely because of a lack of high-resolution movement data collected simultaneously with verified causes of mortality. We managed to collate 2 such datasets from 2004 to 2013. We studied the spatial-temporal changes in movement behavior of 11 elephants in their core areas. Past studies have focused on elephant movement along corridors. We tested for the effect of poaching risk on their path straightness (i.e., tortuosity) while controlling for other environmental and human activities in the landscape using a set of generalized linear mixed models. To test for temporal variation of tortuosity, we used a time-series linear model. Elephants turned less frequently while they were in poaching locations and at times with a high level of poaching activity, even though their speed did not change. The variation of tortuosity is a good indicator of differences in poaching risk as perceived by the elephants, which could complement patrol-based anti-poaching efforts by wildlife managers, especially in remote, inaccessible landscapes.

Simulated performance of multi-year harvest regulation cycles for wild turkeys	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision cycles; harvest management; harvest models; Meleagris gallopavo; population management; sustainable harvest; turkey hunting	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; STRATEGIES; WATERFOWL; VIRGINIA; INDEXES; RATES	Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) are a prolific species and valuable game animal throughout the United States. Stochastic simulations are commonly used to inform harvest management, and we used simulation to test performance of fall harvest management that included 1-, 3-, and 5-year cycles of population assessment and updating of harvest targets, respectively. To assess robustness of our conclusions, we replicated analyses across 18 combinations of model parameters that included population productivity (3 levels), sex-specific vulnerability to fall harvest (3 levels), and magnitude of spring harvest (2 levels). Performance of multi-year cycles, measured using abundance of males and annual harvest, depended on the context of model parameters that interacted to determine responses of populations to harvest. One- and 3-year cycles had similar performance so long as female harvests were less than or equal to male harvests. However, when harvest of females was greater than males, or when 5-year regulation cycles were implemented, there was greater risk due to nonlinear population responses to increased harvest. For example, nonlinearity resulted in thresholds where declines to abundance and harvest could occur with small increases to harvest rates, and thus the sustainability of fall harvests was less robust for multi-year cycles with time-lagged assessment and decision making. Moreover, the harvest rate resulting in threshold responses depended on model parameters and often occurred within the range of harvest rates recommended by earlier modeling studies (7-15%). Our results imply that multi-year cycles can be a viable approach to harvest management. Monitoring that provides information on sex-specific harvest is recommended, however, to determine if nonlinear population responses should be anticipated. Ideally, information on population-specific vital rates would also be available to allow managers to avoid harvest rates near thresholds that are expected to result in population declines.

Managing for multiple species: greater sage-grouse and sagebrush songbirds	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						biodiversity; Brewer's sparrow; correlation; count-based regression; greater sage-grouse; green-tailed towhee; sage thrasher; sagebrush sparrow; umbrella	HABITAT SELECTION; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; BIRDS; MANAGEMENT; REMOVAL; MODELS; WINTER; SCALE	Human activity has altered 33-50% of Earth's surface, including temperate grasslands and sagebrush rangelands, resulting in a loss of biodiversity. By promoting habitat for sensitive or wide-ranging species, less exigent species may be protected in an umbrella effect. The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) has been proposed as an umbrella for other sagebrush-obligate species because it has an extensive range that overlaps with many other species, it is sensitive to anthropogenic activity, it requires resources over large landscapes, and its habitat needs are known. The efficacy of the umbrella concept, however, is often assumed and rarely tested. Therefore, we surveyed sage-grouse pellet occurrence and sagebrush-associated songbird abundance in northwest Colorado, USA, to determine the amount of habitat overlap between sage-grouse and 4 songbirds (Brewer's sparrow [Spizella breweri], sage thrasher [Oreoscoptes montanus], sagebrush sparrow [Artemisiospiza nevadensis]), and green-tailed towhee [Pipilo chlorurus]). During May and June 2013-2015, we conducted standard point count breeding surveys for songbirds and counted sage-grouse pellets within 300 10-m radius plots. We modeled songbird abundance and sage-grouse pellet occurrence with multi-scaled environmental features, such as sagebrush cover and bare ground. To evaluate sage-grouse as an umbrella for sagebrush-associated passerines, we determined the correlation between probability of sage-grouse pellet occurrence and model-predicted songbird densities per sampling plot. We then classified the sage-grouse probability of occurrence as high (probability >0.5) and low (probability <= 0.5) and mapped model-predicted surfaces for each species in our study area. We determined average songbird density in areas of high and low probability of sage-grouse occurrence. Sagebrush cover at intermediate scales was an important predictor for all species, and ground cover was important for all species except sage thrashers. Areas with a higher probability of sage-grouse occurrence also contained higher densities of Brewer's sparrows, green-tailed towhees, and sage thrashers, but predicted sagebrush sparrow densities were lower in these areas. In northwest Colorado, sage-grouse may be an effective umbrella for Brewer's sparrows, green-tailed towhees, and sage thrashers, but sage-grouse habitat does not appear to capture areas that support high sagebrush sparrow densities. A multi-species focus may be the best management and conservation strategy for several species of concern, especially those with conflicting habitat requirements.

Characterizing watercraft-related mortality of sea turtles in florida	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Florida; lifestage; mortality; sea turtles; strandings; vessel-strike injury	GREEN TURTLES; CARETTA-CARETTA; CHELONIA-MYDAS; BOAT STRIKES; RISK; STRANDINGS; ATLANTIC; PATTERNS; SPEED; MANAGEMENT	Mortality from being struck by a motorized watercraft is considerable for many aquatic vertebrates around the world, including sea turtles. We studied stranded (i.e., dead, sick, or injured) sea turtles found in Florida, USA, during 1986-2014 and identified those with sharp force or blunt force injuries indicative of a vessel strike. About a third of stranded loggerheads (Caretta caretta), green turtles (Chelonia mydas), and leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea) had a vessel-strike injury (VSI). The frequency of this injury was lower but still substantial for stranded Kemp's ridleys (Lepidochelys kempii; 26.1%) and hawksbills (Eretmochelys imbricata; 14.8%). Over the study period, the annual number of stranded loggerheads, green turtles, and Kemp's ridleys with a VSI increased as did the annual number of vessels registered in Florida. Eighty-one percent of the stranded turtles with a VSI were found in the southern half of Florida and 66% of those were found along the southeast coast. By coastal county, the proportion of stranded sea turtles with a VSI was positively related to the mean annual number of registered vessels. The percentage occurrence of a VSI was highest for adult loggerheads, green turtles, and leatherbacks, and reproductively active individuals appeared to be particularly vulnerable to these injuries. We conducted necropsies on 194 stranded sea turtles with a VSI and concluded that this injury was the cause of death or the probable cause of death in >= 92.8% of these cases. During 2000-2014, we estimate that the mean annual numbers of stranded sea turtles that died from a VSI were 142-229 loggerheads, 101-162 green turtles, 16-32 Kemp's ridleys, 4-6 leatherbacks, and 2-4 hawksbills. Considering that only about 10-20% of sea turtles that died likely washed ashore, the overall annual mortality may have been 5-10 times greater than that represented by strandings. Most of the significant clusters of stranded sea turtles with a VSI occurred at inlets or passes and the probability that a stranded sea turtle had a VSI decreased with increasing distance from inlets or passes, navigable waterways, and marinas. We suggest focusing initial management efforts on reducing watercraft-related mortality for all sea turtle species around 8 inlets in southeast Florida, reproductively active loggerheads and green turtles along the coast of southeast Florida, and Kemp's ridleys and adult male loggerheads at passes along the coast of southwest Florida.

Survival and cause-specific mortality of moose calves in northeastern minnesota	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Alces alces; calves; Canis lupus; cause-specific mortality; GPS collars; moose; neonates; predation; survival	WHITE-TAILED DEER; CAPTURE-INDUCED ABANDONMENT; CALF MORTALITY; BIRTH CHARACTERISTICS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; SITE SELECTION; PARTURITION; PREDATION; HABITAT	Ungulate reproductive success (calf production and survival) influences population performance. The moose (Alces alces) population in northeastern Minnesota, USA, has declined 65% from 2006 to 2018 but has begun to stabilize. Because causes of this decline were largely unknown, we investigated production, survival, and cause-specific mortality of calves of the global positioning system (GPS)-collared females in this population. In 2013 and 2014, we GPS-collared 74 neonates and monitored them for survival. In 2015 and 2016, we monitored 50 and 35 calving females for signs of neonatal mortality using changes in adult female velocities and assessed seasonal calf survival by aerial surveys. In 2013 and 2014 (pooled), survival to 9 months was 0.34 (95% CI = 0.23-0.52) for collared calves, and in 2015 and 2016 (pooled) survival was 0.35 (95% CI = 0.26-0.48) for uncollared calves. Mortality in all 4 years was high during the first 50 days of life. In 2013 and 2014 (pooled), calving sites were relatively safe for collared neonates; predator-kills occurred a median 17.0 days after departure and a median 1,142 m from calving sites. Predation was the leading cause of death of collared calves (84% of mortalities), with wolves (Canis lupus) accounting for 77% of these. Other forms of mortality for collared and uncollared calves included drowning, infection, vehicle collision, and natural abandonment. We documented higher wolf predation than other recent studies with similar predator communities. Identifying specific causes of calf mortality and understanding their relations to various landscape characteristics and other extrinsic factors should yield insight into mechanisms contributing to the declining moose population in northeastern Minnesota and serve as a basis for ecologically sound management responses.

Long-billed curlew nest site selection and success in the intermountain west	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						breeding; Idaho; Intermountain West; long-billed curlew; nest site selection; nest success; Numenius americanus; SamplePoint; Wyoming	NUMENIUS-AMERICANUS; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; PREDATION; GRASSLAND; MODEL; VEGETATION; ABUNDANCE; SURVIVAL; ECOLOGY; WADER	Grassland birds have experienced steeper population declines between 1966 and 2015 than any other bird group on the North American continent, and migratory grassland birds may face threats in all stages of their annual cycle. The grassland-associated long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus) is experiencing population declines in regional and local portions of their North American breeding range. The nesting period is an important portion of the annual cycle when curlews may face demographic rate limitations from a suite of threats including predators and anthropogenic disturbance. We compared nest sites to random sites within breeding territories to examine nest site selection, and modeled correlates of nesting success for 128 curlew nests at 5 Intermountain West sites. Nest sites were 6 times more likely than random sites to be situated adjacent to existing cowpies. Additionally, curlews selected nest sites with shorter vegetation, and less bare ground, grass, and shrub cover than at random sites within their territories. Nest success varied widely among sites and ranged from 12% to 40% in a season with a mean of 27% for all nests during the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Higher nest success probability was associated with higher curlew densities in the area, greater percent cover of conspicuous objects (cowpies, rocks) near the nest, and higher densities of black-billed magpies (Pica hudsonia) and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) at the site. We also found increased probability of nesting success with increased distance from a nest to the nearest potential perch in that territory. Given the central role of working lands to curlews in much of the Intermountain West, understanding limitations to nesting success in these diverse landscapes is necessary to guide adaptive management strategies in increasingly human-modified habitats. We suggest some grazing and irrigation practices already provide suitable nesting conditions for curlews, and others may require only minor temporal shifts to improve compatibility.

Northern bobwhite breeding season habitat selection in fire-maintained pine woodland	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						basal area; breeding season; Colinus virginianus; fire frequency; habitat selection; northern bobwhite; prescribed fire; Sandhills region	NEST-SITE SELECTION; PRESCRIBED FIRE; GROWING-SEASON; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; ECOSYSTEM; GEORGIA; FOREST	Despite the acknowledged importance of prescribed fire in creating northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) breeding cover, little research has investigated bobwhite breeding season habitat selection relative to time since fire. In 2016 and 2017, we monitored radio-tagged bobwhite on a 17,000-ha portion of a military installation managed with frequent (every similar to 3 years) prescribed fires, applied during the growing and dormant seasons. We monitored bobwhite to determine which vegetation characteristics associated with prescribed burning were important to bobwhite breeding season habitat selection at the microsite (i.e., telemetry location compared to nearby random location) and the macrosite scale (i.e., the burn-unit containing the location compared to study area availability). During 2 breeding seasons, we collected 2,315 bobwhite locations and compared percent cover of vegetation, days since burn, basal area, and distance to key landscape features (e.g., stream, wildlife opening) at a subset of microsite locations (301 locations during 2016 and 890 locations during 2017) to paired random locations. At the microsite scale, bobwhite selected lower basal area of hardwoods, greater woody understory cover, greater other (not wiregrass [Aristida stricta]) grass cover, and greater forb cover than at random points. At the macrosite scale, bobwhite selected units with <4.6 m(2)/ha basal area (combined hardwoods and pines) in 2016 and units with <9.2 m(2)/ha basal area in 2017. At the macrosite scale, bobwhite selected for areas burned in the dormant season of the same year, avoided areas burned in the growing season of the same year, and used other times since last burn categories proportionate to their availability. The selection for a low basal area at both scales indicates prescribed fire effects would be limited by shading from dense overstory, and the shrubs, grasses, and forbs that provide essential cover for bobwhite during the breeding season will not develop. In lower productivity soil regions similar to our study area, we advise that thinning operations set target basal areas below 10 m(2)/ha to create and maintain breeding season habitat for northern bobwhite.

Sheoak woodlands: a newly identified habitat for western ringtail possums	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						conservation; habitat use; occupancy modeling; Pseudocheirus occidentalis; threatened species; Western Australia; western ringtail possum	JARRAH FOREST; CONSERVATION; EXTINCTION; CLIMATE; RISK	Although critically endangered western ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus occidentalis) have been recorded from a variety of vegetation types in southwestern Australia, the extent to which many of these vegetation types are occupied by the species remains unknown. We conducted spotlight surveys for western ringtail possums between March and April 2018 in Albany, southwestern Australia, to determine the species' occupancy in 2 vegetation types. Using occupancy models, we demonstrated that sheoak (Allocasuarina fraseriana) woodlands, previously unrecognized as providing western ringtail possum habitat, support the species, although the median probability of their occupancy was lower than in marri (Corymbia calophylla) and eucalypt (Eucalyptus marginata and E. staeri) woodlands. Use of trees and other habitat components by western ringtail possums varied within and between vegetation types. Sheoak woodlands are likely critical for western ringtail possums and given the apparent flexibility in vegetation types used by the species, investigation of the potential value of other vegetation types for this species has conservation merit.

Yet, few white-tailed deer fawn survival studies have occurred in areas with 4 predator species or have considered concurrent densities of deer and predator species. We monitored survival and cause-specific mortality from birth to 6 months for 100 neonatal fawns during 2013-2015 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, while simultaneously estimating population densities of deer, American black bear (Ursus americanus), coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and gray wolf (Canis lupus). We estimated fawn predation risk in response to sex, birth mass, and date of birth. Six-month fawn survival pooled among years was 36%, and fawn mortality risk was not related to birth mass, date of birth, or sex. Estimated mean annual deer and predator densities were 334 fawns/100 km(2), 25.9 black bear/100 km(2), 23.8 coyotes/100 km(2), 3.8 bobcat/100 km(2), and 2.8 wolves/100 km(2). Despite lower estimated per-individual kill rates, coyotes and black bears were the leading sources of fawn mortality because they had greater densities relative to bobcats and wolves. Our results indicate that the presence of more predator species in a system is not entirely additive in its effect on fawn survival.

There are relatively few assessments of benthic size spectra, and most are based on summer samples alone. Processes influencing size spectra, such as recruitment and predation pressure, vary seasonally, and understanding this variation is necessary to interpret patterns in time or space. Here we compare summer and winter biomass size spectra in the central basin of Kongsfjorden (west Spitsbergen). We recorded seasonal changes in the quality of organic matter available to the benthos, indicated by higher chloroplastic pigments concentrations in surface sediments in summer, as well as in differences in total abundance and biomass of both macrofauna and meiofauna. No significant seasonal differences were documented by multiple regression models for the normalized biomass and size classes. The slope of a linear relationship between normalized biomass and size classes was -0.54 +/- 0.02 indicating a productive system, compared to ecosystems like estuaries. Summer-winter invariability of size spectra suggests that benthic community functioning in this Arctic fjordic system is relatively independent from the seasonality in the supply of organic matter produced in water column.

Tourism and stress hormone measures in Gentoo Penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Stress; Pygoscelis papua; IAATO; Tourism; Visitor guidelines	LONG-LIVED BIRD; PYGOSCELIS-PAPUA; CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS; MAGELLANIC PENGUINS; POPULATION TRENDS; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; BREEDING SUCCESS; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; AREAS	The impacts of tourism on wildlife have long been a concern in areas where ecotourism is a major industry. The issue is especially pressing in Antarctica, which has a rapidly growing tourism industry largely concentrated around penguin colonies on the Antarctic Peninsula. Guidelines developed by both the Committee for Environmental Protection and the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators include measures to minimize wildlife impacts. In this study, we examined the relationship between physiologic stress in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and tourism. Corticosterone is an adrenal glucocorticoid that has been shown in previous studies to increase in response to stressors such as low food availability, environmental conditions, as well as human visitation and proximity. Fecal glucocorticoids (FGM; primarily corticosterone and metabolites) were measured in Gentoo Penguin guano collected at 19 breeding colonies (n=108, 3-10 samples per site) on the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, representing a wide range of tourism visitation. We found a large degree of variation in FGM concentrations, and no relationship between FGM concentrations and number of tourists landed at that site. These results suggest that current tourism management guidelines on the Antarctic Peninsula are effective at preventing increased stress in Gentoo Penguins as measured by hormonal markers, and demonstrate the use of guano as a non-invasive, low-impact methodology for monitoring Gentoo Penguin stress.

At the same time, changing nutrient dynamics can have similarly strong and potentially interacting effects. To investigate the response of the taxonomic and trophic structure of planktonic and ice-associated communities to varying sea-ice properties and nutrient concentrations, we analysed four different communities sampled in the Eurasian Basin in summer 2012: (1) protists and (2) metazoans from the under-ice habitat, and (3) protists and (4) metazoans from the epipelagic habitat. The taxonomic composition of protist communities was characterised with 18S meta-barcoding. The taxonomic composition of metazoan communities was determined based on morphology. The analysis of environmental parameters identified (i) a shelf-influenced' regime with melting sea ice, high-silicate concentrations and low NOx (nitrate+nitrite) concentrations; (ii) a Polar' regime with low silicate concentrations and low NOx concentrations; and (iii) an Atlantic' regime with low silicate concentrations and high NOx concentrations. Multivariate analyses of combined bio-environmental datasets showed that taxonomic community structure primarily responded to the variability of sea-ice properties and hydrography across all four communities. Trophic community structure, however, responded significantly to NOx concentrations. In three of the four communities, the most heterotrophic trophic group significantly dominated in the NOx-poor shelf-influenced and Polar regimes compared to the NOx-rich Atlantic regime. The more heterotrophic, NOx-poor regimes were associated with lower productivity and carbon export than the NOx-rich Atlantic regime. For modelling future Arctic ecosystems, it is important to consider that taxonomic diversity can respond to different drivers than trophic diversity.

Variability in the sea-ice conditions strongly influence the survival and reproduction of animals that are synchronized with the seasonality of sea ice. Although the linkages between Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and sea-ice conditions are well established, the spatial and temporal scales at which sea ice affects individuals and populations are poorly known. Using 23years of penguin breeding success and remote-sensing data of sea ice, we investigate the spatial and temporal scales at which sea-ice changes best explain variations in the reproductive success of Adelie penguins at Pointe Geologie, East Antarctica. The best spatial scale encompassed all foraging areas exploited and all the sea-ice conditions encountered by penguins over a breeding season. There was a consistent influence of sea-ice concentration during the guard stage on the overall breeding success. We demonstrate the importance of considering sea ice at a fine temporal scale rather than using an average value over the breeding season to best explain reproductive success in Adelie penguins.

Lake Victoria itself is home to around 500 fish species, most of which are haplochromine cichlids. The LVB is increasingly under threat from unsustainable land conversion and the intensification of agriculture. High population growth is driving the expansion of agriculture, urbanization, and freshwater abstractions, which have a profound impact on freshwater biodiversity. In addition, increased demand for agricultural crops from domestic and international markets are likely to lead to larger agricultural operations, further threatening freshwater biodiversity. This study explores these potential future impacts on the biodiversity found in freshwater rivers in the LVB as a result of projected future changes in land use. A newly developed database of land-use impacts on freshwater biodiversity is introduced, with a focus on ecological community composition data from freshwater habitats under human pressures. Impacts on freshwater biodiversity are then projected under four different scenarios of land-use change. Results show that land use has a significant impact on freshwater biodiversity. Freshwater biodiversity is projected to be at most risk in sub-basins in the Tanzanian, Rwandan, and Burundian part of the LVB, such as the Kagera and Magoga/Isonga sub-basins. Local species richness levels are particularly affected in the Magoga/Isonga sub-basin in Tanzania, with an average loss of 10.8% across all scenarios. Model results show the potential to identify broad spatial patterns of likely threats and pressures on freshwater ecosystems under different socio-economic futures. The analysis of these patterns, where they are consistent and where they differ, can support the production of policy that strives to find the optimal balance between development and conservation in an uncertain future.

In this study, the relationships between aquatic macrophytes and gradients of environmental factors were explored using an extensive set of data collected from 13 lakes of the Greek mainland that are part of the European network Natura 2000. The main objectives were to assess the importance of key abiotic predictors and estimate possible environmental thresholds of macrophyte richness, diversity, and abundance using boosted regression trees (BRTs), as well as to explore further the distribution of dominant macrophyte taxa along environmental gradients. The results reveal conductivity as a significant predictor of macrophyte total cover and diversity. In addition, orthophosphate and nitrate nitrogen appear to play an important role for several macrophyte species and assemblages, reflecting a major effect of eutrophication on the distribution of taxa. The majority of macrophyte assemblages were found in waters characterized by high nutrient content, although their distribution extends along a wide range of phosphorus and nitrogen concentration. In contrast, charophyte species show the optimum of their distribution in clear, oligotrophic waters. This integrated study can be used for ranking environmental factors that influence macrophyte distribution in the lakes of Greece and for identifying taxa or macrophyte assemblages that can be used as effective indicators of changes in the abiotic environment. In addition, the results can contribute to the conservation of freshwater habitats in the protected areas studied. In particular, measures that aim to improve water quality are expected also to restore oligotrophic habitats that are characterized by benthic charophyte vegetation. Overall, the links between macrophyte assemblages and abiotic factors are critically important in improving freshwater biodiversity management and environmental policies in east Mediterranean lakes.

While the effects of nonlinear climate change are often delayed or dampened by internal ecosystem dynamics, recent warming events in the Arctic have driven rapid environmental response, raising questions of how terrestrial and freshwater systems in this region may shift in response to abrupt climate change. We quantified environmental responses to recent abrupt climate change in West Greenland using long-term monitoring and paleoecological reconstructions. Using >40 years of weather data, we found that after 1994, mean June air temperatures shifted 2.2 degrees C higher and mean winter precipitation doubled from 21 to 40 mm; since 2006, mean July air temperatures shifted 1.1 degrees C higher. Nonlinear environmental responses occurred with or shortly after these abrupt climate shifts, including increasing ice sheet discharge, increasing dust, advancing plant phenology, and in lakes, earlier ice out and greater diversity of algal functional traits. Our analyses reveal rapid environmental responses to nonlinear climate shifts, underscoring the highly responsive nature of Arctic ecosystems to abrupt transitions.

The effect of copper nanoparticles on olfaction in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO			English	Article							WILD YELLOW PERCH; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; EXPOSURE; CADMIUM; TOXICITY; SULFATE; METALLOTHIONEIN; IMPAIRMENT; EXPRESSION; BEHAVIOR	Although olfactory toxicity of copper (particularly Cu2+) in fish has drawn considerable research attention, the impact of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) on the olfactory system is not well characterized. The main objective of this study was to investigate the time-dependent effects of CuNPs and Cu2+ on olfactory sensitivity and olfactory-mediated behaviours of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). To establish olfactory-impairment thresholds, 24 h inhibitory concentration (IC) curves, induced by CuNPs or Cu2+ on ciliated and microvillous olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) were determined using electro-olfactography (EOG). The results indicated ciliated cells are more sensitive to both CuNPs and Cu2+ exposure relative to microvillous OSNs. Thus, the concentration of contaminants that induced 50% inhibition in ciliated OSNs (24 h-IC50; 322 and 7 mu g L-1 for CuNPs and Cu2+, respectively) were selected as equi-toxic concentrations. Fish were exposed to 24 h-IC50 concentrations for 24 h or 96 h, and their olfactory sensitivity was studied using EOG and a behavioural assay. Results of EOG demonstrated a gradual, time-dependent increase in the inhibitory effect of CuNPs, whereas fish under Cu2+ exposure displayed a partial recovery at 96 h, as compared to the 24 h time point. Fish behavioural results followed a similar pattern as in neurophysiological experiments. Overall, exposure to CuNPs resulted in a different time-dependent toxicity pattern on the fish olfactory system than Cu2+ after exposure at equi-toxic concentrations. Our data suggest that CuNPs and Cu2+ affected chemosensory function and behaviour differently in rainbow trout.

We predicted that carbon stored in live aboveground biomass, aboveground necromass, and soil components of forests on the eastern flank of the Colombian Andes would change with elevation along this gradient extending from 750 to 2,800 m above sea level. The rationale was that the corresponding change in temperature (14-26 degrees C) would influence tree growth and decomposition of organic matter. To address this hypothesis, we examined the carbon stored in these three components using data from 20 0.25-ha plots located along this elevational gradient. The mean total carbon stock found in the study region was 241.3 +/- 37.5 Mg C/ha. Aboveground carbon stocks decreased with elevation (p = 0.001), as did necromass carbon stocks (p = 0.016). Although soil organic carbon stocks did not differ significantly along the gradient (p = 0.153), they contributed proportionately more at higher than at lower elevations, counterbalancing the opposite trends in aboveground carbon and necromass carbon stocks. As such, total carbon stocks did not vary significantly along the elevational gradient (p = 0.576).

Low modularity and specialization in a commensalistic epiphyte-phorophyte network in a tropical cloud forest	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						Atlantic forest; facilitation; nestedness; plant-plant interaction; vertical stratification	PLANT FACILITATION NETWORKS; VASCULAR EPIPHYTES; RAIN-FOREST; VERTICAL STRATIFICATION; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; POLLINATION; NESTEDNESS; ORCHIDS; SYSTEMS	Species interactions can shape the structure of natural communities. Such sets of interactions have been described as complex ecological networks, an example of which is the commensal network formed by epiphyte-phorophyte interactions. Vascular epiphytes germinate and grow on phorophytes (support trees), assuming a horizontal distribution (among the phorophyte species) and a vertical distribution (from the base of the tree trunk to the crown of phorophytes, i.e., through ecological zones). Here, we investigated the organization of these structural dimensions of the epiphyte-phorophyte network in a Brazilian tropical montane cloud forest. The analyzed network, comprising 66 epiphyte species and 22 phorophyte species, exhibited a nested structure with a low degree of specialization, a typical pattern for epiphyte-phorophyte networks in forests. The network was slightly modular, with 65% of the species common to three modules, and had vertical structure corresponding to the vertical organization of the phorophytes. The size (diameter at breast height) of phorophyte individuals influenced the network structure, possibly due to the increase in habitat area, the time available for colonization by epiphytes, and a greater number of microenvironments. We found that the distribution of the epiphyte species differed between the phorophyte ecological zones, with greater richness in the lower portions and greater abundance in the upper portions of the phorophytes. The results provide relevant guidance for future research on the characteristics and the vertical and horizontal organization of vascular epiphyte and phorophyte networks. in Portuguese is available with online material.

It is not well known, however, if such influence is constant across years. Caterpillars have been reported to be particularly susceptible to changes in plant community composition across forest succession, as most species are specialists and rely on the presence of their hosts. Nevertheless, in the case of tropical dry forests, plant species have less defined successional boundaries than tropical wet forests, and hence herbivore communities should be able to persist across different successional stages. To test this prediction, caterpillar communities were surveyed during eight consecutive years in a tropical dry forest in four replicated successional stages in Chamela, Jalisco and Mexico. Lepidopteran species richness and diversity were equivalent in mature forests and early successional stages, but a distinctive caterpillar community was found for the recently abandoned pastures. Species composition tended to converge among all four successional stages during the span of eight years. Overall, our results highlight the importance of both primary and secondary forest for the conservation of caterpillar biodiversity at a landscape level. We also highlight the relevance of long-term studies when assessing the influence of forest succession to account for across year variation in species interactions and climatic factors. in French is available with online material.

Promiscuous pollinators-Evidence from an Afromontane sunbird-plant pollen transport network	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						flower visitation; generalist pollinators; Ngel Nyaki; Nigeria; pollination mutualism; specialization	SPECIALIZATION; BIRD; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	Sunbirds play a major role in the pollination of Old World nectivorous plants. However, with the exception of the Cape Floristic Region there is a major knowledge gap around African nectivore interaction networks-a stark contrast from the abundance of neotropical hummingbird-plant networks. Here, we describe a sunbird pollen transfer network (PTN) which we use in conjunction with a sunbird flower visitation network (FVN) to explore levels of sunbird specialization within an Afromontane forest habitat. Both networks were generalized compared with similar-sized hummingbird networks, reflecting the wide range of flower types visited, the generalist diet, and bill characteristics of sunbirds. Three sunbird species from the genus Cinnyris accounted for 85% of flower visits and 77% of all pollen transported. Of the 17 plant species across both networks, 15 are predominantly pollinated by insects while Anthonotha noldeae (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) and Globimetula braunii (Loranthaceae) depend on sunbirds for seed set. Sunbird species average bill lengths varied between 14.5 mm (the variable sunbird) and 23.6 mm (the Green-headed Sunbird), but, while more pollen was carried on longer bills, we found no evidence for a relationship between bill length and type of flower visited. Both networks were nested. Some specialization was observed in both networks although this does not appear to be driven much by sunbird-flower trait matching. Overall, our results suggest that in contrast to nectivores elsewhere, factors such as phenology and/or environment, rather than morphology, may play important roles in limiting potential sunbird-flower interactions and need further investigation.

Complex indirect effects of epiphytic bromeliads on the invertebrate food webs of their support tree	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						Costa Rica; non-trophic interactions; predator facilitation; seasonality; trophic cascades	SPECIES RICHNESS; TROPHIC CASCADES; DIVERSITY; PREDATION; COMMUNITY; ABUNDANCE; FOREST; PLANTS; NESTS	Ecosystem engineers are species that affect others through the provision of habitat rather than consumptive resources. The extent to which ecosystem engineers can indirectly affect entire food webs, however, is poorly understood. Epiphytic tank bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) are ecosystem engineers that are common throughout the Neotropics, and are associated with a variety of predatory arthropods. Here, we examine if bromeliads, by increasing predator densities, indirectly benefit their support tree through reduction in herbivorous insects and leaf damage. We observed and manipulated bromeliad densities in Costa Rican orange orchards, and measured impacts on leaf damage and arboreal and bromeliad invertebrate communities in two different seasons. Our results show that bromeliads are associated with predatory and herbivorous invertebrates but not leaf damage. Bromeliads were correlated with increased densities of their associated predators, especially ants and hunting spiders, but we could not confirm a causal link. Associations with bromeliads changed over time, with seasonal shifts interfering with responses to our manipulations. Bromeliads had a reduced association with predators in the dry season. Moreover, a null association between bromeliads and herbivorous invertebrates in the dry season unexpectedly became positive in the wet season. In summary, we have only limited evidence that bromeliads indirectly promote the top-down control of arboreal herbivores; instead, our manipulations suggest that bromeliads increase herbivore densities in the wet season. This research suggests that although bromeliads may act as ecosystem engineers, indirectly influencing the invertebrate food web on support trees, their effects are trophically complex and seasonally dependent. in Spanish is available with online material.

Although several studies have uncovered the importance of engineering environments, few studies have evaluated the effect of pioneering plants as ecosystem engineers, especially in tropical environments. When dead, Cecropia leaves become architecturally complex, acquiring a tridimensional shape due to desiccation, and may facilitate other organisms. Here, we evaluate the role of these dead leaves in structuring species richness, abundance, biomass, and composition of macroinvertebrate communities on leaf litter in six protected areas of Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Predators were larger, more abundant, and presented higher standing stock in the presence of dead Cecropia leaves compared to soil debris (i.e., common leaf litter); however, detritivores had the opposite patterns. This resulted in shifts in body size structure of the assemblage, thus causing inversion of biomass pyramids to top-heavy in advanced stages of Cecropia leaves desiccation. Dead Cecropia leaves did not influence species richness and abundance of species, but they influenced the biomass of detritivores and predators in the communities. Our results demonstrated that pioneer trees can act as ecosystem engineers, by facilitating communities of invertebrate predators.

While environmental descriptors over large extents usually have medium-to-low spatial resolution, in situ measures provide accurate information for limited areas, and a gap remains in providing remote descriptors that represent local environmental structure. Texture from satellite images can represent fine-scale heterogeneity over wide spatial coverage, but to date, it has mostly been used to predict general aspects of species diversity, such as richness. Here, we assess the utility of image textures from high-resolution satellite images (RapidEye 3A) and in situ variables to predict differences in the composition of anuran communities in a tropical savanna (Cerrado) of Brazil. While in situ measures accounted for compositional differences in the whole community, two measures of image textures were associated only with the variation of species within the Hylidae family (adj. R-2 = 0.16 and 0.14). Comparatively, image textures predicted ~2/3 of the variation explained by in situ measures (adj. R-2 = 0.23). When both approaches were combined, a greater compositional variation was achieved (adj. R-2 = 0.28), with 1/5 of it shared by both in situ and textures, and 1/5 attributed solely to texture. Our findings suggest that image texture can complement the assessment of environmental heterogeneity acting on the assembly of local anuran communities. This approach can be valuable for explicitly including spatial heterogeneity in biological assessments over broad spatial extents, especially for biological groups strongly filtered by environmental conditions. in Portuguese is available with online material.

Successional loss of two key food tree species best explains decline in group size of Panamanian howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata)	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						Alouatta palliata; Ficus spp; food limitation; group size; howler monkey; Moraceae; primate population dynamics; tropical forest succession	OCELOT LEOPARDUS-PARDALIS; BARRO COLORADO ISLAND; TROPICAL FOREST; MATERNAL INVESTMENT; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; GUARIBA-CLAMITANS; PANTHERA-ONCA; NATIONAL-PARK; POPULATION; WILDLIFE	Negative impacts of discrete, short-term disturbances to wildlife populations are well-documented. The consequences of more gradual environmental change are less apparent and harder to study because they play out over longer periods and are often indirect in their action. Yet, they can drive the decline of wildlife populations even in seemingly pristine and currently well-protected habitats. One such environmental change is a successional shift in a community's species composition as it regenerates from disturbance caused by past human land use. Early and middle successional tree species often provide key foods to folivores and frugivores, but the abundance of these resources drops as the forest matures, with adverse repercussions for these consumers. Our 44-year record (1974-2018) of howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) group sizes and demographic composition from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, a protected reserve, documents an example of this phenomenon. After 70 years of relative stability, the mean size of howler monkey groups exhibited a marked decline, beginning in 2003. This downward trajectory in group size has continued through the most recent census in 2018. The composition of howler groups also changed significantly during the study period, with the patterns of decline differing among age/sex classes. There is no evidence that these changes were caused by increased rates of emigration, group fission, predation, parasitism, or disease. Rather, they are best explained by an island-wide, succession-driven decline in the densities of two species of free-standing fig trees, Ficus yoponensis and F. insipida, which together were providing ~36% of BCI howlers' annual diet. in Spanish is available with online material.

Much of the current understanding of P dynamics in agricultural systems has been obtained from rainfall-driven runoff, and less is known about cold-season processes. An improved understanding of the magnitude, form, and transport flow paths of P losses from agricultural croplands year round, and the climatic drivers of these processes, is needed to prioritize and evaluate appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to protect soil-water quality in cold regions. This study examines multiyear, year-round, high-frequency edge-of-field P losses (soluble reactive P and total P [TP]) in overland flow and tile drainage from three croplands in southern Ontario, Canada. Annual and seasonal budgets for water, P, and estimates of field P budgets (including fertilizer inputs, crop uptake, and runoff) were calculated for each site. Annual edge-of-field TP loads ranged from 0.18 to 1.93 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean = 0.59 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) across the region, including years with fertilizer application. Tile drainage dominated runoff across sites, whereas the contribution of tiles and overland flow to P loss differed regionally, likely related to site-specific topography, soil type, and microclimate. The nongrowing season was the dominant period for runoff and P loss across sites, where TP loss during this period was often associated with overland flow during snowmelt. These results indicate that emphasis should be placed on BMPs that are effective during both the growing and nongrowing season in cold regions, but that the suitability of various BMPs may vary for different sites.

More specifically, the relative importance of manure application, tillage, and soil-test P (STP) has not been assessed at the field scale. In this study, we compiled a dataset composed of 125 site-years of data from 26 fields that were continually monitored for edge-of-field P loss during snowmelt and storm events. Regression tree analyses were performed to rank the level of influence each environmental and management factor had on nutrient loads. Dissolved P (DP) was the majority of the total P (TP) during frozen conditions, but a small portion of TP during nonfrozen conditions. Manure application had a greater influence on the flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMCs) of TP and DP during frozen conditions than during nonfrozen conditions. No-till resulted in greater TP and DP FWMCs during frozen conditions than conventional tillage, whereas the opposite effect for TP FWMC was seen during nonfrozen conditions. However, regression tree analysis revealed that STP (0- to 5-cm depth) was the most important factor in predicting DP and TP FWMCs during frozen conditions and DP FWMC during nonfrozen conditions. Extremely high STP values were associated with late-frozen manure applications and grazed pastures. Reducing surface P loss in seasonally frozen landscapes will require prioritizing management strategies that avoid manure application through early-and late-frozen conditions and lead to a drawdown of STP, particularly in the top 5 cm.

Hydrological and Seasonal Controls of Phosphorus in Northern Great Plains Agricultural Streams	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CONSERVATION TILLAGE; SNOWMELT RUNOFF; SURFACE WATERS; EUTROPHICATION; SEDIMENT; NITROGEN; MANITOBA; LOSSES; MODEL; SCALE	Controls on nutrient transport in cold, low-relief agricultural regions vary dramatically among seasons. The spring snowmelt is often the dominant runoff and nutrient loading event of the year. However, climate change may increase the proportion of runoff occurring with rainfall, and there is an urgent need to understand seasonal controls on nutrient transport to understand how patterns may change in the future. In this study, we assess patterns and drivers of total P (TP) dynamics in eight streams draining agriculturally dominated watersheds, located in southern Manitoba, Canada. Data from three years of monitoring revealed highly coherent patterns of TP concentrations in streams, with pronounced peaks in the spring and midsummer across the region. This coherent pattern was in spite of considerable interannual variability in the magnitude and timing of discharge; in particular, a major storm event occurred in summer 2014, which resulted in more discharge than the preceding spring melt. Concentration-discharge model fits were generally poor or not significant, suggesting that runoff generation is not the primary driver of TP dynamics in the majority of streams. Seasonal patterns of conductivity and stream temperature suggest that mechanisms controlling TP vary by season; a spring TP concentration maximum may be related to surface runoff over frozen soils, whereas the summer TP maximum may be related to temperature-driven biogeochemical processes, which are not well represented in current conceptual or predictive models. These findings suggest that controls on stream TP concentrations are dynamic through the year, and responses to increases in dormant and nondormant season temperatures may depend on seasonally variable processes.

Assessing the Impacts of Climate Variability on Fertilizer Management Decisions for Reducing Nitrogen Losses from Corn Silage Production	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							OXIDE EMISSIONS; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; MODEL DEVELOPMENT; N2O EMISSIONS; DNDC MODEL; WATER; CROP; COVER; SYSTEMS; CANADA	There is an incentive for dairy farmers to maximize crop production while minimizing costs and environmental impacts. In cold climates, farmers have limited opportunity to balance field activities and manure storage requirements while limiting nutrient losses. A revised DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) model for simulating tile drainage was used to investigate fertilizer scenarios when applying dairy slurry or urea on silage corn (Zea mays L.) to examine N losses over a multidecadal horizon at locations in eastern Canada and the US Midwest. Management scenarios included timing (spring, fall, split, and sidedress) and method of application (injected [10 cm], incorporated [5 cm], and broadcast). Reactive N losses (NO3- from drainage and runoff, N2O, and NH3) were greatest from broadcast, followed by incorporated and then injected applications. Among the fertilizer timing scenarios, fall manure application resulted in the greatest N loss, primarily due to increased N leaching in non-growing-season periods, with 58% more N loss per metric ton of silage than spring application. Split and sidedress mineral fertilizer had the lowest N losses, with average reductions of 9.5 and 4.9%, respectively, relative to a single application. Split application mitigated losses more so than sidedress by reducing the soil pH shift due to urea hydrolysis and NH3 volatilization during the warmer June period. This assessment helps to distinguish which fertilizer practices are more effective in reducing N loss over a long-term time horizon. Reactive N loss is ranked across 18 fertilizer management practices, which could assist farmers in weighing the tradeoffs between field trafficability, manure storage capacity, and expected N loss.

The goal of this field-scale study was to identify the effects of different types of soil amendments (raw manure from cows treated with cephapirin and pirlimycin, compost from antibiotic-treated or antibiotic-free cows, or chemical fertilizer only) and crop type (lettuce [ Lactuca sativa L.] or radish [ Raphanus sativus L.]) on the transport of two antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs; sul1 and ermB) via storm runoff from six naturally occurring storms. Concurrent quantification of sediment and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; Escherichia coli and enterococci) in runoff permitted comparison to traditional agricultural water quality targets that may be driving factors of ARG presence. Storm characteristics (total rainfall volume, storm duration, etc.) significantly influenced FIB concentration (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05), although both effects from individual storm events (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.05) and vegetative cover influenced sediment levels. Composted and raw manure-amended plots both yielded significantly higher sul1 and ermB levels in runoff for early storms, at least 8 wk following initial planting, relative to fertilizer-only or unamended barren plots. There was no significant difference between sul1 or ermB levels in runoff from plots treated with compost derived from antibiotictreated versus antibiotic-free dairy cattle. Our findings indicate that agricultural fields receiving manure-derived amendments release higher quantities of these two " indicator" ARGs in runoff, particularly during the early stages of the growing season, and that composting did not reduce effects of ARG loading in runoff.

Assessing the cumulative adverse effects of offshore wind energy development on seabird foraging guilds along the East Coast of the United States	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						offshore wind farm; cumulative effects; mitigation; exposure; seabirds; guild	MARINE BIRDS; COLLISION RISK; FLIGHT HEIGHTS; FARMS; VULNERABILITY; BEHAVIOR; PROJECTS; IMPACTS	Offshore wind farms are rapidly being permitted along the East Coast of the US, and with subsequent development could cumulatively affect seabird populations. Yet, the seabird guilds most likely at risk of cumulative effects have not been identified. Assessments of cumulative effects must first calculate the cumulative exposure of seabirds to areas suitable for offshore wind farms and then estimate how exposure will affect populations. This paper addresses this first need, and quantifies how three different wind farm siting scenarios could cumulatively expose seven seabird foraging guilds. The coastal bottom gleaner guild (sea ducks) would be exposed at similar rates regardless of siting decision, while other coastal guilds would be exposed at a higher rate when projects are built in shallow areas and close to shore rather than in high-wind areas. The pelagic seabird guild would be exposed at high rates when projects are built in high-wind areas. There was no single offshore wind siting scenario that reduced the cumulative exposure for all guilds. Based upon these findings, we identify the foraging guilds most likely to be cumulatively exposed and propose an approach for siting and mitigation that may reduce cumulative exposure for all guilds.

We document 85 cases of Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) laying, and subsequently abandoning, eggs in empty, unclaimed nests located adjacent to active nests during a 6 y study. The frequency of this behavior was positively correlated with total available nests, a metric that increases with colony size. In addition, two female swallows were observed alternately incubating multiple clutches after mislaying eggs in neighboring nests. We argue the potential to mislay eggs and allocate parental care across separate nests may represent an overlooked cost of colonial nesting in birds.

Space Use and Habitat Selection of American Badgers (Taxidea Taxus) in Southwestern Wisconsin	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							HOME-RANGE; ECOLOGY; PRAIRIE; CARNIVORES; CONSERVATION	Badger (Taxidea taxus) life history and ecology are poorly described despite widespread distribution in North America. We used radio-telemetry to estimate home range size and quantify habitat selection for badgers living in agricultural habitat in southwestern Wisconsin, U.S.A. Badgers in Wisconsin established relatively large home ranges (3 to 30km(2)), with those of males tending to be larger than females. Badgers selected broadly for nonforested grassland habitat in a matrix of agriculture, although fine-scale use varied substantially by individual. These patterns suggest that badgers tolerate levels of human alteration associated with agriculture in Wisconsin, although there may be limits to that tolerance.

Behavioral Response of the Mammalian Community to River Otter Latrine Activity	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							LONTRA-CANADENSIS; LUTRA-LUTRA; PUBLIC INFORMATION; SCENT MARKING; COMMUNICATION; VERTEBRATES; PATTERNS; SITES; MINK	Mammals commonly use latrines to communicate with each other via behaviors, such as scent marking and defecation. Olfactory cues resulting from these behaviors may influence the behavior of other species in and around latrines. The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is well known for its conspicuous use of latrines. We investigated whether latrine behavior of otters affected the behavior of other mammalian species. We used remote cameras to record activity patterns, visitation rates, and species richness at nine otter latrines located at five study sites across northern Indiana. We predicted the use of latrines by otters would result in the avoidance of latrines by other mammals in these riparian systems. Monthly mean species richness was lower at control sites than at latrine sites. Coyotes visited latrine sites more often than control sites, but all other species visited latrines and controls equally. Analysis of activity patterns revealed only white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana) changed activity from primarily nocturnal at latrines to primarily diurnal activity at control sites. Our findings suggest otter latrine activity has minimal effect on the behavior of most other mammals. Therefore, surveying otter latrines with remote cameras may simultaneously provide unbiased estimates about the diversity of the riparian mammal community given mammals tended to visit latrine and control sites equally.

The dynamics of preferential host switching: Host phylogeny as a key predictor of parasite distribution*	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Codiversification; cophylogeny; emerging infectious diseases; host-parasite coevolution; host range; host shifts	WOLBACHIA; EVOLUTION; EXTINCTION; EMERGENCE; ORIGINS; RISK	Parasites often jump to and become established in a new host species. There is much evidence that the probability of such host shifts decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient hosts, but the consequences of such preferential host switching remain little explored. We develop a computational model to investigate the dynamics of parasite host shifts in the presence of this phylogenetic distance effect. In this model, a clade of parasites evolves on an evolving clade of host species where parasites can cospeciate with their hosts, switch to new hosts, speciate within hosts or become extinct. Our model predicts that host phylogenies are major determinants of parasite distributions across trees. In particular, we predict that trees consisting of few large clades of host species and those with fast species turnover should harbor more parasites than trees with many small clades and those that diversify more slowly. Within trees, large clades are predicted to exhibit a higher fraction of infected species than small clades. We discuss our results in the light of recent cophylogenetic studies in a wide range of host-parasite systems.

Reproductive isolation and the maintenance of species boundaries in two serpentine endemic Jewelflowers	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Reproductive isolation; serpentine; speciation; sympatry; Streptanthus	ECOLOGICAL DIVERGENCE; DARWINS COROLLARY; PLANT SPECIATION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; RANGE SIZE; GENE FLOW; PATTERNS; EVOLUTION; POPULATIONS; BARRIERS	Speciation occurs when reproductive barriers substantially reduce gene flow between lineages. Understanding how specific barriers contribute to reproductive isolation offers insight into the initial forces driving divergence and the evolutionary and ecological processes responsible for maintaining diversity. Here, we quantified multiple pre- and post-pollination isolating barriers in a pair of closely related California Jewelflowers (Streptanthus, Brassicaceae) living in an area of sympatry. S. breweri and S. hesperidis are restricted to similar serpentine habitats; however, populations are spatially isolated at fine-scales and rarely co-occur in intermixed stands. Several intrinsic postzygotic barriers were among the strongest we quantified, yet, postzygotic barriers currently contribute little to overall reproductive isolation due to the cumulative strength of earlier-acting extrinsic barriers, including spatial isolation, and flowering time and pollinator differences. Data from multiple years suggest that pre-pollination barriers may have different strengths depending on annual environmental conditions. Similarly, crossing data suggest that the strength of intrinsic isolation may vary among different population pairs. Estimates of total reproductive isolation in S. breweri and S. hesperidis are robust to uncertainty and variability in individual barrier strength estimates, demonstrating how multiple barriers can act redundantly to prevent gene flow between close relatives living in sympatry.

Tempo and mode of mandibular shape and size evolution reveal mixed support for incumbency effects in two clades of island-endemic rodents (Muridae: Murinae)*	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Adaptive radiation; biotic filter; geometric morphometrics; macroevolution; interspecific competition; oceanic island	PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; ECOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; BODY-SIZE; R PACKAGE; MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION; CONTINENTAL RADIATION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; COLONIZATION; DIVERSITY	Existing radiations in a spatially limited system such as an oceanic island may limit the ecological opportunity experienced by later colonists, resulting in lower macroevolutionary rates for secondary radiations. Additionally, potential colonists may be competitively excluded by these incumbent (resident) species, unless they are biologically distinct (biotic filtering). The extant phenotypic diversity of secondary colonists may thus be impacted by lower rates of phenotypic evolution, exclusion from certain phenotypes, and transitions to new morphotypes to escape competition from incumbent lineages. We used geometric morphometric methods to test whether the rates and patterns of mandibular evolution of the Luzon "old endemic" rodent clades, Phloeomyini and Chrotomyini, are consistent with these predictions. Each clade occupied nearly completely separate shape space and partially separate size space. We detected limited support for decelerating and clade-specific evolutionary rates for both shape and size, with strong evidence for a shift in evolutionary mode within Chrotomyini. Our results suggest that decelerating phenotypic evolutionary rates are not a necessary result of incumbency interactions; rather, incumbency effects may be more likely to determine which clades can become established in the system. Nonincumbent clades that pass a biotic filter can potentially exhibit relatively unfettered evolution.

Rapid morphological change of nonnative frugivores on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu*	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Frugivory; Hawaii; morphological change; Oahu; rapid evolution; species introductions	NATURAL-SELECTION; INTRODUCED BIRDS; SEED-DISPERSAL; SPECIMEN SHRINKAGE; LEG MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION; POPULATION; INVASION; HISTORY; DIFFERENTIATION	Novel ecosystems have become widespread created, in part, by the global spread of species. The nonnative species in these environments can be under intense evolutionary pressures that cause rapid morphological change, which can then influence species interactions. In Hawaii, much of the native frugivore community is extinct, replaced by nonnative bird species. Here, we determined if the passerine species of the nonnative frugivore community on O'ahu have morphologically diverged from their native ranges. We compared a variety of traits, all important for frugivory, between museum specimens from the species' native ranges to wild individuals from O'ahu. All four species tested exhibited significant divergence ranging in magnitude from 2.3% to 13.0% difference in at least two traits. Using a method developed from quantitative genetics, we found evidence that a mixture of nonadaptive and adaptive processes worked in concert to create the observed patterns of divergence. Our results suggest that rapid morphological change is occurring and, based on the traits measured, that these changes may influence seed dispersal effectiveness. As these species are largely responsible for seed dispersal on the island, the rapid morphological change of these species can influence the stability and maintenance of plant communities on O'ahu.

Although trait loss is also predicted to occur frequently, few contemporary examples exist. In Hawaii, the Pacific field cricket (Teleogryllus oceanicus) is undergoing adaptive sexual signal loss due to natural selection imposed by eavesdropping parasitoids. Mutant male crickets ("flatwings") cannot sing. We measured the intensity of sexual selection on wing phenotype in a wild population. First, we surveyed the relative abundance of flatwings and "normal-wings" (nonmutants) on Oahu. Then, we bred wild-mated females' offspring to determine both female genotype with respect to the flatwing mutation and the proportion of flatwing males that sired their offspring. We found evidence of strong sexual selection favoring the production of song: females were predominantly homozygous normal-wing, their offspring were sired disproportionately by singing males, and at the population level, flatwing males became less common following a single sexual selection event. We report a selection coefficient describing the total (pre- and postcopulatory) sexual selection favoring normal-wing males in nature. Given the maintenance of the flatwing phenotype in Hawaii in recent years, this substantial sexual selection additionally suggests an approximate strength of opposing natural selection that favors silent males.

Global biogeographic structuring of tropical shallow-water brittle stars	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biogeographic barriers; dispersal; Ophiuroidea; phylodiversity; plate tectonics; shallow-waters; tropical realm	DIVERSITY PATTERNS; GEOGRAPHIC RANGE; REEF FISHES; EVOLUTION; ATLANTIC; OPHIUROIDS; SPECIATION; DISPERSAL; INFERENCE; VICARIANCE	Aim Biogeographic barriers emerged in the tropical oceans as continental masses moved with plate tectonics, and as the tropics contracted to lower latitudes from the late Eocene. These barriers have shaped tropical marine biodiversity. We characterize large-scale diversity patterns for tropical brittle stars and investigate the effect of biogeographic barriers on these in space and time. Location Shallow-water (<200 m) tropical oceans. Taxon Tropical shallow-water brittle stars (class Ophiuroidea). Methods We integrate phylogenetic and biogeographic modelling to test and quantify the biogeographic structuring across the major ocean basins for five families of brittle stars. These are well-sampled in our phylogenies (173 species) and represent an important component of the brittle star fauna of tropical shallow waters. We define major bioregions based on patterns of compositional and phylogenetic beta diversity. Results We find congruence between patterns of shared ancestry of regions and inferred biogeographic histories. Biogeographic reconstructions show that faunal patterns reflect the emergence of biogeographic barriers in the tropical world, with evidence of vicariant events driven by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, the narrowing of the Tethyan Seaway and the rise of the Isthmus of Panama. Main conclusions Biogeographic barriers almost completely isolated regional faunas. However, divergence age estimates predate the onset of the different barriers, suggesting that changes associated with the gradual emergence of the barriers had a strong effect on the evolutionary history of tropical shallow-water brittle stars. Limited, very recent, bi-directional dispersal was detected across the East Pacific Barrier, which is otherwise an important barrier for dispersal of brittle stars.

We used Ageratina adenophora, an invasive plant with restricted evolutionary potential to investigate shifts in the realized climatic niche independent of potential evolutionary adaptations. Location Native Mexican range; exotic ranges in Asia, the USA, the Canary Islands and Australia. Taxon Invasive Asteraceae A. adenophora (Spreng.) R.M.King & H.Rob. Commonly known as Crofton weed. Methods We compiled a robust occurrence dataset of A. adenophora for its native Mexican range and four exotic ranges (Asia, USA, Canary Islands, and Australia) and quantified pairwise niche overlap (Schoener's D) and niche dynamic (stable, unfilling and expansion) indices between the native and exotic ranges in reduced climatic space using smoothed occurrence densities. Niche shift was statistically tested using niche equivalency tests. Results The value of niche overlap (Schoener's D) differed considerably, ranging from relatively high between Mexico and Asia to low between Mexico and Australia. The niche dynamic indices indicated highest level of niche stability in Asia while highest degree of unstable niche was detected in Australia due to both niche expansion and unfilling. The niche similarity tests indicated that the native niche is more similar to the exotic niche than any randomly sampled niche from the exotic range. However, the niche equivalency tests showed evidence of niche differentiation as the observed niche overlap was lower than expected by chance for all pairwise comparisons. Jointly these tests indicate that despite the similarity, the native niche is not perfectly identical to any of the exotic niches. Main conclusions The current study has direct implications for understanding range expansion of invasive species even in the absence of evolutionary adaptation. Our study indicates that invasive species can occupy different, non-consistent realized climatic niches in different parts of the world, thus limiting the transferability of species distribution models and corresponding risk assessments or future projections.

Macroecological studies often cross-reference geographic range data with a climate dataset, to extract the mean environmental conditions encountered by a species within its geographic range. We aimed to assess the consistency of the environmental data estimates derived from IUCN versus GBIF geographic range data, and to test whether such differences may affect estimates of ecogeographical relationships, such as Bergmann's rule. Location Worldwide. Time period Around 2000. Taxa Rodents (Rodentia). Methods We first assessed the correlation between environmental data estimates (19 bioclimatic variables and elevation) derived from IUCN versus GBIF geographic range data of 1,315 rodent species, comparing how range size, conservation status, habitat, zoogeographic realm or elevation changed these correlations. Then, we compared the association between body mass and climate (mean temperature and precipitation) when the latter are derived from IUCN or GBIF data. Results There was high correlation between environmental data estimates derived from IUCN versus GBIF data, especially when excluding GBIF occurrences outside of IUCN polygons. Species' characteristics, or using the mean or median, did not change the consistency between estimates. Overall, GBIF occurrence data and IUCN range maps produced similar patterns of body mass-climate correlations. Main conclusions At the large spatial and taxonomic scale employed in this study, there does not seem to be any considerable differences in the average environmental data estimates derived from IUCN versus GBIF geographic range data. This result indicates that both sources of geographic range data could be used independently or in concert for macroecological inferences that involve summarizing species' niches by a single estimate of the average of their used environments.

Fine-scale analyses can improve our understanding of niche evolution, but information on microhabitat differences between parental species and hybrids is extremely scarce for animal populations. We assessed the pattern and role of niche variation along a hybrid zone, by investigating differences in microhabitat selection between terrestrial cave salamander species (Hydromantes ambrosii and Hydromantes italicus) and their hybrids. We tested whether introgressed populations show intermediate, conserved or transgressive niche, compared to parental species. Furthermore, we compared body condition index (BCI) among individuals observed in different microhabitats (different areas of caves), to assess the potential advantages of exploiting specific microhabitats. Location We surveyed similar to 700 cave sectors in Italy, across the whole range of the two parental species and along their contact zone. Methods We recorded salamander distribution and measured microhabitat features influencing salamander distribution: humidity, temperature and incident light. We tested niche differences between parental species and hybrids, and analysed spatial variation of body condition. Results We detected significant niche shifts between parental species and hybrids. Introgressed populations showed a transgressive niche and exploited sectors with warmer temperature, lower humidity and more light, compared to the non-introgressed ones. Introgressed salamanders were better able to exploit the microhabitat conditions that are frequently found nearby cave entrance. For males, BCI was significantly higher in individuals found close to the cave entrance. Main conclusions The transgressive niche of hybrids between H. ambrosii and H. italicus indicates niche expansion towards harsh environmental conditions, and such transgressive segregation allows exploiting environments with higher food availability. The ability to exploit dry and warm sectors can provide important advantages to hybrid populations that can better persist under stressful conditions. Transgressive niche can be important for long-term persistence and evolution within hybrid zones.

One reason for such inconsistency might be how and at what spatial scale the ecology of different cytotypes is compared. To address this issue, we adopted several complementary approaches to assess ecological requirements of cytotypes in a single species across wide-range of spatial scales. Location Europe. Taxon Tripleurospermum inodorum (Asteraceae). Methods WorldClim extracted data were used for comparing climatic niches of T. inodorum diploids and tetraploids at continental and subcontinental scales and for predicting climatic suitability of habitats in Europe. Within the contact zone of cytotypes, at the regional scale, ecological preferences of cytotypes were assessed independently in three regions. Habitat types and ecological indicators inferred from species composition of vegetation in both uniform-ploidy and mixed-ploidy populations were used for ecological niche reconstructions. Results The two cytotypes differed in their climatic niches. However, due to considerable niche overlap, diploids and tetraploids were predicted to co-occur in an extensive contact zone in Europe. Within the contact zone, cytotypes had identical ecological preferences but varied in their frequency at particular habitat types. The ecological niches of mixed-ploidy and uniform-ploidy populations were undistinguishable. Main conclusions Cytotype distribution patterns may be shaped by multiple environmental forces, each operating at a different spatial scale. In T. inodorum, climate is an important driver of cytotype distribution patterns at continental scale, however, at finer scales within the contact zone, the founder effect and non-random migration patterns caused by human activities seem to be more important than environmental heterogeneity. The use of independent replicates and/or across-scale comparisons can significantly improve the performance of ecological niche assessments.

Here, we worked with the most widespread Southern Hemisphere tree line species, Nothofagus pumilio, across contrasting climatic conditions and determined whether rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations as well as warmer and drier climatic conditions provoked by the 70s-climatic shift have been causing systematic changes in tree line growth rates and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE). Location 36-54 degrees S, southern Andes. Time period 1950-2010. Major taxa studied Nothofagus pumilio. Methods We worked at five disparate climatic tree line locations, spanning 18 degrees of latitude; at each location, we sampled trees at four different elevations, including tree line elevation. We quantified the variation in annual tree-ring width (TRW) as a function of climate, elevation, tree age, size, annual CO2 concentrations and location, using linear mixed-effects models and interpreted TRW trends in relation to iWUE and isotope (delta C-13 and delta O-18) signalling. Results Across locations, the patterns of tree line growth occurring in the 1980-2010 period exhibited a clear and significant negative trend, in contrast to the previous 1950-1980 period. We found an increase in iWUE and delta O-18 across time and locations. Given that an increase in delta O-18 indicates a decrease in stomatal conductance, we assert that drought-induced stomatal closure appears to be causing the reduction in growth. Main conclusions We show unequivocal evidence that warmer and drier summer conditions translated into a decrease in growth rates along the elevational tree line of the southern Andes, reverting previous growth improvements linked to climate warming. An improvement in iWUE at all locations is most likely explained by decreased stomatal conductance given the rising delta O-18 signal. An iWUE-growth decoupling may act as an ecological strategy to respond to drought.	[Fajardo, Alex] CIEP, Camino Baguales S-N, Coyhaique 5951601, Chile; [Gazol, Antonio; Camarero, J.

However, it is not yet fully understood how climate interacts with human impacts or whether the effects of these factors differ between native and alien species. Facing ongoing climate change and urbanization, we explore the effects of climate on plant species richness and composition across European cities. Location Sixty cities in Western, Central and Southern Europe. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods Species presence was recorded in seven habitats in each city. Large-scale climatic gradients were derived from 22 climatic variables using a partial principal component analysis that controlled for the effects of human population size and gross domestic product. The effects of climate and habitat type on the numbers of native and alien species were tested using linear mixed-effect models. The native and alien compositional variation across cities and habitats was analysed using principal component analysis with variation partitioning. Results The Mediterranean-to-temperate climatic gradient had a significant effect on species numbers across all habitats. The numbers of both native and alien species increased from the Mediterranean to temperate Europe. Within each city, the proportion of alien species decreased from highly urbanized to less urbanized habitats. Climate had a stronger effect on the composition of alien plants than on the composition of native plants. The native species composition especially changed from the Mediterranean to temperate cities and alien species composition also from oceanic to continental cities. Main conclusions Urban native and alien species richness follow the pattern found for the whole European flora. Based on this observation, we suggest that the future shift of warm and dry conditions from the Mediterranean to the north that is expected under global change scenarios could affect richness and change the composition of European urban floras. However, this shift would not necessarily alter the proportions of aliens.

Location Finland. Taxon Diatoms. Methods We studied 288 diatom species from 492 stream sites and 230 diatom species from 290 lake sites. For each species, we calculated logit-transformed regional occupancy and log-transformed mean local abundance, and further determined biological traits, ecological preferences and taxonomic levels for each species. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis was used to reveal the linear and nonlinear associations of biological, ecological and taxonomic predictors with occupancy or abundance of lake and stream diatoms. Results There were strong and positive interspecific occupancy-abundance relationships across both lakes and streams. The BRT models explained more deviances in variation in occupancy and abundance and their relationship for lakes than streams. Biological traits, especially cell size, but also life-form and guild, were the strongest predictors of diatom occupancy and abundance in lakes and streams when controlling for ecological preferences and taxonomic relatedness. Main conclusions In general, biological traits were the strongest predictors of occupancy and abundance in both freshwater systems. Species with similar biological traits thus tended to show similar occupancies and abundances. As indicated by lower explained deviances, occupancy and abundance in streams seemed to be more complexly structured than in lakes, suggesting that these two freshwater system types differ in the formation of biodiversity patterns. This difference may be related to the differences in hydrological connectedness between lakes and streams. Understanding how variations in species' occupancy and abundance are formed across various waterbodies is important for meaningful biodiversity conservation.

Surface-to-volume ratios are recurrently suggested as the cause of body size responses to climate, but most inferences on organismal size clines stem from single linear measurements of body length. Here, we illustrate how new photogrammetric techniques can be applied to characterize amphibian morphologies with 3D models. Using the natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita) as model organism, we compared the performance of climatic models in accounting for body size (measured as snout-to vent length, SVL) and body geometry (surface area-to-volume ratios) variation across macroclimatic gradients. Location Palaearctic. Taxon Epidalea calamita (former genus Bufo). Methods We used photogrammetry techniques to reconstruct 104 museum specimens of Epidalea calamita into 3D models and to collect geometric data (volume and surface area) to calculate surface area-to-volume ratios (SA:V). We then apply spatial and non-spatial regression to examine the relationships between SA:V, SVL and a set of bioclimatic variables. Results In accordance with the water conservation hypothesis, SA:V decreased towards more arid environments, a pattern that remained consistent after accounting for spatial autocorrelation effects. Only mean annual temperature was significant correlated with SVL. The contrast between both sets of models indicates that more traditional body size metrics (SVL) and body geometry (SA:V) do not operate the same constraints. Main conclusions We show that the variation in SA:V can be explained by the geographical variation in aridity. Evaporative water loss in wet-skinned ectotherms is highly dependent on the surface area of the skin exposed to the air. In contrast, SVL models detected that body length was more associated with mean annual temperature. This finding stresses the importance of selecting different metrics of body geometry and body size when examining variation across climatic gradients.

Location Coastal waters of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Taxon Teleost Fishes (Infraclass Teleostei). Methods We assess the relationship between species range extent and depth range, maximum body length, schooling behaviour and use of multiple habitats for 1,251 species of northern, temperate, continental shelf fishes in different basins (Atlantic vs. Pacific) and margins (east vs. west) using linear mixed-effect models with family and genus as nested random effects. We further assess the relationship between species range endpoint distribution and latitudinal temperature gradient using generalized linear models. Results We found strong positive relationships between the number of species northern range endpoints and the steepness of the latitudinal sea surface temperature gradient on the western margins of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but no relationship on the eastern margins of these ocean basins. The strongest predictors of range extent in our global model are ocean basin/margin and depth range. Maximum body length, schooling behaviour and use of multiple habitats are also significant predictors of range extent in the global model. The factors influencing range extent differ by basin and margin. Main conclusions There are broad differences in patterns of species range extent and distribution of species ranges among basins/margins. These differences appear to be driven in part by variation in latitudinal water temperature gradient between basin margins. Our data suggest that sharp latitudinal temperature gradients may pose a barrier to dispersal and range expansion along the western margins of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but not necessarily on the eastern margins. Our work also suggests that several post-settlement traits may be associated with range extent either globally or in some temperate basins.

Specifically, we ask how their diversification was influenced by climate change, topography and major rivers. Location Tropical Africa: Lower Guinea (including Cameroon volcanic line; CVL), Congolia, Albertine Rift (AR), Kenyan highlands (KH). Taxon Murine rodents of the Praomys jacksoni complex. Methods We used 849 genotyped individuals to describe the overall diversity and spatial genetic structure across a majority of their known distribution area. The combination of one mitochondrial and three nuclear markers was used to infer dated phylogenies using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Genetic structure was further assessed by multispecies coalescent species delimitation. Current and past distributions of particular taxa were predicted using environmental niche modelling. Results The complex is composed of five major genetic clades (proposed species). Two of them are restricted to specific habitat types (either montane forests of AR or wetlands in lowland forests along the Congo River), three others have wide geographic distributions and lower levels of ecological specialization. The earliest divergence is dated to the Plio-Pleistocene boundary and is in accordance with the separation of AR forests and Guineo-Congolian forests. Further diversification of the complex is associated with Pleistocene climate changes. Relatively stable refugia of suitable climatic conditions were identified in lowland Congolia (for two species currently distributed only in lowland forests) as well as in montane forests of CVL, AR, KH (playing the role of reservoirs of diversity). Large rivers, especially the Congo River, are important barriers to gene flow for most taxa, but probably were not the primary cause of differentiation. Main conclusions The evolutionary history of the complex was primarily affected by Pleistocene climate changes and diversification in forest refugia. There is little support for ecological parapatric speciation or the riverine barrier hypothesis.

Here, we assess the fungal diversity and distribution patterns in karst caves in Southwest China and reveal the major factors that shape the fungal communities. Location Southwest China. Methods Samples of air, rock, sediment and water were collected from eight caves in Southwest China. Using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region of fungal rDNA, we examined the cave fungal communities in Southwest China and studied their correlations with potentially influential factors, such as substrate, cave, location and environmental variables. Results Approximately 10,000 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) spanning 15 phyla were obtained. The highest diversity genus was Penicillium, while Mortierella had the highest relative abundance. Compared with air and rock samples, sediment and water samples harboured higher diversity and distinct communities. Substrate and cave were revealed to be the key determinants of the fungal communities in caves. Sample location and sampling distance from the entrance had more significant impacts on rock and sediment communities than on air and water assemblages. The fungal assemblages in air and water samples from the cave and outside cave environments were similar, while those of rock and sediment samples were significantly different. Main conclusions Our results indicate that sediment and water harboured higher fungal diversity than air and rock, and substrate and spatial variables are key determinants of fungal communities in caves.

Cointroductions of Australian acacias and their rhizobial mutualists in the Southern Hemisphere	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Australian acacias; biological invasions; Bradyrhizobium; host-switching; invasional meltdown; mutualist cointroduction	CO-INTRODUCTION; NATIVE LEGUMES; SOIL; INVASION; TREES; RHIZOSPHERE; POPULATIONS; ASSOCIATE; SUPPORT; SHRUBS	Aim Mutualisms are often disrupted for plants introduced to new ranges, yet many of these plants have managed to obtain effective mutualistic associations in their new ranges. There are two potential pathways for non-native plants to reassemble mutualisms: cointroduction (i.e. familiar associations with cointroduced mutualists) or ecological fitting (i.e. forming or adapting novel associations with resident native mutualists). We assessed the importance of each pathway for mutualist reassembly in four Australian Acacia species (A. baileyana, A. dealbata, A. decurrens and A. melanoxylon) and their associated nitrogen-fixing rhizobial symbionts in two non-native locations. Location Native ranges of acacias in south-eastern Australia and two non-native ranges in New Zealand and South Africa. Methods Rhizobia associated with each acacia species in each country were isolated and identified based on DNA sequencing of the housekeeping recA gene and the symbiotic nodA gene. Separate phylogenies were reconstructed for each gene region to infer biogeographic histories of acacia-associated rhizobia. Selected rhizobial strains for each acacia species by country combination were used as inocula in a glasshouse experiment and early growth kinetics and nitrogen fixation efficiency of acacia seedlings were compared between inoculum treatments to determine symbiotic effectiveness. Results All isolated rhizobial strains belonged to the genus Bradyrhizobium. Phylogenetic analyses revealed almost no country- or species-specific clusters of these strains for either gene region and indicated that most acacia-associated bradyrhizobia in New Zealand and South Africa were cointroduced from Australia. These results were supported by little variation in the growth performances of acacia seedlings, irrespective of inoculum treatment. Main conclusions This study revealed that cointroduction of Australian acacias and their rhizobia may be more prevalent than previously thought. Additionally, a single rhizobium cointroduction event may be sufficient to facilitate the establishment of effective mutualisms in numerous Acacia species, potentially leading to an invasion meltdown.

However, little is currently known about how these environmental drivers may affect edaphic organisms within these ecosystems. In this study, we examined communities of plant root-associated fungi (RAF) over large biogeographical scales and along climatic gradients in the North Atlantic region in order to gain insights into the potential effects of climate variability on these communities. We also investigated whether selected fungal traits were associated with particular climates. Locations Austria, Scotland, Mainland Norway, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Taxa Root fungi associated with the ectomycorrhizal and herbaceous plant Bistorta vivipara. Methods DNA metabarcoding of the ITS1 region was used to characterize the RAF of 302 whole plant root systems, which were analysed by means of ordination methods and linear modelling. Fungal spore length, width, volume and shape, as well as mycelial exploration type (ET) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes were summarized at a community level. Results The RAF communities exhibited strong biogeographical structuring, and both compositional variation as well as fungal species richness correlated with annual temperature and precipitation. In accordance with general island biogeography theory, the least species-rich RAF communities were found on Jan Mayen, a remote and small island in the North Atlantic Ocean. Fungal spores tended to be more elongated with increasing latitude. We also observed a climate effect on which mycelial ET was dominating among the ectomycorrhizal fungi. Main conclusions Both geographical and environmental variables were important for shaping root-associated fungal communities at a North Atlantic scale, including the High Arctic. Fungal OTU richness followed general biogeographical patterns and decreased with decreasing size and/or increasing isolation of the host plant population. The probability of possessing more elongated spores increases with latitude, which may be explained by a selection for greater dispersal capacity among more isolated host plant populations in the Arctic.

Over the hills, but how far away? Estimates of mushroom geographic range extents	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						distribution; fungi; GBIF; host tree; ITS; mushroom; range extent; UNITE database	FUNGUS AMANITA-PHALLOIDES; BIOGEOGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS; MOLECULAR-IDENTIFICATION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; AERIAL DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; SPECIATION; ABUNDANCE; IMPACT; SEQUENCES	Aim Geographic distributions of mushroom species remain poorly understood despite their importance for advancing our understanding of the habitat requirements, species interactions and ecosystem functions of this key group of organisms. Here, we estimate geographic range extents (maximum within-species geographic distance) of genetically defined operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Location World-wide, with emphasis on the American Pacific Northwest. Taxa Amanita, Agaricus, Cortinarius, Galerina, Hebeloma, Hydnum, Hygrocybe, Hygrophorus, Inocybe, Lepiota, Pholiota, and Russula + Lactarius; other genera in Agaricomycotina. Method We used publicly available OTUs from ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences (n = 15,373) from 12 mushroom genera with worldwide distributions. For each of 2,324 species-level OTUs, we estimated the maximum within-species range extent based on sample locality records. In parallel, we estimated range extents for species in four tree genera. Contrasting estimates from well-studied trees allowed us to test for potential biases in our range estimates of less well inventoried mushrooms. Results The median range extents across the 2,324 mushroom OTUs varied from 1,200 to 4,039 km, depending on assumptions. These extents were significantly lower than estimates from permuted or randomized data. Mushroom ranges were comparable to the median natural range extent of tree species (1,613 km). In contrast, the tree median species range increased to 16,581 km when anthropogenic range extensions were included. At least 10 mushroom species were similarly broadly distributed, eight of which have been associated with human activity. Main conclusions Overall, like tree species, mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi show evidence of biogeographic structure rather than global distributions. This reconstruction of geographic range extents drew upon investments into ITS barcoding of extensive herbarium collections. Large scale analyses such as ours can yield estimates of fungal geographic range extents that are a prerequisite to a deeper understanding of the diverse roles of fungi in ecosystems.

Model averaging fails to improve the extrapolation capability of the island species-area relationship	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						extrapolation; habitat islands; model averaging; multi-model inference; power model; species richness; species-area relationship	R-PACKAGE; DIVERSITY; RICHNESS; CURVES; BIODIVERSITY; SHAPES	Aim One of the main applications of the island species-area relationship (SAR) is to predict species richness in areas of habitat too large to be sampled, but there are few clear guidelines for choosing an appropriate model for this purpose. We therefore aimed to test whether a multi-model averaging approach could improve the accuracy of predictions made by extrapolating the ISAR. Specifically, we compared the performance of multi-model averaging with that of the default ISAR model of choice, the power model, in predicting species richness in large habitat islands. Location Global Taxa Vertebrates, invertebrates and plants Methods We removed the largest islands from 120 habitat island datasets, and fitted both the power model and a multi-model average curve (averaging the predictions of up to 20 ISAR models) to this filtered dataset. We then assessed the accuracy of both approaches in predicting the species richness of the largest island in the original dataset using the log error of extrapolation (LEE) metric. A generalized additive regression modelling framework was used to determine whether any dataset characteristics could explain variation in the LEE values for the power model (LEE-POW). Results The power model gave the more accurate richness predictions for 58% of the analysed datasets and the multi-model averaged curve gave the more accurate predictions for the remaining 42%. Both the power models (61% of LEE-POW values were positive) and the multi-model averaged curve (60% were positive) had a slightly greater tendency to over predict the observed richness. The confidence intervals were also on average narrower for the power model predictions (median 95% confidence interval width = 18 species) than for the multi-model averaged curve predictions (median 95% confidence interval width = 78). The range in island areas and richness values explained a small amount of the variation in LEE-POW. Main conclusions Contrary to expectation, multi-model averaging was less accurate than the power model in the majority of cases, and thus does not appear to be a panacea for uncertainty in model choice when extrapolating the ISAR. However, further research is urgently needed to evaluate the performance of a multi-model averaging approach at larger spatial scales.	[Matthews, Thomas J.; Aspin, Thomas W.

We present BioGEEM (BioGeographical Eco-Evolutionary Model), a spatially explicit model that integrates theories and processes understood to drive biodiversity dynamics. We investigated the necessary degree of mechanistic complexity by exploring simulation experiments to evaluate the relative roles of the underlying processes across spatio-temporal scales and ecological levels (e.g. populations, species, communities). Location Hypothetical oceanic islands. Methods BioGEEM is stochastic and grid-based, and it integrates ecological (metabolic constraints, demography, dispersal and competition), evolutionary (mutation and speciation) and environmental (geo-climatic dynamics) processes. Plants on oceanic islands served as a model system. We ran the simulations both with all processes on and with selected processes switched off to assess the role of each process from the emergent patterns. Results The full model was able to generate patterns matching empirical evidence and theoretical expectations. Population sizes were largest on young islands, and species, particularly endemics, better filled their potential range on young and old islands due to limited area and reduced competition. Richness peaked at mid-elevations. The proportion of endemics was highest in old, large and isolated environments within the islands. Species and trait richness showed unimodal temporal trends. Switching off selected processes led to several unrealistic patterns, including the evolution of super-dominant species, extremely high richness and weakened spatial diversity gradients. Main conclusions The main predictions derived from BioGEEM are: Competition has cross-scale effects on diversity. Hump-shaped temporal dynamics can be obtained without speciation. Endemic species seem less susceptible to extinction than native non-endemic species. Endemism reflects stronger geographical and environmental isolation. Finally, only the integration of all implemented processes generates realistic spatio-temporal dynamics at population, species, community and assemblage levels.

Goldenrods of American origin (Solidago canadensis, S. gigantea and Euthamia graminifolia) have successfully invaded Europe, and this success can be related to their high phenotypic plasticity. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis of higher phenotypic plasticity of invasive goldenrods by comparing them with native taxa: closely related Solidago virgaurea and similar ecologically, invasive in other regions Tanacetum vulgare. The species studied were grown in a common garden on three different substrates with different fertilizers. After 3 years, the height and number of ramets, biomass production and allocation, phenology and nitrate reductase activity (NRA) were measured. The highest level of phenotypic plasticity was exhibited by the competitively weak native species S. virgaurea. The invasive species produced relatively high biomass and exhibited a moderate level of phenotypic plasticity. Variability in the studied traits did not always correlate with differences in substrates. The invasion success of non-native goldenrods is not caused by their having a higher phenotypic plasticity than native species. Rather, the non-natives should be considered as "Jack of all traits, and master of some".

How do environmental factors such as moisture and soil properties alter diversity during primary succession? Location La Palma, Canary Islands. Methods We recorded vascular plants and bryophytes in 210 plots on a chronosequence of nine lava flows spanning approx. 6,000 years and covering an elevational range of 1,100 m. In a subset (n = 78 plots) we collected and analyzed soil samples for soil nitrogen and plant-available phosphorus. We used generalized linear models, variance partitioning and structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the data. Results Species richness, endemic richness and alien richness increased with time. Natives dominated during early successional stages, whereas endemics and aliens increased with time. At early successional stages, vascular plants and bryophytes had an equal contribution to the species pool, while vascular plants increased up to an 80% contribution at later stages. In the variance partitioning and SEMs, time was the only consistent factor influencing different aspects of diversity during succession (species richness, endemic richness and percent endemism). Only for percent endemism did soil attributes have a substantial impact. Conclusion Primary succession on lava flows on La Palma shows a pattern of increasing overall diversity, endemism and alien richness with time. Time is the only factor consistently explaining diversity and endemism, indicating that environmental influences such as climate and soil properties do not substantially alter them during primary succession. Our study contributes to understanding how different facets of diversity assemble through time by using an understudied, yet important island system, and, for the first time, specifically addresses how endemics contribute to the process of primary succession.

Due to harsher environmental conditions on smaller islands compared to larger ones, environmental filtering may preclude some species, potentially resulting in island size-dependent species pools. We tested whether the species pool size follows a similar species-area relationship as the observed richness. This can provide new insight into community assembly processes and the elusive small-island effect (SIE), which states that species richness on smaller islands is less dependent on area than on larger islands. Location Raja Ampat Archipelago, Indonesia. Methods We studied the woody vegetation on sixty small islands ranging from 3 m(2) to 11,806 m(2). For each recorded species, we estimated its area requirements and compared them against random colonization models. We developed a novel method to calculate probabilistic species pools for each island. We compared different species-area models for observed species richness and our index of species pool size to test whether the SIE results from differences in species pool size. Results We found that most species were restricted to islands significantly larger than expected from random colonization. The occurrence probability of all species increased with island size, indicating a lack of species that are specialized to the conditions on small islands. We found a SIE in observed species richness, but not in species pool size. Conclusion Woody plants in the studied island system have specific requirements that are linked to island area and determine island-specific species pools. Lower community completeness on smaller islands compared to larger ones indicated that the SIE is shaped by local limiting processes that have no impact on the species pool, but control how much of it is realized on an island. Together, these results clearly indicate non-random plant community assembly on small islands.

Here, we focus on species absent from local sites but with the potential to establish within communities - known as dark diversity. Methods for estimating dark diversity are still being developed and need to be compared, as well as tested for the type, and amount, of reference data needed to calibrate these methods. Location South Bohemia (48 degrees 58 ' N, 14 degrees 28 ' E) and Zelezne Hory (49 degrees 52 ' N, 15 degrees 34 ' E), Czech Republic. Method We compared a widely accepted algorithm to estimate species pools (Beals smoothing index, based on species co-occurrence) against a novel method based on an unconstrained ordination (UNO). Following previous work, we used spatially nested sampling for target plots, with the dark diversity estimates computed from smaller plots validated against additional species present in larger plots, and a reference dataset (Czech National Phytosociological Database of >30,000 plots as global reference data). We determined which method provides the best estimate of dark diversity with an index termed the "Success Rate Index". Results When using the whole reference dataset (national scale), both UNO and Beals provided comparable predictions of dark diversity that were better than null expectations based on species frequency. However, when predicting from regionally restricted spatial scales, UNO performed significantly better than Beals. UNO also tended to detect less common species better than Beals. The success rate of combining UNO and Beals slightly outperformed the results obtained from the single methods, but only with the largest reference dataset. Conclusions The UNO method provides a consistently reliable estimate of dark diversity, particularly when the reference dataset is size-limited. For future calculations, we urge caution regarding the choice of dark diversity methods with respect to the reference data available, and how different methods handle species of high, and low, occurrence frequency.

Here we propose and test a method to assess sampling coverage of species distribution in biodiversity databases in geographic and climatic space. Location Europe. Methods Using a test selection of 808,794 vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA), we assessed the sampling coverage of 564 European vascular plant species across both their geographic ranges and realized climatic niches. Range maps from the Chorological Database Halle (CDH) were used as background reference data to capture species geographic ranges and to derive species climatic niches. To quantify sampling coverage, we developed a box-counting method, the Dynamic Match Coefficient (DMC), which quantifies how much a set of occurrences of a given species matches with its geographic range or climatic niche. DMC is the area under the curve measuring the match between occurrence data and background reference (geographic range or climatic niche) across grids with variable resolution. High DMC values indicate good sampling coverage. We applied null models to compare observed DMC values with expectations from random distributions across species ranges and niches. Results Comparisons with null models showed that, for most species, actual distributions within EVA are deviating from null model expectations and are more clumped than expected in both geographic and climatic space. Despite high interspecific variation, we found a positive relationship in DMC values between geographic and climatic space, but sampling coverage was in general more random across geographic space. Conclusion Because DMC values are species-specific and most biodiversity databases are clearly biased in terms of sampling coverage of species occurrences, we recommend using DMC values as covariates in macro-ecological models that use species as the observation unit.

Because their relative importance remains poorly known, we ask how their comparative contribution to co-dominance changes with elevation and geographical extent. Location Madidi region, NW Bolivia. Methods We analysed floristic composition and environmental factors of 90 plots spanning the gradient from Amazonian (<1,000 m) to montane forests at three elevations (1,200-1,500; 2,000-2,300; and 2,800-3,200 m) and two geographical extents: local (plots <12 km apart) and regional (38-120 km apart). We modelled distance decay within each elevational band with a neutral model, using two parameters (speciation rate and dispersal distance). Subsequently, we related the model's residuals to environmental differences using flexible machine learning models. Results We found that 5-44% of the variability in floristic differences along the gradient studied can be explained by a neutral model of distance decay, while 18-50% can be explained by environmental differences. Montane forests showed an overall gradient in floristic composition that is congruent with an increase in elevation for both dispersal limitation and environmental filtering. However, Amazonian forest was more niche-structured and more dispersal-limited relative to its elevation and topography. Conclusions Environmental differences explained floristic differences better than the neutral model, even giving preferential attribution to the more parsimonious neutral processes.

Mass effects explain sapling community assembly in Araucaria mixed forest metacommunities	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						CATS models; functional diversity; metacommunity models; neutral model; patch dynamic; seed size; species sorting; specific leaf area	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY PATTERNS; TREE; GRASSLAND; EXPANSION; TRAITS; DYNAMICS; FRAMEWORK; ECOLOGY; PATCHES; COLONIZATION	Questions What is the relative influence of: (a) traits related to dispersal (seed size) and growth (specific leaf area [SLA]), and; (b) regional species abundances, on the structure of local sapling communities? Which metacommunity models best explain the process of forest nucleation in grasslands? Location Woody vegetation patches originating from nucleation and the continuous forest that neighbors native grasslands, in the southern Brazilian plateau (29 degrees 28 ' 58.00 '' S, 50 degrees 12 ' 26.00 '' W). Methods We calculated community-weighted trait means (CWM) and functional diversity for woody saplings, considering species occurrences (FD) and abundances (FDis) separately for both seed size and SLA, in woody vegetation patches of different sizes and in the continuous forest. We tested whether mean SLA and mean seed size differed between habitat types, and whether values of FD and FDis were lower than expected by chance. We also evaluated whether the relative abundances of species in woody vegetation patches were determined by their abundances in the continuous forest, using CATS models (Community Assembly by Trait Selection). The results were then compared to the expectations from each metacommunity model. Results Functional diversity of SLA and seed size did not differ from what was expected by chance in most sites. Species in communities of different habitat types did not differ in their mean SLA values, but we observed differences in mean seed size, with large-seeded species being typical of areas with more shade. Species abundances in the regional species pool were more important factors than species traits for determining species abundances in the local communities. Conclusions The analytical framework employed in this study enables a straightforward test of different metacommunity structuring models. Mass effects were the metacommunity model that best explained the process of forest nucleation in the southern Brazilian plateau, which highlights the importance of dispersal for the structure of local communities.

Plant species-specific response and tolerance to high land-use intensity in temperate grassland ecosystems	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						community composition; ecological strategies; Ellenberg indicator values; land-use intensity niche; plant functional traits; species-specific niche breadth; species-specific niche optima; temperate grasslands; vegetation dynamics	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; INDICATOR VALUES; FUNCTIONAL TYPES; RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; BIODIVERSITY; COEXISTENCE; DISTURBANCE; PREDICTORS	Aim Intensification of land use strongly impacts plant communities by causing shifts in taxonomic and functional composition. Mechanisms of land use-induced biodiversity losses have been described for temperate grasslands, but a quantitative assessment of species-specific occurrence optima and maximum tolerance (niche breadth) to land-use intensity (LUI) in Central European grasslands is still lacking. Location Temperate, managed permanent grasslands in three regions of Germany. Methods We combined extensive field work with a null model-randomization approach, defined a "habitat niche" for each plant species based on occurrence and abundance across 150 grassland sites differing in LUI (i.e., amount of fertilizer, mowing/grazing intensity and a compound index of these), and assessed their realized niche breadth (tolerance). Underlying mechanisms driving species' responses to LUI were assessed by relating plant functional traits, Ellenberg indicator values (EIV), Grime's ecological strategies (CSR) and Briemle utilization numbers. Results Out of 151 plant species, 34% responded negatively, whereas 10% responded positively to high LUI. This pattern was mainly driven by species' response to fertilization and mowing frequency; grazing intensity response was less pronounced. Positively reacting species, displaying broader niches, were associated with competition-related functional traits, high EIV for nutrient supply and moisture and high mowing tolerance under spatiotemporally variable conditions. Negatively responding species, displaying relatively narrow niches confined to spatiotemporally homogeneous low LUI sites, were associated with a nutrient-retentive strategy, under nutrient-poor, base-rich soil conditions. Conclusion Our analyses of individual species' reactions clearly demonstrate that species responding negatively to high LUI display little tolerance towards intensive fertilization and mowing, leading to plant diversity loss; whereas grazing partly thwarts these effects by creating new habitat niches and promoting ruderal species. Our approach can be applied to other habitat types and biogeographical regions in order to quantify local specific response or tolerance, adding to existing knowledge about local vegetation dynamics.

The combined effects of an extreme heatwave and wildfire on tallgrass prairie vegetation	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; climate extremes; drought; fire; pulses; regime shifts; resilience	FIRE HISTORY; CLIMATE; GRASSLAND; DROUGHT; RESILIENCE; DYNAMICS; EVENTS; PRODUCTIVITY; RESISTANCE; INTENSITY	Questions Climate extremes are predicted to become more common in many ecosystems. Climate extremes can promote and interact with disturbances, but the combined effects of climate extremes and disturbances have not been quantified in many ecosystems. In this study, we ask whether the dual impact of a climate extreme and concomitant disturbance (wildfire) has a greater affect than a climate extreme alone. Location Tallgrass prairie in the Konza Prairie Biological Station, northeastern Kansas, USA. Methods We quantified the response of a tallgrass prairie plant community to a 2-year climate extreme of low growing-season precipitation and high temperatures. In the first year of the climate extreme, a subset of plots was burned by a growing-season wildfire. This natural experiment allowed us to compare community responses to a climate extreme with and without wildfire. Results In plots exposed to the climate extreme but not wildfire, community structure, diversity, and composition showed minor to insignificant changes, such as a 20% reduction in grass cover and a slight increase in species diversity. Plots exposed to both the climate extreme and wildfire underwent larger changes, including an 80% reduction in grass cover, 50% increase in forb cover, and increased plant diversity. Two years after the climate extreme, structural shifts in burned plots showed little sign of recovery, indicating a potentially lasting shift in plant community structure. Conclusions Our results suggest that community responses to climate extremes need to account for climate-related disturbances - in this case, high temperatures, drought and wildfire. This response diverged from our expectation that heat, drought, and an additional fire would favor grasses. Although growing-season wildfires in tallgrass prairie have been rare in recent decades, they will likely become more common with climate change, potentially leading to changes in grassland structure.

The accidental epiphytic occurrence of terrestrial species, in contrast, is common at these latitudes and can provide important insights in the evolution of obligate epiphytes. Here, we present the results of the first two annual censuses of a planned long-term study on accidental epiphytes. We particularly aim to identify: (a) the abundance and species richness of accidental epiphytes; (b) the dynamics of accidental epiphytism; (c) occupied substrates and microsites; and (d) suitable host tree species. Location Harz Mountains, Germany, Central Europe. Methods We surveyed more than 1,200 trees in a low mountain range in two consecutive years for epiphytic individuals of vascular plants, considering host tree species and occupied microsites. Results About one quarter of the surveyed trees hosted epiphytic plants, totalling 1 450 (2016) and 1 350 (2017) individuals, respectively. These belonged to more than 100 species and 39 different families. The majority of epiphytic individuals newly emerged in 2017, whereas one-third persisted since 2016 (or earlier) and a smaller proportion even reproduced in the epiphytic habitat. Accidental epiphytes were mostly restricted to host tree species providing water-storing substrates such as extensive moss pads or arboreal soil accumulated in crotches. Compared to tropical epiphyte communities, accidental epiphytes in the temperate zones show a higher turnover, as they are less consistent in species abundance and composition in time. Conclusion For the majority of the observed species, epiphytism indeed is an accidental phenomenon. Undoubtedly, abiotic conditions limit the occurrence of obligate epiphytes at higher latitudes, but the presence and persistence of numerous epiphytic individuals illustrate that abiotic conditions do not per se preclude epiphytic occurrence of vascular plants in the north-temperate zone. Besides water shortage, the availability of suitable host trees is a decisive environmental factor that contributes to limit epiphytism of vascular plants in Central Europe.

Categorization of species as native or nonnative using DNA sequence signatures without a complete reference library	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						alien invasive species; biomonitoring; biosecurity; community barcoding; DNA barcoding; metabarcoding; Moorea BioCode	BARCODE REFERENCE LIBRARY; FRENCH-POLYNESIA; PLANT INVASIONS; TAXONOMY; EVOLUTION; COMMUNITY; ECOLOGY; LIFE; IDENTIFICATION; DELIMITATION	New genetic diagnostic approaches have greatly aided efforts to document global biodiversity and improve biosecurity. This is especially true for organismal groups in which species diversity has been underestimated historically due to difficulties associated with sampling, the lack of clear morphological characteristics, and/or limited availability of taxonomic expertise. Among these methods, DNA sequence barcoding (also known as "DNA barcoding") and by extension, meta-barcoding for biological communities, has emerged as one of the most frequently utilized methods for DNA-based species identifications. Unfortunately, the use of DNA barcoding is limited by the availability of complete reference libraries (i.e., a collection of DNA sequences from morphologically identified species), and by the fact that the vast majority of species do not have sequences present in reference databases. Such conditions are critical especially in tropical locations that are simultaneously biodiversity rich and suffer from a lack of exploration and DNA characterization by trained taxonomic specialists. To facilitate efforts to document biodiversity in regions lacking complete reference libraries, we developed a novel statistical approach that categorizes unidentified species as being either likely native or likely nonnative based solely on measures of nucleotide diversity. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by categorizing a large sample of specimens of terrestrial insects and spiders (collected as part of the Moorea BioCode project) using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Using a training data set of known endemic (n = 45) and known introduced species (n = 102), we then estimated the likely native/nonnative status for 4,663 specimens representing an estimated 1,288 species (412 identified species), including both those specimens that were either unidentified or whose endemic/introduced status was uncertain. Using this approach, we were able to increase the number of categorized specimens by a factor of 4.4 (from 794 to 3,497), and the number of categorized species by a factor of 4.8 from (147 to 707) at a rate much greater than chance (77.6% accuracy). The study identifies phylogenetic signatures of both native and nonnative species and suggests several practical applications for this approach including monitoring biodiversity and facilitating biosecurity.

In this context, understanding the influence of extrinsic (e.g., relocation design, habitat characteristics) and intrinsic factors (e.g., age and sex) on demographic parameters, such as survival, that regulate the dynamics of relocated populations is critical to improve relocation protocols and better predict relocation success. We investigated survival in naturally established and relocated populations of yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata), an amphibian that was nearly extinct in Belgium by the late 1980s. We quantified survival at three ontogenetic stages (juvenile, subadult, and adult) in the relocated population, the source population, and a control population. In the relocated population, we quantified survival in captive bred individuals and their locally born descendants. Then, using simulations, we examined how survival cost to relocation affects the self-sustainability of the relocated population. We showed that survival at juvenile and subadult stages was relatively similar in all populations. In contrast, relocated adult survival was lower than adult survival in the source and control populations. Despite this, offspring of relocated animals (the next generation, regardless of life stage) survived at similar rates to individuals in the source and control populations. Simulations revealed that the relocated population was self-sustaining under different scenarios and that the fate (e.g., stability or increase) of the simulated populations was highly dependent on the fecundity of relocated adults and their offspring. To summarize, our results indicate that survival in relocated individuals is lower than in non-relocated individuals but that this cost (i.e., reduced survival) disappears in the second generation. A finer understanding of how relocation affects demographic processes is an important step in improving relocation success of amphibians and other animals.

We examined the regional and local factors influencing lifetime productivity (number and richness of occupants) of individual tree cavities across two divergent forest ecosystems: temperate mixed forest in Canada and subtropical Atlantic Forest, Argentina. We predicted that (1) species would accumulate more rapidly within cavities in the species-rich system (Argentina: 76 species) than the poorer system (Canada: 31 species), (2) cavity characteristics associated with nest-site selection in short-term studies would predict lifetime cavity productivity, and (3) species would accumulate more rapidly across highly used cavities than across cavities used only once, and in Argentina than in Canada. We monitored and measured nesting cavities used by birds and mammals over 22 breeding seasons (1995-2016) in Canada and 12 breeding seasons (2006-2017) in Argentina. Cavities were used an average of 3.1 times by 1.7 species in Canada and 2.2 times by 1.4 species in Argentina. Species richness within cavities increased with number of nesting events at similar rates in Canada and Argentina, in both cases much slower than expected if within-cavity species assemblages were random, suggesting that lifetime richness of individual cavities is more strongly influenced by local ecological factors (nest site fidelity, nest niche) than by the regional species pool. The major determinant of lifetime cavity productivity was the cavity's life span. We found only weak or inconsistent relationships with cavity characteristics selected by individuals in short-term nest-site selection studies. Turnover among (vs. within) cavities was the primary driver of diversity at the landscape scale. In Canada, as predicted, species accumulation was fastest when sampling across high-use cavities. In Argentina, the rates of species accumulation were similar across high- and low-use cavities, and fastest when both high- and low-use cavities were pooled. These findings imply that biodiversity of cavity nesters is maintained by a mix of long-lived (highly productive, legacy trees) and many high-turnover (single-use, fast decaying) tree cavities. Conservation of both long-lasting and single-use cavities should be incorporated into decisions about stand-level forest management, regional land use policies, and reserve networks.

Effects of impulsive noise on marine mammals: investigating range-dependent risk	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						auditory damage; marine mammals; pile driving; seismic survey; sound propagation; underwater noise	TEMPORARY THRESHOLD SHIFT; HEARING-LOSS; EXPOSURE; RECOVERY; SOUNDS; TTS	Concerns exist about the impacts of underwater noise on marine mammals. These include auditory damage, which is a significant risk for marine mammals exposed to impulsive sounds such as explosions, pile-driving, and seismic air guns. Currently, impact assessments use different risk criteria for impulsive and non-impulsive sounds (e.g., ships, drilling). However, as impulsive sounds dissipate through the environment, they potentially lose hazardous features (e.g., sudden onset) and become non-impulsive at some distance from the source. Despite management implications, a lack of data on range-dependent characteristics currently limits their inclusion in impact assessments. We address this using acoustic recordings of seismic air guns and pile-driving to quantify range dependency in impulsive characteristics using four criteria: (1) rise time < 25 ms; (2) quotient of peak pressure and pulse duration > 5,000 Pa/s; (3) duration < 1 s; (4) crest factor > 15 dB. We demonstrate that some characteristics changed markedly within ranges of therefore similar to 10 km, and that the mean probability of exceeding criteria 1 and 2 was 3.5 km. In contrast, the mean probability of exceeding criteria 3 remained >0.5 up to similar to 37.0 km, and the mean probability of exceeding criteria 4 remained <0.5 throughout the range. These results suggest that a proportion of the recorded signals should be defined as impulsive based on each of the criteria, and that some of the criteria change markedly as a result of propagation. However, the impulsive nature of a sound is likely to be a complex interaction of all these criteria, and many other unrelated parameters such as duty cycle, recovery periods, and sound levels will also strongly affect the risk of hearing damage. We recommend future auditory damage studies and impact assessments explicitly consider the ranges at which sounds may lose some of their potentially hazardous characteristics.

Bio-energetic modeling of medium-sized cetaceans shows high sensitivity to disturbance in seasons of low resource supply	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						cetacean life history; Dynamic Energy Budget model; Globicephala melas; lifetime reproductive output; marine mammals; population consequences of disturbance; vital rates	FINNED PILOT WHALES; POPULATION CONSEQUENCES; LIFE-HISTORY; GLOBICEPHALA-MELAS; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH; SEALS; RATES	Understanding the full scope of human impact on wildlife populations requires a framework to assess the population-level repercussions of nonlethal disturbance. The Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) framework provides such an approach, by linking the effects of disturbance on the behavior and physiology of individuals to their population-level consequences. Bio-energetic models have been used as implementations of PCoD, as these integrate the behavioral and physiological state of an individual with the state of the environment, to mediate between disturbance and biological significant changes in vital rates (survival, growth, and reproduction). To assess which levels of disturbance lead to adverse effects on population growth rate requires a bio-energetic model that covers the complete life cycle of the organism under study. In a density-independent setting, the expected lifetime reproductive output of a single female can then be used to predict the level of disturbance that leads to population decline. Here, we present such a model for a medium-sized cetacean, the long-finned pilot whale (Globicephala melas). Disturbance is modeled as a yearly recurrent period of no resource feeding for the pilot whale female and her calf. Short periods of disturbance lead to the pre-weaned death of the first one or more calves of the young female. Higher disturbance levels also affect survival of calves produced later in the life of the female, in addition to degrading female survival. The level of disturbance that leads to a negative population growth rate strongly depends on the available resources in the environment. This has important repercussion for the timing of disturbance if resource availability fluctuates seasonally. The model predicts that pilot whales can tolerate on average three times longer periods of disturbance in seasons of high resource availability, compared to disturbance happening when resources are low. Although our model is specifically parameterized for pilot whales, it provides useful insights into the general consequences of nonlethal disturbance. If appropriate data on life history and energetics are available, it can be used to provide management advice for specific species or populations.

Spatially explicit network analysis reveals multi-species annual cycle movement patterns of sea ducks	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						connectivity; eider; flyway; Long-tailed Duck; migration; molt; network analysis; Scoter; sea duck; stopover	LONG-DISTANCE MIGRATION; HABITAT PATCHES; SITE-FIDELITY; TAILED DUCKS; CONSERVATION; CONNECTIVITY; CENTRALITY; DYNAMICS; PACKAGE; WORLDS	Conservation of long-distance migratory species poses unique challenges. Migratory connectivity, that is, the extent to which groupings of individuals at breeding sites are maintained in wintering areas, is frequently used to evaluate population structure and assess use of key habitat areas. However, for species with complex or variable annual cycle movements, this traditional bimodal framework of migratory connectivity may be overly simplistic. Like many other waterfowl, sea ducks often travel to specific pre- and post-breeding sites outside their nesting and wintering areas to prepare for migration by feeding extensively and, in some cases, molting their flight feathers. These additional migrations may play a key role in population structure, but are not included in traditional models of migratory connectivity. Network analysis, which applies graph theory to assess linkages between discrete locations or entities, offers a powerful tool for quantitatively assessing the contributions of different sites used throughout the annual cycle to complex spatial networks. We collected satellite telemetry data on annual cycle movements of 672 individual sea ducks of five species from throughout eastern North America and the Great Lakes. From these data, we constructed a multi-species network model of migratory patterns and site use over the course of breeding, molting, wintering, and migratory staging. Our results highlight inter- and intra-specific differences in the patterns and complexity of annual cycle movement patterns, including the central importance of staging and molting sites in James Bay, the St. Lawrence River, and southern New England to multi-species annual cycle habitat linkages, and highlight the value of Long-tailed Ducks (Calengula haemalis) as an umbrella species to represent the movement patterns of multiple sea duck species. We also discuss potential applications of network migration models to conservation prioritization, identification of population units, and integrating different data streams.

Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) can provide exactly this, and is therefore a promising technology to support future nature management and related applications. However, until now studies evaluating the potential of LIDAR for this field have been highly limited in scope. Here, we assess the potential of LIDAR to estimate the local diversity of four species groups in multiple habitat types, from open grasslands and meadows over shrubland to forests and across a large area (similar to 43,000 km(2)), providing a crucial step toward enabling the application of LIDAR in practice, planning, and policy-making. We assessed the relationships between the species richness of macrofungi, lichens, bryophytes, and plants, respectively, and 25 LIDAR-based measures related to potential abiotic and biotic diversity drivers. We used negative binomial generalized linear modeling to construct 19 different candidate models for each species group, and leave-one-region-out cross validation to select the best models. These best models explained 49%, 31%, 32%, and 28% of the variation in species richness (R-2) for macrofungi, lichens, bryophytes, and plants, respectively. Three LIDAR measures, terrain slope, shrub layer height and variation in local heat load, were important and positively related to the richness in three of the four species groups. For at least one of the species groups, four other LIDAR measures, shrub layer density, medium-tree layer density, and variations in point amplitude and in relative biomass, were among the three most important. Generally, LIDAR measures exhibited strong associations to the biotic environment, and to some abiotic factors, but were poor measures of spatial landscape and temporal habitat continuity. In conclusion, we showed how well LIDAR alone can predict the local biodiversity across habitats. We also showed that several LIDAR measures are highly correlated to important biodiversity drivers, which are notoriously hard to measure in the field. This opens up hitherto unseen possibilities for using LIDAR for cost-effective monitoring and management of local biodiversity across species groups and habitat types even over large areas.

Thus, the magnitude of the effects and their relative importance to species distributions may vary among ecosystems due to anthropogenic stressors. To investigate context dependency in factors governing microbial bioindicators, we developed species distribution models (SDMs) for epilithic stream diatom species in human-impacted and pristine sites separately. We performed SDMs using boosted regression trees for 110 stream diatom species, which were common to both data sets, in 164 human-impacted and 164 pristine sites in Finland (covering similar to 1,000 km, 60 degrees to 68 degrees N). For each species and site group, two sets of models were conducted: climate model, comprising three climatic variables, and full model, comprising the climatic and six local environmental variables. No significant difference in model performance was found between the site groups. However, climatic variables had greater importance compared with local environmental variables in pristine sites, whereas local environmental variables had greater importance in human-impacted sites as hypothesized. Water balance and conductivity were the key variables in human-impacted sites. The relative importance of climatic and local environmental variables varied among individual species, but also between the site groups. We found a clear context dependency among the variables influencing stream diatom distributions as the most important factors varied both among species and between the site groups. In human-impacted streams, species distributions were mainly governed by water chemistry, whereas in pristine streams by climate. We suggest that climatic models may be suitable in pristine ecosystems, whereas the full models comprising both climatic and local environmental variables should be used in human-impacted ecosystems.

Optimizing industrial-scale coral reef restoration: comparing harvesting wild coral spawn slicks and transplanting gravid adult colonies	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						corals of opportunity; harvest; restoration; spawn slicks; transplant	RECRUITMENT; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGY	Accelerating coral reef restoration is a global challenge that has been attempted around the world. Previous attempts show varying levels of success at localized scales, but comparisons of cost and benefits to evaluate large-scale reef restoration approaches are lacking. Here, we compare two large-scale restoration approaches: the harvesting, development, and release of wild coral spawn slicks onto a target reef, with the transplantation of gravid coral colonies to provide a seed population and local source of larvae. Comparisons incorporate the best available information on demographic rates to estimate population growth, beginning at embryo production to colony maturity 4 years following deployment. Cost-effectiveness is considered in a coarse manner. The harvesting, development, and controlled release of coral spawn slicks is anticipated to achieve large-scale restoration of coral communities with low-impact technology at low cost per colony. Harvesting wild spawn slicks has the potential to (1) transport billions of larvae up to thousands of kilometers that (2) are relevant to coral restoration efforts at vast geographical scales while (3) benefitting from the use of technology with extremely low impact on wild populations and (4) retaining natural genetic and species diversity needed to enhance the resilience of restored communities. Transplanting colonies is most useful from reefs designated to be impacted by infrastructural development by providing an opportunity for transfer to high value zones, from dedicated nurseries, and for brooding species. Our contribution provides insights into critical elements of both concepts, and we highlight information gaps in parameter uncertainties.

However, remnant peatlands persist on the periphery of extracted surfaces. These remnant peatlands drop steeply to extracted surfaces, producing artificial ecotones that are more challenging to restore. We asked to what degree natural ecotones at undisturbed reference fens can act as models for the restoration of artificial ecotones around an extracted peatland, and whether management actions can ameliorate conditions in artificial ecotones. We compared changes in elevation, water table, peat, and multiple vegetation characteristics between natural ecotones and unmanaged artificial ecotones. We then clear-cut peripheral strips, completely filled perimeter canals, and smoothed peripheral slopes around sections of the extracted surfaces to assess whether hydrological conditions improved. Without management, artificial ecotones are not good models of natural ecotones. The elevation gradient is steep, and water tables drop steeply within 8 m of blocked perimeter canals, with possible effects at 25 m. The consequent vegetation had denser tree saplings, faster tree growth, almost no moss cover, and low moss species richness. After these management actions, water tables increased to within approximately 5 cm of those along natural ecotones. Future study is required to assess the extent of vegetation recovery, but these results hold promise for a more holistic rehabilitation of ecotones on the periphery of extracted peatland surfaces. We present recommendations to optimize the management actions on the periphery of extracted peatlands.

Restoration potential of invaded abandoned agricultural fields: what does the seed bank tell us?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						above- and belowground similarity; ecological disturbance; environmental degradation; Pteronia incana; rangeland restoration; shrub invasion	SPECIES RICHNESS; EASTERN CAPE; INVASIVE PLANTS; PEDDIE DISTRICT; ALIEN PLANTS; IMPACT; VEGETATION; COMMUNITIES; MUNICIPALITY; CONSERVATION	Soil seed banks can play an important role in the restoration of degraded ecosystems, especially where indigenous species are well represented in, and invasive species are largely absent from, the seed bank. Here, we studied the potential contribution of the soil seed bank to the restoration of invaded, abandoned agricultural fields in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. We recorded the aboveground cover and belowground abundance of all vascular plant species from 120 quadrats that differ in cover of the extralimital woody invader, Pteronia incana. Our results show that higher cover of P. incana is associated with lower species richness, aboveground cover, and belowground seed abundance. Furthermore, community similarity between the above- and belowground component was low, with the seed bank and standing vegetation having only 15 species in common and 49 species being recorded only from the seed bank. We suggest that this large number of seed bank-only species is a relic of previous vegetation, prior to large-scale invasion by P. incana. The most important finding from our study is the absence of P. incana from the soil seed bank. This finding, combined with the large number of mostly native species from the seed bank, holds promise from a restoration perspective. However, given the susceptibility of the invaded systems to erosion, coupled with the low grazing value of the seed bank species, we suggest that P. incana removal should be accompanied by both erosion control measures and reseeding with palatable grass species, to secure the livelihoods of local communities.

Long-term plant community trajectories suggest divergent responses of native and non-native perennials and annuals to vegetation removal and seeding treatments	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate variability; Intermountain West; rehabilitation; restoration; vegetation management; wildfire	GRASS AGROPYRON-CRISTATUM; SAGEBRUSH STEPPE; GREAT-BASIN; RESTORATION; WILDFIRE; FORESTS; TRENDS; PRECIPITATION; ESTABLISHMENT; PERSPECTIVES	Land managers frequently apply vegetation removal and seeding treatments to restore ecosystem function following woody plant encroachment, invasive species spread, and wildfire. However, the long-term outcome of these treatments is unclear due to a lack of widespread monitoring. We quantified how vegetation removal (via wildfire or management) with or without seeding and environmental conditions related to plant community composition change over time in 491 sites across the intermountain western United States. Most community metrics took over 10 years to reach baseline conditions posttreatment, with the slowest recovery observed for native perennial cover. Total cover was initially higher in sites with seeding after vegetation removal than sites with vegetation removal alone, but increased faster in sites with vegetation removal only. Seeding after vegetation removal was associated with rapidly increasing non-native perennial cover and decreasing non-native annual cover. Native perennial cover increased in vegetation removal sites irrespective of seeding and was suppressed by increasing non-native perennial cover. Seeding was associated with higher non-native richness across the monitoring period as well as initially higher, then declining, total and native species richness. Several cover and richness recovery metrics were positively associated with mean annual precipitation and negatively associated with mean annual temperature, whereas relationships with weather extremes depended on the lag time and season. Our results suggest that key plant groups, such as native perennials and non-native annuals, respond to restoration treatments at divergent timescales and with different sensitivities to climate and weather variation.

Selection of shade trees in forest restoration plantings should not be based on crown tree architecture alone	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						ecological restoration; invasive grasses; photosynthetically active radiation; shading	TROPICAL FORESTS; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; SPECIES COMPOSITION; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; ADULT STATURE; COSTA-RICA; ALLOMETRY; LIGHT; PLASTICITY; RESPONSES	The planting of tree seedlings is a common restoration technique in the tropics, and using large-crowned, fast-growing shade species is recommended to suppress invasive grasses and accelerate forest succession. We analyzed the effectiveness of shade species in shading the forest floor during the rainy and dry seasons at young forest restoration sites, whether shade changes according to site for a given species, and whether crown architecture can predict the shade level. We measured the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by the tree crowns of 14 species in two 3-year-old restoration plantings. The ability to predict shade based on crown architecture traits was evaluated using multiple linear regressions. The interception of PAR varied according to species, site, and season for seven species and was generally higher during the rainy season. Low values of tree and first branch height and high values of trunk diameter and mean area of a leaf predicted greater light interception. For the dry season, the ability to predict PAR interception was weaker than that for the rainy season and affected by a shorter tree height and a greater crown area. The crown architecture of shade species did not completely predict their shading ability, and the preselection of shade species for forest restoration purposes based only on crown architecture traits is not effective. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors, such as how long trees retain their leaves throughout the year and the soil and management conditions of the sites undergoing restoration, during the selection of species.

Rebuilding coral reefs: success (and failure) 16 years after low-cost, low-tech restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						coral recruitment; coral reefs; Coral Triangle; destructive fishing; dynamite or blast fishing; rehabilitation	INCLINED ANALYSES; REHABILITATION; FEASIBILITY; RECOVERY; MANAGEMENT	Calls for coral reef restoration are increasing amidst continued declines, yet we know little about long-term outcomes and conditions that lead to successful coral recovery. Here, we report on one of the longest monitoring studies following 16 years of large-scale, "low-tech" experimental reef rehabilitation on rubble fields created by chronic blast fishing in Komodo National Park, Indonesia. After blast fishing had stopped, in the absence of rehabilitation, hard coral cover in rubble fields remained about 3% from 1999 to 2016, but on rehabilitation treatments, cover increased from 0% in 2002 to 44.5% (+/- 21.9% SD) in 2016. Coral cover varied among sites and treatments (ranging from 80% in 2016) in patterns that may reflect current strength and turbidity. Our results demonstrate that low-tech substrate stabilization can facilitate natural coral recruitment and growth. We conclude that relatively low-cost methods can deliver sustained rehabilitation of hard coral cover and that long-term monitoring should be incorporated more widely in restoration activities to inform return on investment.

Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and subsequent two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a significant difference in microhabitat use by brook and non-native trout within restored pools. We also detected a significant difference in microhabitat use by brook trout occupying pools in allopatry versus those occupying pools in sympatry with non-native trout-a pattern that appears to be modulated by size. Smaller brook trout often occupied pools in the absence of non-native species, where they used shallower and faster focal habitats. Larger brook trout occupied pools with, and utilized similar focal habitats (i.e. deeper, slower velocity) as, non-native trout. Non-native trout consistently occupied more thermally suitable microhabitats closer to cover as compared to brook trout, including the use of thermal refugia (i.e. ambient-focal temperature >2 degrees C). These results suggest that non-native trout influence brook trout use of restored habitats by: (1) displacing smaller brook trout from restored pools, and (2) displacing small and large brook trout from optimal microhabitats (cooler, deeper, and lower velocity). Consequently, benefits of habitat restoration in large rivers may only be fully realized by brook trout in the absence of non-native species. Future research within this and other large river systems should characterize brook trout response to stream restoration following removal of non-native species.

Stability of spatial patterns in water chemistry across temperate ecoregions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						water quality; stability; catchment; monitoring; river network	HIGH-FREQUENCY; QUALITY; CATCHMENTS; STREAM; NUTRIENTS; NITROGEN; IMPACT; CARBON	Human activity has polluted freshwater ecosystems across the planet, harming biodiversity, human health, and the economy. Improving water quality depends on identifying pollutant sources in river networks, but pollutant concentrations fluctuate in time. Continuous monitoring of many points in river networks is expensive, impeding progress in developing countries where water quality is degrading fastest. In this study, we analyzed 4523 water chemistry time series of ten parameters (NO3-, PO43-, TP, DOC, SO42-, Cl-, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) across four temperate ecoregions in France (ca. 560 000 km(2)). We quantified the spatial stability of water chemistry across the monitoring stations using rank correlations between instantaneous concentrations and water quality metrics derived from 6-year time series (2010-2015). The strength of this rank correlation represents how well a water quality evaluation metric can be characterized with a single sampling for a given water quality parameter. Results show that a single sampling captured a mean of 88% of the spatial variability of these parameters, across ecoregions with different climate and land-use conditions. The spatial stability resulted both from high spatial variability among sites and high temporal synchrony among time series. These findings demonstrate that infrequent but spatially dense water sampling can achieve two of the major goals of water quality monitoring: identify pollutant sources and inform ideal locations for conservation and restoration interventions.

Themanagement options in a low-input system, like forest coffee (Coffea arabica), arelimited and there are several factors out of farmers' control driving their vulnerability to changing climatic conditions. These can relate to social structures and landscape factors, which can interact to reduce farmers' adaptive capacity, creating a state of contextual vulnerability. We explored the potential synergies of this interaction across elevation, patch area and shade management gradients for smallholder coffee farms around theUNESCOYayu Coffee Forest BiosphereReserve in Ethiopia before, during and immediately following the 2015/16 El Nino. We documented a dramatic collapse in coffee yields across all farms, resulting in coffee incomes 29.5% +/- 18.0% and 19.5% +/- 10.0% of 2014 incomes in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We identified farms at elevations between 1500 and 1600mwith canopy openness between 40% and 45% as being consistently lowyielding over our study period. We found these farmers had the highest rates of income diversification and, therefore, were already exhibiting adaptive capacity. Farmerswith the largest income losses were spatially concentrated between 1600 and 1700m, located in larger patch areas with lower canopy openness. Farmers at this elevation have access to poor infrastructure, restrictions on shademanagement and reported higher dependence on incomefromcoffee, indicating an interaction of biotic and social factors exacerbating their vulnerability. Unfortunately, due to a nationally declared state of emergency, wewere unable to survey farmers on the adaptivemeasures they undertook; therefore, we are limited in assessing their resilience. However, we do show the importance of considering both biotically and socially-mediated influences for assessing smallholder vulnerability, particularly barriers to diversifying incomes.

Climate change driven warming and drying will likely alter peatland DOC dynamics; however, few field studies have quantified the individual and interactive effects of temperature and moisture changes. Using a full factorial water table (control, drained 2 years [experimental], drained 12 years [drained]) x warming (ambient, open-top chamber warming) x microform (hummock, hollow) study design, we monitored DOC concentration and spectrophotometric properties (specific ultraviolet absorbance [SUVA], E2/E3, E4/E6) in a wooded boreal bog in Alberta, Canada. Ecohydrological conditions including water table (WT), soil temperature, plant cover, biomass, and productivity were also measured at each plot. We observed a significant interaction between WT treatment, warming and microform for explaining variation in DOC concentrations, with the highest values at drained, warmed hummocks. Overall, drainage resulted in higher DOC concentration. DOC concentration and E2/E3 increased, whereas SUVA decreased, in response to greater plant productivity (i.e., more negative values of gross ecosystem photosynthesis). For DOC concentration and SUVA, this correlation was largely driven by drained, warmed hummocks where shrub growth increased. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicated that shrub and lichen cover, along with WT and soil temperature, were important for explaining variation in DOC concentration and quality. The results indicate that, although DOC concentrations in peatlands are likely to increase under climate change, much of this increase may be from recent carbon fixation, suggesting more rapid carbon cycling as opposed to destabilization of existing carbon stocks.

We compared the capacity of three process domains-lakes, slow-flowing reaches, and rapids-to disperse and retain plant propagules by releasing small wooden cubes as propagule mimics during the spring flood and recording their final locations. We also measured the geomorphic characteristics (planform, longitudinal profile, cross-sectional morphology, and wood) of each process domain. The three process domains all differed in morphology and hydraulics, and those characteristics were important in shaping the transport capacity of mimics. On average, lakes retained more mimics than slow-flowing reaches but did not differ from the retainment of rapids. Living macrophytes were the most efficient element trapping mimics. In rapids and slow-flowing reaches, most trapped mimics remained floating, whereas in lakes, most mimics ended up on the banks. The decay curves of retention varied substantially among and within process domains. The results suggest that managers who rely on natural recovery of restored sites by means of plant immigration may benefit from understanding landscape patterns when deciding upon the location of restoration measures in stream networks.

The present study aimed to verify which parameters of ant and dung beetle communities (species richness, abundance, unbiased Shannon diversity, and turnover rates) are most useful for evaluating the relative influence of small forest patches (< 50ha) and landscape in the tropical rainforest of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We recorded a total of 106 species of ants and 30 species of dung beetle. The ant and dung beetle assemblages were related in different ways to patch and landscape attributes. Hypogeic ants were more sensitive to patch attributes, particularly vegetation composition, compared to landscape attributes. Epigeic ant assemblages are likely a disturbance indicator, or theassemblages have already homogenized across the region. Arboreal ant assemblages were particularly sensitive to fragmentation and responded to within-patch vegetation and landscape configuration. Dung beetles were more sensitive to landscape composition than to patch attributes. Given these findings, the biomonitoring of ants and dung beetles should focus on both patch and landscape attributesin fragmented landscapes to maintain the different ecosystem functions provided by them.

Predators and priority effects suggested as potential drivers of microfauna communities in a community transplantation experiment along an elevational gradient	OIKOS			English	Article						bromeliad; community structure; elevational gradient; environmental change; microfauna; trophic interactions	SARRACENIA-PURPUREA; PITCHER PLANT; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; INSECT COMMUNITIES; TROPHIC STRUCTURE; LITTER QUALITY; TOP-DOWN; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; TANK	Transplantation experiments are a useful method to identify responses of organisms to environmental change. However, they are typically restricted to single or few species. Our experiment was carried out using entire bromeliad-inhabiting microfauna communities which were transplanted along an elevational gradient, simulating environmental change acting on the communities. Additionally, we manipulated trophic interactions, i.e. resource availability and predator presence, thus combining abiotic and biotic effects in a full-factorial experimental design. Using this experiment, we found a strong signal of original elevation in microfauna community structure (abundance, evenness, functional composition) with a shift from amoeba-dominated to flagellate-dominated communities with increasing original elevation. Surprisingly, the transplantation of communities along the elevational gradient did not affect community structure, indicating strong priority effects. Predation decreased microfauna abundance and increased microfauna evenness, specifically in higher original elevation and high resource levels. In summary, our results suggest that microfauna communities in bromeliads might be primarily shaped by priority effects and predator presence. However, interacting effects (between predator presence and resource availability, as well as between predator presence and original elevation) highlight the usefulness of studies with full-factorial experimental designs to understand community-structuring processes. Bromeliads and other micro-ecosystems provide convenient study systems for community level approaches that could be used in future studies concerning the effects of environmental change, for example climate change on community structure.

CRUSTACEA; DIKEROGAMMARUS-VILLOSUS; RECOGNITION; AMPHIPOD; ECOLOGY	Non-consumptive effects (NCEs) of predators so called 'fear' responses encompass costly antipredator behaviours, such as reduced feeding efficiency. NCEs can influence prey population dynamics and community structure, if prey are 'keystone' species such as Gammarus spp. amphipod 'shrimps'. These freshwater macro invertebrates have the ecosystem functional role of shredding fallen leaf litter, making it accessible to other taxa. Across Europe, the invasive predatory 'killer shrimp' Dikerogammarus villosus is replacing resident Gammarus spp., potentially threatening this vital ecosystem function. While predation (consumptive effects (CEs)) of this invader has been well studied, for the first time we test whether NCEs can be evident in prey only exposed to D. villosus presence and whether this could potentially impact on the prey's functional role. In mesocosms, exposure to constrained D. villosus did not result in mortalities of any of three Gammarus prey species but the leaf shredding efficiencies of all prey were significantly reduced compared to a control treatment. This clear NCE has the potential to propagate through the ecological community via decreased energy processing. This study demonstrates the potential for fear of invasive predator presence alone to impact on ecosystem function.

We studied how millipede assemblages (Diplopoda) vary between forest, forest edge, and meadow habitats in this specific karst environment. We sampled millipedes by pitfall trapping during two vegetation seasons (from March to October in 2001 and 2002) in approximately monthly intervals across nine sites in Central Slovakia (Velka Fatra Mts). In total, 951 individuals belonging to 12 species from 6 families and 10 orders were collected. The dominant species was Unciger foetidus, which was also one of the two most frequent species along with Polydesmus complanatus. Although the total number of captured millipedes was greatest on forest edges (395 individuals), intermediate in meadows, and lowest in forests (214 individuals), millipede abundance and species composition varied considerably within each habitat type among the sites. Total millipede species richness in meadow and forest edge habitats was the same (11 species) and it was lower in forest habitats (7 species), while species diversity (Shannon's H') and equitability (E) were greatest in meadows. Millipede diversity measures (species richness or equitability) were correlated positively with species richness of herb layer and negatively with shrub layer equitability, soil conductivity, and soil phosphorus. Thus, we found complex patterns of heterogeneity in millipede community composition and richness across studied habitats and elevations that were driven by habitat type and plant community and soil characteristics. While millipede abundance patterns varied, open habitats supported most species-rich millipede communities at lower elevations, while forest edges were most species rich at the high elevation.

Complex effects of nonpollinating wasps on the relationship between pollinating wasp and seed production in Ficus andicola	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Exploitation; Ficus; Fig-wasp; Mutualism stability; Nonpollinating fig-wasp	FIG WASPS; EVOLUTION; COEVOLUTION; MUTUALISM; STABILITY; ECOLOGY; CONFLICT; IDARNES	Mutualisms are evolutionarily unstable because an imbalance in benefits obtained by the two partners may make the interaction exploitative. In the Ficus-Agaonidae system, it is advantageous for pollinating wasps (PW) to lay eggs in as many flowers as possible within a fig, to maximize offspring production. From the trees perspective, however, a balance is expected between seed and wasp production, as wasps represent the trees male function. The key to the system's stability requires explaining why PW mainly use internal flowers for egg-laying, leaving those closer to the fig's wall for seed production. An hypothesis proposes that nonpollinating fig-wasps (NPFW), which exploit the system by laying eggs in figs but not pollinating, help stabilize the mutualism. We compared seed and PW production in figs of F. andicola with and without NPFW. In unexploited figs, seed and PW numbers were negatively correlated, and the PW/seeds proportion was 3:1. In exploited figs, seed and PW numbers were positively correlated, and the PW/seed ratio was approximately 1:1. This pattern may result from an indirect effect of Idames gr. fiavicollis on PW. This species of NPFW lays before or simultaneously with PW in the same kind of flowers, causing PW to spend more time searching for free ovaries, thus reducing their laying rate. Alternatively, PW may reject some flowers to reduce the risk of exploitation by NPFW. In unexploited figs, PW use more flowers at the expense of seed production. In exploited figs, NPFW restrict flower use by PW, favoring a balance in the seeds/PW ratio. This effect only occurs at low exploitation levels. The absence of NPFW favors PW, whereas high exploitation levels are detrimental for both seeds and PW. A high spatial and temporal variability in exploitation rates seems required to avoid directional selection favoring PW or NPFW, thus stabilizing the mutualism.

Multi-year (2008-2017) chemical data from 25 HML from the Gran Paradiso National Park (Western Italian Alps) were used to address two specific objectives: (1) assess the major determinants of HML hydrochemistry; (2) identify any multi-years trend attributable to global change. Local trends in climatic variables and NO3-, NH4+, and SO42- deposition were evaluated over the same period as possible drivers of lake chemistry. We were able to explain most of the variance associated to the major ion concentration, but much less of that associated with nutrient content and with variables related to atmospheric deposition (e.g. Cl-, Na+, inorganic N). The explanation of which probably requires studies at a regional scale. As a whole, lake chemistry depends on the interplay of several environmental variables, including the impact of human activities (i.e. point source of organic pollutants). Catchment geology and vegetation cover influence several variables related to weathering processes, which show a general increase over the last 10years. This general trend can be attributable to climatic variability enhancing weathering processes in lake catchments. However, a concomitant decrease of precipitation amount and the deposition of acidifying compounds may have contributed to the observed trends. Meteorological data were almost unrelated to HML hydrochemistry, suggesting that lake chemical composition would depend more strongly on long-term climatic variations rather than on short-term meteorological events.

Edge-to-interior distribution patterns are, however, poorly studied for litter- and soil-dwelling fauna, such as terrestrial gastropods, despite their high densities and significant impact on ecosystem processes, as both herbivores and detritivores. Therefore, we investigated edge-to-interior abundance patterns of terrestrial gastropods in 224 fragmented forest patches across Western Europe. Catching over 15,000 gastropods, we found that slug abundance is reduced in forest edges, while snail abundance shows no response on the edge effect. We hypothesize that these patterns could be explained by higher drought tolerance of snails, since forest edges have reduced air and soil humidity and elevated temperatures compared to forest interiors. Reduced slug abundance in forest edges potentially has ecological consequences for herbivory in and outside forest patches and nutrient cycling.

Vultures provide a valuable example of complex social animals, with potential conflicts between cooperative and competitive behaviors. Yet, little is known about the socio-genetic structure of this guild because of the inherent difficulties of sampling highly mobile species with large geographical ranges. Herein, we genotyped 300 non-invasive samples from Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) with microsatellite markers to investigate the social dynamics in this highly vagile vulture that possess a despotic social system and communal roosting behavior. We explored the role of age and sex in the dispersion and relatedness patterns of the Andean condor across the central region of Argentina. We provided evidence of age-biased dispersal, supporting the idea that immature condors are largely nomadic using temporary roosting sites during exploratory flights. Our results also insinuated that sex-biased dispersal is age-dependent, with male-biased dispersal during the early life stage, suggesting habitat exclusion by adult male despotic competition. Finally, our kinship analysis showed that regional clusters are composed of highly related adults, indicating the retention of intergenerational family members. Collectively, these results demonstrate that kin associations are driven by adult philopatry, and possibly maintained by fitness benefits of social cooperation for this species.Significance statementAn important question in behavioral ecology is how and when does group living affect population structure and space use. We show that adult Andean condors exhibit philopatric behavior, resulting in kin structuring patterns. Family coalitions may facilitate cooperative strategies to locate and secure costly resources, resulting in indirect fitness benefits. However, immature individuals seem to be excluded from adult territories due to despotic competition or because of an innate exploratory behavior, resulting in a scattered distribution pattern. Understanding the genetic consequences of social dynamics not only increase our knowledge of the behavioral ecology of elusive wide-ranging species, but is also essential in wildlife monitoring to design effective genetic sampling.

Hidden Markov Models Reveal Tactical Adjustment of Temporally Clustered Courtship Displays in Response to the Behaviors of a Robotic Female	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						hidden Markov model; display bouts; display rate; mate choice; courtship tactics; greater sage grouse	LEKKING SAGE GROUSE; SEXUAL SELECTION; MATING SUCCESS; MATE CHOICE; SIGNALS; TUTORIAL; ROLES; MALES; COST	We present a statistical approach-a custom-built hidden Markov model (HMM)-that is broadly applicable to the analysis of temporally clustered display events, as found in many animals, including birds, orthopterans, and anurans. This HMM can simultaneously estimate both the expected lengths of each animal's display bouts and their within-bout display rates. We highlight the HMM's ability to estimate changes in animals' display effort over time and across different social contexts, using data from male greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Male display effort was modeled across three sites in two experimental treatments (robotic female simulating interested or uninterested behavior) and in the presence or absence of live females. Across contexts, we show that sage grouse males primarily adjust their bout lengths rather than their within-bout display rates. Males' responses to female behavior were correlated with male mating success: males with more matings showed high display persistence regardless of female behavior, while males with fewer matings tended to invest selectively in females that were already showing interest in mating. Additionally, males with higher mating success responded more to the presence of a female than males with fewer matings did. We conclude with suggestions for adapting our HMM approach for use in other animal systems.

Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics in the Wild: Clonal Turnover and Stability in Daphnia Populations	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						compensatory dynamics; population dynamics; rapid adaptation; stability; zooplankton	RAPID EVOLUTION; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY; EMERGENCE; SELECTION; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; PULEX; TIME	There is increasing recognition of the importance of rapid adaptation in the dynamics of populations and communities. While the effects of rapid adaptation on the stability of populations have been shown in experimental systems, demonstration of their impacts in natural populations are rare. We examined the relationship between clonal dynamics and population stability of natural Daphnia pulex populations experiencing seasonal environmental variation. We show that the degree of asynchrony in a population's clonal dynamics is tightly linked to its population-level stability. Populations whose clonal abundances were more asynchronous were more stable temporally. Variation in asynchrony was related to variability in primary productivity, and experiments using clones from the study populations revealed significant genotype by environment interactions in response to food level. This suggests that clonal turnover was not due to neutral dynamics alone but may be linked to variation in functional traits associated with resource acquisition and conversion.

Statistical modeling of patterns in annual reproductive rates	ECOLOGY			English	Article						Conway-Maxwell-Poisson; fecundity; generalized Poisson; Heliconia acuminata; Oreothlypis celata; overdispersion; regression; underdispersion; zero-inflation	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; LIFE-HISTORY; COUNT DATA; GROWTH	Reproduction by individuals is typically recorded as count data (e.g., number of fledglings from a nest or inflorescences on a plant) and commonly modeled using Poisson or negative binomial distributions, which assume that variance is greater than or equal to the mean. However, distributions of reproductive effort are often underdispersed (i.e., variance < mean). When used in hypothesis tests, models that ignore underdispersion will be overly conservative and may fail to detect significant patterns. Here we show that generalized Poisson (GP) and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions are better choices for modeling reproductive effort because they can handle both overdispersion and underdispersion; we provide examples of how ecologists can use GP and CMP distributions in generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to quantify patterns in reproduction. Using a new R package, glmmTMB, we construct GLMMs to investigate how rainfall and population density influence the number of fledglings in the warbler Oreothlypis celata and how flowering rate of Heliconia acuminata differs between fragmented and continuous forest. We also demonstrate how to deal with zero-inflation, which occurs when there are more zeros than expected in the distribution, e.g., due to complete reproductive failure by some individuals.

Decomposition, a fundamental ecosystem function and strong driver of future fire occurrence, is highly sensitive to nutrient availability and is, therefore, particularly important in this context. Here we show that 40 yr of quadrennial (4yB) and biennial (2yB) prescribed burning result in severely P- and N-depleted litter stoichiometry, respectively, relative to fire exclusion. These effects exacerbated the nutrient limitation of microbial activities, constraining litter decomposition by 42.1% (4yB) and 23.6% (2yB) relative to unburned areas. However, invertebrate-driven decomposition largely compensated for the diminished capacity of micro-organisms under 4yB, suggesting that invertebrates could have an important stabilizing influence in fire-affected ecosystems. This effect was strongly positively coupled with the strength of microbial P-limitation and was not obviously or directly driven by fire regime-induced changes in invertebrate community assemblage. Together, our results reveal that high-frequency fire regimes promote nutrient-poor, carbon-rich ecosystem stoichiometry and, in doing so, disrupt ecosystem processes and modify the relative functionality of micro-organisms and invertebrates.

Faster movement in nonhabitat matrix promotes range shifts in heterogeneous landscapes	ECOLOGY			English	Article						area restricted search; Baltimore checkerspot butterfly; climate change; edge behavior; integrodifference equation; invasions; range expansion	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISPERSAL; BEHAVIOR; EXPANSION; SPREAD; CONNECTIVITY; RESTORATION; ADAPTATION; STRATEGIES	Ecologists often assume that range expansion will be fastest in landscapes composed entirely of the highest-quality habitat. Theoretical models, however, show that range expansion depends on both habitat quality and habitat-specific movement rates. Using data from 78 species in 70 studies, we find that animals typically have faster movement through lower-quality environments (73% of published cases). Therefore, if we want to manage landscapes for range expansion, there is a trade-off between promoting movement with nonhostile matrix, and promoting population growth with high-quality habitat. We illustrate how this trade-off plays out with the use of an exemplar species, the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly. For this species, we calculate that the expected rate of range expansion is fastest in landscapes with similar to 15% high-quality habitat. Behavioral responses to nonhabitat matrix have often been documented in animal populations, but rarely included in empirical predictions of range expansion. Considering movement behavior could change land-planning priorities from focus on high-quality habitat only to integrating high- and low-quality land cover types, and evaluating the costs and benefits of different matrix land covers for range expansion.

However, the response of soil microbial communities and their function to depleted C availability in situ is unclear. We evaluated the role of soil C inputs in controlling microbial biomass, community composition, physiology, and function by (1) experimentally excluding plant C inputs in situ for 9 yr in four temperate forest ecosystems along a productivity gradient in Oregon, USA; and (2) integrating these findings with published data from similar C-exclusion studies into a global meta-analysis. Excluding plant C inputs for 9 yr resulted in a 13% decrease in SOC across the four Oregon sites and an overall shift in the microbial community composition, with a 45% decrease in the fungal : bacterial ratio and a 13% increase in Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio. Although gross N mineralization decreased under C exclusion, decreases in gross N immobilization were greater, resulting in increased net N mineralization rates in all but the lowest-productivity site. Microbial biomass showed a variable response to C exclusion that was method dependent; however, we detected a 29% decrease in C-use efficiency across the sites, with greater declines occurring in less-productive sites. Although extracellular enzyme activity increased with C exclusion, C exclusion resulted in a 31% decrease in microbial respiration across all sites. Our meta-analyses of published data with similar C-exclusion treatments were largely consistent with our experimental results, showing decreased SOC, fungal : bacterial ratios, and microbial respiration, and increased Gram-positive : Gram-negative bacterial ratio following exclusion of C inputs to soil. Effect sizes of SOC and respiration correlated negatively with the duration of C exclusion; however, there were immediate effects of C exclusion on microbial community composition and biomass that were unaltered by duration of treatment. Our field-based experimental results and analyses demonstrate unequivocally the dominant control of C availability on soil microbial biomass, community composition, and function, and provide additional insight into the mechanisms for these effects in forest ecosystems.

Species insurance trumps spatial insurance in stabilizing biomass of a marine macroalgal metacommunity	ECOLOGY			English	Article						compensatory dynamics; kelp forests; metacommunity; spatial insurance hypothesis; spatial scale; stability; synchrony	ECOSYSTEM STABILITY; COMPENSATORY DYNAMICS; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; MACROCYSTIS-PYRIFERA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; SYNCHRONY; ABUNDANCE; PRODUCTIVITY	Because natural ecosystems are complex, it is difficult to predict how their variability scales across space and levels of organization. The species-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous dynamics among species should reduce variability when biomass is aggregated either from local species populations to local multispecies communities, or from metapopulations to metacommunities. Similarly, the spatial-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous spatial dynamics among either local populations or local communities should stabilize metapopulation biomass and metacommunity biomass, respectively. In combination, both species and spatial insurance reduce variation in metacommunity biomass over time, yet these insurances are rarely considered together in natural systems. We partitioned the extent that species insurance and spatial insurance reduced the annual variation in macroalgal biomass in a southern California kelp forest. We quantified variability and synchrony at two levels of organization (population and community) and two spatial scales (local plots and region) and quantified the strength of species and spatial insurance by comparing observed variability and synchrony in aggregate biomass to null models of independent species or spatial dynamics based on cyclic-shift permutation. Spatial insurance was weak, presumably because large-scale oceanographic processes in the study region led to high spatial synchrony at both population- and community-level biomass. Species insurance was stronger due to asynchronous dynamics among the metapopulations of a few common species. In particular, a regional decline in the dominant understory kelp species Pterygophora californica was compensated for by the rise of three subdominant species. These compensatory dynamics were associated with positive values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating that differential species tolerances to warmer temperature and nutrient-poor conditions may underlie species insurance in this system. Our results illustrate how species insurance can stabilize aggregate community properties in natural ecosystems where environmental conditions vary over broad spatial scales.

The strength of top-down control in these trophic cascades can be affected by the identity and diversity of predators, prey, and resources, as well as environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient loading, which can all impact interaction strength between trophic levels. Few studies have been able to replicate a complete community over a large geographic area to compare the full trophic cascade in a manipulative experiment. Here, we identify geographic dependency in trophic cascade strength, and the driving factors and specific mechanisms behind it, by combining geographically replicated experiments with a novel approach of community analogues of common garden and transplant experiments. We studied a predator-detritivore-detritus food web in bromeliads in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Brazil. We found that interaction strengths between resources, consumers, and predators were strongly site-specific, but the exact mechanism differed between trophic levels. Large bodied predators created strong interaction strengths between predator and consumer trophic levels, reducing consumer abundance regardless of the geographic location, whereas small-bodied predators created weak interactions with no impact on consumer abundances in any site. In contrast, the interaction strength between consumers and resources varied among sites, depending on the dominant species of leaf detritus. More labile leaf species in Costa Rica created a strong consumer-resource interaction and therefore strong trophic cascade, whereas tougher leaf species in Brazil created a weak consumer-resource interaction, and an overall weaker trophic cascade. Our study highlights the importance of replicating experiments over geographic scales to understand general patterns of ecological processes.

Dynamical systems theory shows that when ecosystems approach the point of loss of stability associated with these transitions, they take a long time to recover from perturbations, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. This generic feature of dynamical systems can offer early warning signals of abrupt transitions. However, these signals are qualitative and cannot quantify the thresholds of drivers at which transition may occur. Here, we propose a method to estimate critical thresholds from spatial data. We show that two spatial metrics, spatial variance and autocorrelation of ecosystem state variable, computed along driver gradients can be used to estimate critical thresholds. First, we investigate cellular-automaton models of ecosystem dynamics that show a transition from a high-density state to a bare state. Our models show that critical thresholds can be estimated as the ecosystem state and the driver values at which spatial variance and spatial autocorrelation of the ecosystem state are maximum. Next, to demonstrate the application of the method, we choose remotely sensed vegetation data (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) from regions in central Africa and northeast Australia that exhibit alternative states in woody cover. We draw transects (8 x 90 km) that span alternative stable states along rainfall gradients. Our analyses of spatial variance and autocorrelation of EVI along transects yield estimates of critical thresholds. These estimates match reasonably well with those obtained by an independent method that uses large-scale (250 x 200 km) spatial data sets. Given the generality of the principles that underlie our method, our method can be applied to a variety of ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states.

The scale-dependent effect of environmental filters on species turnover and nestedness in an estuarine benthic community	ECOLOGY			English	Article						abiotic filter; beta-diversity; brackish water; coastal lagoon; community assembly; hierarchical environmental filter; macrofauna	BETA DIVERSITY; SEDIMENT; COMPONENTS; DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; INVERTEBRATES; METAANALYSIS; RULES	Environmental filtering is a major mechanism structuring ecological communities. However, it is still not clear how different abiotic drivers composing the environmental filter interact with each other to determine local species assemblage and create spatial patterns in species distribution. Here, we evaluated the effects of two strong and uncorrelated environmental variables (salinity and sediment properties) on the beta-diversity of an estuarine macrobenthic community while accounting for spatial effects. Our results show that the benthic community composition has a strong spatial structure along the estuary, which can be greatly explained by salinity and sediment variation. Salinity is most associated with species replacement (turnover), whereas sediment is more important for species loss (nestedness). However, the effects of sediment variation on nestedness are mainly detected at a smaller spatial scale (estuarine sectors), whereas the effects of salinity on species turnover are stronger as spatial scale increases (entire estuary). Our findings suggest that environmental filters can drive both turnover and nestedness components of beta-diversity, but that their relative importance depends on the spatial scale of investigation. Although abiotic drivers associated with detrimental effects (sediment) usually result in nestedness, larger spatial scales encompass abiotic drivers associated with different suitable conditions (salinity), increasing the relative importance of the replacement component of species beta-diversity.

Interspecific prey aggregations or "neighborhoods" may therefore affect an individual's vulnerability to predation. We examined the influence of prey neighborhood structure (i.e., the densities and identities of prey neighborhoods) on spatial variation in predation in a multi-prey system with a primary apex predator. We combined GPS locations of lions (Panthera leo), kill-site surveys, and spatially explicit density estimates of five species of ungulates for which a significant level of predation was attributable to lions. In addition to the dual influence of predator activity and vegetation, predation risk was attributable to the structure of prey neighborhoods for at least two of the five species of prey. Along with traditionally recognized components of predation (the rate of predator-prey encounters and prey catchability), we encourage ecologists to consider how prey neighborhood structure influences spatial variation in predation risk.

Landscape patterns in top-down control of decomposition: omnivory disrupts a tropical detrital-based trophic cascade	ECOLOGY			English	Article						Anablepsoides hartii; detrital processing; detrital-based trophic cascade; killifish; leaf decomposition; leaf-shredding insects; macroconsumers; omnivory; Phylloicus hansoni; Poecilia reticulata; Trinidadian guppy; trophic cascade; tropical streams	LEAF-LITTER BREAKDOWN; EXPERIMENTS PREDICT; PREDATOR DIVERSITY; MASS RELATIONSHIPS; STREAM; FISH; EVOLUTION; SHRIMP; ADAPTATION; GRADIENT	Detrital-based trophic cascades are often considered weak or absent in tropical stream ecosystems because of the prevalence of omnivorous macroconsumers and the dearth of leaf-shredding insects. In this study, we isolate top-down effects of three macroconsumer species on detrital processing in headwater streams draining Trinidad's northern mountains. We separated effects of different macroconsumers by experimentally manipulating their temporal access to isolated benthic habitat over the diel cycle. We found no evidence that omnivorous macroconsumers, including a freshwater crab (Eudaniela garmani) and guppy (Poecilia reticulata), increased leaf decomposition via consumption. By contrast, above a waterfall excluding guppies, the insectivorous killifish, Anablepsoides hartii, reduced the biomass of the leaf-shredding insect Phylloicus hansoni 4-fold, which consequently reduced leaf decomposition rates 1.6-fold. This detrital cascade did not occur below the barrier waterfall, where omnivorous guppies join the assemblage and reduce killifish densities; here killifish had no significant effects on Phylloicus or decomposition rates. These patterns of detrital processing were also observed in upstream-downstream comparisons in a landscape study across paired reaches of six streams. Above waterfalls, where killifish were present, but guppies absent, leaf decomposition rates and Phylloicus biomass were 2.5- and similar to 35-fold lower, respectively, compared to measurements below waterfalls. Moreover, the strength of top-down control by killifish is reflected by the 20- and 5-fold reductions in variability (+/- SE) surrounding mean Phylloicus biomass and leaf decomposition rates in upstream relative to downstream reaches where no top-down control was detected. Findings show a clear, detrital-based trophic cascade among killifish, a leaf-shredding insect, and leaf decomposition rates. Results also show how omnivorous guppies disrupt this cascade by depressing killifish densities, thereby releasing invertebrate shredders from predation, and significantly increasing decomposition rates. Moreover, this combination of direct and indirect trophic interactions drives patterns in decomposition rates in stream networks at a landscape scale, resulting in significantly lower rates of decomposition above vs. below barrier waterfalls. Our findings reveal that omnivory can result in significant indirect effects on a key ecosystem process, illustrating the importance of these hidden trophic pathways in detrital-based systems and suggesting that resource control in tropical systems may be even more complex than previously envisioned.

Biological N fixation (BNF) may alleviate fire-induced N deficiencies that inhibit ecosystem recovery, yet if and how BNF achieves this under frequent fire is unclear. This problem is further complicated in the context of modern human influences (such as land-use history and atmospheric N deposition), which may confound the relationship between fire and fixation. Here, we investigate whether BNF supplies the N necessary to replace fire-induced N losses in restored longleaf pine savannas, and, if so, what factors control fixation. We established 54 1-ha plots of longleaf pine capturing 227 yr of forest recovery and a broad gradient of fire return interval (1.5-20 yr) at two sites in the southeastern United States. We quantified N fixation from three functional groups (herbaceous legumes, soil crusts, and asymbiotic N fixing bacteria), N losses from individual fire events and ecosystem dynamics of N supply and demand. We found that BNF rates were low but sustained over stand age but were substantially below estimated rates of atmospheric N deposition. While fire temporarily stimulated BNF from herbaceous legumes, neither BNF nor atmospheric N deposition were sufficient to balance N losses from fire and soil N stocks declined over stand age. However, rates of N mineralization were surprisingly high and tree productivity was unrelated to N availability, questioning the importance of N limitation in these temperate savannas. While it is possible that progressive N losses signal a decline in ecosystem resiliency, N enrichment from multiple land-use transitions and anthropogenic N deposition may suppress rates of BNF or diminish its importance as a long-term N balancing source in these pyrogenic ecosystems. In this case, fire may be acting as relief mechanism, critical for returning the modern longleaf pine landscape to its historical oligotrophic condition.

We investigate the degree to which captive propagation alters the phenotypes and ecological roles of fish stocked into wild communities. We focus on captive propagation of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) for biocontrol, which represents one of the largest scale production efforts for any fish released into the wild. Captive propagation in mosquitofish consistently generated novel mixtures of morphological and behavioural traits that deviate from those of wild populations. A mesocosm experiment showed that mosquitofish from captive propagation facilities differ from wild fish in their effects on aquatic community structure by shifting their consumption to less-mobile, benthic prey. Synthesis and applications. Captive-propagated and translocated wild fish stocks not only differ in phenotype, but can have substantially different ecological effects on the communities into which they are introduced. Therefore, captive propagation programmes involving continual release should expand their concerns beyond altered phenotypes and fitness to include whether propagated fish actually provide the intended ecological roles and services associated with their wild counterparts. Infusions of wild alleles and captive environments that mimic wild conditions are recommended strategies to retain the desired ecological role of captive-propagated fish.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						agri-environment schemes; countryside stewardship; grazing; higher level stewardship; livestock; saltmarsh; site condition; wetlands	BRACKISH MARSHES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GREAT-BRITAIN; BIODIVERSITY; DENSITY; SEA; VEGETATION; BENEFITS; IMPACTS; POLICY	Grasslands occur around the globe and, in temperate regions, their natural management by fire, drought and wild herbivores has largely been replaced by grazing with domestic livestock. Successful management for agriculture is not always suitable for conservation and can have a detrimental effect on biodiversity. Conservation grazing of saltmarshes, delivered through agri-environment schemes, may provide a solution to counteract biodiversity loss by providing farmers with financial incentives to graze these internationally important coastal wetlands more sensitively. To assess whether conservation grazing is being achieved and whether agri-environment schemes are effective in delivering this management, we conducted a national survey on English saltmarshes, scoring the management on each site as optimal, suboptimal or detrimental in terms of suitability for achieving conservation aims for five aspects of grazing: presence, stock type, intensity, timing and habitat impact. Although most saltmarshes suitable for grazing in England were grazed, conservation grazing was not being achieved. Sites under agri-environment management for longer did score higher and approached optimal levels in terms of grazing intensity in one region, but sites with agri-environment agreements were no more likely to be grazed at optimal conservation levels than sites without them overall, indicating that agri-environment schemes, in their current form, are an ineffective delivery mechanism for conservation grazing on saltmarsh. The low specificity of agri-environment prescription wording may contribute to this failure, with prescriptions either being vague or specifying suboptimal or detrimental management objectives, particularly for grazing intensity, timing and stock type. These objectives are often set too high or too low, during unsuitable periods or using stock types inappropriate for achieving conservation aims. Synthesis and applications. Our national survey indicates that agri-environment schemes are not currently delivering conservation grazing on English saltmarshes. Agri-environment schemes are the only mechanism through which such grazing can be implemented on a national scale, so improving their effectiveness is a priority. Policymakers, researchers and managers need to work together to ensure better translation of conservation guidelines into schemes, increasing the specificity of management prescriptions and improving understanding of the need for management measures. A more detailed and reliable system of auditing to ensure that management activities are taking place would be beneficial or alternatively moving to a results-based scheme where payments are made on desirable outcomes rather than on evidence of management.

Targeted agri-environment schemes (AESs) to enhance populations of threatened species inhabiting farmland have been proposed for this purpose, yet their effectiveness for nocturnal wildlife remains unknown. We assessed whether hedgerow management prescribed by targeted AESs to improve habitat conditions for the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) in England may positively influence the species, the entire bat assemblage and the insect prey of bats. We specifically investigated the responses of bats (occurrence, activity and species richness) and insects (biomass, abundance and diversity) to time since last trimming (from 1 up to 10 years). We explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of AES via changes in trimming regime on bats. Moreover, we investigated the effects of landscape context on bats as we expected that highly mobile species would benefit further from landscape-scale management. Bat species richness significantly increased with time since last trimming. Three bat taxa of major conservation concern in Western Europe substantially benefited from the targeted prescription, namely R. ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Plecotus spp. Insect family richness and dipteran abundance were also significantly greater at hedgerows that were untrimmed for at least 3 years. The activity of more common bat species (i.e. pipistrelle bats) was not influenced by time since last trimming. Changes in trimming regime strongly affected hedgerow height which directly and indirectly (by increasing prey abundance) influenced bat occurrence, activity and species richness along hedgerows. The activity of highly mobile bat species was mainly associated with a range of landscape attributes. The amount of semi-natural grassland within 0.5 km of the sampling sites positively influenced R. ferrumequinum while the presence of urban areas negatively affected light-sensitive bat species. Synthesis and applications. The implementation of targeted agri-environment schemes can include effective measures to enhance bats and their insect prey in farmland. Although we highlight the success of current prescriptions on hedgerow management, we suggest that their effectiveness can easily be optimized by encouraging farmers to keep hedgerows untrimmed for longer periods (>3 up to 10 years). We also highlight that a multi-scale management approach is required to successfully promote bats in farmland.	[Froidevaux, Jeremy S.

However, empirical evidence of grazing-intensity effects on plant diversity is contradictory. Explicitly considering the small-scale heterogeneity of short, frequently grazed and tall, rarely grazed patches typical of low-input grazing systems may be crucial to the understanding of paddock-scale grazing effects. We studied three patch types (short, intermediate, tall) within an unfertilised long-term cattle grazing experiment in Lower Saxony, Germany, comparing three paddock-scale grazing intensities. We analysed soil nutrient concentrations and recorded vegetation composition at a total of 135 plots. We determined species richness, Simpson diversity, Simpson evenness and beta diversity of individual plots (plot scale) and patch types within paddocks (patch scale). To quantify paddock-scale diversity, we resampled plot-scale species composition across a gradient of relative proportions of short and tall patches within a paddock. Patch type, not paddock-scale grazing intensity, was the main driver of plant diversity at both plot and patch scale. Short patches were more diverse than tall patches, but the effect was not strongly mediated by the lower soil nutrient concentrations in the short patches. By contrast, both patch type and grazing intensity affected vegetation composition at plot and patch scale. Beta-diversity within and between patch types was independent of grazing intensity; consequently, paddock-scale diversity was determined by the relative proportion of short versus tall patches. Higher alpha diversity of short patches compared to tall patches was more important than beta diversity between the two patch types in shaping paddock-scale diversity. Consequently, with increasing short-patch proportion, paddock-scale diversity increased. Synthesis and applications. Our study identifies the grazing-induced patch structure as the most important driver of plant diversity across different grazing intensities in low-input, that is, unfertilised and continuously stocked, pastures. To optimise grazing management for biodiversity, understanding plant-diversity responses to grazing at the patch scale is indispensable. Our results suggest that, in unfertilised, continuously stocked European pastures, trade-offs between biodiversity and agronomic production may be small, as short patches, whose proportion increases with stocking rate, also had the highest plant diversity.

Previous studies, however, have only provided evidence that vertebrates can be detected using iDNA, but have not taken the next step of placing these detection events within a statistical framework that allows for robust biodiversity assessments. Here, we compare concurrent iDNA and camera-trap surveys. Leeches were repeatedly collected in close vicinity to 64 camera-trap stations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We analyse iDNA-derived mammalian detection events in a modern occupancy model that accounts for imperfect detection and compare the results with those from occupancy models parameterised with camera-trap-derived detection events. We also combine leech-iDNA and camera-trap data in a single occupancy model. We found consistent estimates of occupancy probabilities produced by our camera-trap and leech datasets. This indicates that the metabarcoding of leech-iDNA method provides reasonable estimates of occupancy and may be a suitable method for studying and monitoring mammal species in tropical rainforests. However, we also show that a more extensive collection of leeches would be needed to assess mammal biodiversity with a robustness similar to that of camera traps. As certain taxa were only detected in leeches, we see great potential in complementing camera-trap studies with the iDNA approach, as long as the collection of leeches follows a robust and standardised sampling scheme. Synthesis and applications. Here, we describe an approach to analyse detection records of mammals derived from leech samples using an occupancy framework that accounts for leech-specific factors influencing the detection probability. We further combined camera trap and leech data, which lead to increased confidence in occupancy estimates. Our approach is not restricted to the processing of leech samples, but can be used for the analysis of other invertebrate DNA and environmental DNA data. Our study is the first step to shift the application of invertebrate DNA studies from opportunistic ad-hoc collections to the systematic surveys required for long-term management of wildlife populations.

Smitten spres av fremmed nordamerikansk ferskvannskreps (f.eks. signalkreps; Pacifastacus leniusculus). Overvaking av krepsepest i Norge har tradisjonelt basert seg pa burforsok, en etisk problematisk metode hvor dodelighet hos edelkreps i bur overvakes ved relevante lokaliteter. Overvaking av edelkrepsbestander blir gjort ved bruk av teiner. Vi har testet om overvaking basert pa innsamling av miljo-DNA (eDNA) kan v AE re et egnet alternativ til burforsok, og et supplement til teinefangst. Etter en ulovlig introduksjon av smitteb AE rende signalkreps i en innsjo med edelkreps, utnyttet vi vissheten om et kommende krepsepestutbrudd til a initiere eDNA-overvaking og burforsok samtidig, supplert med teinefangst. Tilsammen ble 304 vannprover filtrert fra ulike provetakingsstasjoner over en fire-ars periode. eDNA data (arts-spesifikk qPCR) for tilstedev AE relse av A. astaci, edelkreps og signalkreps i vannprover ble sammenlignet med dodelighet i burforsok og teinefangst. Dette er den forste studien som sammenligner eDNA-overvakning og burforsok under et naturlig krepsepestutbrudd. Vi viser at eDNA-overvaking korresponderer godt med biologisk status malt i form av dodelighet hos burkreps og resultater fra teinefangst. eDNA-analyser avslorer ogsa tilstedev AE relsen av A. astaci smittestoff i vannet opptil 2,5 uker for edelkreps dor i burforsok.

Uansett arstid gir eDNA et oyeblikksbilde av tilstedev AE relse, frav AE r eller bortfall av edelkreps, og utgjor derfor ogsa et verdifullt supplement til teinefiske, som avhenger av sesong og nasjonal lovgivning. Syntese og bruksomrader. Parallell eDNA-overvakning av Aphanomyces astaci (krepsepest agens) og relevante stedegne og fremmede arter av ferskvannskreps er velegnet for tidlig varsling av invasjon og smitte, risikovurderinger, evaluering av habitatstatus, og overvaking av status for smittestoff og fremmed/stedegen ferskvannskreps. Metoden er dyrevelferdsvennlig, og utelukker behovet for burforsok med levende kreps i sykdomsovervaking. Videre gir eDNA-overvakning mindre sannsynlighet for a spre Aphanomyces astaci smitte enn tradisjonelle metoder. Denne studien har bidratt til a implementere eDNA-overvaking i norsk overvakning av krepsepest, edelkreps og signalkreps, og vi tror at andre land ogsa kan forbedre sine forvaltningsstrategier for ferskvannskreps ved hjelp av en lignende tiln AE rming. The European noble crayfish Astacus astacus is threatened by crayfish plague caused by the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, which is spread by the invasive North American crayfish (e.g. signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus). Surveillance of crayfish plague status in Norway has traditionally relied on the monitoring survival of cage-held noble crayfish, a method of ethical concern. Additionally, trapping is used in crayfish population surveillance. Here, we test whether environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring could provide a suitable alternative to the cage method, and a supplement to trapping. We took advantage of an emerging crayfish plague outbreak in a Norwegian watercourse following illegal introduction of disease-carrying signal crayfish, and initiated simultaneous eDNA monitoring and cage-based surveillance, supplemented with trapping. A total of 304 water samples were filtered from several sampling stations over a 4-year period. eDNA data (species-specific quantitative real-time PCR [qPCR]) for the presence of A. astaci, noble and signal crayfish within the water samples were compared to cage mortality and trapping. This is the first study comparing eDNA monitoring and cage surveillance during a natural crayfish plague outbreak. We show that eDNA monitoring corresponds well with the biological status measured in terms of crayfish mortality and trapping results. eDNA analysis also reveals the presence of A. astaci in the water up to 2.5 weeks in advance of the cage method. Estimates of A. astaci and noble crayfish eDNA concentrations increased markedly during mortality and vanished quickly thereafter. eDNA provides a snapshot of the presence, absence or disappearance of crayfish regardless of season, and constitutes a valuable supplement to the trapping method that relies on season and legislation. Synthesis and applications. Simultaneous eDNA monitoring of Aphanomyces astaci (crayfish plague) and relevant native and invasive freshwater crayfish species is well-suited for early warning of invasion or infection, risk assessments, habitat evaluation and surveillance regarding pathogen and invasive/native crayfish status. This non-invasive, animal welfare friendly method excludes the need for cage-held susceptible crayfish in disease monitoring. Furthermore, eDNA monitoring is less likely to spread A. astaci than traditional methods. This study resulted in the implementation of eDNA monitoring for Norwegian crayfish plague and crayfish surveillance programmes, and we believe other countries could improve management strategies for freshwater crayfish using a similar approach.

Flow restoration and the impacts of multiple stressors on fish communities in regulated rivers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						bypassed river channels; ELOHA; hydropower; minimum flow; regulated rivers; riparian degradation; stressor interactions; traits	ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; STREAM RESTORATION; ASSEMBLAGES; RESPONSES; HYDROPOWER; FRAMEWORK; REGIMES; FUTURE; LIMITS; ELOHA	River regulation for hydropower is undertaken worldwide, causing profound alterations to hydrological regimes and running water habitats. Regulated catchments are often subjected to additional stressors, arising inter alia from agriculture, forestry and industry, which are likely to interact with impacts of river regulation on fish and other biota. Such interactions are poorly understood, hindering planning of effective mitigation and restoration. We investigated fish responses to increased discharge (as a restoration measure) in regulated rivers in Sweden. We compiled electrofishing data from river channels downstream of hydropower dams, each of which either has or lacks a mandated minimum discharge corresponding to c. 5% of pre-regulation discharge. We further analysed interactions between flow restoration and co-occurring local and regional stressors. River channels without a mandated minimum discharge were characterized by a low diversity of fish species with traits favouring persistence under unpredictable environmental conditions, including omnivory, short life cycles and small size. Additional stressors further reduced diversity and increased dominance by broad-niched, opportunistic species. Both the presence and magnitude of a mandated minimum discharge were positively related to fish diversity and density, and the relative density of three economically and recreationally valuable species. However, the size of these relationships frequently varied with the presence of additional stressors. Increasing levels of hydrological degradation and reduced connectivity at the catchment scale reduced positive flow-ecology relationships and hindered the restoration of fish communities towards reference conditions. However, application of a mandated minimum discharge also assisted in mitigating impacts of some co-occurring stressors, especially reduced riparian integrity. Synthesis and applications. Additional stressors can strongly influence the outcomes of flow restoration for fish community diversity and composition. Our approach combining fish species and trait data from multiple flow restoration projects with information on additional stressors yielded valuable insights into factors affecting flow restoration success, useful for (a) identifying the systems most likely to benefit from mandated minimum flows, (b) modelling influences of multiple stressors on flow-ecology relationships, (c) prioritizing additional measures to manage co-occurring stressors and enhance outcomes from flow restoration.

However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose-response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. Results showed that severe trauma was restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. Pathological indicators of mortality were only predicted to occur in collision speeds in excess of 5.1 m/s (95% C.I. 3.2-6.6) and was affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments.

We studied population dynamics of tigers in Corbett National Park (CNP) in Indian Terai, which harbours the largest and highest density tiger population in any protected area of the world. Through population viability models, we demonstrate the importance of CNP in tiger recovery within western Terai. We camera trapped 521 km(2) of CNP using open population capture-mark-recapture framework between 2010 and 2015 to estimate annual abundance, spatially explicit density, survival, recruitment, temporary movements, sex ratio and proportion of females breeding. We model metapopulation persistence with and without Corbett as a source within western Terai landscape at different levels of poaching and habitat connectivity. In 6 years, we recorded 6,202 photo-captures of 307 individual tigers. Annual tiger abundance and density were stable at 120 (SE 19) and 14 (SE 3) per 100 km(2) respectively. Detection probability of tigers was 0.18 (SE 0.03) and detection-corrected male:female sex ratio was female biased (0.80 SE 0.13). Apparent annual survival probability was 0.79 (SE 0.05) for females and 0.60 (SE 0.04) for males. Survival of tigers in CNP (0.68 SE 0.12) was lower than that reported for other populations. CNP tigers showed high reproduction with 54.8 (SE 5.1)% females breeding and with addition of 35 (SE 8)% as new recruits to the population each year. Small tiger populations in western Terai with moderate poaching could only persist through dispersal from CNP. Synthesis and applications. Corbett tiger population was characterized by a stable high density, high reproductive rate and low survival, resulting in high turnover rates (32%-48%) between successive years. Such source populations could sustain low-level poaching and with habitat connectivity, recover tiger populations across the landscape. This study establishes potential thresholds that can likely be achieved by tiger populations under optimal natural conditions and highlights the importance of prioritizing conservation of source populations within tiger landscapes. This information can be used to plan and implement realistic tiger recovery programmes globally.

These include high soil fertility, the dominance of a few fast-growing plant species, degraded soil faunal communities and missing propagules of the targeted above- and below-ground flora and fauna. A combination of removing the topsoil and introducing propagules of target plants has become one of the major tools for nature conservation agencies and practitioners to reduce soil fertility and restore former species-rich grasslands in various European countries. Using topsoil removal as a restoration measure has provoked an ongoing debate between supporting nature conservation and rejecting soil protection agencies. Although it favours species-rich plant communities, it strongly disturbs soil communities and affects physical and chemical soil properties and processes. Currently, there is a lack of long-term data to assess how restored grassland ecosystems develop and recover after topsoil removal. Here, we used two well-established bioindicators, soil nematodes and plants, to quantify restoration success of topsoil removal in comparison with alternative restoration measures and target communities 22 years after intervention. The nematode community composition indicated reduced nutrient availability in the restored systems, as was aimed at by topsoil removal. Nevertheless, after this 22-year period following topsoil removal, nematode composition and structure revealed successful recovery. Plant communities benefitted from the reduction of soil nutrients after topsoil removal as indicated by higher numbers of plant species and higher Shannon diversity. Furthermore, topsoil removal strongly promoted the re-establishment of plant species of the target plant community. Synthesis and applications. Overall, our study demonstrates how a massive intervention by topsoil removal proved successful in converting intensively managed into species-rich grasslands. This contrasts with the mild intervention of repeated mowing and removing of the harvested plant material. We show that, in the long run, potential negative effects of topsoil removal on the soil fauna can be successfully overcome and plant communities can develop into targeted species-rich grassland.

Long-term impacts of changed grazing regimes on the vegetation of heterogeneous upland grasslands	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						grassland; grazing; habitat mosaics; herbivore; long-term experiment; mire; uplands; vegetation dynamics	PRODUCTIVITY GRADIENT; LOW-INTENSITY; DIVERSITY; PLANT; LIVESTOCK; SHEEP; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; COMMUNITIES; ABANDONMENT	Marginal agricultural land, which in the UK refers to upland grazings in particular, is going to see changes in management driven by markets, subsidies, grants and environmental change with implications for biodiversity. Using a large-scale, long-term grazing experiment in the UK uplands we assessed the impact of intensification (tripling sheep numbers), abandonment (removal of sheep) and grazer diversification (partial replacement of sheep by cattle) on vegetation composition in a heterogenous area of grassland. Species benefiting from increased grazing included sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), mat grass (Nardus stricta) and deer grass (Trichophorum cespitosum). Species that benefitted from the removal of grazing included bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). Responses differed between vegetation communities; more productive acid grassland communities showed little change when grazing was removed, whilst less productive mire communities contained species, capable of increasing after grazing removal. Increased grazing and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of cattle increased species diversity. Synthesis and applications. Marginal agricultural grassland will likely see management change driven by markets, subsidies and environmental change. Vegetation change in these relatively infertile grasslands is slow and features shuffling dominance amongst species in the initial vegetation. Initial structural changes affect other trophic levels in this experiment; the slow change in composition will affect the system over longer timescales. Management decisions in the uplands encompass complex trade-offs between production, biodiversity and a range of ecosystem services. Predicting the consequences of decisions is difficult given the slow dynamics of unproductive habitats.

Grassland biodiversity restoration increases resistance of carbon fluxes to drought	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity; carbon cycling; drought; fertilizer; grassland restoration; seed addition; soil microbial community	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; SOIL-NITROGEN; WATER-UPTAKE; LAND-USE; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; MEADOW; PRODUCTIVITY; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT	Evidence suggests that the restoration of plant diversity in grasslands not only brings benefits for biodiversity conservation, but also the delivery of ecosystem services. While biodiversity-function experiments show that greater plant diversity increases resistance of plant productivity to climate extremes, it is not known whether real-world management options for grassland restoration likewise stabilize ecosystem responses to extreme climate events. We used a long-term (23 year) field experiment in northern England to test the hypothesis that management aimed at biodiversity restoration increases the resistance and recovery of ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes to short-term summer drought. This was tested by measuring plant, soil and microbial responses to a simulated drought in experimental grassland plots where fertilizer application and seed addition have been managed to enhance plant species diversity. The cessation of fertilizer application brought about small increases in plant species richness. Additionally, cessation of fertilizer application reduced overall plant productivity and promoted hemi-parasitic plants at the expense of grasses and forbs. Resistance of CO2 fluxes to drought, measured as ecosystem respiration, was greater in non-fertilized plots, as lower plant biomass reduced water demand, likely aided by proportionally more hemi-parasitic plants further reducing plant biomass. Additionally, legumes increased under drought, thereby contributing to overall resistance of plant productivity. Recovery of soil microbial C and nitrogen was more rapid after rewetting than soil microbial community composition, irrespective of restoration treatment, suggesting high resilience of soil microbial communities to drought. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that while grassland diversity restoration management increases the resistance of carbon fluxes to drought, it also reduces agricultural yields, revealing a trade-off for land managers. Furthermore legumes, promoted through long-term restoration treatments, can help to maintain plant community productivity under drought by increasing their biomass. As such, grassland management strategies not only have consequences for ecosystem processes, but also the capacity to withstand extreme weather events.

Earlier work revealed that overgrazing may stimulate persistent vegetation collapse in low-productivity environments where vegetation survives by concentrating scarce resources within its local environment. However, it remains unclear whether grazer fluctuations may cause persistent vegetation changes in high-productivity systems where dense stands facilitate their own survival by hampering grazer access. Here, we experimentally tested how the release from grazing by greylag geese (Anser anser) affects spatial vegetation structure in a highly productive, brackish marsh in which dense reed (Phragmites australis) stands and bare roosting areas coexist. Next, we assessed the resilience of the change in vegetation patterning by reintroducing the geese after a 2-year exclosure period. During herbivore exclusion, vegetation rapidly colonized the bare areas, while reintroduction of herbivores generated a clear species-specific response. Specifically, the pioneer species, Bolboschoenus maritimus, was immediately eradicated, while the dense and high structure of P. australis facilitated its own persistence by limiting grazer access. Surface accretion (similar to 1 cm/year) during herbivore exclusion further amplified this herbivore-inhibiting feedback, because greylag geese primarily rely on waterlogged conditions for grubbing. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that temporary reductions in herbivore numbers may induce persistent unfavourable changes in the spatial structure of a high-productivity system. It is therefore important to first assess whether vegetation changes are naturally reversible or persistent. If state shifts are indeed persistent, sufficiently high grazer densities must be maintained to warrant the favourable heterogeneous system. If changes in vegetation structure negatively impact grazer densities, active management such as sod cutting or mowing may be required to restore ecosystem structure and functions.

Remnant woodland biodiversity gains under 10 years of revealed-price incentive payments	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						conservation auction; grazing pressure; incentive; long-term monitoring; restoration; temperate grassy woodland; weed control	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; CONSERVATION TENDERS; SET-ASIDE; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; AUSTRALIA; BIRDS; ATTRIBUTES; FARMLAND; PROGRAMS	Evaluation of conservation incentive programme outcomes is needed to direct future investment, however, monitoring of large-scale programmes is relatively rare. Research in this area has frequently relied on space-for-time substitution or similar designs, rarely controlling for counterfactual trends or potential learning or leakage effects using repeated measures taken before and after intervention at impact and independent control sites. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) monitoring design, we investigate the ecological impact of a conservation stewardship programme, where landholders set their own contract price through a reverse auction. In order to maintain or increase species and structural diversity of remnant native vegetation, contracted landholders agreed to manage grazing pressure (from stock and feral animals), control weeds and retain fallen logs. We test whether impact sites (private land under contract) changed over a 9-10 year period relative to control sites (independently managed, non-contracted private land) and reference sites (public conservation areas). Modest improvements were detected in native plant species richness, log abundance and grazing pressure at impact sites compared with background changes observed at control sites. While log abundance and grazing pressure were directly managed at impact sites, the improvement in native plant species richness was assumed to be influenced by reduction in multiple pressures such as grazing pressure and weed abundance. No significant intervention effects were detected in other variables including regeneration, plant litter cover, weed cover and canopy dieback. However, these variables did show changes over time which were likely due to weather, particularly an extended period of drought followed by unusually high rainfall. Policy implications. This study shows that revealed-price incentive contracts can produce biodiversity improvement compared with the business-as-usual scenario of native vegetation management on private land. The use of a Before-After-Control-Impact monitoring design enabled the separation of treatment effects from background changes such as those linked to climate and weather, demonstrating the importance of this approach for programme evaluation. We recommend the allocation of appropriate resources for monitoring and also highlight the need for the collection of baseline data prior to contract establishment at both impact and independently managed control sites.

Remnant forest in Costa Rican working landscapes fosters bird communities that are indistinguishable from protected areas	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						avian; deforestation; fragmentation; habitat loss; landscape context; reserve; restoration; working landscapes	BIODIVERSITY; LAND; DIVERSITY; VALUES	The outcome of the ongoing biodiversity crisis depends on the capacity of the Earth's wildlife to persist in working landscapes. Yet, the species that occupy working landscapes are often distinct from those in protected areas, with a large group of "sensitive species" thought to rarely venture into human-dominated landscapes. As governments have committed to restoring degraded lands world-wide, determining whether and how working landscapes can be restored to benefit sensitive species remains a major challenge. We surveyed Neotropical birds across Northwestern Costa Rica in protected areas, farms and forests embedded within working landscapes. We analysed community composition to understand how gradients of forest cover, fragmentation and regional precipitation determine how conserving (or restoring) tropical forests in working landscapes could safeguard entire communities, especially sensitive species with limited ranges. We found agricultural sites maintained relatively high bird diversity but hosted very distinct communities from those found in protected areas. The average range size of species found in agricultural communities was double the size of species in protected areas. However, high forest cover sites in working landscapes housed bird communities with small range sizes that were equivalent to those in nearby protected areas, despite being twice as fragmented and significantly more disturbed. The effect of local forest cover on bird composition was contingent on both landscape context and regional climate. When local forest cover increased in wetter regions and more forested landscapes, bird communities in working landscapes exhibited a stronger shift towards the assemblages found in protected areas. Specifically, we found that reforesting the wettest sites would increase similarity to protected areas fourfold compared to only a twofold increase in the driest sites. Synthesis and applications. Despite experiencing much more fragmentation and degradation than protected areas, forests in Costa Rican working landscapes can maintain bird communities that strongly resemble those found in protected areas. This suggests that conserving or restoring forests in working landscapes, particularly within wetter regions and already forested landscapes, may safeguard bird communities when creating protected areas is infeasible.

Terrestriality constrains salamander limb diversification: Implications for the evolution of pentadactyly	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						body form; Caudata; constraint; digit loss; elongation; integration; paedomorphosis; phenotypic evolution; tetrapod evolution	PHYLOGENETIC COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS; BODY-FORM; STABILIZING SELECTION; DIGIT REDUCTION; SERIAL HOMOLOGY; LIFE-CYCLES; PATTERNS; WALKING; INTEGRATION; LOCOMOTION	Patterns of phenotypic evolution can abruptly shift as species move between adaptive zones. Extant salamanders display three distinct life cycle strategies that range from aquatic to terrestrial (biphasic), to fully aquatic (paedomorphic) and to fully terrestrial (direct development). Life cycle variation is associated with changes in body form such as loss of digits, limb reduction or body elongation. However, the relationships among these traits and life cycle strategy remain unresolved. Here, we use a Bayesian modelling approach to test whether life cycle transitions by salamanders have influenced rates, optima and integration of primary locomotory structures (limbs and trunk). We show that paedomorphic salamanders have elevated rates of limb evolution with optima shifted towards smaller size and fewer digits compared to all other salamanders. Rate of hindlimb digit evolution is shown to decrease in a gradient as life cycles become more terrestrial. Paedomorphs have a higher correlation between hindlimb digit loss and increases in vertebral number, as well as reduced correlations between limb lengths. Our results support the idea that terrestrial plantigrade locomotion constrains limb evolution and, when lifted, leads to higher rates of trait diversification and shifts in optima and integration. The basic tetrapod body form of most salamanders and the independent losses of terrestrial life stages provide an important framework for understanding the evolutionary and developmental mechanisms behind major shifts in ecological zones as seen among early tetrapods during their transition from water to land.

Sperm head abnormalities are more frequent in songbirds with more helical sperm: A possible trade-off in sperm evolution	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						acrosome; cell integrity; passerine bird; sperm competition; sperm damage; sperm morphology	POSTCOPULATORY SEXUAL SELECTION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; COMPETITION; MOTILITY; ACROSOME; MORPHOLOGY; FERTILITY; LENGTH	Sperm morphology varies enormously across the animal kingdom. Whilst knowledge of the factors that drive the evolution of interspecific variation in sperm morphology is accumulating, we currently have little understanding of factors that may constrain evolutionary change in sperm traits. We investigated whether susceptibility to sperm abnormalities could represent such a constraint in songbirds, a group characterized by a distinctive helical sperm head shape. Specifically, using 36 songbird species and data from light and scanning electron microscopy, we examined among-species correlations between the occurrence of sperm head abnormalities and sperm morphology, as well as the correlation between sperm head abnormalities and two indicators of sperm competition. We found that species with more helically shaped sperm heads (i.e., a wider helical membrane and more pronounced cell waveform) had a higher percentage of abnormal sperm heads than species with less helical sperm (i.e., relatively straight sperm) and that sperm head traits were better predictors of head abnormalities than total sperm length. In contrast, there was no correlation between sperm abnormalities and the level of sperm competition. Given that songbird species with more pronounced helical sperm have higher average sperm swimming speed, our results suggest an evolutionary trade-off between sperm performance and the structural integrity of the sperm head. As such, susceptibility to morphological abnormalities may constrain the evolution of helical sperm morphology in songbirds.

Female multiple mating (polyandry) has diverse evolutionary consequences, and there are many potential benefits and costs of polyandry. However, our understanding of its evolution is biased towards studies enforcing monandry in polyandrous species. What drives and maintains variation in polyandry between individuals, genotypes, populations and species remains poorly understood. Genetic variation in polyandry may be actively maintained by selection, or arise by chance if polyandry is selectively neutral. In Drosophila pseudoobscura, there is genetic variation in polyandry between and within populations. We used isofemale lines to found replicate populations with high or low initial levels of polyandry and tracked polyandry under experimental evolution over seven generations. Polyandry remained relatively stable, reflecting the starting frequencies of the experimental populations. There were no clear fitness differences between high versus low polyandry genotypes, and there was no signature of balancing selection. We confirmed these patterns in direct comparisons between evolved and ancestral females and found no consequences of polyandry for female fecundity. The absence of differential selection even when initiating populations with major differences in polyandry casts some doubt on the importance of polyandry for female fitness.

Inbreeding alters context-dependent reproductive effort and immunity in male crickets	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						fecundity compensation; genotype-by-environment interaction; life-history theory; residual reproductive value	HISTORY TRADE-OFFS; DECORATED CRICKET; TERMINAL INVESTMENT; LIFE-SPAN; FECUNDITY COMPENSATION; ECOLOGICAL IMMUNOLOGY; SEXUAL SELECTION; DEPRESSION; COSTS; POLYANDRY	Infection can cause hosts to drastically alter their investment in key life-history traits of reproduction and defence. Infected individuals are expected to increase investment in defence (e.g., by increasing immune function) and, due to trade-offs, investment in other traits (e.g., current reproduction) should decrease. However, the terminal investment hypothesis postulates that decreased lifespan due to infection and the associated reduction in the expectation for future offspring will favour increased investment towards current reproduction. Variation in intrinsic condition will likely influence shifts in reproductive investment post-infection, but this is often not considered in such assessments. For example, the extent of inbreeding can significantly impact an individual's lifetime fitness and may influence its reproductive behaviour following a threat of infection. Here, we investigated the effects of inbreeding status on an individual's reproductive investment upon infection, including the propensity to terminally invest. Male crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus) from four genetically distinct inbred lines and one outbred line were subjected to a treatment from an increasing spectrum of simulated infection cue intensities, using heat-killed bacteria. We then measured reproductive effort (calling effort), survival and immune function (antibacterial activity, circulating haemocytes and haemocyte microaggregations). Inbred and outbred males diverged in how they responded to a low-dose infection cue: relative to unmanipulated males, outbred males decreased calling effort, whereas inbred males increased calling effort. Moreover, we found that inbred males exhibited higher antibacterial activity and numbers of circulating haemocytes compared with outbred males. These results suggest that an individual's inbreeding status may have consequences for context-dependent shifts in reproductive strategies, such as those triggered by infection.

The Alpine silver ant, Formica selysi, has two forms of social organization-single-queen and multiple-queen colonies-determined by alternate haplotypes at a large supergene. Here, we explore whether mate preference contributes to the maintenance of the genetic polymorphism at the social supergene. With mate choice experiments, we found that females and males mated randomly with respect to social form. Moreover, queens were able to produce offspring irrespective of whether they had mated with a male from the same or the alternative social form. Yet, females originating from single-queen colonies were more fertile, suggesting that they may be more successful at independent colony founding. We conclude that the pattern of asymmetric assortative mating documented from mature F. selysi colonies in the field is not caused by mate preferences or major genetic incompatibilities between social forms. More generally, we found no evidence that disassortative mate preference contributes to the maintenance of polymorphism at this supergene controlling ant social organization.

Rapid recovery of soil arthropod assemblages after exotic plantation tree removal from hydromorphic soils in a grassland-timber production mosaic	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						assemblages; biodiversity; hydromorphic soils; invasive alien species; plantations; restoration	LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; ALIEN PLANTS; SOUTH-AFRICA; INTERMEDIATE DISTURBANCE; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SPECIES RICHNESS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; FOREST	Many wetland systems are being lost or degraded by human activities such as plantation forestry. Therefore, efforts to restore these wetland systems are important for biodiversity recovery. We assess the recovery of arthropod assemblages that occupy hydromorphic grassland topsoil and leaf litter after the removal of exotic pine trees. We sampled arthropods in three biotopes (natural untransformed hydromorphic grasslands, restored hydromorphic grasslands, and commercial pine plantations) replicated across a large-scale timber-grassland mosaic in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa. In the restored sites, overall species richness, as well as species richness of spiders, ants, and orthopterans, was significantly higher than in plantations, and was as high as in natural, untransformed sites. Additionally, overall assemblage structure along with spider, beetle, ant, and orthopteran assemblages showed no significant differences between restored and natural grasslands. Therefore, pine tree removal enables recovery of these arthropod taxa to levels similar to those in natural hydromorphic grassland. Recovery was rapid, with the assemblages in some restored sites resembling those in untransformed sites after only 6 years, indicating a high level of resilience and recovery in these systems. Contrary to expectations, time since pine removal had a negative effect on arthropod recovery. This was due to the strongly negative effect of alien invasive American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius), which was most common in older restored sites, causing deviation from their restoration trajectory. The potential for arthropod recovery in these hydromorphic grasslands is high, but successful restoration is dependent on ongoing appropriate grassland management, especially removal of bramble.

Jump-starting coastal wetland restoration: a comparison of marsh and mangrove foundation species	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						coastal wetland; foundation species; life history strategy; mangrove; restoration; salt marsh	AVICENNIA-GERMINANS SEEDLINGS; SALT-MARSHES; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEAF-AREA; COMMUNITY; LOUISIANA; COMPETITION; ESTABLISHMENT; CONSEQUENCES	During coastal wetland restoration, foundation plant species are critical in creating habitat, modulating ecosystem functions, and supporting ecological communities. Following initial hydrologic restoration, foundation plant species can help stabilize sediments and jump-start ecosystem development. Different foundation species, however, have different traits and environmental tolerances. To understand how these traits and tolerances impact restoration trajectories, there is a need for comparative studies among foundation species. In subtropical and tropical climates, coastal wetland restoration practitioners can sometimes choose between salt marsh and/or mangrove foundation species. Here, we compared the early life history traits and environmental tolerances of two foundation species: (1) a salt marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) and (2) a mangrove tree (Avicennia germinans). In an 18-month study of a recently restored coastal wetland in southeastern Louisiana (USA), we examined growth and survival along an elevation gradient and compared expansion and recruitment rates. We found that the rapid growth, expansion, and recruitment rates of the salt marsh grass make it a better species for quickly establishing ecological structure at suitable elevations. The slower growth, limited expansion, and lower recruitment of the mangrove species show its restricted capacity for immediate structural restoration, especially in areas where it co-occurs with perennial salt marsh species. Our findings suggest that the structural attributes needed in recently restored areas can be achieved sooner using fast-growing foundation species. Following salt marsh grass establishment, mangroves can then be used to further assist ecosystem development. This work highlights how appropriate foundation species can help jump-start ecosystem development to meet restoration objectives.

Malus niedzwetzkyana, an Endangered wild relative of domesticated apples, is an important component of the walnut-fruit forests of Central Asia. Its iconic pink blossom and genetic properties give it special cultural and scientific significance, but livestock grazing and firewood collection threaten its survival. The conservation of the species and its native forest ecosystem is critical and urgent. This study provides information on the ecology and population of M. niedzwetzkyana and the threats affecting its habitat, improving our understanding of its distribution and proposing measures to reduce threats. We collected ecological data and assessed population structure and threats at four forest sites in southern Kyrgyzstan. We mapped 149 individuals, creating the largest known dataset for this species. We developed species distribution models for M. niedzwetzkyana to identify climatically suitable regions and potential areas for restoration. Sary-Chelek Biosphere Reserve contained the largest expanse of pristine forest and the most stable M. niedzwetzkyana population, followed by Kara-Alma Forestry Unit. Forests in the Gava Forestry Unit and Dashman Reserve were most extensively damaged by humans and livestock. The wild apple's favoured habitat was south-west facing slopes with a gradient < 30 degrees and a relatively open canopy. Overall, the study population was vulnerable to extinction with limited regeneration potential. We recommend short-term population enhancement through planting projects and increased protection of individuals in pristine sites. Community-based conservation initiatives should be prioritized in extensively damaged sites, and larger-scale reforestation of these forests needs to be considered.

The Red List, although the data are neither perfect nor comprehensive, is perhaps the most reliable indicator of extinction and extinction threat. Here, data collated from the Red List, of Extinct plant species and of Critically Endangered plant species with populations in decline, are examined to address three questions: (1) How do background, continental, and island plant extinction rates compare? (2) Are biological and physical island parameters associated with plant extinction? (3) Are any plant traits associated with extinction and if so do these differ between islands and continents? The background rate for plant extinction is estimated to be 0.05-0.13 E/MSY (extinctions per million species-years) and the Red List data are above these background rates and also above a higher extinction rate of 0.15 E/MSY. The data indicate that plant extinctions are dominated by insular species. The Red List extinction data are associated with lower competitive ability and lower climate change velocities, and anthropogenic factors. Analyses using only Critically Endangered species whose populations are in decline (arguably the species most at risk of extinction in the near future) largely mirrors this pattern and suggests that drivers of plant extinction may have an inertia that could last well into the future.

During 2015-2016 we surveyed 72% of Kahuzi-Biega National Park rangers to assess their level of job satisfaction, why they chose to become rangers, what they liked and disliked about their job, and what affected their motivation to conduct their work. We used a cumulative link model to assess how various factors affected their self-reported level of job satisfaction. The rangers surveyed had been working in the Park for 16 years on average and most chose this occupation to earn a salary, to conserve wildlife or to serve their country. Overall, ranger job satisfaction was low; however, our findings highlight numerous ways in which this could be improved. These include higher salaries, more promotion opportunities, better recognition from the Congolese wildlife authority and other state services, positive performance incentives, better security, improved living conditions in remote patrol posts, and more support from the judicial system. Ranger patrol assignment (i.e. type of patrol and Park sector to patrol), receiving free housing at the Park headquarters, age, and length of service were statistically significant predictors of job satisfaction. It is likely that increasing ranger job satisfaction would result in a higher commitment to protecting wildlife, improved performance, and positive outcomes for wildlife conservation.

In Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, recurrent human pressure challenges the ability of law enforcement authorities to protect wildlife. During 2010-2015 we studied the implementation of law enforcement in the Park to determine (1) the potential for improvement of the protection of large mammals and (2) the minimum patrolling effort needed to obtain increases in their populations. We recorded presence of large mammals and illegal activities in two areas within the Park, the research area (210 km(2)) and the rest of the Park (5,150 km(2)), and compiled data about patrolling efforts from the Park authorities. Using a generalized linear mixed model we identified a relationship between increased patrolling effort and the relative abundance of large mammals, especially for monkey groups, pygmy hippopotamuses Choeropsis liberiensis and duikers. At low patrolling efforts duiker encounter rates remained stable, whereas rates of encounter with monkey groups and pygmy hippopotamuses decreased. Chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus encounter rates were slower to respond and remained stable at higher patrolling effort, but decreased at low patrolling effort. Our findings suggest that a minimum of 1.32 patrol days per km(2) over 2 years is required for chimpanzee and monkey populations to increase, whereas a patrolling effort of 0.48 days per km(2) over 2 years would lead to an increase in duiker and pygmy hippopotamus populations. We maintain that the patrolling effort required to ensure an increase in wildlife can be estimated relatively precisely from multi-year biomonitoring programmes.

Assessments of conservation status made on the basis of loss or degradation of habitat and lack of records may provide compelling indications of a decline in geographical range and population size, but they do not help identify where conservation action might be best targeted. Methods for assessing the probability of extinction and for modelling species' distributions exist, but their data requirements often exceed the information that is available for some of the most urgent conservation cases. Here we use all available information (localities, expert information, climate and landcover) about a high-priority Vietnamese bird species (Edwards's pheasant Lophura edwardsi) to assess objectively the probability of its persistence, and where surveys or other conservation action should be targeted. It is clear that the species is on the threshold of extinction and there is an urgent need to survey Bach Ma National Park (including the extension) and to consider surveying Ke Go Nature Reserve. This approach has potential to help identify where conservation action should be targeted for other Critically Endangered species for which there is an extreme scarcity of information.

Bats are important to the ecological functioning of remote oceanic islands, and thus the sustainable management of hunting of flying foxes Pteropus spp. is a conservation priority in the Pacific. In Solomon Islands people hunt flying foxes for bushmeat and their canine teeth, which are used as traditional currency. The value of teeth potentially increases hunting pressure on species of Pteropus. We interviewed 197 people on Makira Island to determine the nature of this use and how it may influence flying-fox populations. We asked questions to gather information about hunting practices, the value of canine teeth, utilization of traditional currency, and population trends of Pteropus. Flying-fox teeth remain highly valued on Makira. It is primarily the teeth of P. tonganus that are used rather than those of the smaller P. cognatus. Although flying foxes are not targeted solely for their teeth, this added value seemingly drives hunters to focus on P. tonganus. Hunting varied across five regions of Makira and high hunting pressure corresponded with perceived rarity of P. tonganus. Regions with low hunting pressure may be opportune locations to initiate flying-fox conservation on Makira.

A better understanding of local people's perceptions of the nature of illegal behaviour and the relevance of conservation actions would be useful in informing conservation decisions. We gathered information on the attitudes and perceptions of communities in the vicinity of Ugalla Game Reserve in western Tanzania regarding illegal behaviour and the effectiveness of conservation practices, using household surveys, key informants, and focus groups. We found that local people use the Reserve illegally, especially for hunting (28 +/- SE 6%) and logging (20 +/- SE 5%). We explored behaviours that are problematic for conservation in the partially protected areas around Ugalla. Local communities reported feeling isolated, harassed and intimidated by approaches used to protect Ugalla. They were angered by the conservation of Ugalla as a trophy hunting site for foreigners, and the excessive force and beatings used by game rangers to keep them away from the Reserve. Improving local livelihoods (17%), participatory conservation (16%), and giving people land for agricultural activities (16%) were among the ways that local communities felt would reduce illegal activities. Our findings suggest the need for conservation measures to benefit local communities around Ugalla transparently and equitably. Outreach programmes would help to raise conservation awareness and attract positive attitudes towards conservation. To encourage local support for conservation, we also suggest that conservation authorities create and maintain good relations with people living near the Reserve.

Attitudes towards conservation of the Endangered red panda Ailurus fulgens in Nepal: a case study in protected and non-protected areas	ORYX			English	Article						Ailurus fulgens; conservation attitudes; Nepal; people-park relationships; protected areas; red pandas; threatened species; wildlife conservation	NATIONAL-PARK; PEOPLE	The red panda Ailurus fulgens is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by anthropogenic pressures such as livestock grazing. We surveyed people living in or near protected areas and people living away from protected areas in Nepal, to understand human attitudes towards red panda conservation. Given Nepal's participatory approach to managing protected areas, we hypothesized that local people living in or near protected areas would have more positive attitudes towards red panda conservation than those in non-protected areas. Ninety percent of the 142 respondents had positive attitudes, with people living in or near protected areas expressing less positive attitudes than those in non-protected areas. Despite this difference between protected and non-protected areas, people were generally positive towards red panda conservation. However, positive attitudes did not necessarily translate to sustainable resource-use behaviour. We found there was a high prevalence of both livestock grazing and livestock disease in red panda habitat. We suggest that alternative farming practices (e.g. stall-feeding of livestock) and awareness programmes (e.g. education on the conservation status and legal protection of red pandas, and livestock-wildlife disease transmission) could be important tools to improve conservation attitudes and protect red pandas in Nepal.

However, its status in Slovakia has been reported to the European Commission on the basis of hunters ' reports and expert estimates that have never been validated by a robust scientific approach. We conducted the first camera-trapping surveys to estimate the density of Eurasian lynx in Slovakia by means of spatial capture-recapture models in two reference areas during 2011-2015. We estimated population density per 100 km(2) of suitable lynx habitat (posterior SD) as 0.58 +/- SD 0.13 independent individuals (adults and subadults) in the Stiavnica Mountains and 0.81 +/- SD 0.29 in Veka Fatra National Park and surroundings. These are the lowest densities estimated using spatial capture-recapture models so far reported for the species, suggesting the lynx population in Slovakia is below carrying capacity. We suspect that low densities may be attributable to undetected human-caused mortality. Our results imply that official game statistics are substantially overestimated. Moreover, the lynx population in Slovakia may not be at favourable conservation status as required by the EU Habitats Directive. We therefore call for a thorough assessment of the density and trend of the Slovak Carpathian lynx population, and the establishment of a scientifically robust monitoring system.

From 30-km radii of six community centers, shorelines were examined by merging relevant portions of the NOAA ShoreZone database (utilizing alongshore bioband length segments as accounting units) with nearshore bathymetry and measures of mean global sea-level rise along with local GPS information of isostatic rebound rate. For this analysis, adjustments for the year 2108 were made by using 9868 alongshore length units (totaling 3466 km), each unit having uniform substrate and biologic type, by conducting geometric analysis of shoreline attributes. Given up to 1.8 m of sea level lowering, up to 30% decreases in estuary shoreline lengths are predicted. Trends, verified with both archeologic and land ownership records, confirm utility of simple geometric-based assessments (bathtub approach), particularly for low-energy bays with minimal stream input and bedrock/sediment-dominated shorelines and sites dominated by either isostatic rebound, sea level rise, or both. Predicted changes have implications for traditional and cultural gathering, food webs, and ocean carbon sequestration rates. For example, greater change in shoreline length segments is predicted for protected low-slope gradient bays and estuaries dominated by eelgrass (Zostera marina) and inferred butter clam (Saxidomus gigantean) habitats than for exposed, rocky, steep-gradient peninsulas with red foliose algae, including dulce (Palmaria sp.) and bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana).

Factors Affecting Prey Availability and Habitat Use of Nonbreeding Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) in Coastal Louisiana	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Foraging ecology; barrier island; intertidal invertebrate; invertebrate abundance; nonbreeding shorebird; Gulf of Mexico	ANIMAL-SEDIMENT RELATIONSHIPS; SEMIPALMATED SANDPIPERS; ABUNDANCE; BAY; ECOLOGY; SEASONALITY; SHOREBIRDS; AMPHIPODS; SELECTION; BEHAVIOR	The Gulf of Mexico is home to a large proportion of the wintering population of the threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus), but little is known about the bird's ecology in this region. In Louisiana, the majority of nonbreeding piping plovers are found on the state's rapidly eroding barrier islands. Between August 2013 and May 2014, surveys were conducted to assess the abundance and habitat use of piping plovers, as well as to characterize their invertebrate prey base, on Whiskey and Trinity islands. Seventy-eight percent of piping plovers observed were foraging, 18% roosting, and 4% engaged in other ambulatory activities. Intertidal habitat, such as foreshore beach and tidal flats, was used by 87% of foraging and 96% of roosting piping plovers. Though available, backshore beach, interior sand flats, and dunes were rarely used. The invertebrate community was dominated by haustoriid amphipods (87.5% of individuals collected), followed by bivalves (9.3%) and polychaetes (2.7%). Seasonal patterns and between-island differences were observed in all three invertebrate taxa, but these effects differed between beach habitat and the gulfside and bayside of prominent sand spits. Moisture had a positive effect on amphipod abundance and polychaete presence. There was no association between invertebrate and plover abundance, and prey abundance did not differ between sample sites where piping plovers were observed foraging and random sites. The low abundances of birds and prey, coupled with high variation among samples, are challenges for establishing baseline datasets to evaluate the consequences of coastal restoration activities.

Here, we develop a multidimensional index of specialization based on five sets of ecological characteristics of breeding bird species. We used two recent databases of species traits of European birds based on foraging ecology, habitat, and breeding characteristics. The indices of specialization were calculated by applying the Gini coefficient, an index of inequality. The Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion on a scale between 0 and 1, reflecting a gradient from low to high specialization, respectively. Finally, we tested the strength of the phylogenetic signal of each specialization index to understand how the variance of such indices is shared throughout the phylogeny. The methods for constructing and evaluating a multidimensional index of bird specialization could also be applied to other taxa and regions, offering a simple but useful tool, particularly suited for global or biogeographic studies, as a contribution to comparative estimates of the degree of specialization of species.

Functions of the package can be used to conduct simulations and numerical analyses of a wide range of evolutionary phenomena that would typically be covered in advanced undergraduate through graduate-level curricula in population genetics or evolution. For instance, learnPopGen functions can be used to visualize gene frequency changes through time under multiple deterministic and stochastic processes, to compute and animate the changes in phenotypic trait values or distributions under natural selection, to numerically analyze and graph the outcome of simple game theory models, and to plot coalescence within a population experiencing genetic drift, along with a number of other things. Functions have been designed to be maximally didactic and frequently employ compelling animated visualizations. Furthermore, it is straightforward to export plots and animations from R in the form of flat or animated graphics, or as videos. For maximum flexibility, students working with the package can run functions directly in R; however, instructors may choose to guide students less adept in the R environment to one of various web interfaces that I have built for a number of the functions of the package and that are already available online.

Given their spatial configuration, alpine areas have been traditionally seen as islands surrounded by an "ocean" of unsuitable lands. A quantitative assessment of the effects of Holocene climate fluctuations on islands area and inter-island connectivity is crucial to finely reconstruct past biodiversity dynamics and forecast species responses to future changes. Location Italy. Taxa Carabidae (Ground beetles), Chrysomelidae (Leaf beetles), Elateridae (Click beetles), Orthoptera (Grasshoppers and Crickets) and Papilionoidea (Butterflies and Skippers). Methods A total of 1,077 species for 128,093 records were analysed and a classification based on their functional traits allowed identifying groups of good and poor dispersers within each taxon. A dynamic discrete model of ecosystem evolution provided the spatio-temporal context to test two competing (transient equilibria vs. nonequilibrium) dynamics based on different colonization capabilities. In the transient equilibria dynamic the species are able to respond to island evolution through successful dispersal and colonization events, whereas in the nonequilibrium dynamic ineffective immigration constrains the current species richness to that generated by the strongest island contraction. Results With the exception of Elateridae, good dispersers (Chrysomelidae and Papilionoidea) responded to environmental changes by establishing a series of transient equilibria. In contrast, the nonequilibrium dynamic better described patterns of species richness in poor dispersers (Carabidae and Orthoptera). Main conclusions Our approach could be used as the basis for the development of spatially and temporally explicit models of island evolution and could be a valuable tool for quantifying the sensitivity of single taxa to climate-driven habitat changes. It also represents a further step towards the forecasting of future responses to climate change and the accompanying development of conservation strategies that more effectively respond to the detrimental impacts of climate change on biodiversity.

Unmanned aerial vehicle-based assessment of cover crop biomass and nitrogen uptake variability	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						cereal rye; cover crops; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); remote sensing; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); vegetation indices	VEGETATION INDEXES; REMOTE; MAIZE; RYE; IMAGES; REFLECTANCE; HEIGHT; SYSTEM; FIELDS; GROWTH	Cover crops have the potential to reduce nitrate (NO3) losses while improving soil quality, yet achieving uniform cover crop establishment can be challenging in the US Midwest. Understanding the variability of cover crop biomass and nitrogen (N) uptake at the field-scale is an important step in determining potential effects on the following cash crop and benefits to water quality, but efficient and nondestructive methods are lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted with a multispectral sensor in estimating cover crop (grass species) biomass and N uptake prior to cover crop termination at four commercial fields in Illinois during the 2017 growing season. Two fields had triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) before corn (Zea mays L.) and two had cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) before soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.). Forty ground-truth biomass samples (1 m(2)) were collected on the day of each UAV flight across each field. Linear relationships were established between cover crop biomass and N uptake and four vegetation indices (VIs; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Green Ratio Vegetation Index [GRVI], Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [GNDVI], and Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI]). The four VIs performed similarly in estimating cover crop biomass and N uptake (R-2 range, 0.42 to 0.93; RMSE range, 9.4% to 27.2% of the range of biomass or N uptake). A high degree of within-field variability for NDVI was observed at all fields, with biomass and N uptake at soybean fields ranging from 0 to 1,790 kg ha(-1) and 0 to 48.5 kg ha(-1), respectively, and at corn fields 0 to 840 kg ha(-1) and 0 to 31.5 kg ha(-1), respectively. Because cover crop biomass is often estimated based on hand samples, we also simulated the effects of biomass sampling number (2, 5, 10, or 15) on the probability of reaching different accuracy levels for estimating field means for different field sizes. Under the growing conditions of this single study year and relatively modest biomass accumulation (<1,400 kg ha(-1)), results from this preliminary study provide evidence that UAVs are a viable technique to obtain relatively rapid, nondestructive estimates of biomass and N uptake of two grass cover crops at vegetative stage prior to termination at the field-scale in the US Midwest. This approach could help effectively utilize scarce conservation resources, but further work is needed to evaluate other cover crop species under a wider range of growth conditions.

Repeatable, continuous and real-time estimates of coupled nitrogenase activity and carbon exchange at the whole-plant scale	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						acetylene reduction; actinorhizal; ARACAS; legume; nitrogen fixation; nitrogenase; photosynthesis; respiration	ACETYLENE-REDUCTION ASSAY; N-2 FIXATION; DINITROGEN FIXATION; CAVITY RING; ETHYLENE; ALNUS; DETERMINES; SENESCENCE; INTERIOR; LEGUMES	Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) by higher plants and their bacterial symbionts is a globally important input of nitrogen. Our understanding of the mechanisms that control SNF and the time-scales over which they operate has been constrained by the limitations of the existing methods for measuring SNF. One method, Acetylene Reduction Assays by Cavity ring-down laser Absorption Spectroscopy (ARACAS), seems promising, as it is highly sensitive and gives rapid, continuous, repeatable and real-time measurements of nitrogenase activity. ARACAS has been used to study nitrogen fixation in lichens, mosses and asymbiotic bacteria, but adapting it to higher plants poses challenges because acetylene and ethylene can influence plant function. Here, we report modifications to ARACAS that allow it to be used on higher plants in an environmentally controlled incubation chamber. The modifications include lower concentrations of acetylene (2%) and ethylene and concurrent measurements of whole-chamber CO2 exchange, H2O exchange and nitrogenase activity, linking nitrogenase activity to whole-plant rates of photosynthesis and respiration. After propagating the error terms from all sources, we establish the following parameters of the method: (a) The detection limit of our method was 2-3 ppbv C2H4 per hour, although it rose substantially when we used tank-derived acetylene, which has much higher ethylene contamination; (b) Repeated measures at a frequency of 3 days or longer did not diminish nitrogenase activity or photosynthesis, although daily measurements diminished nitrogenase activity; (c) This method can detect changes at time-scales as short as seconds; (d) Continuous measurement of nitrogenase activity is maintained above 90% of the maximum rate for 7.0 +/- 1.3 (M +/- SD) hours. This method has the potential to improve our understanding of the controls over SNF, and therefore, how SNF and global nitrogen and carbon cycling are likely to be affected by global change.

Multiplex PCR targeting lineage-specific SNPs: A highly efficient and simple approach to block out predator sequences in molecular gut content analysis	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						lineage specific PCR; metabarcoding; predation; prey detection; prey-predator interaction; ribosomal DNA	COST-EFFICIENT; DNA; PREY; SPIDERS; SPRINGTAILS; POPULATION; BARCODE; MARKER; LIFE	Food webs form the basis of biological communities, though empirical research has been hindered by difficulties in quantifying interactions. Metabarcoding from predator gut content extractions with universal primers promises to provide simple and rapid insights into food web interactions. However, the highly overabundant predator DNA often completely out-competes that of the digested prey DNA during PCR, impeding the ability to assess the abundance and diversity of prey items. Focusing on the issue of overabundance of predator DNA amplified by a commonly used COI primer pair, we use predator lineage-specific SNPs at the 3'-end of PCR primers to selectively block out predators from amplification. While this approach largely prevents predator amplification, it retains high taxonomic versatility for prey lineages. We introduce a novel multilocus assay, targeting four nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA markers, and test our approach in a diverse set of spiders from 12 families. We estimate the recovered prey DNA proportions and compare the taxonomic composition of prey communities between markers. Using a feeding experiment, we also explore recovery of prey DNA over time. While commonly used COI primers yield low and very unpredictable amounts of prey DNA, our assay allows for a considerable and consistent prey enrichment across all tested species. The recovered prey's taxonomic composition is comparable between markers and supports results acquired by COI. The new marker set can be amplified in a simple multiplex PCR, considerably reducing the necessary workload. Our multilocus approach allows the generation of an unprecedented amount of prey data at low cost and effort. Lineage-specific PCR is taxonomically versatile and could readily be adapted to any prey-predator interaction, opening up the opportunity for community-wide studies on food web interactions.

These have been shown to improve species estimates when both datasets are large and dense. However, is a PA dataset that is smaller and patchier than hitherto examined able to do the same? Furthermore, when both datasets are relatively small, is there enough information contained within them to produce a useful estimate of species' distributions? These attributes are common in many applications. A stochastic simulation was conducted to assess the ability of a pooled data SDM to estimate the distribution of species from increasingly sparser and patchier datasets. The simulated datasets were varied by changing the number of presence-absence sample locations, the degree of patchiness of these locations, the number of PO observations, and the level of sampling bias within the PO observations. The performance of the pooled data SDM was compared to a PA SDM and a PO SDM to assess the strengths and limitations of each SDM. The pooled data SDM successfully removed the sampling bias from the PO observations even when the presence-absence data were sparse and patchy, and the PO observations formed the majority of the data. The pooled data SDM was, in general, more accurate and more precise than either the PA SDM or the PO SDM. All SDMs were more precise for the species responses than they were for the covariate coefficients. The emerging SDM methodology that pools PO and PA data will facilitate more certainty around species' distribution estimates, which in turn will allow more relevant and concise management and policy decisions to be enacted. This work shows that it is possible to achieve this result even in relatively data-poor regions.

Monitoring large and complex wildlife aggregations with drones	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						aerial vehicle; automated detection; bird; breeding; colonial; ecology; machine learning; waterbird	AERIAL SURVEYS; MANAGEMENT; SUCCESS; COUNTS; IMAGES	Recent advances in drone technology have rapidly led to their use for monitoring and managing wildlife populations but a broad and generalised framework for their application to complex wildlife aggregations is still lacking. We present a generalised semi-automated approach where machine learning can map targets of interest in drone imagery, supported by predictive modelling for estimating wildlife aggregation populations. We demonstrated this application on four large spatially complex breeding waterbird colonies on floodplains, ranging from c. 20,000 to c. 250,000 birds, providing estimates of bird nests. Our mapping and modelling approach was applicable to all four colonies, without any modification, effectively dealing with variation in nest size, shape, colour and density and considerable background variation (vegetation, water, sand, soil, etc.). Our semi-automated approach was between three and eight times faster than manually counting nests from imagery at the same level of accuracy. This approach is a significant improvement for monitoring large and complex aggregations of wildlife, offering an innovative solution where ground counts are costly, difficult or not possible. Our framework requires minimal technical ability, is open-source (Google Earth Engine and R), and easy to apply to other surveys.

Integrated population models: Model assumptions and inference	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Bayesian; heterogeneity; integrated population models; model assumption violation; parameter estimation	DEMOGRAPHIC DRIVERS; SURVIVAL RATES; ABUNDANCE; REPRODUCTION; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY; DECLINE; COLLARS; GROWTH; BANDS	Integrated population models (IPMs) have become increasingly popular for the modelling of populations, as investigators seek to combine survey and demographic data to understand processes governing population dynamics. These models are particularly useful for identifying and exploring knowledge gaps within life histories, because they allow investigators to estimate biologically meaningful parameters, such as immigration or reproduction, that were previously unidentifiable without additional data. As IPMs have been developed relatively recently, there is much to learn about model behaviour. Behaviour of parameters, such as estimates near boundaries, and the consequences of varying degrees of dependency among datasets, has been explored. However, the reliability of parameter estimates remains underexamined, particularly when models include parameters that are not identifiable from one data source, but are indirectly identifiable from multiple datasets and a presumed model structure, such as the estimation of immigration using capture-recapture, fecundity and count data, combined with a life-history model. To examine the behaviour of model parameter estimates, we simulated stable populations closed to immigration and emigration. We simulated two scenarios that might induce error into survival estimates: marker induced bias in the capture-mark-recapture data and heterogeneity in the mortality process. We subsequently fit capture-mark-recapture, state-space and fecundity models, as well as IPMs that estimated additional parameters. Simulation results suggested that when model assumptions are violated, estimation of additional, previously unidentifiable, parameters using IPMs may be extremely sensitive to these violations of model assumption. For example, when annual marker loss was simulated, estimates of survival rates were low and estimates of immigration rate from an IPM were high. When heterogeneity in the mortality process was induced, there were substantial relative differences between the medians of posterior distributions and truth for juvenile survival and fecundity. Our results have important implications for biological inference when using IPMs, as well as future model development and implementation. Specifically, using multiple datasets to identify additional parameters resulted in the posterior distributions of additional parameters directly reflecting the effects of the violations of model assumptions in integrated modelling frameworks. We suggest that investigators interpret posterior distributions of these parameters as a combination of biological process and systematic error.

These data are consistent with ingesting more C-4 plants, more animal tissues of C-4 herbivores, or both, but it is also possible that this change reflects factors unrelated to changes in the palaeobiology of the genus Homo. Here we use new and published carbon and oxygen isotopic data (n =999) taken from large-bodied fossil mammals, and pedogenic carbonates in fossil soils, from East Turkana in northern Kenya to investigate the context of this change in the isotope signal within Homo. By targeting taxa and temporal intervals unrepresented or undersampled in previous analyses, we were able to conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the ecological context of hominin diet at East Turkana during a period crucial for detecting any dietary and related behavioural differences between early Homo (H. habilis and/or H. rudolfensis) and Homo erectus. Our analyses suggest that the genus Homo underwent a dietary shift (as indicated by delta C-13(ena) and delta O-18(ena) values) that is (1) unrelated to changes in the East Turkana vegetation community and (2) unlike patterns found in other East Turkana large mammals, including Paranthropus and Theropithecus. These data suggest that within the Turkana Basin a dietary shift occurred well after we see the first evidence of early Homo in the region.

The origins and adaptation of European potatoes reconstructed from historical genomes	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DNA-SEQUENCES; R PACKAGE; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; ADMIXTURE; DOMESTICATION; ALIGNMENT; PATTERNS; GENETICS	Potato, one of the most important staple crops, originates from the highlands of the equatorial Andes. There, potatoes propagate vegetatively via tubers under short days, constant throughout the year. After their introduction to Europe in the sixteenth century, potatoes adapted to a shorter growing season and to tuber formation under long days. Here, we traced the demographic and adaptive history of potato introduction to Europe. To this end, we sequenced 88 individuals that comprise landraces, modern cultivars and historical herbarium samples, including specimens collected by Darwin during the voyage of the Beagle. Our findings show that European potatoes collected during the period 1650-1750 were closely related to Andean landraces. After their introduction to Europe, potatoes admixed with Chilean genotypes. We identified candidate genes putatively involved in long-day pre-adaptation, and showed that the 1650-1750 European individuals were not long-day adapted through previously described allelic variants of the CYCLING DOF FACTOR1 gene.

Geographic variation in dispersal distance facilitates range expansion of a lake shore plant in response to climate change	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Cakile edentula; climate change; dispersal evolution; expanding range limit; genetic diversity; geographic range	SEED DISPERSAL; CAKILE-EDENTULA; EVOLUTIONARY RESCUE; GENETIC-VARIATION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; LIMITS; SELECTION; MUTATIONS; TRAITS; WAVE	Aim Geographic variation in dispersal abilities is widespread and likely to affect species' range dynamics in response to climate change. However, distribution models that predict climate-induced range shifts do not account for spatial variation in dispersal. We developed an eco-genetic model to investigate how variation in dispersal distances across a species' range could interact with climate-induced selection and alter predicted range dynamics in a species with documented variation in dispersal traits. Location We investigated the range of an annual plant, Cakile edentula var. lacustris, which occupies beaches spanning a 555 km latitudinal gradient along the Laurentian Great Lakes. Methods We built a hybrid model that combines climatic niche modelling, based on decadal climate projections, with an individual-based model that allows for evolutionary processes to act upon a heritable dispersal kernel. We evaluated how spatial variation in dispersal distance and dispersal evolution influenced range dynamics, spatial and temporal variation in dispersal, and the distribution of neutral genetic variation. The model was parametrized with data on C. edentula's distribution, life history and dispersal characteristics. Results Geographic variation in dispersal distance, adaptive dispersal evolution and dispersal distance increased the potential for local populations of C. edentula to keep pace with changing climatic conditions through range shifts. Dispersal distances always increased at the expanding and contracting range edges when dispersal was allowed to evolve. Furthermore, scenarios where dispersal distances were initially lower at the range edges resulted in the largest evolutionary changes over 105 years (>1.5 km increase in mean distance at northern edge). Adaptive dispersal evolution always reduced neutral genetic diversity across the species' range. Main conclusions Variation in dispersal abilities across C. edentula's range and adaptive evolution led to different predicted outcomes in range dynamics during climate change illustrating the importance of including spatial variation in dispersal into species distribution models.

Disentangling how climate change can affect an aquatic food web by combining multiple experimental approaches	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						bromeliad; common garden; drought; elevation; insects; microcosm experiment; mountain; phytothelm; space-for-time; tropics	TOP-DOWN CONTROL; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; LITTER; WATER; DECOMPOSITION	Predicting the biological effects of climate change presents major challenges due to the interplay of potential biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Climate change can create unexpected outcomes by altering species interactions, and uncertainty over the ability of species to develop in situ tolerance or track environmental change further hampers meaningful predictions. As multiple climatic variables shift in concert, their potential interactions further complicate ecosystem responses. Despite awareness of these complexities, we still lack controlled experiments that manipulate multiple climatic stressors, species interactions, and prior exposure of species to future climatic conditions. Particularly studies that address how changes in water availability interact with other climatic stressors to affect aquatic ecosystems are still rare. Using aquatic insect communities of Neotropical tank bromeliads, we combined controlled manipulations of drought length and species interactions with a space-for-time transplant (lower elevations represent future climate) and a common garden approach. Manipulating drought length and experiment elevation revealed that adverse effects of drought were amplified at the warmer location, highlighting the potential of climatic stressors to synergistically affect communities. Manipulating the presence of omnivorous tipulid larvae showed that negative interactions from tipulids, presumably from predation, arose under drought, and were stronger at the warmer location, stressing the importance of species interactions in mediating community responses to climate change. The common garden treatments revealed that prior community exposure to potential future climatic conditions did not affect the outcome. In this powerful experiment, we demonstrated how complexities arise from the interplay of biotic and abiotic mechanisms of climate change. We stress that single species can steer ecological outcomes, and suggest that focusing on such disproportionately influential species may improve attempts at making meaningful predictions of climate change impacts on food webs.

If this extra food availability subsidizes predator populations, gamebird releases could increase predation pressure on other wild birds, affecting their populations. Using three extensive datasets, we examined the spatial relationships between reared and free-roaming gamebirds (pheasant Phasianus colchicus and red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa), and explored spatial and temporal associations between these gamebirds and five species of avian predator (buzzard Buteo buteo, jay Garrulus glandarius, raven Corvus corax, magpie Pica pica and hooded Corvus cornix and carrion Corvus corone crows combined) in lowland rural Britain. Patterns of spatial variation in the abundance of free-roaming gamebirds across Britain appear to be largely determined by gamebird releases, over and above any effects of land use or habitat. Predominantly positive associations between gamebird abundance (both reared and free-roaming) and the abundance and inter-annual population growth rates of predators tested suggest that large-scale variation in avian predator populations may be positively affected by gamebird releases. Synthesis and applications. The positive associations between large-scale gamebird release and predator populations shown here may have implications for prey populations if the releases cause increased predation pressure. If this occurs, game management could have an indirect negative impact on some prey species partially counteracting previously reported positive or benign effects of game management on wider biodiversity. Overall impacts of gamebird releases are likely to be determined by complex interactions between multiple factors, including induced predation pressure, better understanding of which would be possible with compulsory recording of releases and numbers of predators killed. Restriction of releases warrants further investigation and consideration as a potential conservation tool for wild bird populations.

Beyond the general benefits of increasing fallow availability for endangered steppe bird populations, there is a lack of knowledge on how fallow management can contribute to meeting species-specific habitat requirements. We used occurrence data from three steppe bird species protected at the EU level (Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax and Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra), framed in a quasi-experimental approach covering an unprecedented spatio-temporal scale that included 612 fallow fields over a 3-year study period in an agricultural Mediterranean landscape (Spain). We used path analysis to explore the mechanisms by which common agricultural practices affected species-specific occurrence. We examined partial effects of agricultural practices on vegetation structure and food availability, and the partial effect of these variables on bird occurrence compared to control fields (no agricultural practices applied). Agricultural practices had a significant effect on the presence of the three studied species. Through changes in the vegetation structure, Shredding + Herbicide and Tillage increased the occurrence of the Stone Curlew and Shredding increased the occurrence of the Little Bustard. The occurrence of Calandra Lark was mostly affected by landscape variables. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights that, in addition to the acknowledged positive role of fallow availability, applying a limited number of specific agricultural practices before the breeding season can further increase bird occurrence by changing the vegetation structure. Using path analysis, we explored the mechanisms driving the occurrence of three steppe bird species under different agricultural practices. Such information is key to providing specific recommendations for future conservation management of endangered species within agri-environmental schemes.

The Unexpected Absence of Nickel Effects on a Daphnia Population at 3 Temperatures is Correctly Predicted by a Dynamic Energy Budget Individual-Based Model	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Population-level effects; Population modeling; Metal toxicity; Temperature; Nickel; Dynamic energy budget individual-based model	LIFE-HISTORY; TOXICITY; CLADOCERAN; EXPOSURE; MAGNA; ADAPTATION; PARAMETERS; DENSITY; FITNESS; STRESS	Recent studies have shown that temperature affects chronic nickel (Ni) toxicity to Daphnia magna at the individual (apical) level. However, the effect of temperature on Ni toxicity to D. magna at the population level is unknown. The present study investigated whether the effect of temperature on chronic Ni toxicity to D. magna assessed on apical endpoints can be extrapolated to the population level. The results of the population experiment showed no consistent Ni effects on total D. magna population abundance at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C, although the Ni concentrations tested were previously reported to significantly reduce reproduction in D. magna individuals. This result supports the idea that ecological risk assessment should not extrapolate as such from apical endpoints to the population level. A dynamic energy budget individual-based model (DEB-IBM) was calibrated using apical Ni toxicity data at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. The goal was to investigate whether the calibrated DEB-IBM would be able to predict the unexpected absence of effects at the population level and to further investigate the effect of temperature on Ni toxicity to a D. magna population. At the population level, the calibrated DEB-IBM correctly predicted the unexpected absence of an effect of Ni on a D. magna population. Detailed analysis of simulation output suggests that the predicted lower Ni sensitivity at the population level occurs because Ni-induced mortality is compensated by reduced starvation (less intraspecific competition). Extrapolated median effective concentration (EC50) values for population density predicted that the effect of temperature on Ni toxicity to D. magna populations was smaller (1.9-fold higher at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C) than on Ni toxicity to D. magna apical reproduction (the EC50 is 6.5-fold higher at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C). These results show that the DEB-IBM can help to replace population experiments by in silico simulations and to optimize the experimental design of population studies.

Selenium and mercury in freshwater fish muscle tissue and otoliths: a comparative analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Bioaccumulation; Otoliths; Mercury; Selenium	RESIDUE APPROACH; OHIO RIVER; PATTERNS; ELEMENTS; HISTORY; BASS	Evaluating potential ecological and human health risks of exposure to bioaccumulative trace elements is typically implemented using analysis of tissue samples. Increasingly, the microchemistry of fish calcified structures is used to elucidate the lifetime exposure to trace elements. In the present study, we measured total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and selenium (Se) in muscle tissue and otolith samples from 12 species of fish collected at reference sites and locations influenced by power plant wastewater. Muscle tissue concentrations of Se were sensitive to recent wastewater exposure magnitude, stream type, trophic level, and species (p < 0.001). For Hg, concentrations in muscle tissue and otoliths were affected only by trophic level and species. Levels of THg and Se in muscle tissue and otolith samples were positively correlated for those species with a robust sample size. Some individual fish from 3 species (channel catfish, hybrid striped bass, and freshwater drum) showed significantly increasing or decreasing lifetime concentrations of either THg or Se in otolith samples. Multiple regression analysis indicated that for bluegill muscle tissue Se concentrations could be best explained utilizing water concentrations of selenium, sulfate, and molybdenum (r(2) = 0.87; p < 0.001). Because of the increased cost and specialized sample processing requirements of analyzing trace elements in otolith structures, it may be prudent to limit these analyses to those species where insights into temporal trends are sought or where evidence indicates that fish move into or out of contaminated water bodies.

SSDs Revisited: Part I-A Framework for Sample Size Guidance on Species Sensitivity Distribution Analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Biostatistics; Ecotoxicology; Species sensitivity distributions; Hazard; Risk Assessment	ECOLOGICAL RISK-ASSESSMENT; LIFE-CYCLE; TOXICITY; ASSUMPTIONS	We propose a framework on sample size for species sensitivity distribution (SSD) analyses, with perspectives on Bayesian, frequentist, and even nonparametric approaches to estimation. The intent of a statistical sample size analysis is to ensure that the implementation of a statistical model will satisfy a minimum performance standard when relevant conditions are met. It requires that a statistical model be fully specified and that the means of measuring its performance as a function of sample size be detailed. Defining the model conditions under which sample size is calculated is often the most difficult, and important, aspect of sample size analysis because if the model is not representative, then the sample size analysis will provide incorrect guidance. Definitive guidance on sample size requires general agreement on representative models and their performance from stakeholders in important domains such as chemical safety assessments involving government regulators and industry; the present study provides an initial framework that could be used to this end in the future. In addition, our analysis provides immediate value for understanding how well current SSD analyses perform under a few basic models, sample sizes, and quantitative performance criteria. The results confirm that many analyses are adequately sized to estimate hazardous concentration percentile values (typically the 5th percentile for chemical hazard assessments). However, on the low end of sizes seen in common practice, hazardous concentration estimates can be more than 1 order of magnitude greater than the model-defined value.

In this study, bike commuters' exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) was assessed using mobile measurements and video recording along three alternative routes from central Edinburgh to the science and engineering campus of the University of Edinburgh. Results indicate significant differences in UFP exposure across the three alternative routes, with mean particle number counts (PNC) of 7,990, 9,824 and 19,310 particles/cm(3) respectively. With respect to the different types of bike infrastructure present along routes, the findings suggest that bicycle boxes (spaces at intersections that allow cyclists to position themselves ahead of vehicle traffic) are effective for reducing UFP exposure and that using shared bus-bike lanes should be avoided where possible. Heavy duty vehicles (i.e. buses and trucks) and construction sites were identified as the main sources of peaks in UFP exposure. All routes in the city of Edinburgh showed markedly lower PNC levels than those reported by studies conducted in other cities. The findings of this study can inform the implementation of bike-sharing schemes and the design of future cycling infrastructure, for example in the context of developing the low emission zone proposed for implementation across Edinburgh for 2020.

Predicting the fundamental thermal niche of crop pests and diseases in a changing world: A case study on citrus greening	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Asian Citrus Psyllid; Bayesian inference; crop management; Huanglongbing; risk of establishment; species distribution models; transmission suitability; vector-borne disease	CANDIDATUS-LIBERIBACTER-ASIATICUS; SAO-PAULO STATE; DIAPHORINA-CITRI; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VECTOR; SPREAD; MEXICO; UNDERSTAND; MANAGEMENT	1. Predicting where crop pests and diseases can occur, both now and in the future under different climate change scenarios, is a major challenge for crop management. One solution is to estimate the fundamental thermal niche of the pest/disease to indicate where establishment is possible. Here, we develop methods for estimating and displaying the fundamental thermal niche of pests and pathogens and apply these methods to Huanglongbing (HLB), a vector-borne disease that is currently threatening the citrus industry worldwide. 2. We derive a suitability metric based on a mathematical model of HLB transmission between tree hosts and its vector Diaphorina citri, and incorporate the effect of temperature on vector traits using data from laboratory experiments performed at different temperatures. We validate the model using data on the historical range of HLB. 3. Our model predicts that transmission of HLB is possible between 16 and 33 degrees C with peak transmission at similar to 25 degrees C. The greatest uncertainty in our suitability metric is associated with the mortality of the vectors at peak transmission, and fecundity at the edges of the thermal range, indicating that these parameters need further experimental work. 4. We produce global thermal niche maps by plotting how many months each location is suitable for establishment of the pest/disease. This analysis reveals that the highest suitability for HLB occurs near the equator in large citrus-producing regions, such as Brazil and South-East Asia. Within the Northern Hemisphere, the Iberian peninsula and California are HLB suitable for up to 7 months of the year and are free of HLB currently. 5. Policy implications. We create a thermal niche map which indicates the places at greatest risk of establishment should a crop disease or pest enter these regions. This indicates where surveillance should be focused to prevent establishment. Our mechanistic method can be used to predict new areas for Huanglongbing transmission under different climate change scenarios and is easily adapted to other vector-borne diseases and crop pests.

Reported dengue cases via DATASUS were correlated with reanalysis data from NCEP (rainfall and air temperature) and Brazil's population data (2000 and 2010) from 1994 to 2014. The aim of this study was to evaluate relational patterns between climate variables together with population data from the last census and reported cases of dengue in Brazil from 1994 to 2014 by using statistical techniques. Several statistical methods [descriptive and exploratory statistics; simple and multiple linear regressions; Mann-Kendall (MK), Run, and Pettit nonparametric tests; and multivariate statistics via cluster analysis (CA)] were applied to time series. The highest percentages of Dengue cases were in Brazil's Southeast (47.14%), Northeast (29.86%), and Central West (13.01%). Upon CA of the Brazilian regions, three homogeneous dengue groups were formed: G(1) (North and Central West), G(2) (Southeast and Northeast), and G(3) (South). Run testing indicated that the time series is homogenous and persistence free. MK testing showed a nonsignificant trend of increase of dengue cases in 23 states with positive trends and in four states with negative trends of Brazil. A significant increase in the magnitude of dengue at the regional level was recorded in the North, Southeast, South, and Central West regions. Statistical methods showed that dengue variability in Brazil is cyclical (2- to 3-year cycles), but not repetitive of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the moderate, strong, and neutral categories. ENSO interferes with the action of weather systems, changing or intensifying rainfall and air temperatures in Brazil. The population increase in recent decades and the lack of effective public policies together with the action of ENSO contributed to the increase in dengue cases reported in Brazil.

Ultraviolet (UV)-blue patches located on the outer-ventral scales of some lacertid lizards are thought to be involved in male-male competition. However, the mechanisms that maintain their honesty remain unknown. Here, we use the common wall lizard Podarcis muralis to test whether the lateral UV-blue spots are conventional signals, the honesty of which is guaranteed by receiver-dependent costs, and discuss their potential role as an amplifier of body size. We first described the morphology and reflectance properties of lateral UV-blue spots in common wall lizards and investigated how they influence male-male competition. Spot size and number, UV chroma, and conspicuousness (calculated using vision models) were significantly greater in adult males relative to adult females and adult males relative to juveniles. Total spot area (and not spot number) of adult males was positively correlated with body size. We conducted staged competition encounters between focal males and smaller or larger rivals with control or manipulated spots. Spots were enlarged in small rivals and reduced in large rivals to disrupt the phenotypic correlation between spot area and body size. Aggressiveness and dominance were positively influenced by body size in control encounters. Spot manipulations resulted in greater submission and less aggressiveness in focal males. These results contradict the predictions associated with conventional signals and amplifiers, but suggest that spots contributed to opponent evaluation during short-distance encounters between competing males.Significance statementMany animals use color to communicate. During intraspecific resource competition, some species use color signals as an assessment tool to determine if they should engage in or avoid conflicts. Studies have found that in non-mammalian vertebrates, UV coloration can be a good indicator of fighting ability or aggressiveness. We tested whether and how the UV-blue spots of common wall lizards play a role in male-male competition by studying the properties of their spots, and then used that information to design and conduct competition experiments between males involving spot manipulation. Both body size and spot manipulation influenced aggression and submission during encounters. In particular, results suggest that spot manipulation disrupted mutual assessment and thus that spots play a role in competition signaling in male common wall lizards.

This ensemble model is also one of the most popular species distribution model algorithms (SDMs) available to date. RF by default can produce categorical and numerical species distribution maps based on its classification tree (CT) and regression tree (RT) algorithms, respectively. Statistically, CT can also produce numerical predictions (class probability). Many real-world applications (e.g. conservation planning) employ binary presence-absence outputs that use classification thresholds to make these conversions. However, there is little available information regarding the difference in model performance between CT and RT for inference settings. Here, under an ensemble modeling framework, 52 forest tree species with presence-only data for all of China were selected for comparison of the performance of CT and RT algorithms in projecting the distribution and potential range shifts of these species under current and future climates. Five climatic variables were used to develop CT and RT models. Eight threshold-setting approaches were employed to convert numerical predictions into binary predictions. With regard to probabilistic predictions, the relative performance of CT and RT depended on the choice of the evaluation criteria. For both RT and CT, threshold-setting methods significantly altered the determination of thresholds, model performance, and subsequently projections of species range shifts under climate change. The four threshold selection methods (MaxKappa, MaxOA, MaxTSS, and MinROCdist) based on the composite model accuracy measures most often achieved significantly higher model performance than CT default threshold method and other threshold methods. They consistently projected that species' geographical ranges changed in response to climate change with the same direction and magnitude. We argue for choosing RT rather than CT as the SDM if model discrimination capacity (the ability to differentiate between occurrences of presence and absence) is viewed as more important than model reliability (the agreement between predicted relative indexes of occurrence and observed proportions of occurrence), and vice versa. In line with gradient theory, we can recommend the use of numerical predictions for species distribution modeling since they help to convey more information than binary predictions. Binary conversion of model outputs should only be carried out when it is clearly justified by the application's objective. The four aforementioned threshold methods are promising objective methods for binary conversions of continuous predictions when presence-only data are available. This study proposes guidelines on how machine learning can be used for specific applied and theoretical applications in a SDM context.

Predicting larval tick burden on white-footed mice with an artificial neural network	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Aggregation; Blacklegged ticks; Ixodes scapularis; White-footed mouse; Peromyscus leucopus; Larval burden; Artificial neural network (ANN)	IXODES-SCAPULARIS ACARI; PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS; LYME BORRELIOSIS; BORNE DISEASES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HOSTS; ABUNDANCE; IXODIDAE; RICINUS; COMMUNITY	White-footed mice are important hosts for immature blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and the most competent reservoir hosts for several tick-borne pathogens, including the agent of Lyme disease, in eastern North America. The distribution of larval ticks on individual mice tends to be highly heterogeneous, potentially resulting in few individual hosts causing the majority of host-to-tick transmission events. In this study, we created an artificial neural network (ANN) model using a 20 year data set from Millbrook, NY, to understand which attributes of mice or the environment predict high larval burden. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the importance of, and interactions between, the most influential attributes. Our analysis indicated that highest larval burden is predicted in warmer and drier than average years when host abundance is low, and that climatic conditions and host density are far more important in predicting larval burden than traits of individual mice, a finding that could have human health implications within the context of a warming climate. Practically, our results suggest that instead of basing tick-control treatments on particular attributes of hosts, treatments should be targeted based on climate factors. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of including variable interactions in models aiming to predict vector (tick) aggregation, and, most broadly, demonstrate the utility of ANNs in understanding aggregation of ticks and other vectors.

This study we explored the effects of ecological restoration on the relative roles of replacement (beta(rep1)) and richness , difference (beta(ri)(ch)) components in terms of taxon (T beta(total)), phylogenetic (P beta(total)), and functional (F beta(total)) beta diversity in the Lishan mountain meadow, north China. The results reflected the relatively high values of beta diversity in the severely disturbed areas. Following restoration, the compositions of disturbed areas were closer to that of non-disturbed areas than that pre-restoration. In addition, we found the changes in T beta(total) were similar to those of P beta(t)(otal) and F beta(total). However, when beta(total) was partitioned into beta(rep1) and beta(r)(ich) components, the processes generating the beta diversity patterns appeared to be different in the different disturbance areas. The patterns of taxon and phylogenetic beta diversity resulted equally from the replacement and richness difference components, whereas the functional richness difference was higher than the functional replacement for functional beta diversity in the severely disturbed subarea. When the community was subjected to slight anthropogenic activity, only the replacement component had an important role in generating beta diversity patterns. With an increase in anthropogenic activity, both replacement and richness difference components played the important role. The relative roles of replacement and richness difference highlighted the anthropogenic effects on the community composition pre- and post-restoration. Disintegrating the relative roles of these two components was beneficial to understand the status of vegetation restoration and for taking appropriate measures in the different stages of restoration.

Blast integrate management (BIM) requires the use of genetic resistance, cultural practices, and chemical control, although for sustainable BIM, the insertion of biological agents may be the fourth component for. The objective of this work was to test three formulations of Burkholderia pyrrocinia (BRM32113) previously selected and to verify the effectiveness in resistance induction and blast control in rice. Two experiments were carried out, in a completely randomized design with three replications, in the greenhouse (E1 and E2). E1 aimed to select the best treatment for suppressing leaf blast severity and activating plant defense mechanisms. It was composed of 8 treatments: (1) formulated 11+ B. pyrrocina x Magnaporthe oryzae; (2) formulated 17+ B. pyrrocina x M. oryzae; (3) formulated 32+ B. pyrrocina x M. oryzae; (4) formulated 11 x M. oryzae; (5) B. pyrrocinia 17 x M. oryzae; (6) formulated 32 x M. oryzae; (7) B. pyrrocina x M. oryzae; (8) M. oryzae; (9) control (water). E2 aimed to investigate the effect of the best treatments, for the promotion of plant growth and suppression of leaf blast by calculating AUDPC. It was composed of 6 treatments: (1) formulated 11+ B. pyrrocina x M. oryzae; (2) formulated 32+ B. pyrrocina x M. oryzae; (3) formulated 11 x M. oryzae; (4) formulated 32 x M. oryzae; (5) B. pyrrocina x M. oryzae; (6) water. And after, we did two assays aimed to localize this biological agent after application at seed, soil, and rice plant. In E1, formulated 11+ B. pyrrocinia and 32+ formulated and B. pyrrocina were the best, suppressing leaf blast by up to 97% and providing the significant increase of the enzymes -1,3-glucanase, chitinase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, lipoxygenase, and salicylic acid at 24h and 48h after inoculation with M. oryzae. In E2, treatments formulated 11+ B. pyrrocinia, formulated 32+ B. pyrrocinia, and B. pyrrocina provided more significant increases in growth promotion and reduced area under disease progress curve. B. pyrrocinia was detected in the rice plant for 18days, predominantly in the root system (internal and external). The use of B. pyrrocinia formulations based on sugarcane molasses and glycerol can be an essential strategy for sustainable management. Although all the benefits come from these sustainable formulations, the adoption by commercial biological segment depends on an established formulation process. It seems that all the results showed here by this research will be readily assimilated by startups of the organic segment.

In this context, spatially explicit soil information is essential for improving the knowledge of the role of soil in changing environments, supporting coastal sustainable management. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data provides an attractive opportunity to monitor soil because the acquisition of images is independent of weather and daylight. However, SAR has not been commonly used for soil prediction. In this study, we firstly investigated the temporal variation of vegetation canopy and the soil-vegetation relationship using Sentinel-1 data in an invaded coastal wetland. And then we built 3D models to predict soil properties at multiple depths. A total of 16 Sentinel-1 images were acquired in a growing season. A series of soil physicochemical properties were examined including soil bulk density, texture, organic/inorganic carbon, pH, salinity, total nitrogen, and C/N ratio, relating to three depth layers in the top 1-m depth. Our results showed that time-series Sentinel-1 data can capture temporal characteristics of vegetation, and VH/VV was more sensitive to the vegetation growth than VH and VV. The soil-vegetation relationship captured by time-series SAR data was beneficial to predict soil properties, especially for soil chemical properties. The models provided permissible prediction accuracy, with an average RPD of 0.99. We concluded that the prior understanding of the temporal variation of SAR data is essential for developing practical soil prediction strategy. Our results highlight that SAR has the potential to predict a diverse set of soil properties in coastal wetlands with dense vegetation cover.

The evolutionary processes that generate such generalized interactions remain unknown, partly due to the difficulty in comparing their breadth. We argue that the interaction specificity of species involved in broad interactions evolves in three ways: (a) assemblage specialization, in which a species specializes on particular host species that contribute unique resources, yielding specialization on the entire host assemblage; (b) apparent generalism, in which a species specializes on one or few host species that contribute unique resources, but also associates with other host species that contribute functionally redundant resources; and (c) true generalism, in which a species associates with multiple hosts that overlap functionally, and that are geographically interchangeable based on opportunity for encounter, leading to frequent host switching. We performed a phylogenetically controlled analysis of data on mycorrhizal fungal associations for approximately 25% of the orchid subfamily Cypripedioideae to determine whether these plants have specialized on their mycorrhizal fungal communities, or whether they are true generalists. We also assessed the impact of environmental factors on these associations. Our results suggested strong support for apparent generalism, suggesting strong specialization on particular, dominant fungi and weak specialization on others. Large orchid clades associated with dominant fungal species, notably Tulasnella cystidiophora for genus Cypripedium, and T. cystidiophora and T. calospora for genus Paphiopedilum. Significant phylogenetic signal in fungal species richness per plant species, but not in the fungal phylogenetic diversity per plant species nor in the composition of fungal assemblages across orchid species suggested that plant phylogeny is an important determinant of fungal association. Mixed linear models showed that environment influenced specificity across plant species, and that observed differences were strongly driven by differences in sampling effort. Synthesis. We found evidence of specialization of plant species on dominant fungal species, and to a lesser extent on their close relatives. The strong dominance of particular fungal species in these associations suggests important ecological roles for them, while environmental gradients in specificity suggest strong environmental filtering of these interactions.

Variation within a species is increasingly acknowledged to have substantial ecological consequences, particularly through trophic cascades. We hypothesized that the intraspecific genotypic variation of the tree host might impact the phylogenetic composition of its rhizospheric microbial communities, by favouring particular clades, that might be further reflected in ecosystem process rates. We tested whether the intraspecific genotypic variation of Pinus pinaster modulates nutrient cycling by determining the phylogenetic structure of its symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi and rhizospheric bacteria. We sequenced fungal and bacterial molecular markers and reconstructed phylogenies in the rhizosphere of P. pinaster trees belonging to three genotypic variants (Mediterranean, Atlantic, African) in three 45-year-old common garden experiments, and measured seven soil enzymatic activities. Local effects, based on differences in elevation and soil conditions across sites, were strong predictors of the ectomycorrhizal and bacterial communities thriving in tree's rhizosphere. Across-site variation also explained differences in phosphorus cycling. We detected, however, a significant effect of the plant genotype on the phylogenetic structure of the root-associated microbiota that was consistent across sites. The most productive Mediterranean plant genotype sheltered the most distinct root microbiome, with the dominant Basidiomycetes and Proteobacteria having a strong influence on the phylogenetic microbial community structure and associating with an enhanced hydrolysis of celluloses, hemicelluloses and chitin. Beneath the less productive Atlantic genotype, the less abundant Ascomycetes and up to thirteen bacterial phyla shaped the phylogenetic microbial structure, and predicted the rates of peptidase. Ectomycorrhizal fungi explained the activity of cellulases and protease, and bacteria that of hemicellulases and chitinase, suggesting functional complementarity. Synthesis. This is the first report using three-replicated long-term common gardens in mature forests to disentangle plant genotype- and site-specific drivers of the rhizospheric microbiome and its enzymatic potential. We concluded that intraspecific variation in primary producers leaves a phylogenetic signature in mutualists and decomposers that further modulate key steps in carbon and nitrogen cycles. These results emphasize the ecological relevance of plant intraspecific diversity in determining essential plant-soil feedbacks that control ecosystem productivity and performance.

Re-examining a classic example of escape and radiate coevolution	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						coevolution; diversification; escape and radiate; evolution of anti-herbivore defenses; key innovation; latex; phylogenetics; plant-herbivore interactions	LINEAGE DIVERSIFICATION; VEGETATIVE ORGANS; DEFENSE; SPECIATION; LATICIFERS; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; CHARACTER; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	The association between increased lineage diversification rates and the evolution of latex and resin canals is widely cited as a paradigmatic example of Ehrlich and Raven's 'escape-and-radiate' hypothesis of co-evolution. However, it has been over a quarter-century since the original study, and updates to phylogenetic comparative methods, plant molecular systematics, and phenotypic data warrant a reassessment of this classic finding. We gathered data on latex and resin canals across 345 families and 986 genera of vascular plants and conducted a multi-scale test of the association between these traits and lineage diversification rates. At a broad scale (across clades), we used sister-clade comparisons to test whether 28 canal-bearing clades had higher net diversification rates than their canal-lacking sister clades. At a finer scale (within clades), we used ancestral state reconstructions and phylogenetic models of lineage diversification rates to examine the relationship between trait evolution and the timing of diversification rate shifts in two better-characterized clades - Araceae and Papaveraceae. At both scales of our analyses we found poor support for the predicted relationship between diversification and the evolution of latex and resin canals. Follow-up analyses clarified that the qualitative change between our results and those of the Farrell et al.'s classic study is not the result of different phylogenetic comparative methods. Instead, the differences are attributable to updates to plant systematic hypotheses and new data on laticifers and resin canal presence/absence. Synthesis. Our updated study reveals that there is no longer strong evidence for latex or resin canals as general, consistently replicable drivers of species diversity across plants. However, we cannot rule out a relationship in all groups. We therefore argue that theoretical and empirical work aimed at understanding ecological factors that condition 'escape-and-radiate' dynamics will allow for more nuanced tests of the hypothesis in the future.

Macroevolutionary patterns in overexpression of tyrosine: An anti-herbivore defence in a speciose tropical tree genus, Inga (Fabaceae)	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						expanding leaves; herbivore host choice; Inga (Fabaceae); plant-herbivore interactions; prephenate dehydrogenase; tropical rainforests; tyrosine overexpression	NITROGEN-CONTENT; LEAF DEVELOPMENT; YOUNG LEAVES; EVOLUTION; BUTTERFLIES; INSECTS; PLANTS; MECHANISMS; METABOLITE; TOXICITY	Plant secondary metabolites are a key defence against herbivores, and their evolutionary origin is likely from primary metabolites. Yet for this to occur, an intermediate step of overexpression of primary metabolites would need to confer some advantage to the plant. Here, we examine the evolution of overexpression of the essential amino acid, L-tyrosine and its role as a defence against herbivores. We examined overexpression of tyrosine in 97 species of Inga (Fabaceae), a genus of tropical trees, at five sites throughout the Neotropics. We predicted that tyrosine could act as an anti-herbivore defence because concentrations of 4% tyrosine in artificial diets halved larval growth rates. We also collected insect herbivores to determine if tyrosine and its derivatives influenced host associations. Overexpression of tyrosine was only present in a single lineage comprising 21 species, with concentrations ranging from 5% to 20% of the leaf dry weight. Overexpression was pronounced in expanding but not in mature leaves. Despite laboratory studies showing toxicity of L-tyrosine, Inga species with tyrosine suffered higher levels of herbivory. We therefore hypothesize that overexpression is only favoured in species with less effective secondary metabolites. Some tyrosine-producing species also contained secondary metabolites that are derived from tyrosine: tyrosine-gallates, tyramine-gallates and DOPA-gallates. Elevated levels of transcripts of prephenate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the tyrosine biosynthetic pathway that is insensitive to negative feedback from tyrosine, were found only in species that overexpress tyrosine or related gallates. Different lineages of herbivores showed contrasting responses to the overexpression of tyrosine and its derived secondary metabolites in their host plants. Synthesis. We propose that overexpression of some primary metabolites can serve as a chemical defence against herbivores, and are most likely to be selected for in species suffering high herbivory due to less effective secondary metabolites. Overexpression may be the first evolutionary step in the transition to the production of more derived secondary metabolites. Presumably, derived compounds would be more effective and less costly than free tyrosine as anti-herbivore defences.

Integrated metabolic strategy: A framework for predicting the evolution of carbon-water tradeoffs within plant clades	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon stable isotope; ecophysiological traits; leaf economic spectrum; oxygen stable isotope; phenotypic plasticity; plant strategies; tradeoffs; water-use efficiency	NITROGEN-USE EFFICIENCY; LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; STABLE-CARBON; OXYGEN; TRAITS; TREE; DELTA-O-18	The fundamental tradeoff between carbon gain and water loss has long been predicted as an evolutionary driver of plant strategies across environments. Nonetheless, challenges in measuring carbon gain and water loss in ways that integrate over leaf lifetime have limited our understanding of the variation in and mechanistic bases of this tradeoff. Furthermore, the microevolution of plant traits within species versus the macroevolution of strategies among closely related species may not be the same, and accordingly, the latter must be addressed using comparative phylogenetic analyses. Here we introduce the concept of 'integrated metabolic strategy' (IMS) to describe the ratio between carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) and oxygen isotope composition above source water (Delta O-18) of leaf cellulose. IMS is a measure of leaf-level conditions that integrate several mechanisms contributing to carbon gain (delta C-13) and water loss (Delta O-18) over leaf lifespan, with larger values reflecting higher metabolic efficiency and hence less of a tradeoff. We tested how IMS evolves among closely related yet ecologically diverse milkweed species, and subsequently addressed phenotypic plasticity in response to water availability in species with divergent IMS. Integrated metabolic strategy varied strongly among 20 Asclepias species when grown under controlled conditions, and phylogenetic analyses demonstrate species-specific tradeoffs between carbon gain and water loss. Larger IMS values were associated with species from dry habitats, with larger carboxylation capacity, smaller stomatal conductance and smaller leaves; smaller IMS was associated with wet habitats, smaller carboxylation capacity, larger stomatal conductance and larger leaves. The evolution of IMS was dominated by changes in species' demand for carbon (delta C-13) more so than water conservation (Delta O-18). Although some individual physiological traits showed phylogenetic signal, IMS did not. In response to experimental decreases in soil moisture, three species maintained similar IMS across levels of water availability because of proportional increases in delta C-13 and Delta O-18 (or little change in either), while one species increased IMS due to disproportional changes in delta C-13 relative to Delta O-18. Synthesis. IMS is a broadly applicable mechanistic tool; IMS variation among and within species may shed light on unresolved questions relating to the evolution and ecology of plant ecophysiological strategies.

Recent research has showed very high levels of specialization in the cyanolichens involving Peltigera (mycobionts) and their Nostoc photosynthetic partners (cyanobionts). Yet, little is known about the mechanisms contributing to the establishment and maintenance of such high specialization levels. Here, we characterized interactions between Peltigera and Nostoc partners at a global scale, using more than one thousand thalli. We used tools from network theory, community phylogenetics and biogeographical history reconstruction to evaluate how these symbiotic interactions may have evolved. After splitting the interaction matrix into modules of preferentially interacting partners, we evaluated how module membership might have evolved along the mycobionts' phylogeny. We also teased apart the contributions of geographical overlap vs phylogeny in driving interaction establishment between Peltigera and Nostoc taxa. Module affiliation rarely evolves through the splitting of large ancestral modules. Instead, new modules appear to emerge independently, which is often associated with a fungal speciation event. We also found strong phylogenetic signal in these interactions, which suggests that partner switching is constrained by conserved traits. Therefore, it seems that a high rate of fungal diversification following a switch to a new cyanobiont can lead to the formation of large modules, with cyanobionts associating with multiple closely retated Peltigera species. Finally, when restricting our analyses to Peltigera sister species, the latter differed more through partner acquisition/loss than replacement (i.e., switching). This pattern vanishes as we look at sister species that have diverged longer ago. This suggests that fungal speciation may be accompanied by a stepwise process of (a) novel partner acquisition and (b) loss of the ancestral partner. This could explain the maintenance of high specialization levels in this symbiotic system where the transmission of the cyanobiont to the next generation is assumed to be predominantly horizontal. Synthesis. Overall, our study suggests that oscillation between generalization and ancestral partner loss may maintain high specialization within the lichen genus Peltigera, and that partner selection is not only driven by partners' geographical overlap, but also by their phylogenetically conserved traits.

Number of different pollen taxa or pollen richness is used to characterise past plant richness. To improve the interpretation of sedimentary pollen richness, it is essential to understand the relationship between pollen and plant richness in contemporary landscapes. This study presents a regional-scale comparison of pollen and plant richness from northern Europe and evaluates the importance of environmental variables on pollen and plant richness. We use a pollen dataset of 511 lake-surface pollen samples ranging through temperate, boreal and tundra biomes. To characterise plant diversity, we use a dataset formulated from the two largest plant atlases available in Europe. We compare pollen and plant richness estimates in different groups of taxa (wind-pollinated vs. non-wind-pollinated, trees and shrubs vs. herbs and grasses) and test their relationships with climate and landscape variables. Pollen richness is significantly positively correlated with plant richness (r = 0.53). The pollen plant richness correlation improves (r = 0.63) when high pollen producers are downweighted prior to estimating richness minimising the influence of pollen production on the pollen richness estimate. This suggests that methods accommodating pollen-production differences in richness estimates deserve further attention and should become more widely used in Quaternary pollen diversity studies. The highest correlations are found between pollen and plant richness of trees and shrubs (r = 0.83) and of wind-pollinated taxa (r = 0.75) suggesting that these are the best measures of broad-scale plant richness over several thousands of square kilometres. Mean annual temperature is the strongest predictor of both pollen and plant richness. Landscape openness is positively associated with pollen richness but not with plant richness. Pollen richness values from extremely open and/or cold areas where pollen production is low should be interpreted with caution because low local pollen production increases the proportion of extra-regional pollen. Synthesis. Our results confirm that pollen data can provide insights into past plant richness changes in northern Europe, and with careful consideration of pollen-production differences and spatial scale represented, pollen data make it possible to investigate vegetation diversity trends over long time-scales and under changing climatic and habitat conditions.

At landscape scales, feedbacks cause vegetation and wildfire regimes to alter one another, while forest patterns at local scales can result from feedbacks between plants and their abiotic environment. Consequently, disturbances and abiotic changes may give rise to forest patterns that further affect processes like wildfire. Examples may exist in the history of subalpine ribbon forests, which are alternating areas of forest and meadow where snow drifting and linear bands of trees depend upon each other. Just as ongoing climate changes may change snow levels and the dynamics in these forests, past climate changes and wildfires may have generated the conditions suitable for ribbon forests. To examine feedbacks in subalpine forests and the potential that climate changes and fires gave rise to ribbon forests, we obtained six fossil pollen records from a subalpine landscape in Colorado. Forests there may have responded to climate change and widespread wildfires similar to 1,000 years ago when >80% of sites on the landscape burned within a century. The fires coincided with regional warming, but the extent of burning declined before the climate cooled, possibly driven by changes in fuel structure and composition. The pollen records indicate that large vegetation changes coincided with the widespread wildfires at five of the six sites. Pollen assemblages consistent with ribbon forests first became important at this time as sagebrush (Artemisia) and other meadow taxa increased and conifers, especially spruce (Picea) declined. The ribbon forests emerged as novel fuel breaks at the time when temperatures rose similar to 0.5 degrees C but the number of sites burned per century declined. Cooling during the Little Ice Age then expanded the openings and extent of ribbon forests, probably helping to reduce the frequency of fires across our sites to its minimum. Synthesis. The rise of ribbon forests in northern Colorado illustrates how climate and fire can interact to rapidly transform landscapes and disturbance regimes. The interactions can produce forest patterns with unexpected consequences such as reduced wildfire despite regional warming.

Plant geographic origin and phylogeny as potential drivers of community structure in root-inhabiting fungi	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; host plant abundance; host plant phylogeny; Illumina sequencing; pathogenic fungi; plant geographical origins; root-inhabiting fungi	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL FEEDBACK; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE; SPECIES RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; PATHOGEN; GRASS; BIOTA; MAINTENANCE; ENDOPHYTES	Root-inhabiting fungal communities, including mutualists and antagonists, influence host plant performance, and can potentially shape plant community composition. However, there is uncertainty about how root-inhabiting fungal communities are structured, and if fungal community characteristics are significant predictors of host plant abundance. In this study, we first assessed how root-inhabiting fungal communities were structured in relation to the phylogeny and geographic origins (native vs. exotic) of their host plants in an old-field community. In addition, we took into consideration the spatial arrangements (i.e. physical locations) of the individual host plants. We then tested if the relative abundances of pathogenic and beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi could predict host plant abundances. We found that host plant phylogeny was an important factor in structuring the whole fungal community, irrespective of host plant origin. Furthermore, the spatial arrangements of individual host plants were a strong predictor of AM fungal community structure. Host plant phylogeny and spatial arrangements appeared to similarly affect the structure of pathogenic fungal communities. No distinct differences were observed between native and exotic plant species in fungal community characteristics. The relative abundances of AM and pathogenic fungi were not significant predictors for observed abundances of their host plants. Synthesis. Host plant phylogeny and spatial arrangements can structure naturally occurring root-inhabiting fungal communities. The absence of distinct differences in fungal community composition, including pathogens, in exotic and native plants suggests long residence times and the consequent naturalization of exotic species in the region, allowing for the establishment of similar plant-microbial interactions between native and exotic species.

Quantifying niche availability, niche overlap and competition for recruitment sites in plant populations without explicit knowledge of niche axes	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						biotic interactions; coexistence; environmental heterogeneity; facilitation; fundamental niche; niche partitioning; recruitment function; seed limitation	SPECIES-RICHNESS; SOIL-MOISTURE; GRASSLAND; MAINTENANCE; COEXISTENCE; PATTERNS; HETEROGENEITY; ESTABLISHMENT; DOMINANCE; INVASION	Niche availability, niche overlap and competitive ability are key determinants of the distribution and abundance of species. However, quantifying each of these components is difficult because it is not always possible to identify or measure relevant environmental gradients (niche axes) along which species might partition or compete for niche space. We describe a method that uses seed addition experiments to quantify the number of 'safe-sites' (microsites suitable for a species to recruit from seed) at a location and show how this method can be used to quantify niche availability, niche overlap and competitive ability. We illustrate our approach using two seed addition experiments in grassland. In the first experiment, we added seeds of one native and two exotic grass species, alone and in mixture, to plots that were arrayed along a gradient of soil moisture availability. We show that the three species partitioned safe-sites, implying that all three species could locally co-occur through niche partitioning, in part due to different responses to moisture availability. In the second experiment, we added seeds of three commonly co-occurring native grass species, alone and in mixture, to plots with no obvious environmental gradients. One species out-competed two others for site occupancy, allowing us to quantify both the degree of niche overlap and the relative ability of each species to compete for safe-site occupancy without a priori knowledge of the niche axes. Results from both experiments demonstrate the fine-scales at which species can partition niches to facilitate co-occurrence. Synthesis. By conceptualising a plot of ground as containing a limited number of microsites that are safe for the recruitment of a given species, and using seed addition experiments to measure both the number of safe-sites and degree of safe-site overlap among species, we show how niche availability, niche overlap and competitive ability can be quantified at fine-scales without a priori knowledge of niche axes. Our approach allows questions about niche availability and competition for shared niche space to be empirically tested, and to examine how these processes vary along environmental gradients to shape species distributions and patterns of co-occurrence.

The spatial ecology of sex ratios in a dioecious plant: Relations between ramet and genet sex ratios	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						clonal reproduction; dioecy; reproductive ecology; sex ratios; sexual dimorphism; spatial ecology	FEMALE BIAS; PATTERNS; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; POLLINATION; DIMORPHISM; DISPERSAL; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS	In clonal dioecious plants, the frequency and spatial distribution of flowering ramets contains information on the underlying genet sex ratio. These measures can also provide insight on potential ecological mechanisms causing variation and bias in sex ratios among populations. We used a novel likelihood-based approach and spatial clustering model to estimate the genet sex ratios from flowering ramet data collected from 32 populations of dioecious Thalictrum pubescens, a clonal species from eastern N. America that occupies moist wetland and forested environments. We investigated sex ratios of seed families, clone size, patterns of flowering and plant height to determine potential causes of sex-ratio bias. Flowering ramet sex ratios varied considerably among populations but were significantly male-biased. Seed families grown to flowering also exhibited the same degree of male bias. Both models predicted close correspondence between ramet and genet sex ratios. The likelihood model revealed that sex differences in ramet production could not account for biased ramet sex ratios. The spatial clustering model indicated that ramets were significantly clustered at two spatial scales and estimated similar cluster sizes and densities for both sexes. There was no evidence for spatial segregation of the sexes. Both sexes were equally likely to flower in consecutive years and repeated bouts of flowering had no effect on ramet height. Synthesis. Our analyses suggest that the widespread occurrence of male-biased sex ratios in Thalictrum pubescens is unlikely to result from sexual differences in clonal growth or habitat preferences. The bias appears to become established early in the life cycle, perhaps at the seed stage as a consequence of local resource competition.	[Timerman, David; Barrett, Spencer C.

Responses of seedling growth and survival to post-germination cotyledon removal: An investigation among seven oak species	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						cotyledon predation; red oak; seed-animal interaction; seedling performance; seedling survival; white oak	GREY SQUIRRELS; SMALL RODENTS; PREDATION; ACORNS; DISPERSAL; SIZE; RECRUITMENT; NITROGEN; PATTERNS; WEEVILS	Rodents regularly rely on emerged epicotyls to locate and remove cotyledons still containing valuable nutrients. However, the extent to which acorn characteristics influence tolerance to post-germination predation has received little attention. Here, we investigated the impact of cotyledon removal following epicotyl emergence on seedling performance and survival of seven oak (Quercus) species. We imitated cotyledon predation at different stages of seedling establishment and development in order to detect effects on seedling height, leaf number and tissue/component mass. Seedling growth and survival were negatively affected by cotyledon loss regardless of oak species. However, these negative effects decreased as the epicotyl length at which cotyledons were removed increased. We also found that there was a threshold epicotyl length above which seedling survival and performance were relatively unaffected in white oak species compared to red oak species. Following cotyledon removal, early germinating white oak (section Quercus) seedlings survived and/or grew better than the late germinating red oak (section Lobatae) seedlings. This was likely caused by a difference in dependence on cotyledon reserves, which ultimately affected the ability of seedlings to tolerate cotyledon removal. Synthesis. From an evolutionary perspective, this is likely to follow from the early germination in white oaks and the ability of seed consumers to locate young seedlings from the emerging epicotyls. Our study has implications for forest regeneration by suggesting additional opportunities for white oak species to establish following epicotyl emergence. Future studies should consider quantifying the rates of post-germination cotyledon loss.

The concept that chemical and structural defences can augment each other and do not necessarily trade-off has emanated from this work. In this study, we examine woody plant defence strategies, how these respond to herbivore removal and how they affect plant growth in an East African savanna. At three paired long-term exclosure sites with high browser and mixed-feeder densities at Mpala Ranch, Kenya, we investigated: (a) whether defences employed by the dominant fine- and broad-leaved woody savanna species form defence strategies and if these align with previously proposed strategies, (b) how nine key plant defence traits respond to herbivore removal and (c) how effective the different defence strategies are at protecting against intense herbivory (by measuring plant growth with and without herbivores present). We identified three defence strategies. We found a group (a) with high N, short spines and high N-free secondary metabolites, a group (b) with high N, long spines and low N-free secondary metabolites and a group (c) with moderate N, no spines and low N-free secondary metabolites (most likely defended by unmeasured chemical defences). Structural defences (spine length, branching) were generally found to be induced by herbivory, leaf available N increased or did not respond, and N-free secondary metabolites decreased or did not respond to herbivory. Species with long spines combined with increased "caginess" (dense canopy architecture arising from complex arrangement of numerous woody and spiny axis categories) of branches, maintained the highest growth under intense browsing, compared to species with short spines and high N-free secondary metabolites and species with no spines and low N-free secondary metabolites. Synthesis. At our study site, structural traits (i.e. spines, increased caginess) were the most inducible and effective defences against intense mammalian herbivory. We propose that high levels of variability in the way that nutrient and defence traits combine may contribute to the coexistence of closely related species comprising savanna woody communities.

Given increasing environmental variability and uncertainty under global change, an emerging question is how biodiversity influences the stability of multiple functions (i.e. multifunctional stability). We currently know little, however, about the determinants and mechanisms of multifunctional stability, which is of practical importance for ensuring the sustainable provision of multiple functions. Here, we examined mechanisms contributing to stability (quantified as the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation) of multiple functions related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration, including plant above-ground and below-ground productivity, litter production, gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration, in a large grassland biodiversity experiment in Inner Mongolia. We found that community-wide species asynchrony was a strong driver to stabilize multiple functions. Community-wide asynchrony mediated the positive effects of species richness and response diversity (describing how species with similar effects on ecosystem function respond differently to environmental change) on multifunctional stability. However, species richness had a negative direct effect on multifunctional stability because, although it increased the averaged temporal mean of multiple functions, it strongly increased the averaged temporal standard deviation of multiple functions. The overall effects of species richness on multifunctional stability were thus negative, whereas those of response diversity were positive. Synthesis. The studied ecosystem functions related to ecosystem productivity and carbon sequestration are important in natural grasslands across the world. We conclude that species asynchrony and response diversity, rather than species richness, are key to the ecosystem multifunctional stability. The loss of response diversity and compensatory mechanisms would likely reduce the long-term sustainability of grasslands in the face of global change.

Effect of lianas on forest-level tree carbon accumulation does not differ between seasons: Results from a liana removal experiment in Panama	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon balance; dry season advantage; dry season length; liana biomass increase; liana-tree competition	TROPICAL FORESTS; DRY-SEASON; WATER-USE; GROWTH; PATTERNS; CLIMATE; UNCERTAINTY; COMPETITION; DROUGHT; STORAGE	Lianas are prevalent in Neotropical forests, where liana-tree competition can be intense, resulting in reduced tree growth and survival. The ability of lianas to grow relative to trees during the dry season suggests that liana-tree competition is also strongest in the dry season. If correct, the predicted intensification of the drying trend over large areas of the tropics in the future may therefore intensify liana-tree competition resulting in a reduced carbon sink function of tropical forests. However, no study has established whether the liana effect on tree carbon accumulation is indeed stronger in the dry than in the wet season. Using 6 years of data from a large-scale liana removal experiment in Panama, we provide the first experimental test of whether liana effects on tree carbon accumulation differ between seasons. We monitored tree and liana diameter increments at the beginning of the dry and wet season each year to assess seasonal differences in forest-level carbon accumulation between removal and control plots. We found that median liana carbon accumulation was consistently higher in the dry (0.52 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) than the wet season (0.36 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and significantly so in three of the years. Lianas reduced forest-level median tree carbon accumulation more severely in the wet (1.45 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) than the dry (1.05 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) season in all years. However, the relative effect of lianas was similar between the seasons, with lianas reducing forest-level tree carbon accumulation by 46.9% in the dry and 48.5% in the wet season. Synthesis. Our results provide the first experimental demonstration that lianas do not have a stronger competitive effect on tree carbon accumulation during the dry season. Instead, lianas compete significantly with trees during both seasons, indicating a large negative effect of lianas on forest-level tree biomass increment regardless of seasonal water stress. Longer dry seasons are unlikely to impact liana-tree competition directly; however, the greater liana biomass increment during dry seasons may lead to further proliferation of liana biomass in tropical forests, with consequences for their ability to store and sequester carbon.

Not surprisingly, phenotypic responses to climate change have already been observed in many plant populations. These responses may be due to evolutionary adaptive changes or phenotypic plasticity. Especially plant species with a wide geographic range are either expected to show genetic differentiation in response to differing climate conditions or to have a high phenotypic plasticity. We investigated phenotypic responses and plasticity as an estimate of the adaptive potential in the widespread species Silene vulgaris. In a greenhouse experiment, 25 European populations covering a geographic range from the Canary Islands to Sweden were exposed to three experimental precipitation and two temperature regimes mimicking a possible climate-change scenario for central Europe. We hypothesized that southern populations have a better performance under high temperature and drought conditions, as they are already adapted to a comparable environment. We found that our treatments significantly influenced the plants, but did not reveal a latitudinal difference in response to climate treatments for most plant traits. Only flower number showed a stronger plasticity in northern European populations (e.g. Swedish populations) where numbers decreased more drastically with increased temperature and decreased precipitation treatment. Synthesis. The significant treatment response in Silene vulgaris, independent of population origin - except for the number of flowers produced - suggests a high degree of universal phenotypic plasticity in this widely distributed species. This reflects the likely adaptation strategy of the species and forms the basis for a successful survival strategy during upcoming climatic changes. However, as flower number, a strongly fitness-related trait, decreased more strongly in northern populations under a climate-change scenario, there might be limits to adaptation even in this widespread, plastic species.

Reproductive losses due to climate change-induced earlier flowering are not the primary threat to plant population viability in a perennial herb	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						demography; drought; earlier flowering; environmental driver; matrix model; phenological shift; population dynamics; snowmelt	DEMOGRAPHIC COMPENSATION; CROSS-VALIDATION; PHENOLOGY; FROST; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES; DRIVEN; GROWTH; CONSEQUENCES; SENSITIVITY	Despite a global footprint of shifts in flowering phenology in response to climate change, the reproductive consequences of these shifts are poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unknown whether altered flowering times affect plant population viability. We examine whether climate change-induced earlier flowering has consequences for population persistence by incorporating reproductive losses from frost damage (a risk of early flowering) into population models of a subalpine sunflower (Helianthella quinquenervis). Using long-term demographic data for three populations that span the species' elevation range (8-15 years, depending on the population), we first examine how snowmelt date affects plant vital rates. To verify vital rate responses to snowmelt date experimentally, we manipulate snowmelt date with a snow removal experiment at one population. Finally, we construct stochastic population projection models and Life Table Response Experiments for each population. We find that populations decline (lambda(s) < 1) as snowmelt dates become earlier. Frost damage to flower buds, a consequence of climate change-induced earlier flowering, does not contribute strongly to population declines. Instead, we find evidence that negative effects on survival, likely due to increased drought risk during longer growing seasons, drive projected population declines under earlier snowmelt dates. Synthesis. Shifts in flowering phenology are a conspicuous and important aspect of biological responses to climate change, but here we show that the phenology of reproductive events can be unreliable measures of threats to population persistence, even when earlier flowering is associated with substantial reproductive losses. Evidence for shifts in reproductive phenology, along with scarcer evidence that these shifts actually influence reproductive success, are valuable but can paint an incomplete and even misleading picture of plant population responses to climate change.

However, species that remain in situ and experience climate change will interact with species tracking climate change, which could also affect patterns of biodiversity. The relative contribution of species gains and losses to net changes in species richness is still unclear. We use transplanted plant communities to test the hypothesis that both the change in climate and ecological communities tracking climate change will influence how species richness responds to climate change. Three intact alpine plant communities were reciprocally transplanted to create scenarios in which species experienced warmer and wetter conditions (transferred to lower elevations) and cooler and drier conditions (transferred to higher elevations) over 10 years on the Tibetan Plateau. Communities transplanted into the same elevation as controls represent species tracking climate change. Transferring to lower elevations generally caused a net increase in richness and a higher rate of gains relative to the control plots; the magnitude of this effect depended on the specific elevation. Transferring to higher elevations lead to either net increases or decreases in richness and gains, depending on elevation. Species gains predicted much more variation in changes in species richness (50%) than did species loss (9%). Species richness at the receptor site and the donor site were both important predictors of variation in species richness, and the abiotic environment did not explain additional variation. Changes in cover of dominant plant species in response to transfers did not predict changes in species richness, species gain or species loss. Our results suggest that species gains from species tracking climate change at the receptor sites, rather than species loss from the donor sites, predicted changes in species richness. Synthesis. Warming experiments with physical barriers to dispersal may overestimate the negative effect of warming on plant diversity by not accounting for species gains. Our study highlights the importance of biotic factors in addition to the abiotic environment, when considering how climate change will affect plant diversity.

Climate change is expected to result in a reorganization of the continental distribution of tree species. Recent shifts in distribution patterns have been reported, but it is not always clear how climate change influences these patterns locally, especially in relation to other disturbances. 2. We investigated latitudinal shifts of four ecologically important tree species between 1970 and 2014 within a study area that encompasses their northernmost range limit in northeastern North America (Quebec, Canada; similar to 761,000 km(2)). Changes in latitudinal limits were defined in relation to changes in tree saplings' occurrence patterns within forest plots resampled over two time periods (1970-1977 and 2003-2014). By examining changes in the frequency of occurrences in different portions of the study area along a latitudinal gradient, we were able to identify spatially explicit patterns of loss or gain (sapling recruitment) resulting in the shifts observed. We then estimated the probability of observing a recruitment event in response to changes in climate, disturbance and their interaction, using a multimodel selection approach. 3. Latitudinal limits of all four species shifted northward, but these shifts resulted from different patterns of plot occurrence changes, depending on the species and the location examined. Greater recruitment at northern locations than at southern ones drove shifts for Acer saccharum Marsh., Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. and Acer rubrum L., but less so for Betula alleghaniensis Britt. Climate variables indicating changes in early or late growing season conditions were most often selected in models. Warming tended to reduce recruitment probability in the south but increase it in the north, leading to divergent responses for a given species across the study area. Disturbance effects were generally less important than climate change effects, as was their interaction. 4. Synthesis. Spatially explicit and divergent responses to climate change and disturbance drive recruitment patterns underlying latitudinal shifts of tree species. The importance of early- or late-season climate variables points towards biological processes being affected at critical stages of the life cycle. Understanding the factors that influence species' migration capacity in a changing climate is crucial to inform adaptive management and conservation practices.

Altered phenology can introduce organisms to novel abiotic conditions during growth and modify species interactions, both of which could drive changes in reproduction. We explored how climate change can alter plant reproduction using an experiment in which we manipulated the individual and combined effects of snowmelt timing and frost exposure, and measured subsequent effects on flowering phenology, peak flower density, frost damage, pollinator visitation and reproduction of four subalpine wildflowers. Additionally, we conducted a pollen-supplementation experiment to test whether the plants in our snowmelt and frost treatments were pollen limited for reproduction. The four plants included species flowering in early spring to mid-summer. The phenology of all four species was significantly advanced, and the bloom duration was longer in the plots from which we removed snow, but with species-specific responses to snow removal and frost exposure in terms of frost damage, flower production, pollinator visitation and reproduction. The two early blooming species showed significant signs of frost damage in both early snowmelt and frost treatments, which negatively impacted reproduction for one of the species. Further, we recorded fewer pollinators during flowering for the earliest-blooming species in the snow removal plots. We also found lower fruit and seed set for the early blooming species in the snow removal treatment, which could be attributed to the plants growing under unfavourable abiotic conditions. However, the later-blooming species escaped frost damage even in the plots where snow was removed, and experienced increased pollinator visitation and reproduction. Synthesis. This study provides insight into how plant communities could become altered due to changes in abiotic conditions, and some of the mechanisms involved. While early blooming species may be at a disadvantage under climate change, species that bloom later in the season may benefit from early snowmelt, suggesting that climate change has the potential to reshape flowering communities.

Propagule risk in a marine foundation species: Seascape effects on Zostera marina seed predation	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						buffer analysis; escape hypothesis; granivore; landscape ecology; propagule; seagrass; seed predation; Zostera marina	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SEAGRASS LANDSCAPES; PATCH SIZE; POSIDONIA-AUSTRALIS; CHESAPEAKE BAY; ARTIFICIAL SEAGRASS; NORTH-CAROLINA; CRAB SURVIVAL; LARGE-SCALE; EELGRASS	Both biotic and abiotic factors can affect whether seagrass meadows establish as large, continuous features or as a mosaic of smaller patches, and these processes act across multiple spatial scales. Of these processes, sexual recruitment is considered vital for the recovery and resilience of seagrass meadows. Because numerous estuarine fauna can impact sexual recruitment by consuming seeds, it is important to understand variation in seed consumption throughout the seascape. We sought to determine how cross-scale processes affected seed consumption of Zostera marina, a widely distributed seagrass species. We deployed seed predation units (SPU) within patches ranging in size from 0.28 to 28.48 m(2), and on unvegetated, sandy bottom. Seed consumption was analysed across patch sizes, at patch centres and edges and within the context of total seagrass cover within buffer zones surrounding SPU locations. Using structural equation modelling, we found that measured seascape parameters explained 34% of the observed variation in seed consumption. Specifically, we found that seagrass presence had the strongest effect on seed predation followed by a negative effect of patch size on seed consumption. Although there was no direct effect of percent seagrass cover (within a 4-m buffer of the SPU) on seed predation, percent seagrass cover had a negative indirect effect through its positive correlation with patch size. However, we found that once variation due to patch size and areal cover were accounted for, seeds placed at patch interiors actually experienced greater consumption rates. We did not find similar relationships with our potential seed consumers, although our snapshot sampling likely obscured transient effects. We argue that seagrass recruitment could be affected by seed predation, which is influenced by multiple processes, including predator dispersal, behaviour and aggregation. Since seed-based restoration is becoming more common, and the role of sexual recruitment in meadow maintenance appears to be increasingly important for seagrass resilience, our results demonstrate that for current management strategies to be successful, there is a need to better understand seed predation in seagrass-dominated seascapes. Synthesis. Factors that influence propagule supply and recruitment success of seagrass operate and interact across multiple spatial scales, which can have implications for management.

We have explored the exceptionally high photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) of Proteaceae in this region, triggering the question what the PPUE of co-occurring species in other families might be along the Jurien Bay chronosequence. We explored how traits associated with PPUE, photosynthetic nitrogen (N)-use efficiency (PNUE) and leaf respiration might converge along the chronosequence, and whether Proteaceae and non-Proteaceae species differ in leaf traits associated with nutrient use. Seven to 10 species were sampled at three sites differing in nutrient availability (ranging from N- to P-limited). Measurements of leaf light-saturated photosynthesis and dark respiration were integrated with measurements of total N and P concentration in both mature and senesced leaves, and leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Contrary to what is known for other chronosequences, rates of photosynthesis and respiration did not decrease with increasing soil age and LMA along the Jurien Bay chronosequence. However, they increased when expressed per unit leaf P. Both N and P were used much more efficiently for photosynthesis on nutrient-poor sites, in both Proteaceae and non-Proteaceae species. Proteaceae had the fastest rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf P, followed by species that preferentially allocate P to mesophyll cells, rather than epidermal cells. Synthesis. Our results show that with declining soil P availability, photosynthetic P-use efficiency of all investigated species from different families increased. Plants growing on the oldest, most nutrient-impoverished soils exhibited similar rates of CO2 exchange as plants growing on more nutrient-rich younger soils, and extraordinarily high photosynthetic P-use efficiency. This indicates convergence in leaf traits related to photosynthetic nutrient use on severely P-impoverished sites.

Recent peat and carbon accumulation following the Little Ice Age in northwestern Quebec, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						permafrost peatlands; climate warming; vegetation dynamics; carbon accumulation; plant macrofossil analysis	SUB-ARCTIC PEATLANDS; HUDSON-BAY LOWLANDS; HOLOCENE CARBON; PERMAFROST PEATLAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION SUCCESSION; OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS; BOREAL; DYNAMICS; RADIOCARBON	Peatland ecosystems are important carbon sinks, but also release carbon back to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane. Peatlands therefore play an essential role in the global carbon cycle. However, the response of high-latitude peatlands to ongoing climate change is still not fully understood. In this study, we used plant macrofossils and peat property analyses as proxies to document changes in vegetation and peat and carbon accumulation after the Little Ice Age. Results from 12 peat monoliths collected in high-boreal and low-subarctic regions in northwestern Quebec, Canada, suggest high carbon accumulation rates for the recent past (post AD 1970s). Successional changes in plant assemblages were asynchronous within the cores in the southernmost region, but more consistent in the northern region. Average apparent recent carbon accumulation rates varied between 50.7 and 149.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1) with the northernmost study region showing higher values. The variation in vegetation records and peat properties found within samples taken from the same sites and amongst cores taken from different regions highlights the need to investigate multiple records from each peatland, but also from different peatlands within one region.

Bacteriophage inactivation as a function of ferrous iron oxidation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ZERO-VALENT IRON; HYDROXYL RADICALS; AS(III) OXIDATION; WATER TREATMENT; VIRUS REMOVAL; FE(II); PH; ELECTROCOAGULATION; GENERATION; MS2	Iron-based disinfection has been promoted as a potential low-cost, low-byproduct means of virus mitigation. This research is the first to establish that virus inactivation due to ferrous iron is impacted both by the extent of iron oxidation (from ferrous to ferric iron) and the rate of iron oxidation. Log inactivation of bacteriophages increased linearly with ferrous iron concentration at low doses (<3 mg L-1 Fe), but higher doses limited disinfection, likely due to floc formation. The rate of iron oxidation was controlled by independently varying pH and dissolved oxygen concentration. Bacteriophage inactivation increased with the inverse of ferrous oxidation rate, suggesting that slower iron oxidation rates allow better contact between viruses and reactive ferrous iron. Ferrous iron showed potential for disinfection in conditions of low pH and dissolved oxygen, though these conditions preclude effective iron coagulation/flocculation.

The harsh environment provides a short breeding season where the sunlit summer nights provide little reprieve from visibility to predators and increased risk. In this paper, we tested the activity and food choice patterns of bank voles Myodes glareolus in early spring season, categorized by 18h of daylight and 6h of dusk in every day cycle. We found that territorial females showed a less predictable pattern of activity than males that were most active during the hours of dusk. The voles also showed preference to forage on high carbohydrate foods at sunset, while switching over to a more protein and fat-based diet towards sunrise. This shift is suggestive of a diet that is a direct adaptation to day-long fasts. Our results suggest a sensitive mechanism between food choice and predator avoidance in a system where light summer nights increase the predation risk considerably.Significance statementBank voles, Myodes glareolus, are considered a model organism in ecological studies and have been used for studies of population cycles, predator-prey interactions and studies of territoriality with over a century of published records. In this study, we challenge two major preconceptions about these animals using behavioral bio-assays in a controlled environment. (1) We challenge the diurnal activity patterns of these rodents currently accepted to have a bi-modal distribution in summer months and show a unimodular activity pattern. And (2) we show that these animals are not opportunistic foragers but vary their diet to compensate for the stress of an extended daytime fast further supporting a nocturnal pattern of activity even in extreme sunlit nights where night lasts under an hour.

Fire and life history affect the distribution of plant species in a biodiversity hotspot	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						fire return interval; fynbos; life history; Maxent; resprouter; seeder; species distribution model	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; FYNBOS; TRAITS; GERMINATION; SELECTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; PERSISTENCE; RESILIENCE	Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) provide valuable insights into species-environment relationships and potential climate change impacts on diversity. Most SDMs do not account for the role of natural disturbance regimes such as fire in determining current and future species distributions, or how species traits mediate their response to these stressors. Here, we investigate the importance of fire in determining the distributions of species in fire-prone fynbos vegetation, and how this varies in relation to different life history traits (growth form and fire-response strategy). Location Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. Methods We modelled the distribution of 104 plant species with different life history traits, using Maxent. The model included five climatic variables, one edaphic and one fire variable. Post hoc analyses of model output and permutation procedures were conducted to assess variable importance across different life history traits. We accounted for phylogenetic autocorrelation using sister species comparisons. Results Permutation importance scores identified fire return interval as a major determinant of fynbos species' distributions. Linear mixed effect analyses revealed that seeder species were significantly more sensitive to fire than resprouters. Coefficients from the (linear) response curves of the different predictors indicated that the occurrence of species across all life histories was negatively associated with longer fire return intervals. Main conclusions Fire and life history traits governing species' response to fire are key factors determining species distributions in our study system. SDMs that ignore the role of fire in driving species distributions, and how this varies across different life history types, compromise our ability to understand species-environment relationships in fire-prone ecosystems. There is great need for better spatial data describing historical, current and future fire regimes and for models that can incorporate different responses based on species life histories, to improve vulnerability assessments for fire-prone ecosystems.

Location The southern portion of the NACP, a global biodiversity hotspot. This region is characterized by fire-dependent pine savanna fragments that are isolated within a matrix of agriculture, urban development, non-pyrogenic plant communities and plantation forestry. Methods We used nested quadrats to sample plant species on 30 fire-maintained savanna preserves in Florida and Georgia, USA. We analysed between-site Sorenson dissimilarity, a measure of beta diversity, using NMDS and PerMANOVA. We measured nestedness using NODF, and we used Betapart to partition Sorenson dissimilarity into nestedness and turnover components. We used linear and generalized linear mixed models to explore drivers of functional group richness and composition, including fire regime (return interval, number of fires, time since fire and seasonality), vegetation structure (herbaceous cover, woody cover and tree density) and spatial factors (surrounding landscape and geographic distance). Results We found turnover-dominated beta-diversity patterns in all functional groups. Turnover was explained partly by spatial and environmental gradients, but roughly half of the turnover between sites was unexplained. Species richness was higher on sites where fire and fire surrogates had been used longer and more consistently, and these effects were partly independent of current vegetation structure. Fire regimes containing more growing season fire and more diversity of burn seasons promoted higher species richness. Relationships between small-scale and large-scale species richness varied by soil type and functional group. Main conclusions Fire-maintained savannas in the southeastern NACP vary greatly in their plant functional group richness, but high beta diversity resulting primarily from species turnover suggests that even species-poor sites can harbour less-common members of the regional plant metacommunity. Prescribed fire regimes that include growing season fire as well as a diversity of burn seasons may best promote species and functional group richness.

Model outputs are often under-evaluated for explanatory and predictive capacity. Our aim was to evaluate the capacity of existing data for seven small mammal species to provide useful inferences for management planning. Location Bathurst and Melville (collectively the Tiwi) Islands, Northern Territory, Australia. Methods We developed species distribution models (SDMs) with generalized linear models (GLMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs) using survey data (351 sites) of small mammals, with two sets of environmental predictors: (a) field-study measurements and (b) available remotely sensed rasters. Predictive capacity of models was evaluated using percentage of deviance explained (%DE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We used Marxan to evaluate the influence of different model and data types as input for identifying spatial priorities. Results Field-informed SDMs performed well across both modelling methods, with relatively high test AUC values (mean = 0.82, range = 0.64-0.97) and test %DE (mean = 22.5%, range = 3.5%-65.8%). Remotely sensed models performed relatively poorly, with lower test AUC values (mean = 0.7, range = 0.56-0.86) and lower test %DE (mean = 8.9%, range = 0.03%-24.9%). A notable exception was remotely sensed models for Melomys burtoni (AUC = 0.85 & 0.86, %DE = 23.3% & 24.9%, Bathurst and Melville respectively). Marxan site irreplaceability rankings demonstrated low to marginal agreement using field-informed and remotely sensed inputs (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.3), and similarly, using GLM and BRT model inputs (0.29). Main conclusions The occurrence of small mammals on the Tiwi Islands can be reasonably explained with field-informed variables, but not with remotely sensed alternatives. Different models lead to different conservation priorities. Our work emphasizes the importance of thoroughly testing SDMs prior to decision-making.

Phylogeographic structure and evolutionary significant units (ESU) have been proposed as pragmatic proxies to incorporate intraspecific differentiation in SDMs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of using these proxies in SDMs has been poorly investigated. We analysed how the projections of current and future climatically suitable areas can be affected when using ESU-based or lineage-based models compared to a species-level model. Location West-Palaearctic region. Methods As examples, we used three bumblebee species (133,787 observations). We assessed potential climatic niche differentiation between species level, lineages and ESUs, by determining the niche position and niche breadth for each classification level by outlying mean index analyses. Subsequently, we developed SDMs for each species and classification level separately using boosted regression trees prior to a comparison of their performances. Finally, we used the alternative models to project the extent of climatically suitable areas in 2070. Results We found that in spite of highly similar overall model accuracy, integrating intraspecific variability significantly increases model sensitivity (i.e., better predicting presences) while decreased model specificity (i.e., over-predicting the range). Consequently, both predictions of current and projections of future suitable conditions differed among the three approaches. Main conclusions We showed that although integrating lineage or ESU information did not improve the accuracy of conventional species-level SDMs, it led to considerably different conclusions. As SDM-based climatic risk assessments are increasingly used to help and improve conservation plans, divergences and limitations of each modelling approach should be taken into account for developing efficient biodiversity management strategies. Lineage and ESU-based SDMs offer the advantage to draw attention to species in which allopatric populations could display physiologically different responses to climate change when they lead to different results than species-based models.

Assembly processes of waterbird communities across subsidence wetlands in China: A functional and phylogenetic approach	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						assembly process; environmental filtering; functional diversity; phylogenetic diversity; subsidence wetland; waterbird assemblage	ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; REDUNDANCY; BIODIVERSITY; SPACE; BIRDS; MAINTENANCE; ECOLOGY; SIGNAL	Aim Although assembly processes have been studied in a wide range of taxa, determining assembly rules remains controversial, particularly in assemblages consisted of species with strong dispersal capacities. Moreover, few studies focused on communities in recently human-created habitats. We tested two prevailing but opposing hypotheses, environmental filtering and limiting similarity, in waterbird communities across subsidence wetlands created by underground coal mining in China, with an aim to better understand assembly processes in communities composed of highly mobile species in human-dominated landscape. Location The North China Plain. Methods We quantified taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of the waterbird assemblages in different seasons and compared the mean pairwise distances (MPD) and the mean nearest taxon distances (MNTD) with null models to examine whether co-occurring species were clustered or overdispersed on the functional dendrogram or phylogenetic tree. Independent contributions of multi-scale habitat variables therein were determined using a hierarchical partitioning method. Results We showed asynchronous patterns of seasonal dynamics among the multiple diversity metrics, with highest species diversity during autumn migration. Generally, the co-occurring species were functionally and phylogenetically clustered. Habitat variables had stronger effects on the functional structure than on the phylogenetic structure of the communities. The degree of functional clustering increased in older and larger wetlands, while the assemblages shifted from functional clustering to overdispersion with increasing habitat diversity, landscape connectivity and human disturbance. Main conclusions The waterbird assemblages were mainly structured by environmental filtering, and the assembly processes were significantly affected by habitat variables, with stronger effects on functional diversity.

However, recent research suggests that arboreal communities of several indicator groups (ants, amphibians, beetles and butterflies) are more susceptible to human disturbance than their terrestrial counterparts, but what about wildlife at higher trophic levels? We assess responses to disturbance, from forest floor to canopy, of a key conservation flagship group: medium to large rainforest mammals. Location The Manu Biosphere Reserve, southeast Peru. Methods We deploy both arboreal and terrestrial camera traps to directly compare the response of arboreal and terrestrial mammal communities to rainforest degradation and disturbance. Results We show that the arboreal mammal community is more susceptible to habitat disturbance than the terrestrial community. Furthermore, the largest-bodied arboreal species, which are major seed dispersers, showed the greatest negative response to forest disturbance. The strongest predictors of occupancy probability for arboreal communities were focal tree connectivity and canopy cover, whereas surrounding forest loss and canopy height were there strongest predictors of terrestrial community occupancy, although these also had effects similar in size and magnitude on the arboreal community. Main conclusions Conservation conclusions drawn from camera-based studies focused on the terrestrial realm likely underestimate the impact of rainforest degradation to arboreal communities and on arboreal rainforest biodiversity in general. We highlight the importance of implementing arboreal research methods, capable of investigating conservation implications of anthropogenic disturbance across all vertical strata, for accurate conservation assessments and improving rainforest management and restoration strategies.

Shifting habitats expose fishing communities to risk under climate change	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							FISHERIES; OCEAN; ADAPTATION; IMPACTS; DIVERSIFICATION; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; RESPONSES; GULF; FACE	Climate change is expected to have a profound impact on the distribution, abundance and diversity of marine species globally(1,2). These ecological impacts of climate change will affect human communities dependent on fisheries for livelihoods and well-being(3). While methods for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change are rapidly developing(4) and socio-ecological vulnerability assessments for fisheries are becoming available(5), there has been less work devoted to understanding how impacts differ across fishing communities. We developed a linked socio-ecological approach to assess the exposure of fishing communities to risk from climate change, and present a case study of New England and Mid-Atlantic (USA) fishing communities. We found that the northern part of the study region was projected to gain suitable habitat and the southern part projected to lose suitable habitat for many species, but the exposure of fishing communities to risk was strongly dependent on both their spatial use of the ocean and their portfolio of species caught. A majority of fishing communities were projected to face declining future fishing opportunities unless they adapt, either through catching new species or fishing in new locations. By integrating climatic, ecological and socio-economic data at a scale relevant to fishing communities, this analysis identifies where strategies for adapting to the ecological impacts of climate change will be most needed.

Identifying and tracking shifts in spatial regimes is a new approach with potential to enhance understanding of ecological responses to global change. Here, we show strong directional non-stationarity of spatial regimes identified by avian community body mass data. We do this by tracking 46 years of avian spatial regime movement in the North American Great Plains. The northernmost spatial regime boundary moved >590 km northward, and the southernmost boundary moved >260 km northward. Tracking spatial regimes affords decadal planning horizons and moves beyond the predominately temporal early warnings of the past by providing spatiotemporally explicit detection of regime shifts in systems without fixed boundaries.

Fifteen species (5 genera) were identified, of which Euphausia diomedeae was the most abundant during El Nino and Euphausia distinguenda was the most abundant during La Nina and the Neutral condition. In addition, considering all euphausiid species found in this study; under La Nina and Neutral conditions, juveniles were the most abundant phase; while during El Nino, furcilia larvae were the most abundant. During the Neutral condition, the total abundance of euphausiids was significantly higher than during El Nino and La Nina, suggesting that the environmental changes caused by these anomalous conditions would affect abundance due to possible movements of the species towards more favourable conditions. Finally, during El Nino, the euphausiid assemblage was significantly different from the other two conditions, suggesting that the increase in temperature produced by this condition affect the structure and composition of euphausiids assemblage in the Colombian Pacific.

Based on seines in eelgrass (Zostera marina), unvegetated habitat, and edges in Willapa Bay, Washington, USA, nekton abundances varied across habitats and on both diel and seasonal time scales, yet only a few time-by-habitat interactions were observed, in which habitat distinctions were most pronounced at certain times. One explanation is that four of the six most abundant species disproportionately occupied unvegetated habitat or were habitat generalists, but our expectations were based on eelgrass-associated taxa. Multivariate community structure responded separately to season, habitat, and diet period, in order of importance. Total abundance showed a significant season-by-habitat interaction. A summer peak in vegetated habitats was largely driven by shiner perch and sticklebacks, two eelgrass-associated fishes, while unvegetated habitat showed year-round uniform abundances due to taxa like English sole and sand shrimp with winter and spring peaks, and no strong habitat associations or association with unvegetated habitat, respectively. In a single diel-by-habitat interaction, shiner perch were eelgrass-associated during the day but not at night. No evidence emerged of differences in body size across habitats for any species measured, but many taxa grew seasonally, likely as cohorts migrating out of the estuary. Seasonality was thus the strongest signal governing patterns of community structure, abundance, and body size across time and space, while habitat structure and diel period were less important. Our results are largely consistent with the other studies showing the primacy of seasonality in structuring estuarine nekton communities, but also show that this pattern is highly dependent on the seasonal recruitment patterns and habitat associations of abundant nekton.

Acute and chronic response to a change in salinity of the euryhaline polychaete Pygospio elegans (Claparede)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Body volume; Water content; RNA expression; Tolerance range; MS-AFLP	CRAB HEMIGRAPSUS-CRENULATUS; VOLUME REGULATION; POECILOGONOUS POLYCHAETE; NEREIS-DIVERSICOLOR; DEVELOPMENTAL MODE; DNA METHYLATION; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; POPULATION; STRESS; EXPRESSION	Estuaries are thought to be very harsh environments because their physico-chemical parameters, such as salinity, temperature and oxygen, can fluctuate substantially. The distribution of species living in an estuary is largely determined by how well they can cope with such fluctuations. The spionid polychaete Pygospio elegans is common in boreal estuarine habitats that show strong salinity fluctuations, living in habitats ranging from fully marine salinities to brackish environments with salinities as low as 5. In this study we investigated the abilities of P. elegans to cope with an acute as well as a long-term change in salinity. Specimens originating from a salinity of about 15 were exposed to salinity 15 as control and 5 and 30 as low and high salinity treatments. In acute exposure experiments, we measured body volume and tissue water content as well as gene expression of seven genes related to volume- and osmoregulation within 4 h of exposure. In a long-term experiment, we monitored survival, growth and reproduction as well as potential changes in DNA methylation within 6 weeks after a gradual salinity change. In response to abrupt exposure to a hyposmotic medium (salinity 5) we observed increased body volume that could not be fully restored, increased mortality, and no clear change in gene expression. Hence, P. elegans might be a weak cell-volume regulator that cannot cope well with sudden drops in salinity. In contrast, a gradual, long-term change in salinity seemed to be less stressful, although worms at salinity 5 showed slightly increased mortality and reduced or delayed maturity. Overall, there were fewer detrimental effects of exposure to a higher salinity. While the tested salinities fall within the tolerance range of P. elegans from this population, decrease in salinity seems to be a stronger stress.

Mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) are an economically-important fishery species in southern Australia often released from deep-water capture suffering from barotrauma. Hyperbaric chambers were therefore used to simulate various catch and release (C&R) scenarios on A. japonicus which allowed the influences of capture depth, surface duration and repressurization on survival and behaviour to be examined in a controlled environment combined with long-term monitoring post-simulation. In Experiment 1, simulated C&R from an acclimation pressure equivalent to 10, 30 or 50 m depth (n = 24 per depth) with a 2 min surface interval resulted in 8% mortality from 10 m increasing to 46 and 50% mortality from 30 and 50 m respectively; mortality delayed by an average of 64 d (range 5-219 d). A second C&R simulation depressurized A. japonicus individuals from either 10 or 30 m - followed by either repressurization after 10 min (Group R), or no repressurization (Group S) (n = 8 for each group). There was 0% mortality from 10 m for both groups, but from 30 m mortality was 100% for Group S and 88% for Group R. All Group S mortality and 38% of Group R mortality was immediate (< 10 min), the remaining 50% of Group R mortality delayed by an average of 21 d. Barotrauma symptoms also increased in severity with increasing depth and surface interval. Immediate mortality was consistent with the formation of gas embolisms in tissues, whereas delayed mortality was likely caused by declining physical condition resulting from loss of buoyancy control caused by gas escape via swim bladder perforation and body wall rupture. Results from these experiments show the potential for delayed mortality in barotrauma-affected A. japonicus to be considerable even when successfully repressurized, casting substantial doubt over the suitability of A. japonicus as a deep-water C&R target species.

A comparison of diet estimates of captive beluga whales using fatty acid mixing models with their true diets	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Beluga whales; Fatty acid signatures; Calibration coefficients; Mixing models; Diet estimation	SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; CALIBRATION COEFFICIENTS; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; HARBOR SEALS; BEAUFORT SEA; BLUBBER; PREY; VARIABILITY; REFLECT; ECOLOGY	Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) are sentinel species for Arctic environmental change; however, whether belugas are resilient to anticipated changes in prey dynamics remains uncertain, partly due to a lack of dietary information. Mixing models are promising tools to evaluate the diets of marine mammals, using dietary tracers such as fatty acid signatures. Additionally, captive feeding trials are useful to test the effectiveness of these tools for application to wild populations. In our study, we compared the ability of two models, quantitative fatty acid signature analysis in R (QFASAR) and Fatty Acid Source Tracking Algorithm in R (FASTAR) to reconstruct the diets of captive beluga whales that had been fed a long-term diet consisting mostly of Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi), and in smaller proportions, capelin (Mallotus villosus) and squid (Doryteuthis opalescens). To account for fatty acid metabolism, we compared a suite of calibration coefficients derived from captive feeding trials of American mink (Mustela vison), harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), harbour seal (Phoca vitulina richards, and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) fed monotypic diets. For both methods, diets estimated using calibration coefficients derived from feeding trials of mink fed herring and/or seal oil were able to correctly identify herring as the dominant prey source of belugas. In addition, there was higher precision among diet estimates using these calibration coefficients in comparison to those generated using calibration coefficients derived from feeding trials of pinnipeds or mink fed poultry. QFASAR more accurately approximated the diet proportions of the whales than FASTAR, possibly because of the greater robustness to errors in the calibration coefficients. Based on QFASAR, diet estimates best reflect the whales' true dietary proportions consumed approximately two weeks to one month prior to sampling, similar to timeframes seen in previous studies of harbour seals. We recommend caution when using these models with prey that have high within-species variability in fatty acid signatures or small sample sizes, as well as prey with similar fatty acid signatures. The application of mixing models is promising to identify the prey of wild beluga whales and other marine mammals.

Integrating Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) conservation into development and restoration planning in Sabah (Borneo)	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Land use planning; Landscape connectivity; Population dynamics; Cumulative resistant kernels; Least-cost paths; Mortality risk	POPULATION CONNECTIVITY; LANDSCAPE GENETICS; MARTES-AMERICANA; PROTECTED AREAS; LAND-USE; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; INFERENCE	Changes in land use/cover are the main drivers of global biodiversity loss, and thus tools to evaluate effects of landscape change on biodiversity are crucial. In this study we integrated several methods from landscape ecology and landscape genetics into a GIS-based analytical framework, and evaluated the impacts of development and forest restoration scenarios on landscape connectivity, population dynamics and genetic diversity of Sunda clouded leopard in the Malaysian state of Sabah. We also investigated the separate and interactive effects of changing mortality risk and connectivity. Our study suggested that the current clouded leopard population size is larger (+26%) than the current carrying capacity of the landscape due to time lag effects and extinction debt. Additionally, we predicted that proposed developments in Sabah may decrease landscape connectivity by 23% and, when including the increased mortality risk associated with these developments, result in a 40-63% decrease in population size and substantial reduction in genetic diversity. These negative impacts could be mitigated only to a very limited degree through extensive and targeted forest restoration. Our results suggest that realignment of roads and railways based on resistance to movement, without including mortality risk, might be misleading and may in some cases lead to decrease in population size. We therefore recommend that efforts to optimally plan road and railway locations base the optimization on effects of development on population size, density and distribution rather than solely on population connectivity.

Information sources used by practitioners	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Evidence-based conservation; Expert knowledge; Implementation articles; Knowledge transfer; Outreach; Scientific articles; Survey	ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT; SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE; MEDICINE; SUPPORT; FLOW; NEED	Professionals working in practical conservation management and scientists often complain about an information gap between science and practice. Which kinds of information sources are important to professionals and which do they use in their every-day work? Answering these questions and knowing more about the information sources used by conservation professionals would promote effective knowledge transfer from science to practice. We conducted a survey to identify the information sources used by Swiss professionals in nature conservation, including the forest sector. Experience-based information sources (e.g. personal experience, direct exchange with colleagues and experts) are more important for professionals in nature conservation than evidence-based sources (e.g. various print products such as guidelines, specialized journals in national languages, text books targeted to professionals). They were also more often used. Articles from international scientific journals are hardly ever consulted by conservation professionals. It is thus important that scientists engage as experts and take time for direct personal contact and exchange with conservation professionals (e.g. by offering field trips). Given that professionals have little time in their daily business for searching and implementing new scientific knowledge and results, short, audience-targeted and synthetizing publications in national languages as well as specialized websites should be provided by researchers. These measures are key to reduce the gap between science and practice in nature conservation. Article impact statement Personal engagement and personal contact between scientists and conservation professionals are necessary to reduce the science-practice gap.

Trade in wildlife products is driven by consumer demand; however, consumer's motivations are often poorly understood. In this study, we use mixed social science approaches to understand the motivations driving consumers of bear products for medicine in Vietnam, and of traditional medicine practitioners who may be influencing consumers. In addition, we provide current information about the ways bear products are used in the two largest cities of Vietnam: Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. We found that bear products are still used widely in Vietnam, despite their use being prohibited since 2006. We directly estimated use at 45% of the sample of consumers for Hanoi, and 18% for consumers in Ho Chi Minh City. However, bear products are used differently between the two cities, with Hanoians more likely to take bear medicine products to treat an ailment, versus Ho Chi Minh City, where it is taken as a daily tonic. We also found that some traditional medicine practitioners in Vietnam are continuing to prescribe bear products, despite medicinal prescription of bear bile being made illegal, and availability of traditional medicine herbal alternatives. Generally, use of bear products appears to still be widely acceptable in the country, indicating a need for changing the social norms of bear product consumption. The insights gathered here will be beneficial to conservation managers working in Vietnam and throughout the Southeast Asia region, and will be particularly informative for developing and implementing demand reduction campaigns.

We sampled the bee fauna at 27 randomly selected sites along a 140-km (89-mile) segment of a transmission line that extends from Connecticut to New Hampshire. Each site contained two plots, one within the powerline corridor and another in a closely adjacent forest. Data were collected over a 12-week study period (late May to early August) with corridor plots yielding more than twice as many bee species and more than ten times the number of individuals than the forest plots. The aggregate richness for the 54 plots (= 205 species) represents nearly half the bee fauna of New England with species estimation curves suggesting that many additional species were resident but went unsampled. Two globally rare species, Epeoloides pilosulus and Macropis ciliata, were documented from the powerline plots. The time-extended (five-year) vegetation management cycles currently used by many utility companies in New England result in a dynamic array of vegetation composition and structure that supports a multitude of bees as well as other insects, reptiles and amphibians, shrubland birds, small mammals, and other early successional taxa.

Human population growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to drive a vast expansion in agricultural land by 2050, largely at the expense of pastoral land and savanna. The greatest expanse of suitable land yet to be converted to agriculture lies in East and Central Africa, including South Sudan, DRC and Tanzania. To gauge the effects of land conversion on raptor populations in this region we used road survey data from neighbouring Uganda, from which we determined linear encounter rates (birds seen 100 km(-1); n = 33 species), and species richness (from 53 species). Encounter rates were much lower in pastoral land than in protected savanna (median difference: -41%; 23 species), and lower still in agricultural land ( - 90%; 24 species). These disparities were influenced by diet and body mass. For large eagles and vultures, encounter rates in agricultural land were 97% lower than in protected savanna (median of 12 species), whereas for smaller raptors they were 30% lower (12 species). Large, apex consumers were thus more vulnerable to farmland expansion, and this was reflected in the mean body mass of species encountered in savanna (1740 g), pastoral (995 g) and agricultural land (856g). Body mass differences remained significant when vultures were excluded. Since threat status is linked to body mass, encounter rates for globally threatened and near-threatened species likewise showed a more pronounced deficit in farmland than those of least concern. Accordingly, pastoral and agricultural transects were less species-rich (10.6 and 6.7 raptor species 100 km(-1), respectively) than savanna transects (13.2 species). Our findings suggest that the expansion of agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa will reduce raptor populations in pastoral land and savanna by c. 50% and 90%, respectively. We propose that conservation efforts focus on identifying the causes of raptor population deficits in farmland, and on safeguarding tracts of unprotected, intact savanna, together with existing protected areas.

Large carnivore conservation thus requires designing landscapes of coexistence, which should provide suitable habitats and dispersal opportunities in areas shared with humans. This study investigates the landscape of coexistence for the Iberian wolf, using movement data from 15 individuals to model how human-related risks constrain the spatial distribution of habitats and functional connectivity in highly modified landscapes. Wolves avoided potential sources of human disturbance, particularly settlements, roads, trails and windfarms. Avoidance was generally stronger for residents than dispersers, and in daytime than in twilight and night. There was strong elevational segregation, particularly at night, with higher and lower elevations selected by residents and dispersers, respectively. Conductance surfaces indicated that resident wolves were largely restricted to fragmented mountainous areas less used by people, while they faced strong resistance to movement in more densely populated lowlands. Higher tolerance to humans facilitated the movement of dispersers through the landscape, though they had the additional constraint of avoiding resident wolves. There were well-defined dispersal corridors potentially connecting most wolf packs. Our results reinforce the need to prevent new sources of human disturbance such roads and wind farms in remnant areas used by resident wolves, and to preserve continuous dispersal corridors through areas heavily used by humans. More generally, designing landscapes of coexistence should target at facilitating the spatial and temporal segregation of human structures and activities from large carnivore breeding and dispersal habitats.

Pelagic citizen science data reveal declines of seabirds off south-eastern Australia	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Seabirds; Climate change; Environmental drivers; Seasonality; Citizen science; Species archetype modelling; East Australian Current	CABBAGE-TREE-ISLAND; TOP PREDATORS; OCEANOGRAPHIC DRIVERS; MESOSCALE EDDIES; ALBATROSSES; LEUCOPTERA; PETREL; DISTRIBUTIONS; COMMUNITIES; ABUNDANCE	Many seabird communities are declining around the world, a trend frequently linked to climate change and human impacts on habitat and prey. Time series observations of seabirds away from breeding colonies are generally rare, which limits our understanding of long-term changes for conservation actions. We analysed a dedicated citizen science dataset of pelagic seabird abundance (86 species 30 used for modelling analysis from 385 trips) from two locations over 17 years (2000-2016) and a third for seven years, over the continental shelf and slope of south-eastern Australia. To estimate temporal trends and environmental drivers, we used generalised additive modelling and species archetype modelling for groups. Almost half (43%) of the most abundant seabird species declined in our study area over the 17 years. The declines may be associated with human-induced ecosystem change and represent poleward shifts in distribution out of our study area, changes in population abundance, or both. Winter-dominant groups, primarily species rarely frequenting warmer water, were often negatively associated with SSTanom, while summer-dominant groups, composed of species more tolerant of temperate and tropical environments, were generally positively associated with SSTanom. Widespread local declines in seabird populations are of increasing concern. Understanding the extent to which these observed declines represent real declines in abundance, or range shifts, should be a priority. Changing sea temperatures are probably contributing to both. These results from the coast of south-eastern Australia need to be placed in the context of the highly mobile study organisms and the vast spatial scale of the ocean. Long-term citizen science observations, from an array of locations around the world, promise to provide valuable insights into seabird ecology, playing a key part in seabird conservation.

However, potential expansions often meet with resistance because of scarce government resources and competing social priorities. Here, we proposed an expansion of the protected-area system for the western Amazon that increases biodiversity conservation at minimum costs. We started by evaluating biological data to establish conservation targets for enhancing protection of 2419 species of plants and vertebrates. We then built a map that shows the variation in costs of effectively managing lands as protected areas. We also adapted an opportunity cost layer for agriculture and livestock to approximate realistic foregone incomes when a particular extent of land is protected. These cost estimates were used in a decision-support tool to find the most inexpensive places to achieve the conservation targets. We found that this cost-optimized expansion would reduce annual costs by 22% in comparison to an expansion planned without cost data. Moreover, without collaboration with indigenous peoples and without cooperation among the western Amazon countries costs would be 39% and 49% higher, respectively. The cost of the proposed expansion, estimated at US$ 100 million annually, is only a fraction of the regional Gross Domestic Product (0.018%). Thus, this study may help governments and conservation agencies to improve financial planning of the region's reserve network by maximizing species protection at more affordable costs.

Here, we provide a systematic, continental-scale evaluation of the extent and quality of monitoring for threatened species, focussing on terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates in Australia. We found marked inadequacies: one in four threatened taxa are not monitored at all; for taxa that are monitored, monitoring quality, as assessed across nine metrics, was generally low. Higher quality monitoring was associated with policy recognition, in the form of species recovery plans, and for species having a more imperilled conservation status. Across taxonomic classes, the proportion of species monitored was highest for mammals and then birds, whereas monitoring quality was greatest for birds. Improving monitoring quality requires setting dear objectives, direct integration with management, incorporating explicit management triggers, long-term resourcing, and better communication and accessibility of monitoring information. While our results revealed that overall monitoring efforts are inadequate, the positive relationship between improved monitoring outcomes and national policy support highlights that, when resources are available, good monitoring outcomes can be achieved. Quality monitoring programs for threatened species, and biodiversity more generally, should be recognized as vital measures of a nation's progress, analogous and complementary to more widely-used economic and human health indicators.

Sediment associated with algal turfs inhibits the settlement of two endangered coral species	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Coral recruitment; Coral larvae; Turf algae; Sediment; Recovery	RECRUITMENT FAILURE; ACROPORA-PALMATA; PREFERENCES; SURVIVAL; ECOLOGY; DECLINE	Populations of Acropora palmata and Orbicella faveolata, two important reef-building corals, have declined precipitously across the Caribbean region since at least the 1970s. Recruitment failure may be limiting population recovery, possibly due to lack of suitable settlement habitat. Here, we examine the effects of algal turfs and algal turfs + sediment, two widely abundant substrate types across the Florida Keys, on the settlement of these two ecologically-important species. We show that sediment significantly impedes coral settlement, reducing settlement 10- and 13-fold for A. palmata and O. faveolata, respectively, compared to turf algae alone. This result is corroborated by our field survey data that showed a strong, negative relationship between the abundance of turf + sediment and the abundance of juvenile corals. Turf algae alone did not reduce coral settlement. Our results suggest that sediment-laden turf algae are detrimental to settling corals, but that turf algae alone may be relatively benign.

In this study, Symbiodiniaceae communities and the effective quantum yield (Phi(PSII)) of healthy and bleached massive corals from the SCS were compared. The results indicated that the Symbiodiniaceae communities and Opsn values showed coral bleaching-dependent variations. Specifically, the relative abundances of the rare putatively thermally tolerant Durusdiniwn sp. (D1) and the Symbiochlorum hainanensis increased significantly in the bleached corals. In addition, bleached Porites lutea was mainly associated with the putatively thermally tolerant Cladocopium sp. (C15 and C91) and exhibited the highest Phi(PSII) value compared with other bleached corals. These results highlight that the rare putatively thermally tolerant algae and coral species-specific algae may be important for understanding thermal bleaching of corals.

Discrepant hydrocarbons, including linear n-alkanes (n-C-11 to n-C-40) and isoprenoids (AHs), aliphatic ketones (AKs), hopanes and steranes were measured in all core samples, showing mean concentrations ranging from 209 to 5388 mu g g(-1) dw (Sigma(30)AH), 2-244 mu g g(-1).dw (Sigma(13)AK), 189-3713 ng g(-1) dw (Sigma(31)hoparte) and 42-3864 ng g(-1) dw (Sigma(15)sterane), respectively. All sediment cores were found to be petroleum polluted, with Sigma(30)AH > Sigma(31)hopane > Sigma(15)sterane > Sigma(13)AK, with higher levels recorded at 10-20 cm, mainly at industrial sites. Various diagnostic indices revealed that hydrocarbons derived mainly from anthropogenic inputs, with significant contribution of biogenic origin at sites less polluted. Moreover, total organic carbon (0.24-23.45 mg g(-1).dw), terrestrial and marine organic matter had an overwhelming effect on hydrocarbons deposition in sediment cores. Overall, findings provide relevant information for monitoring and preventing petroleum pollution in the sensitive ecosystems of the Persian Gulf.

Few empirical studies, however, have considered how networks of restored habitat patches affect metacommunity dynamics. Here, using a 10-year study on restored hedgerows and unrestored field margins within an intensive agricultural landscape, we integrate occupancy modelling with network theory to examine the interaction between local and landscape characteristics, habitat selection and dispersal in shaping pollinator metacommunity dynamics. We show that surrounding hedgerows and remnant habitat patches interact with the local floral diversity, bee diet breadth and bee body size to influence site occupancy, via colonisation and persistence dynamics. Florally diverse sites and generalist, small-bodied species are most important for maintaining metacommunity connectivity. By providing the first in-depth assessment of how a network of restored habitat influences long-term population dynamics, we confirm the conservation benefit of hedgerows for pollinator populations and demonstrate the importance of restoring and maintaining habitat networks within an inhospitable matrix.

However, cross-scale investigation of their combined effects by linking theory and experiments is lacking. We collected data from aquatic microbial ecosystems investigating the interactive effects of warming (constant and rising temperatures) and enrichment across levels of organisation and contrasted them with community models based on metabolic theory. We found high agreement between our observations and theoretical predictions: we observed in many cases the predicted antagonistic effects of high temperature and high enrichment across levels of organisation. Temporal stability of total biomass decreased with warming but did not differ across enrichment levels. Constant and rising temperature treatments with identical mean temperature did not show qualitative differences. Overall, we conclude that model and empirical results are in broad agreement due to robustness of the effects of temperature and enrichment, that the mitigating effects of temperature on effects of enrichment may be common, and that models based on metabolic theory provide qualitatively robust predictions of the combined ecological effects of enrichment and temperature.

However, how the spatial arrangement of crop fields and other habitats in landscapes impacts arthropods and their functions is poorly known. Synthesising data from 49 studies (1515 landscapes) across Europe, we examined effects of landscape composition (% habitats) and configuration (edge density) on arthropods in fields and their margins, pest control, pollination and yields. Configuration effects interacted with the proportions of crop and non-crop habitats, and species' dietary, dispersal and overwintering traits led to contrasting responses to landscape variables. Overall, however, in landscapes with high edge density, 70% of pollinator and 44% of natural enemy species reached highest abundances and pollination and pest control improved 1.7- and 1.4-fold respectively. Arable-dominated landscapes with high edge densities achieved high yields. This suggests that enhancing edge density in European agroecosystems can promote functional biodiversity and yield-enhancing ecosystem services.

Effects of plant functional group removal on structure and function of soil communities across contrasting ecosystems	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Biodiversity; decomposition; ecosystem functioning; metabarcoding; microbial ecology; nematodes; organic matter accumulation; plant-soil interactions	BIODIVERSITY LOSS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; ISLAND AREA; DIVERSITY; FOREST; FIXATION; NITROGEN; PRODUCTIVITY; VEGETATION; STABILITY	Loss of plant diversity has an impact on ecosystems worldwide, but we lack a mechanistic understanding of how this loss may influence below-ground biota and ecosystem functions across contrasting ecosystems in the long term. We used the longest running biodiversity manipulation experiment across contrasting ecosystems in existence to explore the below-ground consequences of 19 years of plant functional group removals for each of 30 contrasting forested lake islands in northern Sweden. We found that, against expectations, the effects of plant removals on the communities of key groups of soil organisms (bacteria, fungi and nematodes), and organic matter quality and soil ecosystem functioning (decomposition and microbial activity) were relatively similar among islands that varied greatly in productivity and soil fertility. This highlights that, in contrast to what has been shown for plant productivity, plant biodiversity loss effects on below-ground functions can be relatively insensitive to environmental context or variation among widely contrasting ecosystems.

Pathogens manipulate the preference of vectors, slowing disease spread in a multi-host system	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Barley; cereal yellow dwarf virus; behavioural ecology; disease ecology; host diversity; pathogen transmission; vector behaviour; vector manipulation hypothesis; vector-borne disease; vectored disease modelling	BARLEY-YELLOW-DWARF; MALARIA PARASITES; INSECT VECTORS; LIFE-HISTORY; INFECTION; POPULATION; ECOLOGY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; TRANSMISSION; BIODIVERSITY	The spread of vector-borne pathogens depends on a complex set of interactions among pathogen, vector, and host. In single-host systems, pathogens can induce changes in vector preferences for infected vs. healthy hosts. Yet it is unclear if pathogens also induce changes in vector preference among host species, and how changes in vector behaviour alter the ecological dynamics of disease spread. Here, we couple multi-host preference experiments with a novel model of vector preference general to both single and multi-host communities. We show that viruliferous aphids exhibit strong preferences for healthy and long-lived hosts. Coupling experimental results with modelling to account for preference leads to a strong decrease in overall pathogen spread through multi-host communities due to non-random sorting of viruliferous vectors between preferred and non-preferred host species. Our results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between vector behaviour and host diversity as a key mechanism in the spread of vectored-diseases.

Temperature shapes opposing latitudinal gradients of plant taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Americas; biome assembly; elevation; Jaccard dissimilarity; New World; UniFrac	SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOUNTAIN PASSES; PATTERNS; RANGE; EXTINCTION; LIKELIHOOD; SPECIATION; ORGANISMS; EVOLUTION	Latitudinal and elevational richness gradients have received much attention from ecologists but there is little consensus on underlying causes. One possible proximate cause is increased levels of species turnover, or beta diversity, in the tropics compared to temperate regions. Here, we leverage a large botanical dataset to map taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity, as mean turnover between neighboring 100 x 100 km cells, across the Americas and determine key climatic drivers. We find taxonomic and tip-weighted phylogenetic beta diversity is higher in the tropics, but that basal-weighted phylogenetic beta diversity is highest in temperate regions. Supporting Janzen's 'mountain passes' hypothesis, tropical mountainous regions had higher beta diversity than temperate regions for taxonomic and tip-weighted metrics. The strongest climatic predictors of turnover were average temperature and temperature seasonality. Taken together, these results suggest beta diversity is coupled to latitudinal richness gradients and that temperature is a major driver of plant community composition and change.

However, while this concept has been validated under natural conditions, our understanding of the long-term consequences of plant-soil interactions for above-belowground community assembly is restricted to mathematical and conceptual model projections. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that one-time additions of soil biota and plant seeds alter soil-borne nematode and plant community composition in semi-natural grassland for 20 years. Over time, aboveground and belowground community composition became increasingly correlated, suggesting an increasing connectedness of soil biota and plants. We conclude that the initial composition of not only plant communities, but also soil communities has a long-lasting impact on the trajectory of community assembly.	[Wubs, E. R.

Monitoring river water and sediments within a changing Ethiopian catchment to support sustainable development	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Ethiopia; Metals; Monitoring; River; Policy; Pollution	HEAVY-METAL POLLUTION; QUALITY GUIDELINES; EFFLUENT; IMPACTS; STREAM; CITY	In many sub-Saharan states, despite governments' awareness campaigns highlighting potential impacts of aquatic pollution, there is a very limited action to protect the riverine systems. Managing the quality of water and sediments needs knowledge of pollutants, agreed standards, and relevant policy framework supporting monitoring and regulation. This study reports metal concentrations in rivers in industrializing Ethiopia. The study also highlights policy and capacity gaps in monitoring of river and sediments. For two sampling periods in 2013 and 2014, chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) were monitored in water and sediments of the Leyole and Worka rivers in the Kombolcha city, Ethiopia. The sampling results were compared with international guidelines and evaluated against the Ethiopian water protection policies. Chromium was high in the Leyole river water (median 2660 g/L) and sediments (maximum 740 mg/kg), Cu concentrations in the river water was highest at the midstream part of the Leyole river (median 63 g/L), but maximum sediment content of 417 mg/kg was found further upstream. Zinc was the highest in the upstream part of the Leyole river water (median 521 g/L) and sediments (maximum 36,600 mg/kg). Pb concentrations were low in both rivers. For the sediments, relatively higher Pb concentrations (maximum 3640 mg/kg) were found in the upstream of the Leyole river. Except for Pb, the concentrations of all metals surpassed the guidelines for aquatic life, human, livestock, and irrigation water supplies. The median concentrations of all metals exceeded guidelines for sediment quality for aquatic organisms. In Ethiopia, poor technical and financial capabilities restrict monitoring of rivers and sediments and understanding on the effects of pollutants. The guidelines used to protect water quality is based on the World Health Organization standards for drinking water quality, but this is not designed for monitoring ecological health. Further development of water quality standards and locally relevant monitoring framework are needed. Development of monitoring protocols and institutional capacities are important to overcome the policy gaps and support the government's ambition in increasing industrialization and agricultural intensification. Failure to do so presents high risks for the public and the river ecosystem.

Visualizing the dynamics of soil aggregation as affected by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							ORGANIC-MATTER DYNAMICS; RARE-EARTH-OXIDES; MACROAGGREGATE TURNOVER; C SEQUESTRATION; MECHANISMS; CARBON; BIOTA; STABILIZATION; TEMPERATE; ROOTS	Stable soils provide valuable ecosystem services and mechanical soil stability is enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Soil aggregation, which is the major driver of mechanical soil stability, is often treated as a static phenomenon, even though aggregate turnover is continually ongoing. In fact, some breakdown of macroaggregates is necessary to allow new aggregate formation and inclusion of new organic matter into microaggregates. We determined how aggregate turnover times were affected by AMF by tracking movement of rare earth elements (REE), applied as their immobile oxides, between aggregate size classes, and using X-ray fluorescence microscopy to spatially localize REEs in a sample of aggregates. Here we show that AMF increased large macroaggregate formation and slowed down disintegration of large and small macroaggregates. Microaggregate turnover was increased in the presence of AMF. Internal aggregate organization suggested that although formation of microaggregates by accretion of soil to particulate organic matter is common, it is not the only mechanism in operation.

We combined mercury geochemistry, hgcA gene cloning, rRNA methods, and metagenomics to compare microbial communities associated with MeHg production in two sulfate-impacted lakes on Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range. The two lakes represent regional endmembers among sulfate-impacted sites in terms of their dissolved sulfide concentrations and MeHg production potential. rRNA amplicon sequencing indicates that sediments and anoxic bottom waters from both lakes contained diverse communities with multiple clades of sulfate reducing Deltaproteobacteria and Clostridia. In hgcA gene clone libraries, however, hgcA sequences were from taxa associated with methanogenesis and iron reduction in addition to sulfate reduction, and the most abundant clones were from unknown groups. We therefore applied metagenomics to identify the unknown populations in the lakes with the capability to methylate mercury, and reconstructed 27 genomic bins with hgcA. Some of the most abundant potential methylating populations were from phyla that are not typically associated with MeHg production, including a relative of the Aminicenantes (formerly candidate phylum OP8) and members of the Kiritimatiellaeota (PVC superphylum) and Spirochaetes that, together, were more than 50% of the potential methylators in some samples. These populations do not have genes for sulfate reduction, and likely degrade organic compounds by fermentation or other anaerobic processes. Our results indicate that previously unrecognized populations with hgcAB are abundant and may be important for MeHg production in some freshwater ecosystems.

Agricultural intensification reduces microbial network complexity and the abundance of keystone taxa in roots	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PLANT-SOIL FEEDBACKS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DIVERSITY; BACTERIAL; GROWTH; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; IMPACT; L.	Root-associated microbes play a key role in plant performance and productivity, making them important players in agroecosystems. So far, very few studies have assessed the impact of different farming systems on the root microbiota and it is still unclear whether agricultural intensification influences the structure and complexity of microbial communities. We investigated the impact of conventional, no-till, and organic farming on wheat root fungal communities using PacBio SMRT sequencing on samples collected from 60 farmlands in Switzerland. Organic farming harbored a much more complex fungal network with significantly higher connectivity than conventional and no-till farming systems. The abundance of keystone taxa was the highest under organic farming where agricultural intensification was the lowest. We also found a strong negative association (R-2 = 0.366; P < 0.0001) between agricultural intensification and root fungal network connectivity. The occurrence of keystone taxa was best explained by soil phosphorus levels, bulk density, pH, and mycorrhizal colonization. The majority of keystone taxa are known to form arbuscular mycorrhizal associations with plants and belong to the orders Glomerales, Paraglomerales, and Diversisporales. Supporting this, the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in roots and soils was also significantly higher under organic farming. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report mycorrhizal keystone taxa for agroecosystems, and we demonstrate that agricultural intensification reduces network complexity and the abundance of keystone taxa in the root microbiome.

Soil microbial responses to drought and exotic plants shift carbon metabolism	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							COASTAL SAGE SCRUB; COMMUNITY RESPONSE; SHRUB; PRECIPITATION; NITROGEN; BIODIVERSITY; BACTERIAL; RAINFALL; GRASS; DESICCATION	Significant gaps in our understanding of how global change drivers interact to affect the resistance and functioning of microbial communities hinders our ability to model ecosystem responses and feedbacks to co-occurring global stressors. Here, we investigated the effects of extreme drought and exotic plants, two of the most significant threats to Mediterranean-type ecosystems, on soil microbial community composition and carbon metabolic genes within a four-year field rainfall manipulation experiment. We combined measurements of bulk microbial and soil properties with high-throughput microbial community analyses to elucidate microbial responses and microbial-mediated alterations to carbon cycling. While microbial responses to experimental droughts were weak, scant rainfall periods resulted in decreased microbial biomass and activity, and relative abundances of bacterial groups such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria decreased concomitantly with increases in Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes abundance. Soils under exotic plants had increased temperatures, enhanced infiltration during rainfall events, and decreased water retention and labile carbon in comparison to soils under native plants. Higher peaks and more seasonally variable microbial activity were found under exotic plants and, like drought periods, the microbial community shifted towards osmotic stress life-strategies. Relationships found between microbial taxonomic groups and carbon metabolic genes support the interpretation that exotic plants change microbial carbon cycling by altering the soil microclimate and supplying easily decomposed high-quality litter. Soil microbial community responses to drought and exotic plants could potentially impact ecosystem C storage by producing a smaller, more vulnerable C pool of microbial biomass that is prone to increased pulses of heterotrophic respiration.

The discovery that plants can stimulate microbial degradation of PAHs has promoted research on rhizoremediation strategies. We combined DNA-SIP with metagenomics to assess the influence of plants on the identity and metabolic functions of active PAH-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil, using phenanthrene (PHE) as a model hydrocarbon. C-13-PHE dissipation was 2.5-fold lower in ryegrass-planted conditions than in bare soil. Metabarcoding of 16S rDNA revealed significantly enriched OTUs in C-13-SIP incubations compared to C-12-controls, namely 130 OTUs from bare soil and 73 OTUs from planted soil. Active PHE-degraders were taxonomically diverse (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), with Sphingomonas and Sphingobium dominating in bare and planted soil, respectively. Plant root exudates favored the development of PHE-degraders having specific functional traits at the genome level. Indeed, metagenomes of C-13-enriched DNA fractions contained more genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism in bare soil, whereas carbohydrate catabolism genes were more abundant in planted soil. Functional gene annotation allowed reconstruction of complete pathways with several routes for PHE catabolism. Sphingomonadales were the major taxa performing the first steps of PHE degradation in both conditions, suggesting their critical role to initiate in situ PAH remediation. Active PHE-degraders act in a consortium, whereby complete PHE mineralization is achieved through the combined activity of taxonomically diverse co-occurring bacteria performing successive metabolic steps. Our study reveals hitherto underestimated functional interactions for full microbial detoxification in contaminated soils.

A simple spatially explicit neutral model explains the range size distribution of reef fishes	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						dispersal; neutral model; range size; range size distribution; reef fishes; spatially explicit	APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS; PROTRACTED SPECIATION; DISPERSAL ABILITY; PATTERNS; TRAITS; COMMUNITIES; GRADIENTS; DYNAMICS	Aim The great variation in range sizes among species has fascinated ecologists for decades. Reef-associated fish species live in highly spatially structured habitats and adopt a wide range of dispersal strategies. We consequently expect species with greater dispersal ability to occupy larger ranges. However, empirical evidence for such a positive relationship between dispersal and range size remains scarce. Here, we unveil the role of dispersal on the range size distribution of reef-associated fishes using empirical data and a novel spatially explicit model. Location Tropical Eastern Pacific. Major taxa studied Reef-associated fishes. Time period Underlying records are from the 20th and 21st centuries. Methods We estimated range size distributions for all reef-associated fishes separated into six guilds, each with different dispersal abilities. We used a one-dimensional spatially explicit neutral model, which simulates the distribution of species along a linear and contiguous coastline, to explore the effect of dispersal, speciation and sampling on the distribution of range sizes. Our model incorporates biologically important long-distance dispersal events with a fat-tailed dispersal kernel and also adopts a more realistic gradual "protracted" speciation process than originally used in neutral theory. We fitted the model to the empirical data using an approximate Bayesian computation approach, with a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. Results Stochastic birth, death, speciation and dispersal events alone can accurately explain empirical range size distributions for six different guilds of tropical, reef-associated fishes. Variation in range size distributions among guilds are explained purely by differences in dispersal ability with the best dispersers being distributed over larger ranges. Main conclusions Neutral processes and guild-specific dispersal ability provide a general explanation for both within- and across-guild range size variation. Our results support the theoretically expected, but empirically much debated, hypothesis that high dispersal capacity promotes the establishment of large range size.

Why is fruit colour so variable? Phylogenetic analyses reveal relationships between fruit-colour evolution, biogeography and diversification	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biogeography; dispersal; diversification; Ericaceae; fruit; Gaultherieae; phylogeny	BIRD-DISPERSED PLANTS; SEED DISPERSAL; FLESHY FRUITS; R PACKAGE; RICHNESS; RATES; ADAPTATION; FRUGIVORES; DIVERSITY; RADIATION	Aim Are different fruit colours related to large-scale patterns of dispersal, distribution and diversification? Here, we investigate this question for the first time, using phylogenetic approaches in the tribe Gaultherieae (Ericaceae). We test relationships between fruit colour and (a) biogeographic dispersal, (b) elevational and latitudinal species distributions and (c) rates of diversification. Location Global. Time period Recent to 30 million years ago. Major taxa studied The plant tribe Gaultherieae in the family Ericaceae (blueberries and relatives). Methods We estimated a new time-calibrated phylogeny for Gaultherieae. Data on fruit colours and geographic distributions for each species were compiled from published sources and field observations. Using phylogenetic methods, we estimated major dispersal events across the tree and the most likely fruit colour associated with each dispersal event, and tested whether dispersal between major biogeographic regions was equally likely for different fruit colours, and whether dispersal distances were larger for certain colours. We then tested the relationships between fruit colours and geographic variables (latitude, elevation) and diversification rates. Results Large-scale dispersal events were significantly associated with red-fruited lineages, even though red-fruited species were relatively uncommon. Further, different fruit colours were associated with different elevations and latitudes (e.g. red at lower elevations, violet at lower latitudes, white at higher elevations). Violet colour was related to increased diversification rates, leading to more violet-fruited species globally. Main conclusions Overall, we show that different fruit colours can significantly impact the large-scale dispersal, distribution and diversification of plant clades. Furthermore, the interplay between biogeography and fruit-colour evolution seems to generate "taxon cycles" in fruit colour that may drive variation in fruit colour over macroevolutionary time-scales.

Diversity Indopacific Network	The molecular biogeography of the Indo-Pacific: Testing hypotheses with multispecies genetic patterns	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						analysis of molecular variance; biogeographic provinces; biogeographic realms; comparative phylogeography; discordance; dispersal; distance-based redundancy analysis	CORAL TRIANGLE; R PACKAGE; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; SEASCAPE GENETICS; TROPICAL PACIFIC; CONSERVATION; ECOREGIONS; COALESCENT	Aim To test hypothesized biogeographic partitions of the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean with phylogeographic data from 56 taxa, and to evaluate the strength and nature of barriers emerging from this test. Location The Indo-Pacific Ocean. Time period Pliocene through the Holocene. Major taxa studied Fifty-six marine species. Methods We tested eight biogeographic hypotheses for partitioning of the Indo-Pacific using a novel modification to analysis of molecular variance. Putative barriers to gene flow emerging from this analysis were evaluated for pairwise phi(ST), and these phi(ST) distributions were compared to distributions from randomized datasets and simple coalescent simulations of vicariance arising from the Last Glacial Maximum. We then weighed the relative contribution of distance versus environmental or geographic barriers to pairwise phi(ST) with a distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA). Results We observed a diversity of outcomes, although the majority of species fit a few broad biogeographic regions. Repeated coalescent simulation of a simple vicariance model yielded a wide distribution of pairwise phi(ST) that was very similar to empirical distributions observed across five putative barriers to gene flow. Three of these barriers had median phi(ST) that were significantly larger than random expectation. Only 21 of 52 species analysed with dbRDA rejected the null model. Among these, 15 had overwater distance as a significant predictor of pairwise phi(ST), while 11 were significant for geographic or environmental barriers other than distance. Main conclusions Although there is support for three previously described barriers, phylogeographic discordance in the Indo-Pacific Ocean indicates incongruity between processes shaping the distributions of diversity at the species and population levels. Among the many possible causes of this incongruity, genetic drift provides the most compelling explanation: given massive effective population sizes of Indo-Pacific species, even hard vicariance for tens of thousands of years can yield phi(ST )values that range from 0 to nearly 0.5.

Developing allometric models to predict the individual aboveground biomass of shrubs worldwide	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						allometric model construction; biomass equation; carbon inventories; crown diameter; dimensional relationships; multistemmed individuals; plant allometry; scaling relationships	FOREST BIOMASS; LOG-REGRESSION; CARBON STOCKS; TREE HEIGHT; EQUATIONS; PLANT; SIZE; GENERALITY; THORNSCRUB; DENSITY	Aim Existing global models to predict standing biomass are based on trees characterized by a single principal stem, well developed in height. However, their use in open woodlands and shrublands, characterized by multistemmed species with substantial crown development, generates a high level of uncertainty in biomass estimates. This limitation led us to (a) develop global models of shrub individual aboveground biomass based on simple allometric variables, (b) to compare the fit of these models with existing global biomass models, and (c) to assess whether models fit change when bioclimatic variables are considered. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied 118 species of shrubs. Methods We compile a database of 3,243 individuals across 49 sites distributed worldwide. Including stem basal diameter, height and crown diameter as predictor variables, we built potential models and compared their fit using generalized least squares. We used mixed effects models to determine if bioclimatic variables improved the accuracy of biomass models. Results Although the most important variable in terms of predictive capacity was stem basal diameter, crown diameter significantly improved the models' fit, followed by height. Four models were finally chosen, with the best model combining all these variables in the same equation [R-2 = 0.930, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.476]. Selected models performed as well as established global biomass models. Including the individual bioform significantly improved the models' fit. Main conclusions Stem basal diameter, crown diameter and height measures could be combined to provide robust aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates of individual shrub species. Our study supplements well-established models developed for trees, allowing more accurate biomass estimation of multistemmed woody individuals. We further provide tools for a methodological standardization of individual biomass quantification in these species. We expect these results contribute to improve the quality of biomass estimates across ecosystems, but also to generate methodological consensus on field biomass assessments in shrubs.

While anthropogenic factors such as climate change can affect species distributions through time, other naturally occurring ecological processes can also have an influence. Theory predicts that interactions between species can influence distributional dynamics, yet empirical evidence remains sparse. A powerful approach is to monitor and model local colonization and extinction-the processes that generate change in distributions over time-and to identify their abiotic and biotic associations. Intensive camera-trap monitoring provides an opportunity to assess the role of temperature and species interactions in the colonization and extinction dynamics of tropical mammals, many of which are species of conservation concern. Using data from a pan-tropical monitoring network, we examined how short-term local temperature change and ecological similarity between species (a proxy for the strength of species interactions) influenced the processes that drive distributional shifts. Location Tropical forests worldwide. Time period 2007-2016. Major taxa studied Terrestrial mammals. Methods We used dynamic occupancy models to assess the influence of the abiotic and biotic environment on the distributional dynamics of 42 mammal populations from 36 species on 7 tropical elevation gradients around the world. Results Overall, temperature, ecological similarity, or both, were linked to colonization or extinction dynamics in 29 populations. For six species, the effect of temperature depended upon the local mammal community similarity. This result suggests that the way in which temperature influences local colonization and extinction dynamics depends on local mammal community composition. Main conclusions These results indicate that varying temperatures influence tropical mammal distributions in surprising ways and suggest that interactions between species mediate distributional dynamics.

Broader niches revealed by fossil data do not reduce estimates of range loss and fragmentation of African montane trees	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Afromontane; biogeography; niche; palaeoecology; range collapse; species distribution models; tropical climate; tropical forests	EARTH SYSTEM MODEL; LAND-USE CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; LATE QUATERNARY; PRUNUS-AFRICANA; EXTINCTION DEBT; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; SHIFTS	Aim The climate tolerances of many species are broader than those estimated from current native ranges. Indeed, the niches of some Afromontane trees are up to 50% larger after incorporation of fossil data. This expansion could reduce estimates of species' future range loss owing to climate change but also implies strong non-climatic limitations on species' current ranges. One such limitation is land use, which fossil data suggest influences Afromontane tree distribution, preventing these trees from occupying warmer conditions than they do currently. We aimed to assess the degree to which the broader climatic tolerances revealed by fossil data buffer projected range loss from climate and land use for Afromontane trees. Location Africa. Time period Last 21,000 years. Major taxa studied Afromontane trees. Methods We used species distribution models informed by both current and fossil distributions to project future ranges under climate and land-use projections. Results We found that projected range reductions are only slightly ameliorated by incorporation of fossil distributions, and these improvements diminish further under severe land-use or climate change scenarios. Taxa that are less impacted by climate are more impacted by intense land use. Depending on the severity of climate and land use, the geographical extent of Afromontane tree species' ranges will contract by 40-85%, and the trees will be completely lost from large portions of Africa. We projected that the surviving species' ranges will become increasingly fragmented. Main conclusions Maintaining Afromontane ecosystems will require mitigation of both climate and land-use change and protection of areas to optimize connectivity. Our findings caution that species with climate tolerances broader than their current range might not necessarily fare better under strong changes in climate or land use.

We aimed to identify the major strategies that shape the diet space of birds and to investigate their spatial distributions in association with biogeographical, bioclimatic and anthropogenic drivers. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Birds. Methods We analysed score-based assessments of eight diet categories for 8,937 out of 10,964 extant bird species. We constructed a multivariate diet space by ordinating these data in a principal coordinates analysis and assessed its dimensionality as a balance between the representation of original diet scores and parsimony. We averaged the positions of species along each dimension for 12,705 species assemblages and used quantile regressions to infer the relative contributions of species richness, climate, primary productivity, topography and human footprint to the spatial distribution of the diet space at a global scale. Results The diet space of birds was structured by four dimensions ordinating species along continua ranging from insectivory to plant-based strategies, granivory to frugivory, common to rare diets, and nectarivory to carnivory and piscivory. Although orthogonal at the species level, these dimensions were correlated among species assemblages, with regional variation consistent with past climatic and tectonic events. Human footprint packed bird assemblages in the diet space, whereas warm climate, high productivity and high topographic variability were associated with high variability in the prevalence of dietary strategies among assemblages. Main conclusions The tremendous variability in bird diets can be explained by a few basic ecological continua sustained by morphological and ecophysiological differences among species. Strong biogeographical legacies on top of bioclimatic drivers distribute this diet space in species assemblages through environmental filtering and niche packing. However, these patterns are altered at macroecological scales by human-mediated functional homogenization, which might, in turn, affect the global distribution of bird functions and services.

Physiological acclimation and persistence of ectothermic species under extreme heat events	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						acclimation; acclimation response ratio; extreme events; generations; geographic range; persistence; physiological plasticity	THERMAL TOLERANCE; CLIMATE; EVOLUTIONARY; LIMITS; LATITUDE; SIZE	Aim To test if physiological acclimation can buffer species against increasing extreme heat due to climate change. Location Global. Time period 1960 to 2015. Major taxa studied Amphibians, arthropods, brachiopods, cnidarians, echinoderms, fishes, molluscs, reptiles. Methods We draw together new and existing data quantifying the warm acclimation response in 319 species as the acclimation response ratio (ARR): the increase in upper thermal limit per degree increase in experimental temperature. We develop worst-case scenario climate projections to calculate the number of years and generations gained by ARR until loss of thermal safety. We further compute a vulnerability score that integrates across variables estimating exposure to climate change and species-specific tolerance through traits, including physiological plasticity, generation time and latitudinal range extent. Results ARR is highly variable, but with marked differences across taxa, habitats and latitude. Polar terrestrial arthropods show high ARRs [95% upper confidence limit (UCL95%) = 0.68], as do some polar aquatic invertebrates that were acclimated for extended durations (ARR > 0.4). While this physiological plasticity buys 100s of years until thermal safety is lost, combination with long generation times leads to decreased potential for evolutionary adaptation. Additionally, 27% of marine polar invertebrates have no capacity for acclimation and reptiles and amphibians have minimal ARR (UCL95% = 0.16). Low physiological plasticity, long generations times and restricted latitudinal ranges combine to distinguish reptiles, amphibians and polar invertebrates as being highly vulnerable amongst ectotherms. Main conclusions In some taxa the combined effects of acclimation capacity and generation time can provide 100s of years and generations before thermal safety is lost. The accuracy of assessments of vulnerability to climate change will be improved by considering multiple aspects of species' biology that, in combination may increase persistence under extreme heat events, and increase the probability for evolutionary rescue.

Inferring introgression using RADseq and D-FOIL: Power and pitfalls revealed in a case study of spiny lizards (Sceloporus)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						ABBA-BABA; batch effects; D-statistics; hybridization; mito-nuclear discordance	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; GENE FLOW; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; PENALIZED LIKELIHOOD; CHROMOSOME RACES; HYBRIDIZATION; SEQUENCE; EVOLUTION; DIVERGENCE; POPULATIONS	Introgression is now commonly reported in studies across the Tree of Life, aided by recent advancements in data collection and analysis. Nevertheless, researchers working with nonmodel species lacking reference genomes may be stymied by a mismatch between available resources and methodological demands. In this study, we demonstrate a fast and simple approach for inferring introgression using RADseq data, and apply it to a case study involving spiny lizards (Sceloporus) from northeastern Mexico. First, we find evidence for recurrent mtDNA introgression between the two focal species based on patterns of mito-nuclear discordance. We then test for nuclear introgression by exhaustively applying the "five-taxon" D-statistic (D-FOIL) to all relevant individuals sampled for RADseq data. In our case, this exhaustive approach (dubbed "ExD(FOIL)") entails testing up to similar to y250,000 unique four-taxon combinations of individuals across species. To facilitate use of this ExD(FOIL) approach, we provide scripts for many relevant tasks, including the selection of appropriate four-taxon combinations, execution of D-FOIL tests in parallel and visualization of introgression results in phylogenetic and geographic space. Using ExD(FOIL), we find evidence for ancient introgression between the focal species. Furthermore, we reveal geographic variation in patterns of introgression that is consistent with patterns of mito-nuclear discordance and with recurrent introgression. Overall, our study demonstrates that the combination of D-FOIL and RADseq data can effectively detect introgression under a variety of sampling conditions (for individuals, populations and loci). Importantly, we also find evidence that batch-specific error and linkage in RADseq data may mislead inferences of introgression under certain conditions.

Plant DNA-barcode library and community phylogeny for a semi-arid East African savanna	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						barcode gap; biodiversity; comparative phylogenetics; East Africa; Forest Global Earth Observatory; Mpala Research Centre	SUBFAMILY ALOOIDEAE; SOUTHERN AFRICA; SEQUENCE DATA; ACACIA-S.L.; CLASSIFICATION; COMBRETACEAE; HERBIVORES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; FOREST	Applications of DNA barcoding include identifying species, inferring ecological and evolutionary relationships between species, and DNA metabarcoding. These applications require reference libraries that are not yet available for many taxa and geographic regions. We collected, identified, and vouchered plant specimens from Mpala Research Center in Laikipia, Kenya, to develop an extensive DNA-barcode library for a savanna ecosystem in equatorial East Africa. We amassed up to five DNA barcode markers (rbcL, matK, trnL-F, trnH-psbA, and ITS) for 1,781 specimens representing up to 460 species (92% of the known flora), increasing the number of plant DNA barcode records for Africa by 9%. We evaluated the ability of these markers, singly and in combination, to delimit species by calculating intra- and interspecific genetic distances. We further estimated a plant community phylogeny and demonstrated its utility by testing if evolutionary relatedness could predict the tendency of members of the Mpala plant community to have or lack "barcode gaps", defined as disparities between the maximum intra- and minimum interspecific genetic distances. We found barcode gaps for 72%-89% of taxa depending on the marker or markers used. With the exception of the markers rbcL and ITS, we found that evolutionary relatedness was an important predictor of barcode-gap presence or absence for all of the markers in combination and for matK, trnL-F, and trnH-psbA individually. This plant DNA barcode library and community phylogeny will be a valuable resource for future investigations.

Generating amplified fragments with a unique sequence identifier ('tag') for each sample is crucial, as it allows assigning sequences to the original samples. The tagging through so-called fusion primers is a fast and cheap alternative to commercially produced ligation-based kits. However, little is known about potential bias and inconsistencies introduced by the long nucleotide tail attached to those primers, which could lead to deficient reports of community composition in metabarcoding studies. We therefore tested the consistency and taxa detection efficiency of fusion primers in (1) a one-step and (2) two-step PCR protocol as well as (3) a commercially manufactured Illumina kit using mock communities of known composition. The Illumina kit delivered the most consistent results and detected the highest number of taxa. However, success of the two-step PCR approach was only marginally lower compared to the kit with the additional advantage of a much more competitive price per library. While most taxa were also detected with the one-step PCR approach, the consistency between replicates including read abundance was substantially lower. Our results highlight that method choice depends on the precision needed for analysis as well as on economic considerations and recommend the Illumina kit to obtain most accurate results and the two-step PCR approach as a much cheaper yet very robust alternative.

The resultant DNA barcode library includes records for 2,453 named species comprising a total of 5,200 barcode index numbers (BINs), including 2,700 COI haplotype clusters without species-level assignment, so called "dark taxa." Overall, 88 out of 117 families (75%) recorded from Germany were covered, representing more than 50% of the 9,544 known species of German Diptera. Until now, most of these families, especially the most diverse, have been taxonomically inaccessible. By contrast, within a few years this study provided an intermediate taxonomic system for half of the German Dipteran fauna, which will provide a useful foundation for subsequent detailed, integrative taxonomic studies. Using DNA extracts derived from bulk collections made by Malaise traps, we further demonstrate that species delineation using BINs and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) constitutes an effective method for biodiversity studies using DNA metabarcoding. As the reference libraries continue to grow, and gaps in the species catalogue are filled, BIN lists assembled by metabarcoding will provide greater taxonomic resolution. The present study has three main goals: (a) to provide a DNA barcode library for 5,200 BINs of Diptera; (b) to demonstrate, based on the example of bulk extractions from a Malaise trap experiment, that DNA barcode clusters, labelled with globally unique identifiers (such as OTUs and/or BINs), provide a pragmatic, accurate solution to the "taxonomic impediment"; and (c) to demonstrate that interim names based on BINs and OTUs obtained through metabarcoding provide an effective method for studies on species-rich groups that are usually neglected in biodiversity research projects because of their unresolved taxonomy.

Models of isolation mechanisms often consider multiple distances in order to explain genetic divergence. Yet, the available methods to estimate the geographical ranges of lineages are based on direct geographical distances, neglecting other distance metrics that can better explain the spatial genetic structure. We extended the phylogeographical interpolation method (phylin) in order to accommodate user-defined distance metrics and to incorporate the uncertainty associated with genetic distance calculation. These new features were tested with simulated and empirical data sets. Multiple distance matrices were generated including geographical, resistance, and environmental distances to derive maps of lineage occurrence. The new additions to this method improved the ability to predict lineage occurrence, even with low sample size. We used a regression framework to quantify the relationship between the genetic divergence and competing distance matrices representing potential isolation processes that are subsequently used in the interpolation process. Including uncertainty in tree topology and the different distance matrices improved the robustness of the variograms, allowing a better fit of the theoretical model of spatial dependence. The improvements to the method increase its potential application in other fields. Accurately mapping genetic divergence can help to locate potential contact zones between lineages as well as barriers to gene flow, which has a broad interest in biogeographical and evolutionary studies. Additionally, conservation efforts could benefit from the integration of genetic variation and landscape features in a spatially explicit framework.

In this study, we examined the problem of selecting predictor variables derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) when using stepwise and multiple linear regression, and when using kNN imputation using Random Forests (RF) to select predictor variables. Systems of forest attributes and ecological indicators were estimated using ALS statistics and ground data collected in Central-East Spain, on two Mediterranean pine forest areas. Co-registration errors were simulated by means of altering ground data coordinates. The larger the co-registration error, the higher the variation in the selected ALS-based predictors in the parametric approach, which was less affected than the RF-based selection. In both cases, the final performance of the models was not as affected by co-registration errors as the observed variation in the selection of variables: the impact was around 1% in the parametric approach while the value reached the 8% for both stand basal area and the Gini-index under the non-parametric method. The forest biophysical attributes of the set behaved differently towards altering the co-registration factor in both cases. To control the co-registration factor between remote sensing data sources and ground surveys is an essential step to reduce uncertainty in data interpretation and in the modeling of forest attributes.

A genetic approach for simulating persistence of reintroduced tree species populations in restored forests	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Ecological restoration; Genetic diversity; Individual-based model; Population viability	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; TROPICAL FORESTS; NEOTROPICAL TREE; LIFE-HISTORY; DIVERSITY; VIABILITY; MODEL; REGENERATION; METAANALYSIS	Tree populations in regions undergoing restoration are generally made up of few individuals, isolated from neighboring populations, and are found within a matrix of inhospitable human-modified landscapes. Resulting negative genetic consequences such as inbreeding depression and genetic drift require mitigation strategies to maintain sufficient genetic diversity in restoration areas. Such strategies often involve seed sampling from many source trees with different provenances. However, the efficacy of these approaches has not been validated. We present an individual-based spatial simulation model to evaluate the effects of: 1) differing levels of initial genetic diversity; and 2) different area sizes on short (tens of years) and mid-term (hundreds of years) restored population viability. We demonstrate this approach and the use of our model with case study of Centrolobium tomentosum, a tropical tree species widely used in restoration projects in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Our model and analysis framework can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics, from tropical and temperate forests, to assess population persistence in restoration sites as a function of genetic diversity and population size. This knowledge can support planning of both restoration projects and management actions, increasing the probability of restoration success while also reducing associated costs.

Development and application of a multispecies toxicity test with tropical freshwater microalgae	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Phytoplankton; Multispecies bioassay; Herbicides; Atrazine; Imazapic; Flow cytometry; IC10	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; HERBICIDES; EXPOSURE; COPPER; PHYTOTOXICITY; FLUORESCENCE; COMMUNITIES; SENSITIVITY; GROWTH; ALGAE	Microalgae are commonly used in ecotoxicity testing due to their ease of culturing and rapid cell division rates. These tests generally utilise a single species of algae; however, microalgae occur in the environment as complex communities of multiple species. To date, routine multispecies toxicity tests using tropical microalgae have not been available. This study investigated four tropical freshwater microalgal species for use in a chronic multispecies toxicity test based on the population growth (cell division) rate: Pediastrum duplex, Monoraphidium arcuatum, Nannochloropsis-like sp. and Chlorella sp. 12. Flow cytometric analysis identified the different fluorescence and light scattering properties of each algal species and quantified each species within multispecies mixtures. Following optimisation of test media nutrients and pH, a toxicity testing protocol was developed with P. duplex, M. arcuatum and Nannochloropsis-like sp. There were no significant differences in growth rates of each alga when tested over 72 h as single species or in multispecies mixtures. Atrazine and imazapic, two herbicides with different modes of action, were used to assess the sensitivity of the multispecies toxicity test. Atrazine was toxic to all species with 72-h IC10 values of 7.2, 63 and 280 mu g/L for P duplex, M. arcuatum and Nannochloropsis-like sp. respectively, while imazapic was not toxic to any species at concentrations up to 1100 mu g/L. The toxicity of atrazine and imazapic to each microalgal species in the multispecies toxicity test was the same as that determined from single-species toxicity tests indicating that the presence of these microalgae in a mixture did not affect the toxicity of these two herbicides. This study is the first to develop a multispecies tropical microalgal toxicity test for application in freshwaters. This time- and cost-effective tool can be utilised to generate data to assist environmental decision making and to undertake risk assessments of contaminants in tropical freshwater environments.

It has been reported that some non-coplanar PCBs accumulate in the brains of female PD patients. To improve our understanding of the association between PCB exposure and PD risk we have applied whole transcriptome gene expression analysis in blood cells from 594 PCB-exposed subjects (369 female, 225 male). Interestingly, we observe that in females, blood levels of non-coplanar PCBs appear to be associated with expression levels of PD-specific genes. However, no such association was detected in males. Among the 131 PD-specific genes affected, 39 have been shown to display similar changes in expression levels in the substantia nigra of deceased PD patients. Especially among the down-regulated genes, transcripts of genes involved in neurotransmitter vesicle-related functions were predominant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Microplastic pollution in streams spanning an urbanisation gradient	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Microplastic; Freshwater pollution; Urban streams; Catchment parameters	PLASTIC DEBRIS; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; SURFACE WATERS; SEDIMENTS; RIVER; LAKE; CONTAMINATION; TRIBUTARIES; ABUNDANCE	Microplastic pollution has received considerable attention in marine systems, but recent work shows substantial plastic pollution also occurs in freshwater ecosystems. Most freshwater research has focused on large rivers and lakes, but small streams are the primary interface between land, where plastic is used, and drainage networks. We examined variation in the amount and form of plastic occurring in small streams spanning an urbanisation gradient. All streams contained microplastics with concentrations similar to that found in larger systems (up to 303 particles m(-3) in water and 80 particles kg(-1) in sediment). The most abundant types were fragments and small particles (63-500 mu m). Chemical types of plastic were quite variable and often not predictable based on size, form and colour. Variation in microplastic abundance across streams was high, but only partially explained by catchment scale parameters. There was no relationship between human population density or combined stormwater overflows and microplastic abundance. Residential land cover was related to microplastic abundance, but explanatory power was low. Our results suggest local-scale factors may be more important than catchment-scale processes in determining microplastic pollution in small streams. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A rapid zebrafish embryo behavioral biosensor that is capable of detecting environmental beta-blockers	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Isoproterenol; Propranolol; beta-adrenoceptor; Photomotor response; Environmental pharmaceuticals; Toxicity testing	AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; EXPOSURE; PROPRANOLOL; FISH; PHARMACEUTICALS; NOREPINEPHRINE; IDENTIFICATION; THROUGHPUT; RESPONSES; TOXICITY	beta-Blockers (BB) are one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals used for treating cardio-vascular and acute anxiety-related disorders. This class of drugs inhibit beta-adrenoceptor signalling and given their growing, widespread use, BB are routinely detected in surface waters at nM concentrations. This is concerning as trace levels of BB impart developmental and reproductive dysfunction in non-target aquatic organisms, with potential for ecological risks. To date, environmental pharmaceutical risks to non-target animals are not part of the monitoring framework due to the lack of bioassays for assessing their biological effects. Behavioral endpoints have the advantage of a systems-level integration of multiple sensory signals and motor responses for toxicity screening; however, they are not currently used for risk assessment of environmental contaminants. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo photomotor response (zfPMR) has been used in high-throughput behavioral screenings for neuroactive drug effects at high, therapeutic concentrations. Our objective here was to examine if we could utilize the zfPMR for screening environmental levels of BB. Embryos were placed into 96-well plates, exposed to chemicals and/or municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE), and their zfPMRs were measured with video-analysis. To specifically target BB, embryos were co-treated with isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist that stimulates the zfPMR, and the inhibition of isoproterenol-induced response was used as a biomarker of BB exposure. Our results reveal that the inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated zfPMRs can be used as a biosensor capable of detecting BB in the parts-per-billion to parts-per-trillion in water samples, including diluted MWWE. The method developed detects BB in spite of the presence of other neuroactive compounds in water samples. This systems level approach of rapid screening for BB effects provides the most promising evidence to date that behavioral neuromodulation can be potentially applied for environmental effects monitoring of pharmaceuticals.

MP are contaminating marine organisms consumed by humans. This work studied MP contamination in two bivalve species of commercial interest: blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) sampled on the Channel coastlines (France). In parallel, 13 plastic additives and 27 hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) were quantified in bivalves flesh using SBSE-TD-GS-MS/MS to explore a possible relationship between their concentrations and MP contamination levels. MP were extracted using a 10% potassium hydroxide digestion method then identified by mu-Raman spectroscopy. The proportion of contaminated bivalves by MP ranged from 34 to 58%. Blue mussels and common cockles exhibited 0.76 +/- 0.40 and 2.46 +/- 1.16 MP/individual and between 0.15 +/- 0.06 and 0.74 +/- 035 MP/g of tissue wet weight. Some HOC and plastic additives were detected in bivalves. However, no significant Pearson or Spearman correlation was found between MP loads and plastic additives or HOC concentrations in bivalve tissues for the two species. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Anthropogenic litter cleanups in Iowa riparian areas reveal the importance of near-stream and watershed scale land use	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Plastic pollution; Anthropogenic litter; Citizen science; Riparian litter; Cleanup	MARINE DEBRIS; BEACHES; TOURISM; SYSTEMS; RIVERS; WALES	Volunteer cleanup operations collect large datasets on anthropogenic litter that are seldom analyzed. Here we assess the influence of land use in both near-stream and watershed scale source domains on anthropogenic litter concentration (standing stock, kg km(-1)) in riparian zones of Iowa, USA. We utilized riparian litter concentration data on four classes of anthropogenic litter (metal, recyclable, garbage, and tires) from volunteer cleanup operations. Anthropogenic litter data were tested for correlation with near-stream and watershed scale land uses (developed, road density, agricultural, and open lands). Road density (road length/area) and developed land use (% area) were significantly correlated to anthropogenic litter, but agricultural (% area) and open lands (% area) were not. Metal objects correlated to near-stream road density (r = 0.79, p = 0.02), while garbage and recyclable materials correlated to watershed scale road density (r = 0.69, p = 0.06 and r = 0.71, p = 0.05 respectively). These differences in the important spatial scales of land use may be related to differences in transport characteristics of anthropogenic litter. Larger, denser metal objects may be transported more slowly through the water-shed/channelized system and thus, dependent on more proximal sources, whereas smaller, less dense garbage and recyclable material are likely transported more rapidly, resulting in concentrations that depend more on watershed scale supply. We developed a linear regression model that used near-stream road density and the total amount of observed litter to predict an average anthropogenic litter density of 188 kg km(-1) and a standing stock of 946 t in all Iowa streams (>4th Strahler order). The techniques employed in this study can be applied to other professional and volunteer litter datasets to develop prevention and cleanup efforts, inform investigations of process, and assess management actions.

A lack of understanding of the effects of elevated temperature on shark behaviour remains an impediment to forecasting ecosystem-wide impacts. Port Jackson shark eggs were incubated and reared at current and projected end-of-century temperatures (+3 degrees C). We tested juvenile's learning ability with a quantity discrimination task. The mortality rate of sharks reared in warm water was 41.7% compared with no mortality in the present-day sharks. Contrary to expectations, our results suggest that surviving hatchlings from the elevated-temperature group took fewer days to reach learning criterion and had a higher proportion of correct choice compared with hatchlings reared under present conditions. Additionally, this is the first data suggesting that sharks can discriminate different quantities. Our results seem to indicate that learning and behaviour might play a role in allowing elasmobranchs to overcome some of the deleterious effects of climate warming, but further research is needed to fully comprehend these findings.Significance statementThe world's oceans are warming at an unprecedented rate, which will impair development and alter physiological and behavioural traits in marine predators. Learning may play a leading role in allowing apex and mesopredators to adapt to a rapidly changing environment; however, no studies have tested the impacts of ocean warming in their learning abilities. We incubated and reared Port Jackson shark eggs at current and projected end-of-century temperatures (+3 degrees C). Contrary to expectations, surviving juveniles from the elevated-temperature group showed better learning performance, potentially adding learning ability to a growing list of traits that incubation temperature can modify during early development in marine predators. Our results were not entirely negative; it is possible that increased learning performance might allow apex and mesopredators to increase foraging efficiency and match increased energetic demands caused by elevated temperature.

Segmentation of car drivers based on longitudinal GPS travel data	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Electric mobility; Driver segmentation; Vehicle charging; Energy demand; GPS data analytics	VEHICLES; PATTERNS; FEASIBILITY; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM	Current research on the driving performance and energy consumption of electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) considers several criteria, including electric reachability, load to the electric grid, and the share of distances that can be driven electrically. However, prior studies do not distinguish between different driver segments but treat the entirety of drivers as a coherent whole. These aggregated results are hence limited to a macro-level perspective or to an isolated assessment of the recruited driver sample, which reduces the validity of forecasts with respect to specific groups of adopters and their regional impact to the grid. In contrast, the present study outlines a procedure for a segment-wise analysis of drivers using GPS mobility data. The proposed approach allows for both, comparative usability analyses between distinct groups and predictions of the load to the electrical grid on a segment-by-segment basis. We illustrate our approach by the example of a dataset collected from 982 drivers in Italy over two years. The results support decision makers regarding the identification of segment-specific vehicle and infrastructure requirements. Moreover, the insights about benefits and obstacles of EV and PHEV adoption per segment help users take more informed purchasing decisions.

Recent studies have shown that current phenotyping protocols do not adequately address all dimensions of phenotype expression. Therefore, these methods can give biased assessments of sensitivity to temperature, leading to misunderstandings concerning the ecological processes underlying thermal plasticity. We describe here a new robust and versatile experimental framework for the accurate investigation of thermal performance and phenotypic diversity in yeasts and yeast-like microorganisms, at the individual and population levels. In addition to proof-of-concept, the application of this framework to the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici resulted in detailed characterisations for this yeast-like microorganism of (i) the patterns of temperature-dependent changes in performance for four fitness traits; (ii) the consistency in thermal sensitivity rankings of strains between in planta and in vitro growth assessments; (iii) significant interindividual variation in thermal responses, with four principal thermotypes detected in a sample of 66 strains; and (iv) the ecological consequences of this diversity for population-level processes through pairwise competition experiments highlighting temperature-dependent outcomes. These findings extend our knowledge and ability to quantify and categorise the phenotypic heterogeneity of thermal responses. As such, they lay the foundations for further studies elucidating local adaptation patterns and the effects of temperature variations on eco-evolutionary and epidemiological processes.

The intraspecific variation of symbionts remains poorly assessed while phenotypic effects and transmission behaviors, which are key processes for the persistence and evolution of symbioses, may differ widely depending on the symbiont strains. Serratia symbiotica is one of the most frequent symbiont species in aphids and a valuable model to assess this intraspecific variation since it includes both facultative and obligate symbiotic strains. Despite evidence that some facultative S. symbiotica strains exhibit a free-living capacity, the presence of these strains in wild aphid populations, as well as in insects with which they maintain regular contact, has never been demonstrated. Here, we examined the prevalence, diversity, and tissue tropism of S. symbiotica in wild aphids and associated ants. We found a high occurrence of S. symbiotica infection in ant populations, especially when having tended infected aphid colonies. We also found that the S. symbiotica diversity includes strains found located within the gut of aphids and ants. In the latter, this tissue tropism was found restricted to the proventriculus. Altogether, these findings highlight the extraordinary diversity and versatility of an insect symbiont and suggest the existence of novel routes for symbiont acquisition in insects.

Population recovery, seasonal site fidelity, and daily activity of pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) in an Amazonian floodplain mosaic	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						community-based management; lateral migration; movement ecology; paiche; radio telemetry; sustainable fisheries	COMMUNITY-BASED MANAGEMENT; SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES; LATERAL MIGRATION; RIVER; GIGAS; LANDSCAPE; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY	Pirarucu (Arapaima spp.) are the world's largest scaled freshwater fish, reaching 3 m in length and >200 kg in weight. Historical overfishing has devastated populations of this remarkable fish across Amazonian floodplains, but community-based management programmes are now stimulating the recovery of wild populations. Pirarucu have evolved a unique set of life history traits, some of which have important implications for population management. Individuals exhibit lateral annual migration patterns during the prolonged annual flood pulse, entering flooded forests to reproduce and forage. During this period, although managed fish stocks become less monopolisable by local communities responsible for managing protected lakes, pirarucu can occupy and reproduce in new environments and thus potentially contribute to population recovery. Here, we show a strong pattern of pirarucu (Arapaima cf. gigas) population recovery under community-based management in an area along the Jurua River, in western Brazilian Amazonia. We show evidence of population recovery even outside formal protected areas, reinforcing the suitability of pirarucu community-based management as a powerful tool for both biodiversity conservation and the improvement of local livelihoods. We also show pirarucu movements across a floodplain mosaic-including lakes, the main river channel, tributary streams, and flooded forests-during the wet season. Our results support evidence of site fidelity among migrating pirarucu, justifying the high effort invested by local communities in seasonally protecting lakes from poachers and illegal fishers. Finally, restricted daily movement patterns by pirarucu support the suitability of population estimates based on day-time counts because the chance of double counting is substantially reduced during the day when these counts are conducted. We highlight the strong suitability of this species for community-based management, since they can: (1) replenish new environments during the wet season through migration and possibly also reproduction; and (2) be efficiently harvested during the dry season, delivering social and ecological benefits at large spatial scales. Positive examples of fisheries management, which align biodiversity conservation and social development, are important for building optimism, and influencing local and international stakeholders. Our study shows how engaging and empowering local communities to help monitor the movement ecology of target species can be an effective strategy to support the sustainable management of aquatic resources in tropical environments.

Beaver-created successional gradients increase beta-diversity of invertebrates by turnover in stream-wetland complexes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						Castor canadensis; invertebrates; pond; species replacement; turnover	SPECIES RICHNESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; COMPONENTS; HABITAT; METACOMMUNITIES; HETEROGENEITY	Beavers are ecosystem engineers known to modify the environment primarily via dam building. Beaver wetlands are complexes of newly created, mature, and abandoned beaver constructions within a stream network. Invertebrate dynamics across all habitats derived from these successional stages remains poorly explored. Here, we test how this natural successional gradient created by beaver affects invertebrate beta-diversity and its components (turnover and nestedness). Invertebrates were sampled in the Piedmont region of Georgia (U.S.A.) in two seasons (autumn and spring) in each of four stages of habitat succession: natural stream channels, forested wetlands created by newly formed beaver dams, mature open wetland marshes, and abandoned wetland meadows. In autumn, invertebrate communities were different among successional stages, apart from new versus abandoned wetlands and new versus mature wetlands, which were only marginally different, and streams versus abandoned wetlands. In spring, only the mature beaver wetland communities were unique, differing from both streams and from newly formed or abandoned wetlands. Beta-diversity was nearly twice as high for the overall study-system than any individual successional stage, which all had similar diversity. Additionally, turnover was significantly higher than nestedness in all stages. Community differences combined with high turnover among successional stages indicates that beaver wetland communities are not merely a subset of more stable mature wetlands or streams; instead, each stage has a different taxonomic make-up. Our results strengthen the idea that beaver activity can be an important conservation tool by contributing substantially to diversity in areas where they are present. Beaver wetlands have the potential to help stabilise beta- and regional diversity in the face of wetland loss from climate change and other human impacts.

Strong zonation of benthic communities across a tidal freshwater height gradient	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						community structure; environmental gradient; tidal freshwater; trade-offs; zonation	TRADE-OFFS; FISH; DISTURBANCE; PERMANENCE; PREDATION; WETLANDS; HISTORY; FOOD; INVERTEBRATES; DISTRIBUTIONS	Trade-offs associated with environmental gradients generate patterns of diversity and govern community organisation in a landscape. In freshwaters, benthic community structure is driven by trade-offs along generally orthogonal gradients of habitat permanence and predation-where ephemeral systems are physiologically harsh because of drying stress, but inhabitants are less likely to be under the intense predation pressure of more permanent waterbodies. However, in tidal freshwaters, these two stressors are compounding, and the trade-offs associated with them are decoupled. We investigated benthic community structure in a tidal freshwater habitat. These communities experience a suite of conditions atypical for a freshwater habitat: twice-daily drying; and high predation pressure by mobile fishes. We compared benthic communities at three tidal heights (low, mid, high) and contrasted these with nearby non-tidal freshwaters that varied in their hydrology (permanent, temporary). We found that communities were more strongly differentiated in tidal freshwater habitats than between permanent and temporary inland freshwaters, which was surprising given the high interconnectedness and condensed longitudinal scale of tidal habitats. The differentiation of communities in tidal habitats was probably driven by the combined gradients of desiccation risk at low tide and intense predation by fish at high tide-a combination of pressures that are novel for the evolutionary history of the regional freshwater invertebrate fauna. Our study provides evidence that environmental gradients can produce stronger patterns of community zonation than would be predicted for habitats that are spatially contiguous and have little or no dispersal limitation. These results give insight into how communities might respond if drivers of community structure are altered or reorganised from their regional or evolutionary norms.

They suffer from decreasing fitness when they are exposed to permanent hydration, yet they restore fitness when they go through anhydrobiosis. The demographic processes underlying this rejuvenation, however, are still largely unknown. To investigate these processes in detail, we analysed life tables of permanently hydrated and repeatedly desiccated lines of two species of bdelloid rotifers, Macrotrachela quadricornifera and Adineta ricciae. Experimental lineages of these two species originated from habitats with contrasting desiccation frequencies. First, we built a three-stage life cycle including juveniles as well as prime and senescent adults. Next, we estimated stage-specific vital rates (survival, development, and reproduction) and used the estimates to project the asymptotic population growth rates lambda (= eA (R)). Finally, we applied life-table response experiment methods and performed elasticity analysis to assess the contributions of each vital rate to differences in lambda and to estimate effects of proportional changes in vital rates on lambda, respectively. We demonstrated that repeatedly desiccated lines grew faster than permanently hydrated lines. In addition, we confirmed that offspring of post-anhydrobiotic individuals had higher fecundities and matured faster than individuals of the permanently hydrated lines. Survival rates usually did not differ between the two lines, but lambda was most elastic to survival rates of prime adults and juveniles. These general life-history patterns were observed in both species. The analyses performed here provide a detailed investigation of the demographic processes underlying fitness restoration in anhydrobiotic bdelloid rotifers. They reveal that habitat desiccation has profound and consistent effects on the life histories of the two study species. Because laboratory lineages of these species originated from habitats characterised by different wet/dry regimes, we suggest that the desiccation responses identified here may be representative for the entire taxon. As such, our study offers a starting point for comparative analyses beyond bdelloid rotifers.

Here, we modify a previously proposed framework, the Eco-Engineering Decision Scaling, for application to part of the water supply system of Quito, Ecuador. Specifically, we used feedback from engineers and water managers to develop a common set of metrics for defining flow-ecology relationships and assess managed-flow impacts on stream ecology. At 12 sites over 3 years, we collected flow and benthic invertebrate data (taxonomic richness, taxa important for fish, functional feeding groups, and water quality-sensitive taxa) during wet and dry seasons. We then used these data to identify flow thresholds (relative to unmanaged flows) where flow withdrawal caused visible ecological impacts. For this system, reduction of flow to 20% of the annual median was detrimental to benthic communities, while reductions to 40% of the annual median flow caused a variety of responses in the system. A trade-off analysis of weighted metrics showed that a 50% benthic fauna richness could be sustained if dry season flows were maintained between 28% and 40% of the unmanaged median annual flow. This study provides a roadmap for bridging between eco-engineering theoretical frameworks and the adoption of the environmental flows concept as actionable management thresholds.

Multiple factors operate simultaneously and interact in complex ways to shape community assembly. Understanding the organisation of communities including species interactions and the importance of driving factors (food, temperature, nutrients, oxygen concentration, etc.) is a central topic in ecology. Intra-annual variation in zooplankton and the factors that drive them are described in the Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) conceptual model. However, there has been little empirical evidence quantifying the relative contribution of abiotic and physical factors to plankton seasonality in zooplankton communities. 2. Using a long-term time series of zooplankton abundances and environmental conditions, we investigated which physical, chemical, and biotic factors structure zooplankton communities. We quantified their importance in seasonal changes in species composition by exploring networks of interacting species in the Rimov Reservoir (Czech Republic). We investigated how these factors were associated with seasonal and intra-annual (across all seasons) patterns of temporal variation in zooplankton. 3. We predicted that: (1) the zooplankton community in the Rimov Reservoir follows the general seasonal PEG pattern; (2) abiotic factors play an important role in the temporal distribution of zooplankton at the intra-annual scale, but their influence on the community declines at the seasonal scale; and (3) the network of interacting species is more complex at the seasonal scale than at intra-annual scale, so biotic drivers most strongly influence zooplankton patterns at seasonal scales. 4. The intra-annual pattern of zooplankton abundance was mainly determined by the physical environment. As expected, the roles of abiotic drivers of community assembly changed between seasons. There were more interactions between abiotic factors and species structuring the community at the intra-annual scale than at the seasonal scale. Additionally, these interactions were weaker at the seasonal scale than the intra-annual scale. The intra-annual zooplankton community of the Rimov Reservoir was the most stable, while the summer zooplankton community was the most variable. 5. Our results provide evidence that the network of interacting zooplankton taxa is composed of positive and negative relationships, which suggests facilitative, competitive, and predator-prey interactions. Although zooplankton species interactions have an influence year-round, the network of interacting species is more complex during the vegetative period and especially in summer, when species richness and abundance are high. Our results suggest that the zooplankton community is structured by both the biotic network at the seasonal scale and by the physical environment at the intra-annual scale. 6. Seasonal succession in zooplankton communities of temperate lakes is a well-known pattern. However, the influence of interspecific interactions within seasons on this pattern has not been clearly shown until this study. Exploring the community in only one season may provide incomplete knowledge of the factors and species interactions driving the whole community.

Scale dependence of sex-specific movement in a small-bodied stream fish	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						fine scale; PIT tags; sex-biased movement	BIASED DISPERSAL; POPULATION-DENSITY; FUNDULUS-OLIVACEUS; MARK-RECAPTURE; HABITAT USE; EVOLUTION; COMPETITION; TOPMINNOW; BEHAVIOR; RATIO	Animal movement at localised scales is often modulated by competing pressures such as avoiding predators while acquiring resources and mates. The relative magnitude of these trade-offs may affect males and females differently, often resulting in sex-specific differences in movement. Sex-biases in movement have been linked to mating systems (e.g. monogamy or polygamy) in birds and mammals; however, this relationship has received less attention among fishes. Using passive integrated transponder tags and a series of stationary antennas, we evaluated the movement dynamics of a small-bodied, sexually dimorphic stream fish Fundulus olivaceus over a 30-day period in a fourth-order tributary to the Pascagoula River in Mississippi (U.S.A.). We documented dissimilar sex-specific movement behaviours at different spatial scales that were likely to be facilitated by differential resource demands and competitive pressures. Females exhibited an increased propensity to engage in longer, exploratory moves (>30 m); whereas most males remained active within an established territory, making few long-distance longitudinal movements. Local activity levels (proportion of individuals moving) were positively related to density (manipulated during the study), and density was found to affect the magnitude of sex-specific movement. In contrast to females, males increased local activity and movement distance at the reduced density, presumably to expand territory size or mate-searching behaviours, suggesting local mate competition may suppress the movement distance of males. Despite some evidence substantiating a relationship between movement and mating system, our results suggest that the documented sex-specific differences may be related to traits that co-evolve with mating systems, rather than the mating system per se. Our findings also highlight the importance of spatial scale when evaluating patterns of sex-biased movement tendencies.

Inorganic arsenic exposure and neuropsychological development of children of 4-5 years of age living in Spain	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Urinary arsenic species; Inorganic arsenic; Children; Neuropsychological development; Dietary arsenic; Developmental toxicology; Neurodevelopment; Environment; McCarthy scales of Children's abilities	URINARY-EXCRETION; GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION; SEAFOOD INTAKE; DIMETHYLARSINATE; NEUROTOXICITY; METABOLISM; WATER; RICE; ARSENOBETAINE; CONSEQUENCES	Early-life exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) may adversely impact health later in life. To date, evidence of iAs adverse effects on children's neurodevelopment comes mainly from populations highly exposed to contaminated water with conflicting results. Little is known about those effects among populations with low iAs exposure from food intake. We investigated the cross-sectional association between exposure to iAs and neurodevelopment scores among children living in Spain whose main route of exposure was diet. Arsenic species concentrations in urine from 400 children was determined, and the sum of urinary iAs, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid was used to estimate iAs exposure. The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities was used to assess children's neuropsychological development at about 4-5 years of age. The median (interquartile range) of children's sum of urinary iAs, MMA, and DMA was 4.85 (2.74-7.54) mu g/L, and in adjusted linear regression analyses the natural logarithm transformed concentrations showed an inverse association with children's motor functions (beta, [95% confidence interval]; global scores (-2.29, [-3.95, -0.63])), gross scores (-1.92, [-3.52, -0.31]) and fine scores (-1.54, [-3.06, -0.03]). In stratified analyses by sex, negative associations were observed with the scores in the quantitative index (-2.59, [-5.36, 0.17]) and working memory function (-2.56, [-5.36, 0.24]) only in boys. Our study suggests that relatively low iAs exposure may impair children's neuropsychological development and that sex-related differences may be present in susceptibility to iAs related effects; however, our findings should be interpreted with caution given the possibility of residual confounding.

This is important as most measuring stations are on roofs, but patient exposure is at ground level. Our study used a big data approach to estimate the near-ground vertical profile of pollen concentrations based on a global study of paired stations located at different heights. We analyzed paired sampling stations located at different heights between 1.5 and 50 m above ground level (AGL). This provided pollen data from 59 Hirst-type volumetric traps from 25 different areas, mainly in Europe, but also covering North America and Australia, resulting in about 2,000,000 daily pollen concentrations analyzed. The daily ratio of the amounts of pollen from different heights per location was used, and the values of the lower station were divided by the higher station. The lower station of paired traps recorded more pollen than the higher trap. However, while the effect of height on pollen concentration was clear, it was also limited (average ratio 1.3, range 0.7-2.2). The standard deviation of the pollen ratio was highly variable when the lower station was located close to the ground level (below 10 m AGL). We show that pollen concentrations measured at > 10 m are representative for background near-ground levels.

A direct comparison between 2D and low-cost 3D shape analysis using African cichlid mandibles	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Statistical power; 3D Morphometrics	GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS; GENETIC-BASIS; MEASUREMENT ERROR; LANDMARK DATA; EVOLUTION; DIVERGENCE; TRAIT; SIZE	Shape is a complex trait which can be investigated through a variety of methods that have been developed over the past century. Currently, ecologists and evolutionary biologists employ the use of geometric morphometrics on 2D images as their standard approach. Recently, there has been increased interest in the use of 3D methods. However, while low-cost 3D methods of data collection are becoming available their potential benefits are often more implied rather than quantified. Using the mandibles from two species of African cichlids (Maylandia zebra and Tropheops Red Cheek), this study aimed to evaluate the use of a low-cost 3D method of shape capture versus a range of 2D data sets (termed standard', even', and extended'). Our findings indicated that while both 2D and 3D methods could discriminate differences in species and sexes there was only a slight improvement using 3D when landmark datasets were held even. Further, the standard approaches to data collection that would be taken by most researchers clearly outperformed our 3D approach. Therefore, as 3D methods become more accessible researchers should consider a cost/benefit ratio in terms of the time required to obtain 3D data versus shape information gained.	[McWhinnie, K.

Trophic ecomorphology of cichlid fishes of Selva Lacandona, Usumacinta, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Cichlidae; Diet breadth; Diet overlap; Functional ecology; Morphometrics; Neotropics	PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; NICHE CONSERVATISM; TROPICAL STREAM; FEEDING ECOLOGY; DIVERSITY; DIVERSIFICATION; MORPHOLOGY; ASSEMBLAGES; EVOLUTION; RIVER	Neotropical cichlids exhibit great diversity of morphological traits associated with feeding, locomotion, and habitat use. We examined the relationship between functional traits and diet by analyzing a dataset for 14 cichlid species from rivers in the Selva Lacandona region, Usumacinta Basin, Chiapas, Mexico. Volumetric proportions of ingested food items were used to calculate diet breath and interspecific dietary overlap. Morphometric analysis was performed using 24 traits associated with feeding. Associations between morphological and dietary components were assessed using canonical correspondence analysis. The most common feeding guilds were omnivore, herbivore and carnivore (the latter consuming invertebrates and/or fish), with detritivores represented by relatively few species and strict piscivore by one species. Dietary overlap was highest among carnivores (P. friedrichsthalii and T. salvini), herbivores (C. intermedium and C. pearsei) and detritivore-herbivores (V. melanura and K. ufermanni). Dietary components were strongly correlated with several morphological traits, confirming patterns observed in other cichlids. For example, jaw protrusion and mandible length were positively correlated with consumption of fish and terrestrial invertebrates. A longer gut and a wider tooth plate on the lower pharyngeal jaw were correlated with ingestion of vegetation, algae and detritus. Findings confirmed a high degree of trophic specialization in certain species as well as interspecific divergence of functional traits associated with feeding among cichlids of the Usumacinta Basin, which is consistent with the idea that Middle American cichlids represent an adaptive radiation.

It is common that in this process, a species will change its diet based on resource availability. This is the case in the Salto Caxias reservoir, Iguacu River, where five Astyanax species presented changes in their diets after damming. The present study aimed to evaluate possible changes in the feeding activity and condition factor of five sympatric species of Astyanax in the Salto Caxias reservoir in different areas impacted by damming. Sampling was carried out before and after damming the Salto Caxias reservoir. The fish feeding activity and nutritional status were inferred by the mean stomach repletion index and the mean condition factor, respectively. Most of the studied species showed a general decrease in feeding activity and condition factor. Both studied regions, the upstream region and the dam region, presented changes in the analyzed factors. These observations suggest that regardless of diet changes, nutritional status is negatively impacted in altered environments. The nutritional deficit occurs (i) if the diet is altered due to adaptive limitations on the use of the available resources and (ii) if the diet remains unaltered due to the scarcity of the preferred feeding resource. Such decreases might lead to reductions in the population size due to limitations on growth and reproduction until the environment feeding resources can sustain those populations.

Recently, ecologists have shown growing concern in accounting for intraspecific variation in trait-based metrics. Besides intraspecific variation, plants and animals exhibit functional trait variation within the same individual (within-individual variation), which may exceed intraspecific variation and constitute a functional trait itself, influencing ecosystem functioning through individual performance variation. However, the role of within-individual variation in functional diversity (FD) remains unexplored. Here, we used sequential foraging observations of four bird species to quantify the magnitudes of interspecific, intraspecific and within-individual functional trait (foraging item, maneuver and stratum) variation. Then, we estimated functional richness using different hierarchical levels of increasing data resolution: (1) average trait values (based on our own literature search, on a global dataset, on the first observation of each foraging sequence and on complete foraging sequences), (2) average trait values plus intraspecific trait variation, and (3) average trait values plus intraspecific and within-individual trait variation. We also performed a series of simulations accounting for different levels of within-individual trait variation. For the empirical data, both intraspecific and within-individual variation accounted for more than 84% of total variation in functional traits, and for one trait (foraging maneuver) within-individual variation accounted for 84.31%. Although all FD metrics showed significant positive correlations, their magnitude consistently decreased when intraspecific and within-individual variations were taken into account (Pearson's correlations from 0.99 to 0.28). Simulations also showed that not accounting for within-individual variation strikingly underestimated functional richness, even at the lowest levels (< 5%) of within-individual variation. Our results reveal that within-individual variation may represent a major source of functional trait variation. Overall, the inclusion of within-individual variation in trait-based approaches would improve our understanding and use of FD estimators and determine to what extent it matters for assembly processes.

Surrogate species, serving as proxies for the presence or ecological requirements of other species, have thus been proposed in a variety of conceptual approaches, all requiring the selection of representative species on which conservation efforts will be focused. Yet, apart from their inherent ecological limitations, surrogate species approaches often suffer from methodological issues with selection criteria being ill-defined and selection procedures solely expert-based, which makes them irreproducible and prone to bias. We used a niche-based selection algorithm to identify a set of faunal focal species for promoting biodiversity in temperate forests, using the state of Baden-Wurttemberg (Southwestern Germany) as example region. Based on a literature-based categorization of each species' resource requirements we identified - from candidate species of five taxonomic groups - species sets that represented all predefined forest structural components with the most sensitive species. In addition, we examined the effect of variance introduced by expert scoring (of bird species' sensitivity) on the stability of set composition. Candidate species were defined for mammals (N = 24), birds (27), herpetofauna (17), diurnal butterflies (36) and saproxylic beetles (36). The resulting focal-species sets consisted of six (herpetofauna) up to thirteen (diurnal butterflies) species, representing the main forest structural requirements of the faunal forest community at different spatial scales. Non-metric multidimensional scaling showed that the "resource-space" covered by the selected species, both of the multi-taxon and the taxon-specific sets, encompassed the one of the non-selected candidate species, except for mammals. Differences in expert scoring had a major effect on set composition, but dissimilarity between sets decreased with an increasing number of included experts and reached convergence after considering the scoring of 10 and more persons. Niche-based species selection proved valuable for systematic surrogate selection, as it requires a clear definition of the conservation-targets and environmental components to be represented by the surrogate set. The selected algorithm helps objectifying the selection process according to predefined criteria, which can be flexibly chosen so as to maximize different traits (e.g. sensitivity, flagship-characteristics) in the resulting surrogate set. However, given the high sensitivity, expert scoring (where necessary) should never be based on only one or a few experts. Our proposed sensitivity analysis can help identifying the minimal number of experts required for reaching stability in set composition.

Taxonomic harmonization may reveal a stronger association between diatom assemblages and total phosphorus in large datasets	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Bioassessment; Diatoms; Random forest; Taxonomic inconsistency; Total phosphorus; Intercalibration; Data harmonization	ALGAL METRICS; NUTRIENT; VARIABILITY; RIVERS; TAXA	Diatom data have been collected in large-scale biological assessments in the United States, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA). However, the effectiveness of diatoms as indicators may suffer if inconsistent taxon identifications across different analysts obscure the relationships between assemblage composition and environmental variables. To reduce these inconsistencies, we harmonized the 2008-2009 NRSA data from nine analysts by updating names to current synonyms and by statistically identifying taxa with high analyst signal (taxa with more variation in relative abundance explained by the analyst factor, relative to environmental variables). We then screened a subset of samples with QA/QC data and combined taxa with mismatching identifications by the primary and secondary analysts. When these combined "slash groups" did not reduce analyst signal, we elevated taxa to the genus level or omitted taxa in difficult species complexes. We examined the variation explained by analyst in the original and revised datasets. Further, we examined how revising the datasets to reduce analyst signal can reduce inconsistency, thereby uncovering the variation in assemblage composition explained by total phosphorus (TP), an environmental variable of high priority for water managers. To produce a revised dataset with the greatest taxonomic consistency, we ultimately made 124 slash groups, omitted 7 taxa in the small naviculoid (e.g., Sellaphora atomoides) species complex, and elevated Nitzschia, Diploneis, and Tryblionella taxa to the genus level. Relative to the original dataset, the revised dataset had more overlap among samples grouped by analyst in ordination space, less variation explained by the analyst factor, and more than double the variation in assemblage composition explained by TP. Elevating all taxa to the genus level did not eliminate analyst signal completely, and analyst remained the most important predictor for the genera Sellaphora, Mayamaea, and Psammodictyon, indicating that these taxa present the greatest obstacle to consistent identification in this dataset. Although our process did not completely remove analyst signal, this work provides a method to minimize analyst signal and improve detection of diatom association with TP in large datasets involving multiple analysts. Examination of variation in assemblage data explained by analyst and taxonomic harmonization may be necessary steps for improving data quality and the utility of diatoms as indicators of environmental variables.

Using a probabilistic sampling survey design, we were able to make unbiased estimates of biological condition of macroinvertebrate communities throughout the state based on 346 sites sampled from 2009 to 2012. Results from randomly sampled sites were classified as either good, fair, poor in comparison with 75 regional reference sites that were sampled concurrently. We determined that approximately 34 percent of stream kilometers assessed were in poor biological condition as measured with a multi-metric index, the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity. Additionally, we evaluated a variety of chemical and physical habitat stressors known to negatively influence macroinvertebrate communities and determined that poor substrate conditions were the most prevalent and important stressors impacting stream macroinvertebrates, with relative bed stability and percent sand/fines being the most prevalent. A relative risk/attributable risk analysis suggests that improving physical habitat conditions in streams, most notably a reduction in percent sand/fines, will have the greatest impact for improving biological condition for macroinvertebrate communities. It is estimated that approximately 60% of stream kilometers now classified as in poor biological condition in Washington could be improved by reducing the amount of percent sand/fines in the substrate. These results are consistent with those obtained from EPA's national stream surveys and suggest that poor habitat conditions are the most prevalent stressors impacting stream macroinvertebrates in Washington State.

However, there are few studies analyzing contrasting topographical conditions on the relative importance of species to ecosystem functioning, mainly on those who have a greater contribution (i.e., hyperdominant species). We aimed to evaluate whether contrasting topographical conditions determine changes in tree species richness, community composition, and the number of stem and biomass hyperdominant species in a Brazilian Atlantic remnant forest fragment. We selected two areas on distinct hillsides with contrasting topographic conditions, at the biological reserve of the Federal University of Vicosa, Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil. Each area (100x100 m) was sub-divided into 100 plots of 10x10 m. From each plot, all trees having diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 10 cm were identified to the species level and tagged for measurement. We measured three topographic variables (slope, elevation, and convexity) in each plot, based on the assumption that these variables may affect tree species diversity, species composition, and ecosystem function (aboveground biomass). The AGB of individual stems was calculated in all plots. We performed a multivariate regression tree for estimating topographical heterogeneity in each area. We found that species richness differed significantly between areas. Species richness in the Northeast area (the more topographically heterogeneous one) was 48% higher than that in the Southeast area, which is less topographically heterogeneous. The tree species composition varied considerably between areas, with similar AGB patterns being registered among plots. The number of stem hyperdominants varied significantly between areas. In the Southeast area, only two species out of the 85 recorded (2.38%) accounted for 50% of the number of stems hyperdominants, while in the Northeast area 10 species (7.94%) accounted for 50% of stems hyperdominants. Our results showed that high topographic heterogeneity induces high species richness and that the number of stem and biomass hyperdominant species increase along with richness on a local scale. Based on our results, we presume that biomass hyperdominance can also strongly influence forest ecosystem functioning on a local scale.

Linear regression models assume that the relation between soil EC and environmental covariates is constant over the area to be predicted. This is problematic at the regional scale, at which some of the regression parameters may indeed be globally constant, whereas others may vary locally. Moreover, model residuals often exhibit spatial dependence, which invalidates the ordinary least squares linear regression. This study examined the combination of a mixed geographically weighted regression model with simple kriging of the residuals (MGWGK) for mapping soil EC in the Heihe River Basin, an inland river basin in arid northwest China. We compared the performance of MGWRK with those of multiple linear regression (MLR), regression kriging (RK), geographically weighted regression (GWR), geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK) and mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR). Environmental covariates were developed from spatial information on topography, climate, vegetation, and geographic position. A ten-fold cross-validation was applied to evaluate predictive accuracy of the various methods. Soil EC ranged from 0.031 to 182.100 dS m(-1), exhibiting a contrasting distribution of soil EC in the upper, middle, and lower river reaches. The MGWRK method outperformed other methods. The effects of different environmental covariates on soil EC were revealed by the fixed and geographically varying parameters of MGWRK. The nugget-to-sill ratios of fitted variogram models all fell between 25 and 32%, exhibiting moderate spatial autocorrelation of models residuals. Predictive accuracy was improved by MGWRK, as the spatial dependence of model residuals were included in the prediction. When selecting an optimal linear regression model, covariates should be tested to see if they are constant (as in MLR) or spatially varying (as in GWR) or semi-varying (as in MGWR), and model residuals should be tested for spatial dependence (as in MGWRK).

To avoid further biodiversity losses, landscape planning and ecosystem management could benefit from a condensed measure that tracks regional and cumulative ecological degradation from past and ongoing landscape changes. The affected species communities can be described spatially explicit by biotopes. A vulnerability map of biotopes will identify areas with a high potential to be adversely affected and a low capacity to recover. These vulnerability hot spots may require specific protection and maintenance interventions to be sustained. Following the interdisciplinary vulnerability concept, an indicator set related to landscape change was developed for the biotopes of the biosphere reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (Germany), which have been mapped as vector data according to the Brandenburg mapping key. The indicator set was structured into indicators of biotope exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It covered patch metrics, like the size, the fractal dimension, and the amount of similar patches in the surrounding of each patch, as well as class metrics, like the mesh size, the state of endangerment and the average dispersal range of each biotope type. The resulting vulnerability index covered a biotope area of around 130,000 ha, and the study area could be extended readily. European biotopes are already mapped and monitored across large areas, primarily for nature conservation purposes. The biotope vulnerability index developed within this study is intended for application at large spatial scales and has the potential for a straightforward transfer to biotope maps from other German federal states and European regions.

Invertebrates can be used as biological indicators to provide information on soil health. Mites (Arachnida: Acariformes, Parasitiformes) constitute the majority of invertebrates in soil; however, their small size and diversity make them a challenging group to identify. Identification to levels coarser than species (e.g., genus, family) can alleviate some of the taxonomic difficulties. Here we test whether two groups of soil mites, Mesostigmata and Oribatida, can indicate three disturbance types (fire, forest harvest and linear features such as seismic lines and roads) in the boreal forest in northern Alberta. We assessed this at three taxonomic levels: species, genus and family. Samples were collected by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute from 2010 to 2015 from across Alberta. We paired disturbed sites with nearby undisturbed sites while minimizing habitat and temporal differences (N pairs: fire = 13, harvest = 11, linear = 7). Mesostigmata were separated into two size categories, large only (> 300 mu m) and with small included (all mites > 50 mu m), while oribatid were analyzed only with individuals > 300 mu m. We used ANOVAs and PERMANOVAs to determine whether species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and assemblage structure differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Compared to undisturbed habitats, we found that richness and diversity of Mesostigmata > 50 mu m were lower with fire disturbance at all three taxonomic levels; similarly, richness and diversity of Oribatida were lower with fire and harvest at all three taxonomic levels and richness was lower for linear disturbance at family-level. Assemblage structure of Mesostigmata > 50 mu m indicated fire and linear disturbance at all three taxonomic levels, while that of Mesostigmata > 300 mu m indicated all three-disturbance types at species-level, and harvest disturbance at genus and family. Assemblage structure of Oribatida indicated fire disturbance at all three taxonomic levels, and linear disturbance at genus and family. Our analyses showed that mesostigmatid and oribatid mites can indicate disturbance when identified to ranks coarser than species suggests that labour-intensive species-level identifications may not always be required for bioindicator studies using soil mites. The generality of these findings should be assessed in different regions and with different disturbances.

Soil variability affects confidence in the use of common agroecosystem soil indicators	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Agroecosystem; Carbon; Estimation; Multi-functionality; Power analysis; Sampling intensity; Scaling up; Soil indicator; Spatial variation; Woody vegetation	MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CARBON	There is a need for accurate and easily-measured indicators suitable for characterising and monitoring agroecosystem multi-functionality. This is particularly true in intensively-farmed landscapes where it is of interest to quantify the role of small, woody vegetation features in providing ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. However, soil variability introduced by natural and management processes can interact with sampling designs to result in inappropriate sampling intensities and high levels of uncertainty in measured indicators. This can have consequences for upscaling of ecosystem quantities and decision making. Here, we present results from a pilot study aimed at quantifying and understanding variation in ten common indicators of soil condition and function, within shelterbelt and adjacent field soils, at four dryland sheep farms in Canterbury, New Zealand. Our results demonstrate a high level of spatially-structured soil variability, driven by (1) the effects of woody vegetation on shelterbelt soils relative to field soils, (2) differences in underlying soil types among sites, and (3) possible effects of grazing animals within fields. This soil variability had clear knock-on impacts for appropriate sampling effort, depending on the soil indicator in question, the original soil sampling density, and whether the aim was to estimate population mean values or to detect differences among sites with confidence. On the whole, confidence in soil indicator estimates was highest for soil condition indicators (pH, soil moisture, bulk density), variable for carbon quantities, depending on the measure used, and lowest for soil biological process indicators (tea bag index decomposition rate, bait lamina probe micro-invertebrate activity, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity); estimation confidence was also mostly lower for shelterbelt soils due to the effect of woody roots and inputs on soil variability. Based on our results, we present indicative sample size requirements to estimate population means for these different soil indicators. Ultimately, we advocate for the use of pilot studies, such as the one presented here, to facilitate understanding of variability in soil function indicators within different agroecosystems, and how this variability is partitioned spatially within and among vegetated features.

However, measures used to quantify structure of forests are scale-variant, as they rely on bounded observations on either ecological or forest inventory observation units. The understanding of the influence of the scale of observation in mapping of forest structural heterogeneity is limited. Therefore, we researched into effects of plot size on quantifying forest structural heterogeneity, where we describe heterogeneity by three indices in stands under different management systems. In addition, we studied the performance of structural indices in separating different forest management systems across plot sizes, and created wall to wall maps of the indices using airborne LiDAR metrics describing the vertical distribution of canopy heights at different scales of observation. The studied indices are: Gini Coefficient (GC), Structural Complexity Index (SCI), and Enhanced Structural Complexity Index (ESCI). SCI and ESCI require fully mapped plots whereas GC has no information on individual tree locations. Inventory data from 95 one-hectare plots covering a range of management intensities from un-managed to age class forests were used. We quantified the three structural indices for 18 plot sizes ranging from 225 m(2) to 10,000 m(2). Linear fixed effects models were used to study the effects of plot sizes in different levels of structural heterogeneity and Random Forest (RF) models used to provide wall-to-wall maps at varying scales from airborne LiDAR data. The simulation showed that all indices were influenced by the scale of observation with larger effects for plots in forests with higher structural heterogeneity. For the data analyzed we found a threshold scale for enumerating stand structural heterogeneity between 900 m(2) and 2500 m(2). However, stable field and remote sensing predictions of stand structural heterogeneity required plots at least >= 2500 m(2). Compared to GC, SCI and ESCI improved separation of forest structure in the three management systems and at all observed scales. A change of plot sizes affected bivariate relationships between structural indices and air-borne LiDAR metrics as well as the resultant predictive models. Smaller plot sizes yielded weaker relationships and predictive models. All structure indices were predicted from airborne LiDAR with RMSE <= 22% at scales equal or larger than the identified threshold plot size. These findings are relevant to optimize plot sizes for efficient inventory and mapping of forest structural heterogeneity, as well as for the design of natural resource inventories. Additionally, derived maps are useful for studies on forest structure and the link with forest growth, degradation, management intensity, productivity, and biodiversity in the regions.

However, FQA validation to confirm that results represent actual wetland condition is limited. Moreover, FQA has been applied across large regions without consideration for the high environmental variability (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and topography) within application areas, which may limit the effectiveness of FQA as an assessment tool. Because Oklahoma contains diverse ecoregions and extreme environmental gradients, this provides an opportunity to examine the influence of spatial and environmental variability on FQA results. We sampled 68 depressional wetlands dispersed across the state to (1) validate an FQA metric, Floristic Quality Index (FQI), with two established condition assessment methods (i.e., Landscape Development Intensity Index [LDI] and Oklahoma Rapid Assessment Method [OKRAM]) and (2) evaluate the influence of environmental variation (e.g., high and low precipitation) on FQI scores. In our validation analysis, we found a strong positive relationship between FQI and OKRAM, indicating the FQI was able to detect changes in wetland condition in depressional wetlands along a disturbance gradient. Additionally, strong negative relationships between FQI and LDI suggest that FQI is responsive to stressors within the surrounding landscape. When evaluating environmental influence on FQI scores, we found substantial variation between reference wetlands based on location, with higher scores occurring in eastern sites (high precipitation) and lower scores occurring in western sites (low precipitation). We used Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to assess the relationship between plant communities and environmental variables, and found that precipitation was more indicative of plant species distribution than wetland condition (i.e., disturbed or reference condition). Thus, C-values of plant species (i.e., predetermined values assigned to individual plant species) and corresponding FQI scores differed significantly across ecoregions based on high and low precipitation, regardless of wetland condition. This phenomenon highlights the importance of considering regional environmental differences when developing FQI thresholds for wetland assessments, especially across diverse states or ecoregions. To reduce the influence of regional differences on FQIs, as well as other vegetation-based methods, condition class thresholds and reference criteria should be established based on ecoregions to more accurately capture wetland condition using FQI.

A global meta-analysis	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Formicidae; Similarity index; Response ratio; Assembly rules; Plantation	SPECIES RICHNESS; ATLANTIC FOREST; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; BIOINDICATORS; DIVERSITY; RECOVERY; TAXA	The development of easily observable measures of restoration success is essential for monitoring of the ambitious proposed global restoration targets (e.g. The Bonn Challenge; New York Declaration on Forests). Systematic reviews with meta-analyses are a good way to evaluate the performance of different organisms in the monitoring of ecological restoration. Among the arthropods, ants have a long history in environmental monitoring. We compiled a data set and performed a global meta-analysis encompassing studies conducted in different ecosystems around the world to investigate whether richness and composition of species or functional groups (FG) of ant communities can be predicted during the restoration process. Moreover, we aimed to understand the influence of restoration technique (natural regeneration or active restoration), ecosystem type (temperate or tropical), and past land use (mining or pasture) on ant communities in areas undergoing restoration processes. Notwithstanding the varied conditions in which the studies were carried out, our meta-analysis showed that reestablishment of ant FG takes place more quickly than species richness. The recovery of ant diversity is faster in tropical ecosystems and areas under natural regeneration can have higher ant diversity than the reference areas. In temperate ecosystems, mined areas under restoration are less likely to recover the number of species than FG richness. Both species and FG composition were less predictable in our meta-analysis. As the publication of new datasets is increasing, we hope that future meta-analyses can build on the present study to further describe and understand the patterns in ant communities to be used as indicators of ecosystem restoration.

Influence of salinity on relative density of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus) in Everglades National Park: Implications for restoration of Everglades ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Florida Bay; Spotlight surveys; Detection probability; Indicator species; Estuaries	SPOTLIGHT COUNTS; MARK-RECAPTURE; ABUNDANCE; FLORIDA; POPULATION; MODELS; ALLIGATORS; WARINESS; SIZE	The status of the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) has long been a matter of concern in Everglades National Park (ENP) due to its classification as a federal and state listed species, its recognition as a flagship species, and its function as an ecosystem indicator. Survival and recovery of American crocodiles has been linked with regional hydrological conditions, especially freshwater flow to estuaries, which affect water levels and salinities. We hypothesize that efforts to restore natural function to Everglades ecosystems by improving water delivery into estuaries within ENP will change salinities and water levels which in turn will affect relative density of crocodiles. Monitoring ecological responses of indicator species, such as crocodiles, with respect to hydrologic change is necessary to evaluate ecosystem responses to restoration projects. Our objectives were to monitor trends in crocodile relative density within ENP and to determine influences of salinity on relative density of crocodiles. We examined count data from 12 years of crocodile spotlight surveys in ENP (2004-2015) and used a hierarchical model of relative density that estimated relative density with probability of detection. The mean predicted value for relative density (lambda) across all surveys was 2.9 individuals/km (95% CI: 2.0-4.2); relative density was estimated to decrease with increases in salinity. Routes in ENP's Flamingo/Cape Sable area had greater crocodile relative density than routes in the West Lake/Cuthbert Lake area and Northeast Florida Bay areas. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that restored flow and lower salinities will result in an increase in crocodile population size and provide support for the ecosystem management recommendations for crocodiles, which currently are to restore more natural patterns of freshwater flow to Florida Bay. Thus, monitoring relative density of American crocodiles will continue to be an effective indicator of ecological response to ecosystem restoration.

Here we examined historical time series of delta C-13 and delta N-15 in remains of individual invertebrate taxa representing pelagic, littoral and benthic habitats during the 20th century in five boreal lakes of central Canada. We applied a novel statistical approach based on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to quantify the differences in centennial means and trends (i) between invertebrate remains and sedimentary organic matter (SOM), and (ii) among different taxa within each lake to evaluate the coherence of isotope signals during the 20th century. Differences in mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 were usually significant (p < 0.05) between SOM and invertebrate taxa, and among individual taxa, reflecting selective feeding by invertebrates and differences in trophic position within food webs. In contrast, patterns of historical variance in isotope values varied among lakes with few consistent differences between long-term isotopic trends of SOM and invertebrate remains. In particular, SOM and invertebrate isotopic trends were similar in relatively dystrophic lakes, likely due to the importance of terrestrial carbon in both SOM and invertebrate diets. However, significant SOM-invertebrate trend differences were observed for both delta C-13 and delta N-15 in relatively clear-water lakes, possibly reflecting temporal variation in diets or tissue fractionation. Comparisons of historical trends in isotope values among taxa revealed few consistent patterns, likely indicating uncoupled carbon and nitrogen fluxes through invertebrate consumers with different habitat specializations or feeding modes. Together, our findings suggest that evaluation of taxon-specific delta C-13 and delta N-15 can provide valuable insights into historical tropho-dynamics in lake food webs.	[Anas, M. U.

Size, ornamentation, and flight feather morphology promote within-pair paternity in a sexually dimorphic passerine	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Cuckoldry; Sexual selection; Flight performance; Asymmetry; Color; Tyrannus forficatus	DELAYED PLUMAGE MATURATION; FEMALE MATE CHOICE; EXTRA-PAIR; FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; TREE SWALLOWS; BIRDS; SELECTION; TAIL; AGE; EVOLUTION	Morphology in sexually dimorphic species is related to increased opportunity for sexual selection when traits reflect individual quality. In socially monogamous species, it may function to increase variance in reproductive success if exaggerated traits are related to the opportunity to engage in extra-pair paternity (EPP). Nonetheless, it is poorly understood if ornamental versus functional traits are differentially related to the distribution of paternity across individuals. We examined EPP in the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), a sexually dimorphic suboscine passerine, to determine how flight feather morphology (both ornamental and related to flight performance), ornamental coloration, and flight performance were related to paternity for males and females. We assessed paternity at 140 nests across 7years and found that 73% of nests contained extra-pair young with 59% of nestlings resulted from extra-pair fertilizations. Males that secured paternity with their social mate had larger size (wing chord and tail length), better body condition, and more exaggerated ornamental traits (color, primary notch, and streamer length) than cuckolded males. When compared directly to the social males they cuckolded, however, cuckolders had shorter primary notches and had duller coloration. Elongated flight feather features were associated with greater maneuverability during flight, and longer primary notches and tail streamers were associated with maintenance of within-pair paternity, possibly via flight displays. Females that cuckolded their mates had less exaggerated flank coloration but better body condition than those that did not. We posit that in this system, there is a lack of strong selection on extra-pair mate morphology; rather, high-quality males maintained WPP while females in good condition were more likely to cuckold social males of poorer quality, signaling a role of reciprocal selection in extra-pair mate choice. Determinants of the frequency and extent of extra-pair paternity are central to our conception of mating systems, population genetics, and sexual selection. Morphological determinants can influence faithfulness to a mate and are a key aspect of locomotion, limiting or enhancing an individual's ability to interact with others. We examined how ornamental (coloration and tail streamers) and functional traits involved in flight (wing and tail structure) correlated with cuckoldry. Male condition, size, and ornamental traits were negatively associated with cuckoldry; yet, social males were cuckolded by males of poorer quality. Flight feather characteristics were positively associated both with flight performance and maintenance of paternity, suggesting a role of flight in cuckoldry. Female body condition was related to cuckoldry and perhaps indicates reciprocal choice by males for healthy extra-pair mates. We posit a lack of strong selection on extra-pair mate morphology in this system; rather, high-quality males maintained WPP while females were more likely to cuckold social males of poorer quality.

Microclimatic variations and their effects on photosynthetic efficiencies and lichen species distribution along elevational gradients in Garhwal Himalayas	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Chlorophyll fluorescence; Microclimate; Photochemical quenching; Photosynthetic plasticity; Species richness; Climate change; Western Himalayas	CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; LOBARIA-PULMONARIA; VASCULAR PLANTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EPIPHYTIC LICHENS; RICHNESS PATTERNS; MOISTURE-CONTENT; NATIONAL-PARK; GLOBAL CHANGE	Climate change effects on Himalayas are expectedly more pronounced than any other mountainous ecoregion of the world with expected threat of meltdown by the year 2100 if effective checks are not imposed. The impacts of this climate warming in the geologically fragile Himalayas has started to show its effects on shifting precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, glaciers meltdown, species richness patterns and overall unpredictable microclimatic conditions. For measuring such impacts of current climate warming in Himalayan ecosystems, need of ecological substitutes has been stressed on by different United Nation conventions. Lichens in contrast to vascular flora have long been proved to act as cost effective global indicators for measuring ecosystems responses to environmental climate. The variations in microclimatic attributes and their effects on photosynthetic efficiency and distribution were studied in geologically fragile ecosystem of Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Garhwal Himalayas. Total 217 species of lichens comprising 80 genera and 35 families were found along different elevations. Among the different habitat groups, corticolous lichens showed their dominance (123 species) followed by saxicolous (65 species) and terricolous (29 species) lichens. Corticolous forms were dominated by crustose while saxicolous and terricolous were mostly fruticose growth forms. Mostly large number of species showed a narrow distribution with maximum species richness observed in mid elevation zones (1950-2200m) followed by a gradual decline towards higher elevations. Phaeophyscia hispidula, Parmotrema reticulatum and Flavoparmelia caperata showed wider ecological amplitude. Out of these species, P. hispidula and F. caperata were further subjected to chlorophyll fluorescence measurements with a pulse amplified modulated fluorometer to access photosynthetic quenching efficiencies. Maximum electron transport rates (ETR; 96 +/- 5.76mole(-) m(-2)s(-1)) were observed in Phaeophyscia hispidula (1550m) while F. caperata showed nearly 21% lower ETR. Photochemical quenching (qP; 0.5 +/- 0.01) was maximum at 1550m elevation in F. caperata while P. hispidula showed maximum qP values at 2200m elevation, showing it's higher tolerances towards extreme light stresses. F. caperata showed higher (0.102 +/- 0.003) non photochemical quenching (NPQ) in comparison to P. hispidula (0.062 +/- 0.001) at extreme elevations of 3508m. P. hispidula overall showed more toxitolerant nature towards abiotic stresses as compared to F. caperata. Higher photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 1600-2350 mu molm(-2)s(-1)), thallus hydration levels and extreme variations in air temperature (5.75-31.65 degrees C), ambient humidity along elevations were imperative in controlling species richness, distribution and photosynthetic quenching of lichen flora in the region.

We established eleven altitudinal transects in high altitude region of western Himalaya, six of which represented north aspect and the rest represented south aspect. In each transect, vegetation was sampled randomly at every 200m elevation to estimate species rarity, niche width and different FD indices [community-weighted mean traits (CWM), functional richness (FRic), functional divergence (FDiv), functional dispersion (FDis) and functional specificity (FSpe)]. These indices indicate resource utilization, competition for resources, optimal plant strategies, and presence of functionally specialist species. We found a total of 418 plant species, most of which were having narrow niche and distribution. Proportion of species with narrow niche was high at higher elevations, 36.5% species were rare with 17% of them being endemic to Himalaya. At south aspect, lower values of CWM plant height along with lower FRic, FDiv, FDis, and FSpe were recorded. Further, CWM plant height, FRic, FDiv, FDis and FSpe significantly decreased with increasing elevation. Influence of gradients of aridity (aspect) and decreasing temperature (elevation) on species distribution and FD suggest that functioning of high altitude communities is very likely to be affected in future. Our findings therefore emphasize that the plant communities present at higher elevations are more vulnerable under climate change.

Here we considered East district of Sikkim state in the Eastern Himalaya to study plant richness pattern of vascular plants along an elevation gradient of 500-3300m at 100, 200 and 300m elevation steps. The study evaluates species-area relationships along the elevation gradient, spread over four major forest types i.e., low (tropical to sub-tropical, up to 900m), middle (subtropical, 750-1500m), upper (wet temperate, 1500-2700m) and Rhododendron-Conifer Zone (cold temperate/sub-alpine, 2700-3600m) with 664 species from 367 genera and 131 families. Pteridium aquilinum was found to be the most diverse species occurring in all 28-elevation steps along 500-3300m, followed by Polystichum lentum, Polygonum runcinatum and Nephrolepis cordifolia those occured in 23 elevation steps. In general, a hump shaped pattern was observed for plant richness of all life forms along the elevation gradient. The peaks became prominent, with the increase in scale of extent from 100m (R-2=50%) to 300m (R-2=78%) through 200m (R-2=55%) elevation steps, using 2nd order polynomial fitting. The reduction in tree height and richness was noticed beyond 2300m allowing dominance of herbs owing to climatic constraints. Using generalized additive model, temperature could explain the maximum deviance of>47%. Soil explained 36.4% deviance, followed by precipitation (21.6% deviance) inthe plant richness. However, the ecotone effect of different forest types explained the mid-elevation peaks in plant richness more prominentlythan the geographic area availability. Further, inclusion of disturbance and biotic interactions may improve ecological understandings on the plant richness pattern along the elevation gradient.

In the present study, we explore the potential of satellite datasets in identifying the patterns in species richness in part of three global biodiversity hotspots falling in India viz., Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats. We used generalized linear models to correlate remote sensing based vegetation indices (VIs) and physiographic indices (PIs) with plant richness calculated using 1264, 1114, and 1004 field plots across 21 different forest vegetation classes in Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats respectively. Three different vegetation indices ranked highest in explaining the variance in plant richness in the three hotspots. The variance in species richness explained by models based on only VIs was highest (69%, P<0.01) for Bamboo vegetation in Indo Burma hotspot with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, followed by that for dry deciduous forest in Western Ghats (57%, P<0.001) with Normalized Difference Water Index, and for grasslands (54%, P<0.05) in Himalaya by Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index. The explained variance increased with combined models that are based on PIs and VIs to up to 85% (P<0.05). Overall, we observed very high correlation between VIs and plant richness in open canopy vegetation classes with low species richness such as grasslands, scrubs, and dry deciduous forests, followed by vegetation classes with moderately dense canopy. Our study provides crucial insights on utility of satellite datasets as a proxy for estimating plant richness for better conservation of diverse ecosystems.	[Chitale, V.

Here we assessed harmony in plant invasions of two perennial exotic species of similar origin and naturalised in India, i.e., Chromolaena odorata and Tridax procumbens. Predictions made for the current condition was subsequently projected for the years 2050 and 2100 for both moderate and extreme climate change scenarios. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) was applied to assess their habitat suitability, risk area identification and shifts in range sizes. The distribution of C. odorata could mostly depend on temperature and moisture availability; and invade the biodiversity-rich regions of India viz., the Eastern Ghats, the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalaya and the north-eastern regions. The prevalence of T. procumbens in central regions of India could demonstrate its greater dependencies on precipitation seasonality and radiation than that on temperature. These discrepancies in climatic dependencies allowed both for a harmonious distribution, i.e., inhabiting in regions not utilised by other. Both are likely to reduce their potential distribution areas in the future climate, where moisture availability is a key factor for their range expansion.

Modelling Betula utilis distribution in response to climate-warming scenarios in Hindu-Kush Himalaya using random forest	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Alpine treeline ecotone; Climate change; Elevation; Machine learning; Niche modelling	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; UNCERTAINTY; NICHE; FIT	Globally, the increase in the climatic variability has led to adverse effects on the treeline species in the high-elevation mountain landscapes. Identifying the geographical space that supports the treeline species survival over time is essential for conservation biogeography. Increase in the global warming and snowmelt has made available the treeline species favourable niches in the higher elevations. Random Forest algorithm assuming non-parametric distribution was employed to predict the potential distribution of Betula utilis niche in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. The potential distributions were simulated in the Last Inter-Glaciation (LIG), present (the year 1970-2000) and future (the year 2061-2080) environmental conditions. The actual distribution of the species in the current time was modelled and evaluated. The model sensitivity with reference to independent evaluation dataset for highly suitable B. utilis niche was 0.78. The model statistics of the current time was further applied to both the LIG and future (2061-2080) scenarios in order to get a fundamental niche of B. utilis. The treeline species, B. utilis was projected to become vulnerable to 21st century climate changes. The high suitability of B. utilis occurrence in the LIG, current and the future scenario were more likely in the elevation ranges 2601-2800m, 3801-4000m, and 4201-4400m, respectively. The magnitude of advancement was relatively more along elevation and longitude, compared to the latitudinal gradient. The present study provides scientific evidence to conclude that the treeline species potential distribution in HKH is climate driven.

Rapid assessment of biodiversity using acoustic indices	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biodiversity; Soundscape; Acoustic index; SDG	SOUND; NOISE	The evolutionary success of a species is linked to its ability to communicate. Auditory, optic and olfactory systems are biological communication channels. Compared to the latter two, auditory systems are less impeded by physical obstructions. Successful species have effectively articulated this to their advantage. Decoding the acoustic dynamics of a landscape can ingeniously be crafted as a rapid tool to assess biological diversity. Here, we present results of the acoustic analysis carried out in three contrasting soundscapes in Kerala, India. Representative sound samples were recorded at Ernakulam, Kerala, India using Marantz PMD 661 III sonic recorder from 6.00a.m. to 6.00p.m. (IST) from an urban park [Hill Palace Museum (L1)], a sacred grove [Iringole Kavu (L2)], and a legally protected area Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary (L3). Acoustic characteristics of these sites expressed as Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI), Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI), Bioacoustic Index (BI) and Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI) were related to corresponding avian diversity. The objective finding reveals the distinctiveness of sonic characteristics and the status of diversity in each soundscape. Rapid assessment of biodiversity using acoustic indices is a prospective option that can be adopted as a means to generate biodiversity indicators of Sustainable Develeopment Goals (SDGs).

In the introduced range, the evolution of functional traits or plasticity might occur as an adaptive response to novel environmental pressures. Chromolaena odorata originates from the Americas, but now is a noxiously invasive species in some other tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, plant growth, morphology, photosynthesis and plasticity were compared between C. odorata plants from five introduced and five native populations under three light intensities (low, medium and full light). Compared to native C. odorata, introduced conspecifics had higher height under medium and full light, but lower root to shoot biomass ratio across all light conditions, and lower leaf N under medium light. This indicates genetic differences between native and introduced C. odorata. Furthermore, plasticity was higher for introduced C. odorata plants than for native conspecifics under various light environments. Our results indicate that biomass reallocation (from belowground into aboveground) and stronger plasticity could contribute to successful invasion of introduced C. odorata in frequently disturbed environments.

However, multifaceted studies are scant in forests. Here, we examined taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns in 19 beech forest understory plots in two areas belonging to a biodiversity monitoring plan in Tuscany, Italy. We performed linear mixed effect models to quantify the influence of elevation (proxy for macroclimate), aspect (affecting microclimate), and basal area (related to microclimate and stand maturity) on diversity facets of vascular plants. Elevation played a major role in shaping diversity: highelevation plots were less rich in species and had a reduced functional diversity of storage organs that may promote cold-tolerance. Conversely, the diversity of flowering phenology increased with elevation, thus lowelevation vegetation converged functionally towards a common, short blooming period. This strategy may be advantageous for understory plants in the deciduous beech forests experiencing longer growing seasons, hence more extended canopy closure at lower elevations. Basal area negatively affected foliar and multiple traits functional diversity which may be associated with highly selective and competitive environment for light capture in closed canopy, mature stands. Slope aspect did not exert any significant effect on diversity facets, neither did interactions among predictors. Overall, these results confirm the usefulness of implementing multifaceted approaches to i) better understand the influence of environmental drivers on different aspects of plant diversity, and ii) inform the biodiversity monitoring plan that is in place in the study forests by systematically including functional diversity instead of taxonomic metrics only.

Here we describe a successful reactor-based remediation of CP-contaminated soil and assess changes in the toxicity patterns and bacterial communities during the remediation. The remediation consisted of separating half of the contaminated soil to be ground (samples M) in order to test whether the grinding expedited the remediation, the other half was left unground (samples P). Both soils were mixed with wastewater treatment sludge to increase their bacterial diversity and facilitate the degradation of CPs, and the resultant mixtures were placed in 2 bioreactors, M and P, operated for 16 months under anaerobic conditions to favor dehalogenation and for an additional 16 months under aerobic conditions to achieve complete mineralization. Samples were taken every 4 months for toxicity and microbial analyses. The results showed a 64% removal of total CPs (Sigma CPs) in reactor P after just 18 months of remediation, whereas similar depletion in reactor M occurred after similar to 25 months, indicating that the grinding decelerated the remediation. By the end of the experiment, both reactors achieved 93.5 -95% removal. The toxicity tests showed a decrease in toxicity as the remediation progressed. The succession of bacterial communities over time was significantly associated with pH, anaerobic/aerobic phase and the concentration of the majority of CP congeners. Our data indicate that the supplementation of contaminated soil with sludge and further incubation in pilot-scale bioreactors under consecutive anaerobic-aerobic conditions proved to be effective at the remediation of CP-contaminated soil.

Remote Sensing indicators and vertebrate biodiversity distribution in global drylands: An assessment with ESA Diversity II products	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Ecological niche-based modelling; Functional groups; MERIS; Primary productivity; Species richness; Water availability	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BODY-SIZE; CONSERVATION; CLIMATE; RANGE; BIOGEOGRAPHY; RESOLUTION; RICHNESS; MODELS	Remotely sensed estimates represent relevant tools for assessing biodiversity distribution, yet their relationships with functional groups across drylands have never been evaluated. We assessed relationship between bio-indicators derived by the ESA Diversity II project and distribution of terrestrial vertebrates in five drylands. Twenty seven bio-indicators were derived from MERIS data, including averages and inter-annual variability of seasonally aggregated proxies for net primary production, rainfall, soil moisture, rain use efficiency, and soil moisture use efficiency. For each dryland, the functional strategy of 739 terrestrial vertebrates was summarized into functional groups and predicted functional species richness was related with bio-indicators. Water availability was better related with functional species richness than net primary production estimates, suggesting water availability as a critical aspect shaping vertebrate distribution in drylands. Body size appeared as an important functional trait influencing vertebrate distribution across drylands, especially in small-sized species associated with water availability. Selected functional traits, quality of species presence data, and ecological modelling approaches affected analyses relating bio-indicators to vertebrate distribution. The 27 bio-indicators showed potential for biodiversity distribution assessments, and may be taken into consideration in future studies with appropriate model adaptations. The followed methodological approach could be applied to other drylands and even other ecosystems.

We formulate an optimal resource-allocation framework for early detection. The approach is based on the principles of portfolio theory although, unlike standard portfolio theory and its previous applications to biosecurity problems, return is modelled using a flexible mixed-distribution and an uncertainty measure is defined using the Chernoff bound. The Chernoff bound does not assume underlying symmetry and allows sensitivity to both stochasticity and parameter uncertainty to be incorporated systematically into the optimisation process. Optimisation is a trade-off between expected return values and uncertainty while, at the same time, hedging against low-probability high-impact events. In an application to the islands of Torres Strait (Australia), we demonstrate how uncertainty, stochasticity and linkages between surveillance locations interact to significantly alter relative allocation, when compared with allocation based on expected values alone. Locations of particular interest for biosecurity are identified and results lead to a more even spread of resources, or greater surveillance 'diversification'.

We tested whether stochastic and heterogeneous site-specific trajectories or generalities, potentially driven by deterministic processes, control the fate of allochthonous bacteria from anthropogenic sources and the persistence of their functional traits in freshwater. Finding generalities would allow the identification of wastewater treatments that could be effective in abating determinants of antibiotic resistance, We analysed the short-term response of native bacterial communities in waters exposed to the disturbance of wastewater at different dilutions, using a metagenomic approach that revealed both microbial community composition and the scope and abundance of the resistome that can pose indirect risks to human health. We found that the taxonomic composition of the communities after the disturbance was driven by case-specific stochastic processes, whereas the resistome had a deterministic trajectory, rapidly stabilising its functional traits with higher proportions of wastewater effluents, regardless of differences in taxonomic composition, richness of antibiotic resistance genes and of bacterial taxa, phenotypic features of the bacterial communities, and type of wastewater treatment. The observed deterministic proliferation of resistomes in freshwater bodies receiving wastewater effluents, suggests that this process may contribute to the global propagation of antibiotic resistance, and thus calls for new legislations promoting alternative tertiary treatments for the wastewater reuse, and targeting bacterial functional traits and not only bacterial abundances.

Investigations conducted so far have linked fish kills to multiple factors, but extensive studies examining quantitatively the likelihood of fish kills are missing. In the present study, factors related to fish kills in 67 Mediterranean reservoirs located in the Iberian Peninsula were investigated. Moreover, the variation in the likelihood of fish kills with the foreseen consequences of anthropogenically driven climate change upon temperature and precipitation was assessed. During the 23-year period studied (1995-2017) the number of fish kills per reservoir varied from 0 to 3 and happened mostly in Southern reservoirs and during the warmest months, particularly in June. Twelve explanatory variables showed significant differences between reservoirs with and without fish die-offs. Reservoir depth, surface area oxygen and chlorophyll a concentrations were the variables that, together, best discriminated between reservoirs with and without fish kills, explaining 67.2% of the total variation in the occurrence of fish die-offs. The variables retained in the mortality model explained unique parts of that variation, but a considerable amount of the explained variation was shared by all the variables. The number of fish kill events appears to be rising during the examined period and the projection made indicated an increase in the likelihood of fish kills towards the end of the 21st century, particularly for the RCP8.5 emission scenario, with the prevalence of fish kills reaching 0.865 in Southern reservoirs. In the future, oligotrophication is likely the only strategy to consistently reduce fish kills in Mediterranean reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Identification of eukaryotic microorganisms with 18S rRNA next-generation sequencing in wastewater treatment plants, with a more targeted NGS approach required for Cryptosporidium detection	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Wastewater; Cryptosporidium; Blastotystis; Entamoeba; Next-generation sequencing	ZOONOTIC CRYPTOSPORIDIUM; ENTAMOEBA-MOSHKOVSKII; BLASTOCYSTIS SUBTYPES; GENETIC DIVERSITY; GIARDIA-CYSTS; PROTOZOA; PREVALENCE; GENOTYPES; HOMINIS; PARVUM	While some microbial eukaryotes can improve effluent quality in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), eukaryotic waterborne pathogens are a threat to public health. This study aimed to identify Eukarya, particularly faecal pathogens including Cryptosporidium, in different treatment stages (influent, intermediate and effluent) from four WWTPs in Western Australia (WA). Three WWTPs that utilise stabilisation ponds and one WWTP that uses activated sludge (oxidation ditch) treatment technologies were sampled. Eukaryotic 18S rRNA (18S) was targeted in the wastewater samples (n = 26) for next-generation sequencing (NGS), and a mammalian-blocking primer was used to reduce the amplification of mammalian DNA. Overall, bioinformatics analyses revealed 49 eukaryotic phyla in WWTP samples, and three of these phyla contained human intestinal parasites, which were primarily detected in the influent. These human intestinal parasites either had a low percent sequence composition or were not detected in the intermediate and effluent stages and included the amoebozoans Endolimax sp., Entamoeba sp. and Iodamoeba sp., the human pinworm Enterobius vermicularis (Nematoda), and Blastocystis sp. subtypes (Sarcomastigophora). Six Blastocystis subtypes and four Entamoeba species were identified by eukaryotic 18S NGS, however, Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. were not detected. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also failed to detect Giardia, but Cryptosporidium-specific NGS detected Cryptosporidium in all WWTPs, and a total of nine species were identified, including five zoonotic pathogens. Although eukaryotic 18S NGS was able to identify some faecal pathogens, this study has demonstrated that more specific NGS approaches for pathogen detection are more sensitive and should be applied to future wastewater pathogen assessments.

Although LVX is completely synthetic, the results of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, 32 mg-LVX/L) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC, 512 mg-LVX/L) of the sampled sludge showed that the LVX resistance/tolerance for bacterial growth has already existed in the actual wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The key bacteria, i.e. Nitrosomonas sp. (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria), Nitrospira sp. (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria) and Thauera sp. (the predominant denitrifiers), decreased with LVX exposure, and the recovery of biological process in the reactor was disturbed due to LVX exposure. However, after stopping exposure their population was quickly increased and thus the performance was recovered. The results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling and microbial community by sequencing showed the LVX concentration was a crucial factor to the change of bacterial communities and controlled the quantitative evolution of the communities in our systems. This effect was more pronounced as the LVX concentration was higher. The results suggested the removal of residual antibiotics to accomplish under no effect concentration before biological treatment is important to suppress emerging and increasing of the antibiotic resistant bacteria in WWTPs.

Due to human activities, a range of organic pollutants is often detected in groundwater. One source of groundwater contamination is via stormwater infiltration basins, however, there is little information on the types of compounds present in these collection systems and their influence on the underlying groundwater. We developed an analytical strategy based on the use of passive sampling combined with liquid chromatography/high resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry for screening for the presence of pesticide and pharmaceutical compounds in groundwater and stormwater runoff. Emporem (TM) disk-based passive samplers (SDB-RPS and SDB-XC sorbents) were exposed, using for the first time a new specially designed deployment rig, for 10 days during a rainfall event in five different stormwater infiltration systems around Lyon, France. Stormwater runoff and groundwater (via a well, upstream and downstream of each basin) was sampled. Exposed Empore (TM) disks were solvent extracted (acetone and methanol) and the extracts analysed using a specific suspect compound screening workflow. High resolution mass spectrometry coupled with a suspect screening approach was found to be a useful tool as it allows a more comprehensive analysis than with targeted screening whilst being less time consuming than non-targeted screening. Using this analytical approach, 101 suspect compounds were tentatively identified, with 40 of this set being subsequently confirmed. The chemicals detected included fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, indicators of human activity, antibiotics, antiepileptics, antihypertensive and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as well as their metabolites. Polar pesticides were mainly detected in groundwater and pharmaceuticals were more frequently found in runoff. In terms of detection frequency of the pollutants, groundwater impacted by infiltration was found not to be significantly more contaminated than non-impacted groundwater. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are few studies on the relationship between greenness of children's residential communities and their neurobehavioral health. Objective: In this cross-sectional study, we examined the association between neighborhood greenness of children's residential area and their neurobehavioral health. Methods: We used a population-representative sample of school children (n = 1817) from 2012 and 2013 in South Korea. Parents or guardians of children completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess their children's neurobehavioral health. As a measurement for greenness, the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) at a 30-m resolution was retrieved from the Landsat satellite data operated by NASA. The MSAVI values were categorized into tertiles (low, moderate, high greenness) and each child was assigned the mean MSAVI within a 1.6-km radius of residence. We applied survey regressions of the CBCL transformed scores on the 3 levels of greenness, controlling for age, sex, physical activity, monthly family income, exposure to second-hand smoke, exposure to NO2, and blood lead level. Results: High greenness was associated with a lower Total CBCL score compared to low greenness ( -2.33, 95% CI, -4.10 to -0.56). Externalizing Behavior showed a slightly stronger association with greenness than did Internalizing Behavior. The inverse relationship with greenness was strongest for Attention Problems (-1.32; 95% CI: -2.58, -0.06). The magnitudes of the association were strongest when the buffer distance was 1600 m. Conclusions: Greenness of residential neighborhood was associated with lower problematic behavior scores in children, especially aggressive behaviors and attention problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

An integrated phenotypic trait-network in thermo-Mediterranean vegetation describing alternative, coexisting resource-use strategies	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Intraspecific variation; N-dimensional hypervolumes; Phenotypic integration; Niche complementarity; Functional distinctiveness; Limiting similarity	PLANT ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; GRASSLAND COMMUNITIES; GLOBAL CONVERGENCE; LEAF SIZE; DROUGHT; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; DENSITY; ECOLOGY; COMPLEMENTARITY	Vascular plants have been found to align along globally-recognised resource-allocation trade-offs among specific functional traits. Genetic constrains and environmental pressures limit the spectrum of viable resource-use strategies employed by plant species. While conspecific plants have often been described as identical, intraspecific variation facilitates species coexistence and evolutionary potential. This study attempts to link an individual's phenotype to its environmental tolerance and ecosystem function. We hypothesised that: (1) seasonal variation in water availability has selected for tight phenotypic integration patterns that shape Mediterranean vegetation; however, (2) coexisting species employ alternative resource-use strategies to avoid competitive exclusion; specifically (3) species with smaller climatic niches (i.e. potential distributions) display higher functional diversity. We examined the interdependence among and the sources of variation within 11 functional traits, reflecting whole-plant economics (e.g. construction costs, hydraulics, defences, water storage capacity), from nine dominant, thermo-Mediterranean species measured across a wide environmental and geographic gradient. Furthermore, we delineated the phenotypic and climatic hypervolumes of each studied species to test for climatic niche overlap and functional distinctiveness. By adopting this multidimensional trait-based approach we detected fundamental phenotypic integration patterns that define thermo-Mediterranean species regardless of life history strategy. The studied traits emerged intercorrelated shaping a resource-allocation spectrum. Significant intraspecific variability in most measured traits allowed for functional distinctiveness among the measured species. Higher functional diversity was observed in species restricted within narrower climatic niches. Our results support our initial hypotheses. The studied functional traits collectively formed an integrated space of viable phenotypic expressions; however, phenotypic plasticity enables functionally distinctive species to succeed complementary in a given set of environmental conditions. Functional variability among coexisting individuals defined species' climatic niches within the trait-spectrum permitted by Mediterranean conditions. Ultimately, a species establishment in a locality depends on the extent that it can shift its trait values. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we want to know why some alien clonal plant species become invasive and others do not in the introduced range with variations of both abiotic and biotic environments under global anthropogenic change. We selected three invasive alien and three co-occurring, non-invasive alien clonal plant species in China, and grew them under the constant or variable soil nutrient environments in a native community with low or high vegetative propagule pressure (i.e. simulating pressure of anthropogenic alien propagules). Invasive alien species produced more biomass than non-invasives. Interestingly, invasive species benefited significantly greater from high propagule pressure than non-invasives. Biomass and evenness of native communities were greater with non-invasive than with invasive target species. Invasive plants showed a greater increase of leaf N and decrease of leaf C: N ratio when subject to variable nutrients in comparison to constant nutrients than non-invasives. The negative effects of variable nutrients on evenness of native communities were significantly greater under invasive than non-invasive target species. Moreover, biomass of native communities was significantly negatively related to biomass of invasive species. Variable nutrients significantly promoted the negative biomass relationship between non-invasive species and native communities under high propagule pressure and the negative biomass-evenness relationship between invasive species and native communities. Our study suggests that soil nutrient variability and vegetative propagule pressure influence the growth and leaf C and N uptake of alien clonal plant species in native experimental communities, especially under the high propagule pressure and nutrient variability. Invasive alien clonal species have higher performance and advantages over non-invasives. Future studies should also test the mechanisms that invasive and non-invasive or native plants differ in native communities of native or introduced ranges in the field. (C)2019 Elsevier B.V.

Soil bioremediation in cold environments is particularly challenging because of slower degradation rates, slower production of biomass for phytoextraction of trace elements (Ms), and remoteness, which can complicate logistics and inflate costs. This study evaluated a decontamination approach integrating indigenous willows, fungi and compost in a northern community. The site was a waste oil pit and its soil was initially contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) exceeding 200 g kg(-1) and TEs including As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn. In under five years, 65 and 75% of PHC (C6-C50 and >C50) were degraded, compared to 27 and 13% for the untreated control soil. We found contrasting TE translocation patterns to the aboveground biomass for the willow species used (Salix planifolia and Salix ataxensis), as well as distinctive rooting strategies. Hazard quotients were calculated to assess the risk plant material could pose to local wildlife. The highest TE concentration measured was Zn in S. planifolia, which exceeded Canadian soil guidelines. Results indicate toxicity risks to animals linked tons in Satix spp. leaves is generally unlikely. The fungus Trametes versicolor inoculated into the soil did not fruit, however fruiting bodies of Psathyrella sp. were observed consistently (four out of five years). Biological tests indicated that in five growing seasons soil toxicity significantly decreased compared to the untreated soil used as control. This was demonstrated by vegetation cover (137 vs 11% cover), toxicity assays on earthworms (Eisenia andrei) (0 vs 33% mortality) and barley seed germination (Hordeum vulgare) (86 vs 62% germination). The proposed decontamination approach, without the use of synthetic fertilizers, is promising for the PHC remediation of mixed-contaminants on cold climate sites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Linking shifts in bacterial community with changes in dissolved organic matter pool in a tropical lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Community structure; Bacterioplankton; CDOM; Mesocosm; Verrucomicrobiaceae	NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; GEN. NOV.; CARBON; BACTERIOPLANKTON; DIVERSE; SIZE; EFFICIENCY; ABSORBENCY; REACTIVITY	Bacterioplankton communities have a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle. Still the interaction between microbial community and dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwater ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here, we report results from a 12-day mesocosm study performed in the epilimnion of a tropical lake, in which inorganic nutrients and allochthonous DOM were supplemented under full light and shading. Although the production of autochthonous DOM triggered by nutrient addition was the dominant driver of changes in bacterial community structure, temporal covariations between DOM optical proxies and bacterial community structure revealed a strong influence of community shifts on DOM fate. Community shifts were coupled to a successional stepwise alteration of the DOM pool, with different fractions being selectively consumed by specific taxa Typical freshwater clades as Limnohabitans and Sporichthyaceae were associated with consumption of low molecular weight carbon, whereas Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria utilized higher molecular weight carbon, indicating differences in DOM preference among Glades. Importantly. Verrucomicrobiaceae were important in the turnover of freshly produced autochthonous DOM, ultimately affecting light availability and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Our findings suggest that taxonomically defined bacterial assemblages play definite roles when influencing DOM fate, either by changing specific fractions of the DOM pool or by regulating light availability and DOC levels.

GEMAS Project Team	Bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86 in European soils: A baseline for provenancing studies	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Strontium isotopes; European soils; Baseline; Provenancing; Archaeology; Forensic science	STRONTIUM ISOTOPE RATIOS; GEOGRAPHICAL ORIGIN; SR ISOTOPES; WATER; TRACE; FRANCE; MIGRATION; RAINWATER	We present Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios for similar to 1200 selected soil samples, collected by the GEMAS consortium from grazing (Gr) and agricultural (Ap) soils in Europe with the aim to better understand the strontium isotope distribution in the bioavailable fraction of the top-soil and its potential for provenancing applications. Spatial analysis shows that there is a clear distinction between coastal (<100 km) and non-coastal (>100 km) samples in their variance and that this variance is mirrored in the sodium concentration, suggesting an important but highly variable contribution from seaspray. We present two Sr-87/Sr-86 maps at 25 km x 25 km scale: one based solely on the measured data using a classical kriging approach and one based on a Random Forest model using complementary GEMAS data to predict the strontium isotope composition at the remaining 3000+ GEMAS sampling locations, including appropriate uncertainty assessment. Using a forensic Bayesian likelihood ratio approach, a tool was developed in R to create provenancing likelihood ratio maps. The maps delineate areas of high and low likelihood and allow investigators to direct their resources to areas of interest. For actual forensic case work either the measured or the modelled data can be used as reference data for the overall distribution of Sr-87/Sr-86 values in Europe. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Current rehabilitation practices, at times, utilise inorganic soil amendments to improve the physicochemical and biological characteristics of reconstructed soil profiles. These approaches may be appropriate for dryland rehabilitation, but there is limited research available regarding the benefits of using these amendments. Here, we present a study in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, an arid landscape subject to intensive mining that currently uses inorganic soil amendments (gypsum and urea) in post-mining rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of these amendments to (1) promote seed germination, seedling emergence and seedling growth across five plant species and, (2) re-instate soil quality in mine waste substrates. A series of glasshouse experiments assessed eight application combinations of these amendments in two alternative substrates and compared these to unamended substrates and topsoil. Soil amendments had a limited influence on seed germination, were detrimental to seedling emergence and resulted in increased seedling mortality. Mortality in the waste ranged from 2 to 61% but increased to 7-92% in amended waste. Seedling growth improved with high doses of amendments in waste, with a 1.3-5.6-fold increase across all plant species. Soil quality was relatively unaffected by amendments with soil nitrogen ranging from 0.01 to 0.08%, organic carbon from 0.01 to 0.12% and soil microbial activity from 2.3 to 2.4 ppm-CO2 in the amended and unamended waste. The use of soil amendments in mine rehabilitation requires consideration of the trade-off between initial reductions in seedling recruitment and enhanced seedling development at later stages. Future rehabilitation should consider the timing of amendment application to avoid detrimental impacts on seedling recruitment and maximise the benefits to seedling growth.

Basic knowledge of this apex predator has revealed concerns of invasive behaviour and questions regarding its utilization as a biomanipulation species. However, a method enabling its regulation to a required level has not yet been developed. We simulated the impact of angling on the catfish population by method of hook-lines in two post-mining lakes with a monitored population consisting of tagged individuals and in two reservoirs as reference sites. Further, the efficiency of hook-lines as a reducing device was examined and the economic aspects were determined. Catfish population in localities where the species is unwanted or invasive may be efficiently reduced to a harmless level by hook-lines and angling (depending on the approach of anglers). The most efficient time of the year seems to be spring to early summer with catch efficiency of 5.4 individuals per 10 baits in one day. The catch efficiency markedly decreased during the second part of the year and did not exceed 2.8 individuals per 10 baits in one day. Mean size of catfish had negative impact whereas catfish biomass had positive impact on the catch efficiency. Trophic status and number of catfish in the locality had no impact on the catch efficiency. According to model, 11-18 bait-days per 1 ha per season is efficient to decrease catfish population to 10% of the original size. Both angling and hook-lines are very simple, they are financially and time bearable mechanisms of catfish regulation in any condition.

In this case where catfish is beneficial, angling presents a real threat of population collapse and loss of the biomanipulative effect.

We analyze monthly time series of fire activity (number of fires and burned area) and fire weather danger rating indices (Fire Weather Index, Burning Index and Forest Fire Danger Index) at two spatial scales: (i) regionally, splitting the Spanish mainland into Northwest, Hinterland and Mediterranean regions; and (ii) locally, using the EMCWF grid. All analyses are based on decomposing time series to retrieve differential indicators of seasonal cycles, temporal evolution and anomalies. At regional scale we apply lagged cross-correlation analysis (4 lags or months before fire) to explore seasonal associations; and trend detection tests on the temporal evolution component. At the local scale, we calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between each individual index and the 18 possible fire-activity subsets according to fire size (all sizes, > 1 ha and > 100 ha) and source of ignition (natural, unintended and arson); this analysis is applied to both cycles, temporal and anomalies series. Results suggest that weather controls seasonal fire activity although it has limited influence on temporal evolution, i.e. trends. Stronger associations are detected in the number of fires in the Northwest and Hinterland regions compared to the Mediterranean, which has desynchronized from weather since 1994. Cross-correlation analysis revealed significant fire-weather associations in the Hinterland and Mediterranean, extending up to two months prior fire ignition. On the other hand, the association between temporal trends and weather is weaker, being negative along the Mediterranean and even significant in the case of burned area. The spatial disaggregation into grid cells reveals different spatial patterns across fire-activity subsets. Again, the connection at seasonal level is noticeable, especially in natural-caused fires. In turn, human-related wildfires are occasionally found independent from weather in some areas along the northern coast or the Ebro basin. In any case, this effect diminishes as the size of the fire increases. Our work suggests that for some regions of mainland Spain, these fire danger indices could provide useful information about upcoming fire activity up to two months ahead of time and this information could be used to better inform wildland fire prevention and suppression activities.

Estuarine Dissolved Oxygen History Inferred from Sedimentary Trace Metal and Organic Matter Preservation	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Water quality proxies; Dissolved oxygen; Sediment geochemistry; Environmental history; Estuarine circulation`	SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; CALIFORNIA CURRENT; DECLINING OXYGEN; HYPOXIA; BAY; EUTROPHICATION; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; RECONSTRUCTION; CONTAMINATION	Environmental history recorded in estuarine sediment describes water quality regimes through the use of geochemical and biological proxies. We collected sediment cores from two locations in the Coos Estuary, Oregon, at South Slough and Haynes Inlet, spanning from similar to 1680AD to the present. To reconstruct the historical water column oxygen in the estuary, we measured geochemical proxies including organic matter, magnetic susceptibility, and elemental composition, and we constructed sediment chronologies using the Pb-210 profile and radiocarbon dates. Correlation of geochemical proxies and a detailed 15-year record of dissolved oxygen observations supports the inference of dissolved oxygen (DO) history from these sediment cores: a novel finding for small, seasonal Pacific Northwest estuaries. Geochemical evidence suggests that over the last 300years, annually or semi-annually averaged dissolved oxygen stress has been increasing at South Slough, while remaining stable or even decreasing at Haynes inlet. This history was explained by changing climatic and land-use effects on erosion and organic matter as well as the role of shipping channel maintenance in providing a dissolved oxygen reservoir at Haynes Inlet relative to the more isolated South Slough.

Prior studies have shown that strong El Nino events are highly correlated with high rainfall episodes and high freshwater discharge into subtropical estuaries, with subsequent changes in species composition, abundance, and diversity of their biota. In this work, we evaluated the hypothesis that riverine allochthonous matter associated with the strong 2015 El Nino event is assimilated by decapod crustaceans and fishes of a southwestern Atlantic estuary. We analyzed carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) stable isotope ratios of primary food sources and consumers in the estuary and of riverine allochthonous matter. Our findings revealed that higher water surplus and lower salinity associated with the 2015 El Nino coincided with an increase in the number of freshwater fish species and a decrease in the number of marine- and estuarine-dependent fishes inside the estuary. In addition, most estuarine consumers had lower average C-13 values during the wet period associated with the 2015 El Nino. This seemed to reflect the assimilation of C-13-depleted riverine matter, which according to Bayesian isotope mixing models ranged from 11% (adult resident decapod crustaceans) to 60% (adult resident fishes) during the wet season. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of El Nino events on structuring food web organization in estuaries under the influence of this climatic phenomenon, which may become more frequent and intense in a global warming scenario.

Preferential Parasitism of Native Oyster Ostrea edulis Over Non-Native Magallana gigas by a Polydorid Worm	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Intertidal; Estuary; Ecological interactions; Non-native species; Aquaculture; UK	CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; MUSSELS; GROWTH; SHELL; STRENGTH; MOLLUSKS; BEHAVIOR; CILIATA	Parasites are important structural components of marine communities that can affect organism fitness and ecological interactions, and the provision of ecosystem services. Here, we investigate the host association of Polydora ciliata with two ecologically and economically important oyster species (Ostrea edulis, Magallana gigas) and examine its impacts on two fitness aspects: condition and shell strength. Our results provide strong inferential evidence of host specificity by P. ciliata with a tendency towards infestation of the native O. edulis over the introduced M. gigas. Evidence suggests increasing prevalence of parasitism with organismal age, but no clear indication that parasitism leads to reduced condition or shell strength. The prevalence of infection of O. edulis by P. ciliata over M. gigas observed here holds potential implications for species competition and dominance, and their respective population maintenance, which could explain the much lower abundances of O. edulis compared to M. gigas at specific geographical locations. Additionally, these results hold significance for the aquaculture sector, with parasitism likely to lower production output and decrease the end-product market value.	[Lemasson, A. J.; Knights, A.

Simulation model suggests that fire promotes lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) invasion in Patagonia	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Biological invasion; Fire; Pinus; Positive feedback; Simulation model; Tree invasion	SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; ARAUCARIA-ARAUCANA; SPREAD; FORESTS; DISTURBANCE; DETERMINANTS; ENVIRONMENT; FEEDBACKS; REGIMES; IMPACTS	To best understand plant invasions and predict unexpected outcomes it is necessary to integrate information on disturbance, the local environment, and demography. Disturbance by fire has been shown to promote invasions worldwide, but precise interactions between fire, native and invading species remain unclear. Indeed, trade-offs exist between fire-induced mortality of seed sources and increased establishment, driving invasion outcomes. A positive feedback between lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) invasions and fire has been identified but only above a certain pine density. Above this threshold, fire resulted in increased pine dominance at the plot level, however below this threshold establishment rates did not change. We used a spatially explicit invasion simulation model modified to include fire to explore the implications of these complex interactions between pine invasions and fire. We asked if fire promoted P. contorta invasion across a Patagonian steppe site and if this depended on the age of the invasion when it burned. Our simulations indicated that, although fire was not necessary to initiate invasion, fire in communities where pine invasions were at least 10years old resulted in increased spatial extent and maximum invasion density compared to unburned simulations. Fire through younger invasions did not alter the progression of the invasion compared to unburned simulations. Pine invasions should be managed before they reach an advanced stage where positive feedbacks between fire and pine invasion could lead to dramatic increases in invasion rate.

Using the largest seed bank dataset collated to date, comprising 14,293 records for 2566 species, we examined whether the type (transient vs persistent) and density of the seed banks of invasive species differ in their native (home) and alien (abroad) range, and whether these attributes differ among invasive and non-invasive congeners, at home and abroad. A lower probability of forming a persistent seed bank in the alien range was identified when analyzing data for 140 invasive species, although phylogenetic analyses run for 104 of those species did not confirm such differences. However, invasive woody species formed denser seed banks in the alien range, suggesting greater seed production and/or lower seed predation or mortality in the alien than native range. Interestingly, invasive species consistently showed a higher probability of forming persistent seed banks as well as denser seed banks than their non-invasive congeners in their native range, but not in their alien range. These findings provide the first quantitative evidence, based on a large number of species globally, of preadaptation with respect to species life-history traits resulting in the formation of a persistent seed bank in invasive species compared to their non-invasive congeners. The fact that both invasive and non-invasive congeners have similar probabilities of forming persistent seed banks abroad suggests that this might be an important attribute for the establishment of alien species in new ranges (naturalization phase), but not for their spread (invasion phase). Our findings also indicate that the characteristics of native seed banks should be an important component of risk assessments aimed at identifying species that are more likely to become invasive if introduced in new ranges.

We used experimental transplants within and beyond the current elevation range (similar to 0-300m a.s.l.) of two naturalized succulent plant species, Aeonium arboreum and Aeonium haworthii, to investigate whether they have reached their climatic limits in New Zealand. The two species have similar invasion histories but differ in climatic tolerances in their native ranges, therefore we expected them to differ in their potential to spread within New Zealand. We transplanted individuals of both species along an elevation and precipitation gradient and measured plant growth, mortality and seedling establishment over 2years. Both species responded strongly and in similar ways to climatic variation along the gradient. Annual frost days was a strong predictor of performance for both species; plants grown at sites with more frost days had lower growth, survival and reproduction. We used our results to predictplant growth, survival and reproduction beyond their current naturalised range. We found that neither species is likely to survive at elevations greater than 300m a.s.l. and that, while A. haworthii appears to be at or near climatic equilibrium, A. arboreum has the potential for spread further up in elevation. We provide the first evidence of the climatic tolerances of Aeonium sp. in their introduced range, and the risk of their continued spread in New Zealand.

Historical, current, and potential population size estimates of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the United States	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Feral swine; Invasive species; Introduced species; Population size; Range expansion	FERAL SWINE; RANGE EXPANSION; CONSEQUENCES; MANAGEMENT; THREATS; RISK	To control invasive species and prioritize limited resources, managers need information about population size to evaluate the current state of the problem, the trend in population growth through time, and to understand the potential magnitude of the problem in the absence of management actions. This information is critical for informing management actions and allocating resources. We used two national-scale data sets to estimate historical, current, and future potential population size of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa; hereafter wild pigs) in the United States. Between 1982 to present, the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study mapped the distribution of wild pigs in the United States. In addition, recent research has predicted potential population density of wild pigs across the United States by evaluating broad-scale landscape characteristics. We intersected these two data sets to estimate the population size of wild pigs in 1982, 1988, 2004, 2010, 2013, and 2016. In addition, we estimated potential population size if wild pigs were present at equilibrium conditions in all available habitat in each state. We demonstrate which states have experienced recent population growth of wild pigs and are predicted to experience the greatest population increase in the future without sufficient management actions and policy implementation. Regions in the western, northern, and northeastern United States contain no or few wild pig populations, but could potentially support large numbers of these animals if their populations become established. This information is useful in identifying regions at greatest risk if wild pigs become established, which can assist in prioritizing management actions aimed at controlling or eliminating this invasive species across broad to local scales.

Climate warming reduces the reproductive advantage of a globally invasive intertidal mussel	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Reproductive output; Physiological performance; Species distribution; Rocky shore; Climate change; Invasive species; Dynamic Energy Budget model	INDIGENOUS PERNA-PERNA; MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS; THERMAL-STRESS; TIPPING POINTS; WAVE EXPOSURE; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; ATTACHMENT STRENGTH; PREY INTERACTIONS; SOUTH-AFRICA; PATTERNS	Predicting the spread of invasive species in a warming world calls for a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the relative performance of both invasive and indigenous species as recipient communities can offer biotic resistance. A particularly important functional trait in this context is reproductive potential. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is invasive world-wide and threatens the native brown mussel Perna perna on South African rocky shores. Where they co-exist, Mytilus dominates the high and Perna the low mussel zone, overlapping in the middle. Mytilus generally exhibits high individual reproductive output, but feeding time is reduced, physical conditions are stressful and adult densities are lower on the higher shore. We compared overall reproductive potential of populations of the two species using a 1-year data set for three sites, accounting for within-shore distribution and abundances. Despite the restriction of Mytilus to the more stressful upper-shore, its aggregate reproductive potential was comparable to that of Perna. We then used Dynamic Energy Budget modelling to test the effects of changing conditions by calculating aggregate reproductive potential under temperature conditions predicted for the end of the century by the International Panel on Climate Change. The results suggest increased aggregate reproductive potential for both species, but the effect was stronger for the native species at two of three sites, implying increased biotic resistance by Perna to the further spread of Mytilus. Combining ecological context and physiological performance elucidates how interactions between native and invasive species may alter. Such nuances are fundamental to anticipating winners or losers in a world where distribution shifts are increasingly common.

As FLMs have become more mechanistic, more input parameters are required, which increases model parameter uncertainty. To better understand the increased mechanistic detail provided by LANDIS-II/PnET-Succession, we studied the effects of parameter uncertainty on model outputs based on three different approaches. Global sensitivity analyses summarized the influence of each parameter, a local sensitivity analysis determined the magnitude of and degree of nonlinearity of variation in model outputs alongside variation in individual parameters, and a regression tree analysis identified hierarchical relationships among and interaction effects between parameters. Foliar nitrogen, maintenance respiration, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were the most influential parameters in the global analysis. Knowing where parameter influence is concentrated will help model users interpret results from LANDIS-II/PnET-Succession to address ecological questions and should guide priorities for data acquisition.

Yet, factors influencing loss, i.e. vulnerability, have gained less attention to date. Vulnerability is defined as the degree of loss resulting from the hazard impact on buildings. Recent studies have focused on evaluating vulnerability to dynamic flooding using proxies from case studies and based on empirical ex-post approaches. However, the transferability to other case studies and, therefore, the ability of such models to actually predict future losses is limited. To overcome this gap, we present a beta model based on loss data from the European Alps, which clearly shows that a single vulnerability function is sufficient to predict losses resulting from different types of torrential hazards and to provide probabilities of destruction under specific scenarios. As a result, the curves are transferable and may significantly increase the predictive power of risk analyses.

We conducted an accountability study assessing the improvement in ambient air quality and estimating the effect on health outcomes of the policy. Method: We used interrupted time series (ITS) with segmented regression to identify any change in ambient concentrations of SO2 in contrast to other ambient pollutants (particulate matter <10 mu m in diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3)) at 10 monitoring stations in Hong Kong from 2010 to 2017. We validated these findings using cumulative sum control (CUSUM) charts. We used a validated risk assessment model to estimate effects of changes in air quality on death for natural causes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Results: Mean monthly concentrations of SO2 fell abruptly at the monitoring station closest to the main shipping port (Kwai Chung (KC)) by -10.0 mu gm(3 )p-value = 0.0004, but not elsewhere. No such changes were evident for the other pollutants (PM10, NO2, O-3). CUSUM charts confirmed a change in July 2015. Estimated deaths avoided per year as a result of the policy were 379, 72, 30 for all natural causes, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases respectively. Conclusion: Implementation of the shipping emission policy in Hong Kong successfully reduced ambient SO2, with the potential to reduce mortality. However, to gain full benefits, restrictions on shipping emissions need to be implemented throughout the region. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We designed this study with the aim to disentangle the effects of multiple stressors on emerging aquatic insects from wetlands impacted by intensive agricultural practices and receiving runoff from neonicotinoid-treated canola. A total of 22 semi-permanent wetlands were monitored over two growing seasons (11 different wetlands per year) in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Over the two sampling years, dipterans from the families Chironomidae (60-67%), Muscidae (13-15%) and Ceratopogonidae (7-13%) made up the majority of emergent taxa, representing 80-95% of the total emergence. Multivariate ordination analyses of eight water quality and nine wetland habitat variables revealed that neonicotinoid concentration, turbidity, vegetation disturbance, and continuity of a vegetative grass buffer zone were significant factors influencing the aquatic insect taxa composition. Generalized linear mixed effects models indicated that total insect emergence over time was significantly predicted by neonicotinoid concentrations (imidacloprid toxic equivalency, TEQ) and vegetation disturbance. Higher neonicotinoid concentrations negatively affected insect emergence over time, whereas vegetation disturbance increased total emergence, likely due to the abundance of disturbance-tolerant taxa. Overall, we observed community-level responses driven by multiple indicators of wetland degradation (insecticides, turbidity, and vegetation disturbance). Collectively, these multivariate field data provide an in-depth understanding of how agricultural management practices, including neonicotinoid use, interact to shape wetland aquatic insect communities.

Moss often dominates these ecosystems and their N content (%N) and stable isotope ratio (delta N-15) are used as indicators of atmospheric N deposition. Here, we used a single moss species (Hylocomiwn splendens) as a bioindicator of atmospheric N deposition in the mountainous areas of Japan. The moss was collected from 38 sites on all slope aspects (east, west, south, and north) ranging from 1800 to 2800 m in altitude. The correlation between moss N variables (%N and delta N-15) and environmental conditions (altitude and slope aspects) was analyzed using linear models based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. In the constructed models, %N showed a significant or weak negative correlation with altitude on all slope aspects. In contrast, delta N-15 was significantly and positively correlated with altitude, with high values on the western alpine slopes. When using delta N-15 as a marker of N sources, N in alpine moss on the west slope seemed to be influenced by transboundary N pollutants through particulate matter (PM), which is brought to Japan from mainland Asia by prevailing westerly winds and northwest monsoons. However, as moss N is also affected by other factors, such as different N chemical forms, fixed N from cyanobacteria, and seasonal differences in atmospheric N, further research should directly compare moss N with atmospheric N deposition to elucidate the influence of transboundary N pollutants on moss N.

However, intraspecific differences in functional traits could modulate the plant responses to the expected increase in drought. Using a trait based approach, we evaluated under controlled conditions how Quercus sober seedlings from the latitudinal edges of the distribution range of the species respond to different watering treatments in terms of vegetative growth and biomass allocation. In addition, we simulated an extreme drought by stopping watering until death to determine chemical and physiological traits under drought stress and to identify which morphological traits were more associated to drought resistance (expressed as survival time without watering). Seedlings from the northern provenance presented higher aboveground biomass allocation (i.e. shoot length and biomass allocation to shoot and leaves), while the southern ones were characterised by longer roots and higher biomass allocation to roots. Under extreme drought, seedlings from the southern provenance maintained higher photosynthetic rates than northern seedlings and were able to modulate their water-use efficiency (estimated from delta C-13) depending on environmental conditions, which allowed them to survive for a longer period. Finally, drought resistance was partially explained by the plant biomass allocation pattern. Traits related to growth in height and light interception were negatively related with drought resistance, whereas traits involving investment in root biomass were positively related with resistance. These geographical differences evidence a local adaptation to drought at the southern edge of Q. sober distribution. Our results highlight the importance of the conservation of the genetic resources that peripheral populations harbour at distribution edges.

We show that LATs and roots have different functions in resource uptake in the two species, which we mainly attributed to dissimilarities in carbon acquisition and growth traits (e.g., photosynthesis, relative growth rate, non-structural carbohydrates, malate), to water relation traits (e.g., water and osmotic potentials, relative water content, hydrenchyma thickness) and nutrient uptake (e.g., N-15-labelling). While the roots of A. aquilega did contribute to water and nutrient uptake, the roots of L. splendens were less important than the role played by the LATs in resource uptake. We also provide evidenced for a synergistic effect of combined watering of tank and root in the Bromelioideae species. These results call for a more complex interpretation of LATs vs. roots in resource uptake in bromeliads.

Nitrogen flows in global pork supply chains and potential improvement from feeding swill to pigs	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Animal production; Nitrogen use efficiency; Livestock; Food wastes; Life cycle	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; FOOD WASTE; ANIMAL PRODUCTION; ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; MANURE MANAGEMENT; NUTRIENT USE; LIVESTOCK; CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY; EMISSIONS	The global pork sector contributes to food security and supports livelihoods for millions of households but also causes nitrogen (N) pollution. Here we assess N flows, losses, and N use indicators for global pork supply chains, from "cradle-to-primary-processing-gate" and for three production systems: the backyard, intermediate and industrial systems. Subsequently, we evaluate the effects of feeding swill to industrial pigs on N flows and land use. To produce 3.5 Tg N of pork globally, 14.7 Tg N are lost into the environment, of which 68% is lost to watercourses in the form of nitrates and organic N and the reminder emitted to the atmosphere as N-gas (e.g., NH3, NOx and N2O). We found that the efficiency of N use, hotspot and magnitude of N losses per unit of area depend chiefly on the region (agro-ecological and economic context), origin of feed, and manure management systems. Swill feeding increases N use efficiency and reduces N losses at the feed production stage. It achieves a saving of 31 Mt of soybeans and 20 Mt of grains on dry matter basis, equivalent to 16 M ha of land used. Its adoption would require innovative policies to preserve food safety and public health. Future research may explore the feasibility and requirements to adopt swill feeding at a country level and may investigate potential impacts on other sustainability objectives.

Using porous iron composite (PIC) material to immobilize rhenium as an analogue for technetium	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Technetium; Rhenium; Nitrate; Zero-valent iron; Permeable reactive barriers; Column experiment	ZERO-VALENT IRON; RAY-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; NITRATE REDUCTION; RELEASE; REMEDIATION; GROUNDWATER; SOLUBILITY; SPECIATION; CHROMIUM; KINETICS	Technetium (Tc-99), a uranium-235 (U-235) and plutonium-239 (Pu-239) fission product, is a primary risk driver in low level radioactive liquid waste at U.S. Department of Energy sites. Previous studies have shown success in using Zero Valens Iron (ZVI) to chemically reduce and immobilize redox sensitive groundwater contaminants. Batch and column experiments were performed to assess the ability of a novel porous iron composite material (PIC) to immobilize Tc(VII) in comparison with two commercial Fe oxide sorbents and reagent grade ZVI in the presence and absence of NO3-, a competing oxidized species that is often found in high concentrations in liquid nuclear waste. Perrhenate (ReO4) was used as a non-radioactive chemical analogue for pertechnetate (TcO4) under both oxic and anoxic test conditions. The PIC powder was the most effective at immobilizing Re(VII) under all batch test conditions. The presence of nitrate (NO3-) slowed the removal of ReO4- from solution, presumably through chemical reduction and precipitation. Even so, the PIC and ZVI were effective at removing both Re(VII) and NO3- completely from solution. Nitrate was reduced to NH3- with very little nitrite (NO2(-)) buildup during equilibration. Significant Re immobilization was observed in the column tests containing PIC sorbent, even though inlet solutions were in equilibrium with O-2. The presence of NO3- hastened Re breakthrough, while NO3- reduction to NH3- was observed. The results suggest that PIC and ZVI would be the most effective at the removal of TcO4- from contaminated groundwater sites.

However, effects of nano-metal-materials on the occurrence and level of ARGs in the soil and plant, have not been fully explored. To gain insights into this impact, we conducted a pot experiment by adding nano-silver particles (AgNPs) as a stimuli and Ag ion (AgNO3) and tetracycline as a comparison. By using high throughput quantitative PCR, our results indicated that application of AgNPs (similar to 20 nm and similar to 50 nm) at a concentration of 100 ppm resulted in no significant changes in the abundance of ARGs in either soil or phyllosphere (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, the overall pattern of resistome, especially in soil, was shifted following AgNPs application, with a significance increase in the relative abundance of efflux pumps genes, which is an important mechanism for co-selection of ARGs by heavy metals. By comparison, Ag ion at an equivalent Ag mass of AgNPs markedly increased ARGs abundance and shifted ARGs profile in soil, indicating that free Ag ion had a stronger impact on ARGs than AgNPs. These findings provide new insights in assessing the risks of manufactured nanomaterials accumulated in the environment.

Early-life triclosan exposure and parent-reported behavior problems in 8-year-old children	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Child behavior; Childhood; Epidemiology; Neurodevelopment; Pregnancy; Triclosan	BISPHENOL-A EXPOSURE; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHER; URINARY TRICLOSAN; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; THYROID-HORMONE; PREGNANCY; PHENOLS; CHILDHOOD; HYPOTHYROIDISM; NEUROBEHAVIOR	Background: Triclosan exposure may decrease circulating thyroxine levels or cause neuron apoptosis, which in turn may adversely affect neurodevelopment. However, few studies have examined the association of early life triclosan exposure with child behavior. Objective: To quantify the association between early-life triclosan exposure and child behavior at age 8-years in 202 mother-child pairs from the HOME study (Cincinnati, OH; enrolled: 2003-2006). Methods: We quantified urinary triclosan concentrations up to 3 times in mothers (16-weeks, 26-weeks, and delivery) and up to 6 times in children (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years). Parents rated children's problem behaviors at age 8-years using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2). Adjusting for covariates and accounting for exposure measurement error, we estimated changes in behavior problem scores per 10-fold increase in mean gestational and childhood triclosan concentrations. In addition, we estimated sex-specific associations. Results: Child sex modified the association of gestational and childhood triclosan with several BASC-2 scales (sex x triclosan p-values < 0.2). In boys, increasing gestational triclosan was associated with higher behavioral symptom index (beta: 4.5; 95% CI: 1.0, 8.1), externalizing problems (beta: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.2, 9.0), attention problem (beta: 6.6; 95% CI: 2.4, 11), hyperactivity (beta: 6.4; 95% CI: 2.1, 11), and somatization (beta: 3.8; 95% CI: 0.3, 7.3) scores. In contrast, triclosan-BASC-2 associations in girls were generally null and not statistically significant. We observed similar patterns of associations between childhood triclosan and these same behavioral scores; however, their magnitude decreased substantially after adjusting for gestational triclosan and associations were not statistically significant. Conclusion: In this cohort, increasing gestational and childhood urinary triclosan concentrations were associated with higherbehavior problem scores in 8-year old boys, but not girls.

Trophic cascade strength is influenced by size frequency distribution of primary consumers and size-selective predation: examined with mesocosms and modeling	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Trophic cascades; Size-selective predation; Compensatory mechanisms; Biomanipulation; Invasive fish	HABITAT STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; DRY-WEIGHT ESTIMATE; FOOD-WEB; BODY-SIZE; ZOOPLANKTON; FISH; LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; NUTRIENT; LENGTH	Understanding variation in trophic cascades is critical for developing management strategies for invasive and introduced species as well as in designing biomanipulation experiments. We evaluated, in fish driven trophic cascades, the responses of invertebrate biomass, body size, and production both experimentally and through a model. Experimental mesocosm treatments of small (Moina), large (Daphnia pulex), and mixed size zooplankton communities were characterized with and without size-selective fish (bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus). Experimental responses were typical of trophic cascades showing reduced biomass, body size and production of zooplankton and generally enhanced chlorophyll a. Although zooplanktonbiomass was similarly reduced in all fish treatments, production for the fish D. pulex treatment was lower than the other fish treatments because larger taxa have a lower ratio of production to biomass (P/B). As would be expected based on zooplanktonproduction among fish treatments, response of chlorophyll a in treatments with D. pulex was faster and final concentration higher than in Moina or mixed size treatments. A model of changes in production under a range of reductions in body size and/or biomass, from no reduction to 99% reduction, supported experimental results indicating invertebrate production can be resilient to reduction of biomass when body size is reduced. Strength of trophic cascades may therefore, in part, be related to interactions among reduction in biomass, size-selective predation, and size frequency distribution and plasticity of prey community. Because size-selective predation is a common trait in trophic cascades, some level of compensation is likely in most trophic cascades.

This progressive disconnection from the natural world is profoundly concerning as it affects human health, wellbeing, attitudes and behaviors towards nature. Increasing the quantity of experiences of nature (EoN) can enhance health and wellbeing benefits, but it remains unclear whether it can also affect environmental attitudes across different countries. Here, we conducted a cross-cultural survey among 741 people from France, Israel and the UK, who either own a dog (and thus prone to go outdoors to walk their dog), a cat, or no pet. This setting was used as a quasi-experiment to explore the relationships between EoN, nature relatedness, environmental knowledge and attitudes. Our results confirmed that dog-owners have a higher quantity of EoN. However, we found that although dog-ownership was associated with people's relatedness to nature, the increased quantity of EoN did not correlate with environmental knowledge or attitudes. Thus, increasing the quantity of EoN may not be sufficient for mitigating the effects of the extinction of experience and consequently a more profound understanding of the quality of EoN and the means to enhance it are needed. This knowledge is crucial to help landscape planners provide accessible and suitably designed green spaces that can foster meaningful interactions with nature, for instance through specific gardening practices or creative design.

In these environments picoplankton constitute a key component of the food webs. We compared lakes with different regimes (clear vegetated and turbid), in periods with contrasting hydrological conditions. Samplings were conducted during late summer in 2015 (higher water levels), 2016 and 2017 (lower water levels). In each lake we measured limnological variables and quantified picoplankton by flow cytometry. Differences in picoplankton structure among lakes were associated with their regime and hydrological conditions. We found higher abundances of heterotrophic bacterioplankton (HB) in more turbid and eutrophic lakes; these lakes also showed higher abundances of both bacterial fractions analyzed (high and low nucleic-acid content). Clear vegetated oligotrophic lakes showed the lowest photosynthetic picoplankton abundances and higher densities of PE-rich picocyanobacteria (Pcy). All lakes presented PE-rich cells and picoeukaryotes (Peuk), the latter being the most frequent group in all the environments and the most abundant in turbid ones. PC-rich Pcy appeared only in clear vegetated, organic turbid and inorganic turbid, showing one or two cytometric populations. Clear vegetated lakes with water level reduction show an increase of HB, PC-rich cells and Peuk abundances. We provided evidences that picoplankton structure is influenced by lake regime, and in some lakes the shift from clear vegetated to turbid states strongly affects the structure of these communities.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates in lakes increases along an elevational gradient paralleling increasingly oligotrophic conditions. For this purpose, 12 lakes located between 575 and 2796 m above sea level were sampled in summer and fall to include two different seasonal windows in phytoplankton dynamics and environmental conditions. The degree of mixotrophy in phytoplankton was estimated in tracer experiments using fluorescently-labeled bacteria and done with composite samples collected in the euphotic zone and in samples obtained from the chlorophyll-a maximum. The results indicated the existence of a positive trend particularly in summer in the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates with elevation, however, this trend was not linear, and exceptions along the elevational gradient were found. Changes in the relative abundance of mixotrophic flagellates were related with significant changes in water transparency, DOC and phosphorus concentrations, as well as in bacterial and flagellate abundance. Overall, our results reveal that the harsh growth conditions found in oligotrophic high mountain lakes favor a mixotrophic trophic strategy among phytoplankton.

Using a 16-year time-series dataset, we tested the hypothesis that seasonal variation would explain most of the gamma diversity of these plankton communities. We also investigated the environmental and temporal factors responsible for the variations in composition and species turnover. The scale related to dry and rainy seasons explained a considerable percentage of the gamma diversity and variation partitioning, showed that compositional changes occurred mainly over broader temporal scales. Environmental factors varying among seasons and ENSO events explained changes in composition, although some communities did not respond to the environment. Our results suggest that niche and stochastic processes operating at temporal scales correlated with ENSO climate events contributed to changes in species composition. Hence, climate anomalies might be important to maintain diversity in areas with reduced or loss of the natural variations in environmental conditions. Our results also suggest that, although communities show similar patterns of variation in composition, they might respond in a different degree to environmental and temporal factors. Thus, while niche-associated (environment) and stochastic (time) processes drove the phytoplankton, stochastic processes were more important for zooplankton, whereas neither were important for ciliates.

To better understand how organisms may be affected by contamination to H-3 it is essential to link observed effects to a correct estimation of absorbed dose rates. Due to quick isotopic exchanges between H-3 and hydrogen, H-3 measurement is difficult in small organisms such as zebrafish embryo, a model in ecotoxicological assay. This work aimed to optimise tritium measurement protocol to better characterise internalisation by early life stages of zebrafish. Zebrafish eggs were exposed at one HTO activity concentration of 1.22 x 10(5) Bq/mL. This activity was calculated to correspond to theoretical dose rates of 0.4 mGy/h, where some deleterious effects are expected on young fish. A protocol for the preparation of biological samples was adapted from the method classically used to segregate the different forms of tritium in organisms. To deal with very quick isotopic exchanges of H-3 with hydrogen, the impacts of washing by nontritiated water as well as the bias induced by absorbed tritium around organisms on the measured activity concentration were studied. We managed to develop protocols to perform total tritium and total organically bound tritium (OBT) activity concentrations measurements in zebrafish eggs and larvae. The measurement of these both forms allowed the calculation of tissue-free-water-tritium (TFWT). To better understand total tritium internalisation, a study of total tritium kinetics from 4 hpf (hour post-fertilization) to 168 hpf was performed. OBT and TFWT were also assessed to complete the total tritium internalisation kinetics. The internalisation is a rapid phenomenon reaching a steady-state within 24 h after the beginning of contamination for total tritium and TFWT, with concentration factors and TFWT/HTO close to unity. OBT formation seemed to be slower. It appeared that OBT content in organisms was low with an OBT/TFWT ratio of about 8% for both stages (24 hpf and 96 hpf). To verify absorbed dose rates at key developmental stages (24 hpf eggs and 96 hpf larvae), they were calculated from total tritium activity concentrations after exposure at 1.22 x 10(5) and 1.22 x 10(6) Bq/mL, as these two activity concentrations were used to assess effects of tritium in another part of the study. Dose rates calculated from total tritium activity concentrations measured in 24 hpf eggs and 96 hpf larvae were consistent with the nominal ones, which validates the robustness of the protocol developed in the present study.

In this study, multi-species microcosms were used to investigate effects of ionizing radiation in a model freshwater ecosystem, including endpoints at both structural and functional levels and ecological interactions. Microcosms were exposed for 22 days to a gradient of gamma radiation with four dose rates from 0.72 to 19 mGy h(-1), which are within the range of those seen at contaminated sites. Results showed significant dose related effects on photosynthetic parameters for all macrophyte species. No significant effects of radiation were observed for the consumers in the microcosms, however trends indicate the potential for longer-term effects. We also witnessed a different response of Daphnia magna and Lemna minor compared to previous single-species studies, illustrating the importance of multispecies studies, which aim to encompass systems more realistic to natural ecosystems. Microcosms allowed us to isolate specific relationships between interacting species in an ecosystem and test the effects, both direct and indirect, of radiation on them. In addition, the ecological pathways and processes, and the experimental design itself, was central to understanding the results we witnessed. This type of study is important for radioecology research that has been very much limited to high dose rates and single species studies. This approach to radioecology has been strongly promoted in recent decades and, to our knowledge, this is the first microcosm study performed at dose rates similar to those at contaminated field sites.

Although atmospheric stability for both sites (50 km apart) was shown to be governed by similar synoptic conditions, their contrasting settings caused differences in mixing conditions for each stability category. At the urban sub-Alpine site Ljubljana, situated within a topographic basin, wind speeds associated with the most stable conditions were 0.2-0.3 m s(-1). By comparison, corresponding wind speeds for the near-coastal sub-Mediterranean site Ajdovscina, located at the foothills of the Trnovski gozd barrier, were 0-0.2 m s(-1). The wind direction at Ljubljana under stable conditions (similar to 80 degrees) was consistent with drainage flow into the basin along the Sava River valley. The corresponding wind direction at Ajdovscina was 20-40 degrees, consistent with gentle katabatic drainage from the flanks of the Trnovski gozd barrier. After removing fetch effects on radon variability at each site, a large contrast in local contributions to the radon signal was noted: the diurnal amplitude of the local radon signal increased from similar to 24 Bq m(-3) at Ljubljana to similar to 47 Bq m(-3) at Ajdovscina. This difference was attributed to a greater nocturnal radon accumulation rate at Ajdovscina (3.5 Bq m(-3) h(-1) vs 2.1 Bq m(-3) h(-1)) due to higher radon fluxes from flysch and carbonate rocks compared to the sea and lake sediments in the Ljubljana Basin. The ability of radon to consistently distinguish subtle changes in atmospheric mixing at sites with contrasting topographic settings indicates that it will be a powerful tool for characterising air quality in these complex environments. Specifically, diurnal radon cycles indicate that the capability of the atmosphere to dilute primary pollutants is considerably less in the basin environment.

In this sense, much effort is dedicated to identify reef resilience indicators and traits, the restoration and protection of which can promote coral reef recovery following degradation. Here we examine two widely studied reef resilience traits, i.e. coral recruitment and structural complexity, and potential links between the two on different spatial scales that may be used to promote reef resilience by active restoration. Specifically, we explore the use of structural complexity enhancement (SCE; artificially increasing the complexity of a degraded reef by adding structures to it) as a potential restoration tool for increasing coral recruitment. Our SCE experiments resulted in an increase of 400-600% in coral recruitment, which was correlated with some of the spatial scales of complexity. From a management perspective, the current study supports the idea that, under certain circumstances, SCE may serve as an effective restoration tool to enhance coral recruitment, which could be an alternative or addition to coral transplantation. The results also emphasize the importance of measuring and enhancing structural complexity on different spatial scales (from mm to m) for the promotion of different functional groups (e.g. corals and fish). This approach, if further developed, may serve as a key element in restoration projects of structurally degraded coral reefs.

Macroinvertebrate diversity and rarity in non-glacial Alpine streams	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Aquatic macroinvertebrates; Dispersal; Stream headwaters; Species abundance distribution; Community ecology; Rarity	ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; PHYSICO-CHEMISTRY; BETA-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; DISPERSAL; HABITAT; RIVER; CHIRONOMIDAE; VARIABILITY; ABUNDANCE	Alpine landscapes are being transformed through the rapid recession of glaciers, resulting in the development of numerous non-glacial headwater streams inhabited by a diverse assemblage of macroinvertebrates. We examined spatial patterns in biodiversity and rarity of macroinvertebrates in 41 non-glacial streams from five glacierized catchments in the Swiss Alps undergoing rapid glacial recession over the last decades. Water physico-chemistry and food resources (periphyton, benthic organic matter) varied widely among streams within each catchment, while no significant differences occurred among catchments. Variability in community composition was similar among streams within each catchment but differed among catchments, reflecting differences in catchment-scale species pools due to biogeographical context and season. Overall, 101 taxa from ca 33,000 individuals collected were identified in the streams with 7-33 taxa found in individual streams. Some 64% of the taxa comprised less than 5% of the total abundances at the streams (rare in abundance) with 78% of the taxa being represented by less than 5% of the most common taxon (Baetis sp.), whereas 47% of the taxa were found in less than 10% of the streams (rare in distribution). No taxon was found at all sites (maximum presence at 85% of the sites), while 15% of the taxa were found at 50% of the sites or more. However, analyzing the rank-abundance distribution showed that rarity was less prevalent than previously shown in other ecosystems. The results indicated that community assembly of alpine headwater streams is a complex interaction between environmental properties (habitat filtering), habitat stability coupled with dispersal (source sink dynamics), and time since deglaciation (island biogeography). Integrating these processes is essential towards understanding ongoing colonization events in headwater streams of alpine catchments as glaciers continue to recede.	[Alther, R.; Robinson, C.

We examined how wind, a poorly studied abiotic factor, affects the distribution and abundance of two aphid species, Uroleucon aeneum and Brachycaudus cardui (hereafter black and green aphids, respectively), that live on the thistle Carduus thoermeri (Asteraceae) in a windy region of Patagonia, Argentina. First, considering the prevailing wind direction, we described the distribution of both aphid species around plant stems. Then, we performed a bi-factorial experiment in which we cut stems with aphids to manipulate their position respect to wind (exposed/unexposed) and to control wind incidence (protected/unprotected). Finally, using the species most affected by wind, we examined possible mechanisms through which wind could affect aphids. Both aphid species were less abundant on the side of the stem exposed to wind respect to the unexposed side; and this pattern was stronger for the black aphid. When black aphids were positioned exposed to wind and without protection, their proportion changed towards the unexposed side of the stem; while green aphids showed a weaker response to wind. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that wind triggered both the detachment of black aphids and their movement towards the unexposed side of the stem. Our results showed that wind can explain the asymmetric distribution of aphids around plants and that stems can act as windbreaks. In a less windy future scenario, aphids could expand their foraging area, reaching higher infestation rates, which could affect their role in structuring ant assemblages and their status as crop pests. This work highlights the importance of testing the effects of less studied abiotic factors to fully understand how climate change could impact on the abundance and distribution of animals in the future.

The manner in which species are vertically stratified in these complex habitats is not known, with lack of nest sites being proposed to limit ant populations. Here, we assess ant community stratification and nest site limitation in a lowland rainforest in New Guinea using experimental addition of artificial bamboo nests of two cavity sizes (small: similar to 12 mm large: similar to 32 mm diameter) placed at ground level, in the understorey, and in the canopy. We also conducted a pilot experiment to test the utility of nest translocation. Nests were checked for occupancy after 10 weeks and half of the occupied nests were then translocated between forest plots, while keeping same vertical position. Occupancy of small nests was much higher in the understorey and canopy than at ground level (similar to 75% vs. similar to 25%). Translocation was successful, as a majority of nests was inhabited by the same species before and after translocation and there was no impact of translocation to a different plot compared to the control, except for a reduction in colony size at ground level. Our experiment demonstrates a vertical stratification in community composition of ants nesting in hollow dead cavities and shows that these ants are more nest site limited in the higher strata than at ground level. Use of small artificial cavities has great potential for future experimental studies, especially for those focused on arboreal ants, as occupancy is high and translocation does not negatively affect their colony size. in Tok Pisin is available with online material.

Previous studies indicate that species endemism is related to both past and modern climate, but studies of phylogenetic endemism are relatively rare and mainly focused on smaller regions. Here, we provide the first assessment of the patterns of species and phylogenetic endemism in angiosperm trees across the Northern Hemisphere as well as the relative importance of modern climate and glacial-interglacial climate change as drivers of these patterns. Location Northern Hemisphere. Major taxa Angiosperm trees. Methods Using tree assemblages at the scale of 100 km x 100 km grid cells and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models, we assessed the relationships between species endemism, phylogenetic endemism and modern climate variables, Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present temperature velocity. Results Species and phylogenetic endemism were associated with both modern climate and glacial-interglacial climate change, with higher values in areas with stable historical climate and warmer and wetter modern conditions. Notably, the multivariate SAR analyses showed that the combinations of variables with highest Akaike's information criterion (AIC) weight always included both LGM-present climate instability and modern climate, that is, modern precipitation and temperature. Main conclusions Our results show that high phylogenetic endemism is partially dependent on long-term climate stability, highlighting the threat posed by future climate changes to the preservation of rare, phylogenetically distinct lineages of trees.

Despite the increasing availability of geo-referenced trait observations, current databases are still insufficient to cover all vegetation types and environmental conditions. In parallel, the growing number of continuous eddy-covariance observations of energy and CO2 fluxes has enabled modellers to optimize TBMs with these data. Past attempts to optimize TBM parameters mostly focused on model performance, overlooking the ecological properties of ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess the ecological consistency of optimized trait-related parameters while improving the model performances for gross primary productivity (GPP) at sites. Location Worldwide. Time period 1992-2012. Major taxa studied Trees and C-3 grasses. Methods We optimized parameters of the ORCHIDEE model against 371 site-years of GPP estimates from the FLUXNET network, and we looked at global covariation among parameters and with climate. Results The optimized parameter values were shown to be consistent with leaf-scale traits, in particular, with well-known trade-offs observed at the leaf level, echoing the leaf economic spectrum theory. Results showed a marked sensitivity of trait-related parameters to local bioclimatic variables and reproduced the observed relationships between traits and climate. Main conclusions Our approach validates some biological processes implemented in the model and enables us to study ecological properties of vegetation at the canopy level, in addition to some traits that are difficult to observe experimentally. This study stresses the need for: (a) implementing explicit trade-offs and acclimation processes in TBMs; (b) improving the representation of processes to avoid model-specific parameterization; and (c) performing systematic measurements of traits at FLUXNET sites in order to gather information on plant ecophysiology and plant diversity, together with micro-meteorological conditions.

We tested these two hypotheses in a phylogeographic study of Rhodiola sect. Prainia, a monophyletic section with ecologically divergent lineages. Molecular data from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer, six plastid markers and 13 nuclear microsatellite loci were analyzed for 240 individuals from 19 populations of this section. Environmental data were used to analyze the niches of major phylogenetic lineages within this section and to model changes in their distributions since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We found that Rhodiola sect. Prainia consists of three evolutionary lineages: all populations of R. stapfii, R. prainii populations at the southern edge of the QTP, and R. prainii populations in the interior part of the QTP. During the LGM, the survival of R. prainii in the interior part of the QTP corresponded with the in situ survival hypothesis, while R. stapfii most probably survived the LGM in a manner corresponding with the tabula rasa hypothesis. The evolutionary history of different lineages of this section was shaped by topography, climate change, and lineage-specific habitat preferences.

Today, drone-based methods offer new opportunities for plant size assessments. We tested crown variables derived from drone-based photogrammetry for predicting and scaling plant water use. In an oil palm agroforest and an oil palm monoculture plantation in lowland Sumatra, Indonesia, tree and oil palm water use rates were measured by sap flux techniques. Simultaneously, aerial images were taken from an octocopter equipped with an Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We used the structure from motion approach to compute several crown variables such as crown length, width, and volume. Crown volumes for both palms (69%) and trees (81%) explained much of the observed spatial variability in water use; however, the specific crown volume model differed between palms and trees and there was no single linear model fitting for both. Among the trees, crown volume explained more of the observed variability than stem diameter, and in consequence, uncertainties in stand level estimates resulting from scaling were largely reduced. For oil palms, an appropriate whole-plant size-related predictor variable was thus far not available. Stand level transpiration estimates in the studied oil palm agroforest were lower than those in the oil palm monoculture, which is probably due to the small-statured trees. In conclusion, we consider drone-derived crown metrics very useful for the scaling from single plant water use to stand-level transpiration.

With warming and drought during the growing season, insect-driven defoliation is expected to increase in frequency and severity with potential broad-scale impacts on tundra ecosystem functioning. Here we provide the first broad-scale reconstruction of spatio-temporal dynamics of past insect outbreaks by assessing their effects on shrub growth along a typical Greenlandic fjord climate gradient from the inland ice to the sea. Location Nuuk Fjord (64 degrees 30 ' N/51 degrees 23 ' W) and adjacent areas, West Greenland. Taxa Great brocade (Eurois occulta L.) and grey willow (Salix glauca L.). Methods We combined dendro-anatomical and remote sensing analyses. Time series of ring width (RW) and wood-anatomical traits were obtained from chronologies of >40 years established from 153 individuals of S. glauca collected at nine sites. We detected anomalies in satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) related to defoliation and reconstructed past changes in photosynthetic activity across the region. Results We identified outbreaks as distinctive years with reduced RW, cell-wall thickness and vessel size, without being directly related to climate but matching with years of parallel reduction in NDVI. The two subsequent years after the defoliation showed a significant increase in RW. The reconstructed spatio-temporal dynamics of these events indicate substantial regional variation in outbreak intensity linked to the climate variability across the fjord system. Main conclusions Our results highlight the ability of S. glauca to cope with severe insect defoliation by changing carbon investment and xylem conductivity leading to high resilience and rapid recovery after the disturbance. Our multiproxy approach allows us to pinpoint biotic drivers of narrow ring formation and to provide new broad-scale insight on the C-budget and vegetation productivity of shrub communities in a widespread arctic ecosystem.

Monitoring these losses can help guide mitigation efforts. In most studies, sampling strategies predominantly rely on collecting animal and vegetal specimens. Although these techniques produce valuable data, they are invasive, time-consuming and typically permit only limited spatial and temporal replication. There is need for the development of complementary methods. As observed in other ecosystems, freshwater environments host animals that emit sounds, either to communicate or as a by-product of their activity. The main freshwater soniferous groups are amphibians, fish, and macroinvertebrates (mainly Coleoptera and Hemiptera, but also some Decapoda, Odonata, and Trichoptera). Biophysical processes such as flow or sediment transport also produce sounds, as well as human activities within aquatic ecosystems. Such animals and processes can be recorded, remotely and autonomously, and provide information on local diversity and ecosystem health. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an emerging method already deployed in terrestrial environments that uses sounds to survey environments. Key advantages of PAM are its non-invasive nature, as well as its ability to record autonomously and over long timescales. All these research topics are the main aims of ecoacoustics, a new scientific discipline investigating the ecological role of sounds. In this paper, we review the sources of sounds present in freshwater environments. We then underline areas of research in which PAM may be helpful emphasising the role of PAM for the development of ecoacoustics. Finally, we present methods used to record and analyse sounds in those environments. Passive acoustics represents a potentially revolutionary development in freshwater ecology, enabling continuous monitoring of dynamic bio-physical processes to inform conservation practitioners and managers.

Self-thinning and size-dependent flowering of the grass Spartina alterniflora across space and time	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						allometry; saltmarsh; self-thinning; sexual reproduction; size-dependent; trade-offs; vegetative growth	REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; CLONAL INTEGRATION; PLANT HEIGHT; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; DENSITY RELATIONSHIP; THRESHOLD SIZE; REACTION NORMS; MASS-DENSITY; GROWTH	Plants adjust their size and reproductive effort in response to numerous selection pressures and constraints. The self-thinning law describes a well-known trade-off between size and density. Plants also trade-off investment into growth vs. sexual reproduction, as described by life-history theory. We build on past work on plant allometry and life history by examining both self-thinning and size-dependent reproduction in a single plant species, the saltmarsh grass Spartina alterniflora, across a wide range of settings: three landscape positions, two habitats and eight sites, across sixteen years. Plants in different landscape positions and years varied tremendously in size and shoot density. However, all this variation could be explained by a single allometric relationship consistent with the self-thinning law, but with a lower slope. Flowering was size-dependent, and the size at which plants had a 50% probability of flowering varied among habitat, sites and years. Plants that were stressed reproduced at a smaller size than plants that were growing under good conditions, and this pattern was consistent among habitat, sites and years. Finally, reproductive biomass and the proportion of shoots flowering increased with increasing vegetative size (plant height or shoot biomass). Combining these two patterns, S. alterniflora plants growing high density are small and reproduce at a smaller size than large plants growing at low density. Although there is tremendous spatial and temporal variation in S. alterniflora growth and reproductive patterns, all this variation can be understood as resulting from two simple allometric trade-offs. Because saltmarsh plants often occur in monospecific stands, they may serve as simple, model systems for studies of plant life history.

Methods to analyze trajectories have developed in parallel, but many tools fail to make an immediate connection between a movement model, covariates of the movement, and animal space use.MethodsHere I develop a novel method based on the Brownian Bridge Movement Model that facilitates investigating and testing covariates of movement. The model makes it possible to flexibly investigate different covariates including, for example, periodic movement patterns.ResultsI applied the Brownian Bridge Covariates Model (BBCM) to simulated trajectories demonstrating its ability to reproduce the parameters used for the simulation. I also applied the model to a GPS trajectory of a meerkat, showing its application to empirical data. The value of the model was shown by testing the interaction between maximal daily temperature and the daily movement pattern.ConclusionThis model produces accurate parameter estimates for covariates of the movements and location error in simulated trajectories. Application to the meerkat trajectory also produced plausible parameter estimates. This new method opens the possibility to directly test hypotheses about the influence of covariates on animal movement while linking these to space-use estimates.

In order to project future plausible scenarios of marine biodiversity at the scale of the whole Mediterranean basin, the current challenge is to develop an explicit representation of the multispecies spatial dynamics under the combined influence of fishing pressure and climate change. Not with standing the advanced state-of-the-art modeling of food webs in the region, no previous studies have projected the consequences of climate change on marine ecosystems in an integrated way, considering changes in ocean dynamics, in phyto- and zoo-plankton productions, shifts in Mediterranean species distributions and their trophic interactions at the whole basin scale. We used an integrated modeling chain including a high-resolution regional climate model, a regional biogeochemistry model and a food web model OSMOSE to project the potential effects of climate change on biomass and catches for a wide array of species in the Mediterranean Sea. We showed that projected climate change would have large consequences for marine biodiversity by the end of the 21st century under a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5 with current fishing mortality). The total biomass of high trophic level species (fish and macroinvertebrates) is projected to increase by 5 and 22% while total catch is projected to increase by 0.3 and 7% by 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, respectively. However, these global increases masked strong spatial and inter-species contrasts. The bulk of increase in catch and biomass would be located in the southeastern part of the basin while total catch could decrease by up to 23% in the western part. Winner species would mainly belong to the pelagic group, are thermophilic and/or exotic, of smaller size and of low trophic level while loser species are generally large-sized, some of them of great commercial interest, and could suffer from a spatial mismatch with potential prey subsequent to a contraction or shift of their geographic range. Given the already poor conditions of exploited resources, our results suggest the need for fisheries management to adapt to future changes and to incorporate climate change impacts in future management strategy evaluation.

The distribution of novel bacterial laccases in alpine paleosols is directly related to soil stratigraphy	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Paleosols; Stratigraphy; Laccase; Metagenome	ALKALI-STABLE LACCASE; COPPER; METAGENOMICS; DEGRADATION; DIVERSITY	Bacterial laccases are now known to be abundant in soil and to function outside of the cell facilitating the bacterial degradation of lignin. In this study we wanted to test the hypotheses that: i) Such enzymes can be identified readily in stratified paleosols using metagenomics approaches, ii) The distribution of these genes as potential 'public good' proteins in soil is a function of the soil environment, iii) Such laccase genes can be readily retrieved and expressed in E. coli cloning systems to demonstrate that de novo assembly processes can be used to obtain similar metagenome-derived enzyme activities. To test these hypotheses, in silico gene-targeted assembly was employed to identify genes encoding novel type B two-domain bacterial laccases from alpine soil metagenomes sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. The genes obtained from different strata were heterologously cloned, expressed and the gene products were shown to be active against two classical laccase substrates. The use of a metagenome-driven pipeline to obtain such active biocatalysts has demonstrated the potential for gene mining to be applied systematically for the discovery of such enzymes. These data ultimately further demonstrate the application of soil pedology methods to environmental enzyme discovery. As an interdisciplinary effort, we can now establish that paleosols can serve as a useful source of novel biocatalytic enzymes for various applications. We also, for the first time, link soil stratigraphy to enzyme profiling for widespread functional gene activity in paleosols. Crown Copyright (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Springs drive downstream nitrate export from artificially-drained agricultural headwater catchments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agricultural land-use; Groundwater; Headwater catchments; Nitrate-nitrogen flux; Subsurface drainage	SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; WATER-QUALITY; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; NEW-ZEALAND; NITROGEN; NUTRIENT; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION; STREAMS; LOSSES	Excessive nutrient loading from small agricultural headwaters can substantially degrade downstream water quality and ecological conditions. But, our understanding of the scales and locations to implement nutrient attenuation tools within these catchments is poor. To help inform farm- and catchment-scale management, we quantified nitrate export in nine one-kilometre-long lowland agricultural headwaters fed by tile and open tributary drains in a region with high groundwater nitrate (<1 to >15 mg L-1 NO3-N) over four years. Across-catchment differences in upstream spring water nitrate concentrations predicted differences in annual nitrate loads at catchment outlets (range <1-72 megagrams NO3-N 365 d(-1)), and nitrate loads were higher in wet seasons and wet years, reflecting strong groundwater influences. Partitioning the sources of variability in catchment nitrate fluxes revealed that similar to 60% of variation was accounted for by a combination of fluxes from up-stream springs and contributions from tile and open tributary drains (46% and 15%, respectively), with similar to 40% of unexplained residual variation likely due to groundwater upwellings. Although tile and open tributary drains contributed comparatively less to catchment loads (tile drains: <0.01 and up to 50 kg NO3-N d(-1); open drains: <5 kg and up to 100 kg NO3-N d(-1)), mitigation targeted at these localised, farm- scale sources will contribute to decreasing downstream nitrate fluxes. However, high nitrate loads from groundwater mean current NO3-N waterway management and rehabilitation practices targeting waterway stock exclusion by fencing alone will be insufficient to reduce annual NO3-N export. Moreover, managing catchment nutrient fluxes will need to acknowledge contributions from groundwater as well as farm-scale losses from land. Overall, our results highlight how nutrient fluxes in spring-fed waterways can be highly dynamic, dominated more by groundwater than local run-off, and point to the scales and locations where nitrate attenuation tools should be implemented.

Minimization of dissolved methane, nitrogen and organic micropollutants emissions of effluents from a methanogenic reactor by using a preanoxic MBR post-treatment system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Greenhouse gas; UASB; Hybrid bioreactor; Methane oxidation; Denitrification; Organic micropollutants	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; CARE PRODUCTS PPCPS; BISPHENOL-A; NITRITATION-ANAMMOX; MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR; OXIDIZING BACTERIA; REMOVAL; DENITRIFICATION; TRANSFORMATION; NITRIFICATION	The use of a hybrid membrane bioreactor (MBR) post-treatment system is proposed as a cost-efficient technology in order to minimize the environmental impact of anaerobic effluents, treating low-strength sewage at room temperature, such as their high nitrogen content and the presence of dissolved methane. In this research, nitrite was externally added at different concentrations into the anoxic compartment, providing an extra electron acceptor besides the existing nitrate, to evaluate its effect on denitrification, methane oxidation and OMPs removal processes. The nitrite addition significantly improved the denitrification potential of the system, achieving nitrogen removals up to 35 mg TN L-1. Moreover, higher nitrite concentrations clearly promoted an increase in the removal of some organic micropollutants (OMPs) such as diclofenac (DCF), ethinylestradiol (EE2), triclosan (TCS) and ibuprofen (IBP). Nevertheless, methane removal efficiencies or rates were not affected by this fact. Finally, COD and ammonium removals higher than 99 and 91% were observed during the entire operation, respectively. Based on the results, a future strategy in which ammonium is partially oxidized to nitrite could result in better nitrogen and OMPs removals for the proposed technology. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The main aims of this study were to 1) describe the concentrations and patterns of essential and toxic elements measured in maternal whole blood during pregnancy; 2) identify dietary, lifestyle and sociodemographic determinants of element status; and 3) explore the impact of iron deficiency on blood element concentrations. Methods: This study is based on blood samples collected from 2982 women in gestational week 18 in The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study (MoBa) which were analyzed as part of the Norwegian Environmental Biobank. We derived blood element patterns by exploratory factor analysis, and associations between blood element patterns and diet were explored using sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression. Results: Blood concentrations were determined for the essential elements (in the order of most abundant) Zn > Cu > Se > Mn > Mo > Co, and the toxic metals Pb > As > Hg > Cd > Tl. The concentrations were in ranges that were similar to or sometimes more favorable than in other pregnant and non-pregnant European women. We identified two blood element patterns; one including Zn, Se and Mn and another including Hg and As. For the Zn-Se-Mn pattern, use of multimineral supplements was the most important dietary determinant, while a high score in the Hg-As pattern was mainly determined by seafood consumption. Concentrations of Mn, Cd and Co were significantly higher in women with iron deficiency (plasma ferritin < 12 mu g/L) than in women with plasma ferritin >= 12 mu g/L. Conclusion: Our study illustrates complex relationships and coexistence of essential and toxic elements. Their potential interplay adds to the challenges of studies investigating health effects related to either diet or toxicants. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Wastewater treatment plants efficiently remove microplastics from sewage, trapping the particles in the sludge and preventing their entrance into aquatic environments. Treatment plants are essentially taking the microplastics out of the waste water and concentrating them in the sludge, however. It has become common practice to use this sludge on agricultural soils as a fertilizer. The aim of the current research was to evaluate the microplastic contamination of soils by this practice, assessing the implications of successive sludge applications by looking at the total count of microplastic particles in soil samples. Thirty-one agricultural fields with different sludge application records and similar edaphoclimatic conditions were evaluated. Field records of sludge application covered a ten year period. For all fields, historical disposal events used the same amount of sludge (40 ton ha(-1) dry weight). Extraction of microplastics was done by flotation and particles were then counted and classified with the help of a microscope. Seven sludge samples were collected in the fields that underwent sludge applications during the study period. Soils where 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 applications of sludge had been performed had a median of 1.1, 1.6, 1.7, 2.3, and 3.5 particles g(-1) dry soil, respectively. There were statistical differences in the microplastic contents related to the number of applications that a field had undergone (1, 2, 3 < 4, 5). Microplastic content in sludge ranged from 18 to 41 particles g(-1), with a median of 34 particles g(-1). The majority of the observed microplastics were fibers (90% in sludge, and 97% in soil). Our results indicate that microplastic counts increase over time where successive sludge applications are performed. Microplastics observed in soil samples stress the relevance of sludge as a driver of soil microplastic contamination. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hydrology induces intraspecific variation in freshwater fish morphology under contemporary and future climate scenarios	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Cyprinidae; Geometric morphometrics; Hydrology; Trait variability	STREAM FISH; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; LOCAL ADAPTATION; BODY SHAPE; RESPONSES; FLOW; DIVERGENCE; EVOLUTION; LAKE	Predicting future changes in habitat-associated species traits is an important step in understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change. However, models projecting phenotypic responses to future climate change typically assume populations will respond similarly across the range of a species, while local adaptation and spatial variation in environmental changes are rarely considered. In this study, among-population phenotypic variability was coupled with geographic variation in anticipated hydrologic changes to examine patterns of population-level phenotypic changes expected under future climatic change. To estimate phenotypic responses to watershed hydrology, phenotype-environment associations between body shape and contemporary streamflow were quantified among populations of six species of fishes (Cyprinidae). Future streamflow estimates (2070-2099) were then used to project body shapes within populations, assuming the same phenotype-environment relationships. All species exhibited significant associations between body shape and contemporary streamflow discharge and variability. However, these relationships were not consistent, even among species occupying similar vertical positions in the water column. When these phenotype-environment relationships were projected into future streamflow conditions, populations are not expected to respond uniformly across the species' ranges, and all but one species exhibited projected morphologies outside of the current range of morphological variation. These findings suggest local adaptation and spatial heterogeneity in environmental changes interact to influence variation in the degree of expected phenotypic responses to climate change at both the species and population level.

Pollutant accumulation and delivery to coastal waters can be expected to increase, as lengthening dry spells will be increasingly punctuated by more extreme precipitation events. Coastal pollution exposes human populations to high levels of fecal bacteria and associated pathogens, which can cause a variety of health impacts. Consequently, studying the impact of atmospheric rivers as the mechanism generating pulses of water pollution in coastal areas is relevant for public health and in the context of climate change. We aimed to quantify the links between precipitation events and water quality in order to explore meteorological causes as first steps toward effective early warning systems for the benefit of population health in California and beyond. We used historical gridded daily precipitation and weekly multiple fecal bacteria indicators at similar to 500 monitoring locations in California's coastal waters to identify weekly associations between precipitation and water quality during 2003-09 using canonical correlation analysis to account for the nested/clustered nature of longitudinal data. We then quantified, using a recently published catalog of atmospheric rivers, the proportion of coastal pollution events attributable to ARs. Association between precipitation and fecal bacteria was strongest in Southern California. Over two-thirds of coastal water pollution spikes exceeding one standard deviation were associated with ARs. This work highlights the importance of skillful AR landfall predictions in reducing vulnerability to extreme weather improving resilience of human populations in a varying and changing climate. Quantifying the impacts of ARs on waterborne diseases is important for planning effective preventive strategies for public health. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Vertical flow constructed wetlands for decentralized wastewater treatment in Jordan: Optimization of total nitrogen removal	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Arid climate; Domestic wastewater; E. coli; Irrigation; Recirculation; Reuse	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DESIGN; RECIRCULATION; ELIMINATION; AERATION; SYSTEM; REUSE	The baseline performance of two full-scale vertical flow (VF) constructed wetlands operating in the arid climate of Jordan is presented in this study, within the context of the Jordanian Standards for reuse of treated wastewater. One system was a recirculating VF wetland, and the other was a single-pass two-stage VF wetland. Operational modifications were made to each treatment system, with the aim of improving Total Nitrogen (TN) removal. For the recirculating VF system, attached-growth media was added to the recirculation tank to provide increased surface area for growth of denitrifying bacteria. The modification showed a small but significant improvement in TN removal (8 mg/L less than the baseline phase; p = 0.004). Statistical analysis showed that 30% and 4.5% of the increase in compliance with the TN limits (Class A and Class B/C, respectively) could be attributed to the modification. The two-stage VF wetland was modified with a step-feeding line that introduced carbon-rich raw wastewater to the intermediate pump shaft just upstream of the second-stage filter. The modification also resulted in a small but significant improvement in TN removal (13 mg/L less than the baseline phase; p = 0.005). The increase in compliance with the TN standard due to the modification was estimated at 20% and 22% for Class A and B/C, respectively. The simple operational modifications proved to be effective for improving total nitrogen removal in arid climate VF wetland systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Decision-making and results of studies on effects of exposure to Hg depend on adequate estimation of [Hg] at the studied level, which in turn is sensitive to variation in [Hg] in sampling units. However, there is little information on how feather [Hg] varies within nestlings, between nest mates, or between broods. We sampled feathers from sibling great egret nestlings in three breeding colonies of the Everglades where birds were exposed to variable Hg levels through diet. We compared the deviation of samples from average [Hg] within four levels of aggregation: individual (different scapular feathers of the same individual); brood (samples from siblings in the same nest), breeding colonies; and the entire wetland ecosystem. We found, on average, little intra-individual (<2%) and intra-brood (<6%) differences in [Hg], and no effects of chick hatch order in feather [Hg]. Further, intra-brood variability was not statistically different from intra-individual variability in [Hg]. In contrast, there was much higher variation between broods within colonies (>20%) and within the entire wetland (>30%) that could bias estimates of exposure to Hg obtained through small sample sizes. We simulated the influence of inter-brood variability in estimates of exposure to Hg under different sample sizes, and we found that uncertainty decreases markedly with samples sizes >6, and suggest a sample size of 10 individuals from different nests for monitoring programs and to estimate Hg contamination in areas where no previous knowledge is available.

For this purpose, C. riparius larvae were exposed throughout their entire life cycle to sediments collected in three sites along the Saulx river in France, and the toxic effects were measured at different levels of biological organization: from the molecular (lipidomic analysis and transcriptional variations) to the whole organism response (respiration rate, shape markers and emergence rate). In the sediment characterized by an intermediate level of contamination with PAHs and phtalates, we detected an increase of the cell stress response and delayed emergence of males. In the group exposed to the most contaminated sediment with PAHs, phtalates and pesticides, genes related to endocrine pathways, cell stress response and biotransformation processes were overexpressed, while female wing shape was affected. Field-collected sediment exposure did not induce significant effects on mentum shape markers or on the lipid profile. The present study provides new insights into the multilevel effects of differentially contaminated sediments in insects. This integrative approach will certainly contribute to improved assessment of the risk that complex mixtures of pollutants pose to the aquatic ecosystem. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Use of antibacterial toothpaste is associated with higher urinary triclosan concentrations in Asian immigrant women living in Vancouver, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Triclosan; Toothpaste; Biomonitoring; Exposure; Personal care products	BISPHENOL-A; ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS; PREGNANT-WOMEN; HUMAN EXPOSURE; POPULATION; PHENOLS; VARIABILITY; PARABENS; TRICLOCARBAN; PREDICTORS	Background: Triclosan is an antibacterial added to consumer products including toothpastes, cosmetics, and plastic cutting boards. Known to disrupt reproductive and hormonal functioning in animals, epidemiological studies indicate that exposure to triclosan may have similar effects on human health. Methods: 100 women aged 19 to 45 years born in India or China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan new to the Vancouver (Canada) area were recruited in 2015-2016 by word of mouth, public advertisements, and contacts in health and cultural organizations. Participants completed an interview which queried potential sources of triclosan exposure at home and at work and their urine was tested for triclosan by GC-MS. Determinants of urinary triclosan were assessed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Triclosan was detected in 62% of urine samples, with an overall GM of 14.5 mu g/L (95% CI: 9.7-21.7 mu g/L; range: <LOD to 1900 mu g/L). Colgate Total (R) toothpaste users had higher urinary triclosan concentrations (median = 34.0 mu g/L) than non-users (median = 2.5 mu g/L, rho < 0.001), a result which was unaffected by adjustment for age, income, BMI, and country of birth. South Asian born women had elevated urinary triclosan compared to East Asian born women. Conclusion: Triclosan exposure via a specific antibacterial toothpaste brand was identified in reproductive age newcomer women in Canada.

Impacts of land use on an insectivorous tropical bat: The importance of mercury, physio-immunology and trophic position	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agriculture; Antioxidants; Deforestation; Landscape planning; Oxidative stress; Rice; Stable isotopes	ORYZA-SATIVA-L.; OXIDATIVE STRESS; METHYLMERCURY; BIOACCUMULATION; DIET; RISK; BUCHANNAN; ISOTOPES; TISSUES; FOREST	Deforestation, agricultural intensification, and habitat homogenization are critical threats to biodiversity in Southeast Asia. Limited information is available on the trophic and physiological responses of tropical animals to these environmental changes. The wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat Chaerephon plicatus is a cave roosting species that is experiencing population declines across Southeast Asia, where landscapes have been drastically modified. In our study site in central Thailand, we tested the hypothesis that wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bats living in landscapes that contrast in heterogeneity and land-use differed in mercury contamination, trophic position and physio-immunological status. Bats from less heterogeneous landscapes (dominated by rice crops, absence of large forest patches) occupied a lower trophic position than conspecifics from more heterogeneous landscapes (including large forest patches). Additionally, bats from these habitats had lower concentrations of mercury in erythrocytes, lower body mass, higher antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), lower antioxidant glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and lower values of the GPx/SOD ratio than bats from more heterogeneous landscapes. Individual bat mercury concentrations were positively correlated with body mass and two immune markers (lysozyme and immunoglobulin) but were negatively correlated with plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity. Our results suggest various links among landscape heterogeneity, mercury exposure/accumulation, and health status of wildlife in Southeast Asian countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mineral weathering; Bacteria; Hg mobilization; Sediment; Hg biosensor	DISSOLUTION; MINE; REDUCTION; TRANSPORT; STRAINS	Bioavailable mercury represents a major threat locally to wildlife and also contributes to the global Hg pool and cycling of Hg. In this study, we focused on bacterial mobilization of inorganic Hg contained in sediment collected from the river Idrijca near the site of UNESCO's Idrija Mercury Mine. At the lowest trophic level, bacteria have an important role in Hg mobilization due to the cumulative nature of Hg in the food chain. Ignoring the most commonly studied sulfate reducing and methanogenic bacteria, we focused, among others, on the ubiquitous mineral weathering bacteria, Bacillus and Pseudomonas, the nitrifying Nitrobacter sp., the nitrogen fixing Rhizobium and Azotobacter, the aerobic Brevundimonas and the exoelectrogenic Schewanella to examine their potential for the mobilization of total (tHg) and the bioavailable Hg (bHg) fraction. We showed that several bacterial groups are able to mobilize the less soluble formes of Hg, i.e. HgS and smelting calcine in the sediment, either via close contact between cells and sediment particles or by the cell-excreted exudates resulting in increased levels of tHg and bHg in solution or in the cell biomass. The diversity of bacterial groups capable of mobilizing Hg implies that many different more general pathways and consequently many mobilization mechanisms, are possible apart from the Hg specific routes. In particular, the bacterial groups Pseudomonas and Bacillus, with their mineral weathering capabilities, were shown to be able to increase or decrease the availability of bHg depending on the peculiarities of their respective metabolisms and the nature of their exposure to the river sediment. Additionally, we showed that accumulation of Hg in the biofilm biomass is one type of mechanism influencing the bioavailability of Hg and can act as a point at which the insoluble Hg can enter into the foodweb.

Previous results on trace metal concentrations in the Pyrenees, where extensive mining (Ag, Fe) occurred from the Antiquity to the 19th century, suggest that >= 600 tons of anthropogenic lead (Pb) is stored in soils in the Haut-Vicdessos area (France). Yet the potential bioavailability of this legacy contamination to contemporary biota remains unclear. Wetherefore asked if previously reported high-levels of legacy Pb can be seen in other environmental compartments including aquatic biota, and how these are distributed within the biota. Based on Pb-isotopic data, we also assessed if any Pb contamination found in contemporary biota can be linked to local/regional mining. Samples of sphagnum, soil, sediment, biofilm, and fish (Salmo trutta and Phoxinus phoxinus) were collected from three adjacent valleys in the Haut-Vicdessos area. Pb concentrations varied both between sites (i.e. decreasing concentrations with increasing distance from the former mine) and betweenwithin-site environmental compartments (i.e. soil > biofilm >= sediment > sphagnum > fish) as well as within organisms (i.e. entire organism N liver N muscle). Further, Pb-isotopic ratios (Pb-206/Pb-207, Pb-208/Pb-207 and Pb-208/Pb-206) measured in soil, biofilm, and fish indicated both natural (weathering bedrock) and anthropogenic (industrial, transportation and/or former mining activities) sources of Pb-deposition to the area. Generally, body Pb-concentrations were within regulatory guidelines, yet contemporary biota in the upper Haut-Vicdessos area, and their prey, still showed a large range of Pb isotopic signatures, of which former mining activities appeared to have a strong influence. Our study showed that mining derived legacy Pb continues to affect onsite biota even ifmining activities ceased >100 years ago, thus reflecting the long-lasting impact of human-environment interaction, suggesting that ecosystem conditions may remain impaired centuries after activities have ceased.

Effect of study area bathymetric heterogeneity on parameterization and performance of a depth-based geolocation model for demersal fishes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Archival tags; Demersal fish; Fish geolocation; Fish movement; Hidden Markov model; State-space model	COD GADUS-MORHUA; LIGHT-BASED GEOLOCATION; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ATLANTIC COD; MIGRATION PATTERNS; SEASONAL MOVEMENTS; PACIFIC HALIBUT; BALTIC SEA; GULF; TEMPERATURE	State-space geolocation models can provide valuable information on the large-scale movements of many fish species. The sensitivity of such complex models to model assumptions and fixed parameters is rarely assessed quantitatively, yet is important for interpretation of results and adaptation for new species and different geographic regions. We hypothesized that parameterization and performance of a discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with a Gaussian depth-based data likelihood for demersal fishes first implemented in the flat terrain of the North Sea would be affected by the more heterogeneous depths found in the North Pacific Ocean. We ran the HMM on depth data from simulated random walk movement trajectories in flat, sloping, and heterogeneous study areas in the North Pacific Ocean where known depth distributions in each model grid cell were provided by high-resolution (5 m) multibeam bathymetry data. Performance was compared among different data likelihood specifications and grid sizes in each area. We found that model performance decreased when grid cell depth distributions departed from normal distributions. Performance decreased with increasing grid size in the heterogeneous and sloping study areas but not the flat study area. A new method for specifying grid cell depth variance based on study area slope performed better than the standard method of obtaining variance from adjacent grid cell values for larger grid sizes in heterogeneous and sloping areas. Overall model performance was highest in the heterogeneous and sloping areas at small grid sizes and in the flat area at large grid sizes. The estimated value of diffusion was also sensitive to bathymetric heterogeneity and variance-specification method. These results suggest that the degree of study area heterogeneity should be considered when choosing fixed parameters such as likelihood and grid size, and when interpreting the model results. In addition, this approach demonstrates the need for sensitivity analyses when using the model on a new species and in a new study area.	[Nielsen, J. K.; Mueter, F. J.; Adkison, M.

One of the corner stones to successfully control them is to better estimate their dispersal capabilities. For flying insects, dispersal performance is commonly estimated through flight mill and mark-release-recapture experiments. However, each approach has its own bias, over- and under-estimating flying distances respectively. The objective of this study was to develop an individual-based dispersal model to circumvent these drawbacks. The shape of the dispersal kernel was calibrated on distances recorded in flight mill experiments (previously done) and then model parameters were fine-tuned based on mark-release-recapture experiments (presented in this study). The pine sawyer beetle, Monochamus galloprovincialis, was used as case study because it is the European vector of the invasive pine wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, recognized as one of the biggest threats to pine forests worldwide. The best fitted model to mark-release-recapture data was parameterized with a mean flying distance of 2000 m per day, which is consistent with flight mill data. It was used to further simulate the dispersal of 100 beetles in non-fragmented pine forests. The cumulative flight distance was 63 km on average at the end of their adult life stage, and the mean dispersal distance as the crow flies was of ca. 13 km. At the end of the maturation period, when most nematodes have been already transmitted to host pines via shoot feeding, about 80% of the insects were located at more than 500 m from the emergence point. These outcomes clearly question the relevance of clear-cut zones of 500 m radius required by the European regulation for the eradication of the invasive nematode. Such dispersal model could be used to support decision-making for eradication programs.

A young female left Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, Norway) on 26 March 2018 and reached Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, 76 days later, after travelling a cumulative distance of 3506 km, bringing her ca. 1789 km away (straight-line distance) from her natal area. The total cumulative distance travelled during the entire tracking period, starting when she left her natal area on 1 March 2018 and ending when she settled on Ellesmere Island on 1 July 2018, was 4415 km. This is among the longest dispersal events ever recorded for an Arctic fox. Crossing extensive stretches of sea ice and glaciers, the female moved at an average rate of 46.3 km/day +/- 41.1 SD. The maximum movement rate was 155 km/day and occurred on the ice sheet in northern Greenland. This is the fastest movement rate recorded for this species. The northernmost location recorded was on the sea ice off northern Greenland at a latitude of 84.7 degrees N. The Arctic fox was of the blue colour morph typical for coastal environments, where Arctic foxes are adapted to food webs without lemmings but with substantial inputs of marine food resources. The Arctic fox settled on Ellesmere Island in a food web with lemmings, thereby switching ecosystems. Our observation supports evidence of gene flow across Arctic regions, including those seasonally bridged by sea ice, found in studies of the circumpolar genetic structure of Arctic fox populations.

Comparative feeding behaviour of native and introduced terrestrial snails tracks their ecological impacts	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						Alien species; functional response; interspecific competition; non-indigenous species	CEPAEA-NEMORALIS GASTROPODA; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; LAND SNAILS; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; COMPETITION; PULMONATA; INVASION; SIZE; TEMPERATURE; PREDATION	A developing body of theory and empirical evidence suggest that feeding behaviour as measured by the functional response (FR) can assist researchers in assessing the relative potential, ecological impacts and competitive abilities of native and introduced species. Here, we explored the FRs of two land snails that occur in south-western Ontario, one native (Mesodon thyroidus) and one non-indigenous (Cepaea nemoralis) to Canada. The non-indigenous species appears to have low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities. Consistent with theory, while both species conformed to Type II functional responses, the native species had a significantly higher attack rate (5.30 vs 0.41, respectively) and slightly lower handling time (0.020 vs 0.023), and hence a higher maximum feeding rate (50.0 vs 43.5). The non-indigenous species exhibited a significantly longer time to contact for a variety of food types, and appeared less discriminating of paper that was offered as a non-food type. The non-indigenous species also ate significantly less food when in mixed species trials with the native snail. These feeding patterns match the known low ecological impact of the introduced snail and are consistent with the view that it is an inferior competitor relative to the native species. However, field experimentation is required to clarify whether the largely microallopatric distributions of the two species in south-western Ontario reflect competitive dominance by the native species or other factors such as habitat preference, feeding preferences or predator avoidance. The relative patterns of feeding behaviour and ecological impact are, however, fully in line with recent functional response theory and application.

Process-based models accounting for the effect of bioturbation are needed for the modelling of erosion dynamics. With this work, we explore whether the fundamental allometric principles of metabolic activity scaling with individual and population size may provide a framework to derive general patterns of bioturbation effect on cohesive sediment resuspension. Experimental flumes were used to test this scaling approach across different species of marine, soft-sediment bioturbators. The collected dataset encompasses a range of bioturbator functional diversity, individual densities, body sizes and overall population metabolic rates. Measurements were collected across a range of hydrodynamic stress from 0.02 to 0.25 Pa. Overall, we observed that bioturbators are able to slightly reduce the sediment resuspension at low hydrodynamic stress, whereas they noticeably enhance it at higher levels of stress. Along the whole hydrodynamic stress gradient, the quantitative effect of bioturbators on sediment resuspension can be efficiently described by the overall metabolic rate of the bioturbating benthic communities, with significant variations across the bioturbators' taxonomic and functional diversity. One of the tested species (the gallery-builder Polychaeta Hediste diversicolor) had an effect that was partially deviating from the general trend, being able to markedly reduce sediment resuspension at low hydrodynamic stress compared to other species. By combining bioturbators' influence with hydrodynamic force, we were able to produce a process-based model of biota-mediated sediment resuspension. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Quality control (QC) results are documented and, upon request, available to the customer. That has led many customers of analytical services to neglect the need for their own, laboratory independent, external QC for large geochemical mapping or monitoring projects. Here, based on recent examples from projects of the Geological Surveyor Norway, it is demonstrated how such an external QC procedure should look. Simple graphics are used to visualize QC results. R scripts for producing these graphics are provided. Despite of the laboratories' own internal QC procedures, a number of quality issues like time trends, sample mix-ups, concentration breaks between different batches due to the use of several instruments and excessive rounding of analytical results were detected. Thus, even in these times of accreditation, it is still a necessity to install project-level, laboratory independent, QC procedures in order to produce reliable and comparable datasets.

Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) has experienced an unprecedented forest retreat northward during the last century. Whether the response of growth to climate has dissimilar patterns at different altitudes, and what the "altitudinal trends" of forest development will be in the future, remains unclear. We dendroclimatically investigated the impacts of climate change on the growth of larch forests along an altitudinal gradient. In total, 721 trees from 25 forest stands, representing an altitudinal range from 400 to 950 m a.s.l. in the Great Xing'an Mountains, northeast Cbina, were sampled and used to develop tree-ring width chronologies. The results suggest that warming caused a dedine in larch growth at low altitude, while tree growth increased at high altitude. The growth-climate relationships indicate that October-February temperatures were positively correlated with larch growth at low- and high-altitude sites, but negatively correlated at medium-altitude sites (ca. 600-700 m a.s.l.). April-May (early spring) temperatures and October-January precipitation had positive effects on growth in general (ca. 75% of all sites). The effects of summer temperature/precipitation on larch growth at high-altitude sites were opposite to that at low-altitude sites. This change of response from significantly positive/negative correlation to significantly negative/ positive correlation occurred gradually along the altitudinal gradient. The relationships varied significantly with altitude both in the case of temperature (R-2 = 0.425, P < 0.001) and precipitation (R-2 = 0.613, P < 0.001). The shift in response of larch forest to changes in summer temperature and precipitation occurred in the areas with a mean annual temperature of ca. -4 degrees C and ca. -5 degrees C, respectively; larch growth at temperatures lower or higher than these thresholds was limited by temperature and precipitation, respectively.

Intraseasonal variation of E. coli and environmental covariates in two irrigation ponds in Maryland, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Water quality; E. coli; Regression tree; lrrigation water; Indicator bacteria	MICROBIAL WATER-QUALITY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; REGRESSION TREES; SURVIVAL; INACTIVATION; AERUGINOSA; BACTERIA; MATTER; GROWTH	The microbial quality of irrigation water is typically assessed by measuring the concentrations of E. coli in irrigation water reservoirs that are variable in space and time. E. coli concentrations are affected by water quality parameters that co-vary with E. coli concentrations and may be easily measured with currently available sensors. The objective of this work was to identify the most influential environmental covariates affecting E. coli concentrations during a three-month biweekly monitoring period within two irrigation ponds in Maryland during the summer of 2017. E. coli levels as well as sensor-based water quality parameters including turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved fluorescent organic matter, conductivity, and chlorophyll were measured at 23 and 34 locations in ponds 1 and 2, respectively. Regression tree analyses were used to determine the most influential water quality parameters for the prediction of E. coli levels. Correlations between E. coli and water quality covariates were not strong and were inconsistently significant. Shoreline sample locations had higher E. con concentrations than interior pond samples and significant differences were observed when comparing these two groups. Regression trees provided fairly accurate predictions of E. coli levels based on water quality parameters with R-2 values ranging from 0.70 to 0.93. Factors identified via the regression trees varied by sampling date but common leading covariates included cyanobacteria, organic matter, and turbidity. Results indicated environmental covariates, sensed either remotely or in situ, could be useful to delineate areas with different E. coli survival conditions across irrigation ponds and potentially other water bodies such as lakes, rivers, or bays.

Specifically, the aim of this work was to explore the socio-demographic, dietary, and lifestyle determinants of adipose tissue Cd concentrations. The study population is a subsample of GraMo cohort. Adipose tissue samples were intraoperatively collected from 226 adult volunteers recruited in two public hospitals from Granada, Spain. Cd concentrations in adipose tissue were analyzed by High-Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS). Data on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, diet and health status were collected by face-to-face interviews. Predictors of Cd concentrations were assessed by multivariable linear regression with a stepwise variable selection. We found detectable levels of Cd in the adipose tissue of all the study participants, with a mean concentration (+/- standard deviation) of 12.66 +/- 18.91 mu g/kg. Smoking habit at recruitment was associated with increased adipose tissue Cd concentrations (beta for smokers - 0.669 p < 0.001; beta for former smokers - 0.502, p < 0.001; reference non-smokers). Age was positively associated with Cd concentrations (beta = 0.014, p < 0.001), and men showed lower concentrations than women (beta -0.424, p < 0.001). Obesity, measured as Body Mass Index (BMI). showed an inverse association with Cd concentrations (beta = -0.038, p < 0.001). Egg consumption >= 2 portions/week (beta = 0.241, p = 0.025) was positively associated with Cd concentrations. Perceived exposure to paints was also positively associated with Cd concentrations. The observed associations with age, smoking habit, BMI, and egg and meat consumption did not substantially change after sex/gender stratification. Our results are consistent with currently-known Cd sources and suggest other potential pathways, which might be population-specific. As a whole, our findings underline the potential relevance of adipose tissue as a biological matrix for exposure characterization to Cd, as well as for the assessment of long-term clinical implications of the exposure, particularly in obesity-related diseases.

Evaluation of 16S next-generation sequencing of hypervariable region 4 in wastewater samples: An unsuitable approach for bacterial enteric pathogen identification	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Wastewater; Next-generation sequencing; 16S rRNA; V4; Greengenes; Enterobacteriaceae	RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENE; SEWAGE-TREATMENT PLANTS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; DIVERSITY; DEGRADATION; SALMONELLA; STRAINS; TOLUENE; SEARCH	Recycled wastewater can carry human-infectious microbial pathogens and therefore wastewater treatment strategies must effectively eliminate pathogens before recycled wastewater is used to supplement drinking and agricultural water supplies. This study characterised the bacterial composition of four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (three waste stabilisation ponds and one oxidation ditch WWTP using activated sludge treatment) in Western Australia. The hypervariable region 4 (V4) of the bacterial 16S rRNA (16S) gene was sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences were pre-processed in USEARCH v10.0 and denoised into zero-radius taxonomic units (ZOTUs) with UNOISE3. Taxonomy was assigned to the ZOTUs using QIIME 2 and the Greengenes database and cross-checked with the NCBI nr/nt database. Bacterial composition of all WWTPs and treatment stages (influent, intermediate and effluent) were dominated by Proteobacteria (29.0-87.4%), particularly Betaproteobacteria (9.0-53.5%) and Gamrnaproteobacteria (8.6-34.6%). Nitrifying bacteria (Nitrospira spp.) were found only in the intermediate and effluent of the oxidation ditch WWTP, and denitrifying and floc-forming bacteria were detected in all WWTPs, particularly from the families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclales. Twelve pathogens were assigned taxonomy by the Greengenes database, but comparison of sequences from genera and families known to contain pathogens to the NCBI nr/nt database showed that only three pathogens (Arcobacter venerupis, Laribacter hongkongensis and Neisseria canis) could be identified in the dataset at the V4 region. Importantly, Enterobacteriaceae genera could not be differentiated. Family level taxa assigned by Greengenes database agreed with NCBI nr/nt in most cases, however, BLAST analyses revealed erroneous taxa in Greengenes database. This study highlights the importance of validating taxonomy of NGS sequences with databases such as NCBI nr/nt, and recommends including the V3 region of 16S in future short amplicon NGS studies that aim to identify bacterial enteric pathogens, as this will improve taxonomic resolution of most, but not all, Enterobacteriaceae species.

We used linear models to investigate the effect of trapping season, feeding habits (delta C-13), food availability from marine and terrestrial ecosystems (reindeer carcasses and sea ice cover), sex, age and body condition on liver total Hg (THg) levels. Liver THg levels increased in arctic foxes with 7.2% (95% CI: 2.3, 9.6) per year when the concentrations were adjusted for variation of delta C-13, sea ice cover, and reindeer carcasses, whereas the raw annual trend was 3.5% (CI: -0.11, 72). However, the THg levels in arctic foxes from Svalbard are still lower than other marine mammals. We also demonstrate that arctic fox terrestrial food consumption is important for lowering the overall THg levels in this species. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of the neonicotinoid imiacloprid on gene expression and DNA methylation in the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						epigenetics; methylome; RNA-seq; BS-seq; social insects; pesticide	CHRONIC EXPOSURE; SOCIAL INSECTS; GENOME-WIDE; R PACKAGE; BEE; TRANSCRIPTOME; EVOLUTION; METHYLOME; CONSERVATION; EPIGENETICS	Neonicotinoids are effective insecticides used on many important arable and horticultural crops. They are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists which disrupt the function of insect neurons and cause paralysis and death. In addition to direct mortality, there are numerous sublethal effects of low doses of neonicotinoids on bees. We hypothesize that some of these large array of effects could be a consequence of epigenetic changes in bees induced by neonicotinoids. We compared whole methylome (BS-seal) and RNA-seal libraries of the brains of buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers exposed to field-realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid to libraries from control workers. We found numerous genes which show differential expression between neonicotinoid-treated bees and control bees, but no differentially methylated cytosines in any context. We found CpG methylation to be focused mainly in exons and associated with highly expressed genes. We discuss the implications of our results for future legislation.	[Bebane, P. S.

Ancient historical events are thought to play a fundamental role in configuring bioregions, but the effects of more recent events on these regional biotas are largely unknown. We used a network approach to identify regional and sub-regional faunas of European Carabus beetles and developed a method to explore the relative contribution of dispersal barriers, niche similarities and phylogenetic history on their configuration. We identify a transition zone matching the limit of the ice sheets at the Last Glacial Maximum. While southern species pools are mostly separated by dispersal barriers, in the north species are mainly sorted by their environmental niches. Strikingly, most phylogenetic structuration of Carabus faunas occurred during the Pleistocene. Our results show how extreme recent historical events-such as Pleistocene climate cooling, rather than just deep-time evolutionary processes-can profoundly modify the composition and structure of geographical species pools.

Endometrial recognition of pregnancy occurs in the grey short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						recognition of pregnancy; marsupial; pregnancy; placenta; implantation	ESTROUS-CYCLE; MATERNAL RECOGNITION; GENE-EXPRESSION; TAMMAR WALLABY; EVOLUTION; PLACENTA; TRANSCRIPTOME; CONCEPTUS; OVULATION; PROTEINS	In human pregnancy, recognition of an embryo within the uterus is essential to support the fetus through gestation. In most marsupials, such as the opossums, pregnancy is shorter than the oestrous cycle and the steroid hormone profile during pregnancy and oestrous cycle are indistinguishable. For these reasons, it was assumed that recognition of pregnancy, as a trait, evolved in the eutherian (placental) stem lineage and independently in wallabies and kangaroos. To investigate whether uterine recognition of pregnancy occurs in species with pregnancy shorter than the oestrous cycle, we examined reproduction in the short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), a marsupial with a plesiomorphic mode of pregnancy. We examined the morphological and gene expression changes in the uterus of females in the non-pregnant oestrous cycle and compared these to pregnancy. We found that the presence of an embryo did not alter some aspects of uterine development but increased glandular activity. Transcriptionally, we saw big differences between the uterus of pregnant and cycling animals. These differences included an upregulation of genes involved in transport, inflammation and metabolic-activity in response to the presence of a fetus. Furthermore, transcriptional differences reflected protein level differences in transporter abundance. Our results suggest that while the uterus exhibits programmed changes after ovulation, its transcriptional landscape during pregnancy responds to the presence of a fetus and upregulates genes that may be essential for fetal support. These results are consistent with endometrial recognition of pregnancy occurring in the opossum. While the effects on maternal physiology appear to differ, recognition of pregnancy has now been observed in eutherian mammals, as well as, Australian and American marsupials.

However, these two uncertainties are rarely addressed concurrently in epidemic studies. We present an approach to simultaneously address both sources of uncertainty, to elucidate which source most impedes decision-making. In the case of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, epidemiological uncertainty is represented by a large ensemble of published models. Operational uncertainty about three classes of interventions is assessed for a wide range of potential intervention effectiveness. We ranked each intervention by caseload reduction in each model, initially assuming an unlimited budget as a counterfactual. We then assessed the influence of three candidate cost functions relating intervention effectiveness and cost for different budget levels. The improvement in management outcomes to be gained by resolving uncertainty is generally high in this study; appropriate information gain could reduce expected caseload by more than 50%. The ranking of interventions is jointly determined by the underlying epidemiological process, the effectiveness of the interventions and the size of the budget. An epidemiologically effective intervention might not be optimal if its costs outweigh its epidemiological benefit. Under higher-budget conditions, resolution of epidemiological uncertainty is most valuable. When budgets are tight, however, operational and epidemiological uncertainty are equally important. Overall, our study demonstrates that significant reductions in caseload could result from a careful examination of both epidemiological and operational uncertainties within the same modelling structure. This approach can be applied to decision-making for the management of other diseases for which multiple models and multiple interventions are available.

Honeybee dietary neonicotinoid exposure is associated with pollen collection from agricultural weeds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						non-crop plants; environmental fate; bee declines; pollen analysis; clothianidin; thiamethoxam	BEE COLONY LOSSES; INSECTICIDES; US; RESIDUES; PATTERNS; COUNTRY; HEALTH; ROUTE	Neonicotinoid insecticides have been linked to bee declines. However, tracking the primary exposure route for bees in the field has proven to be a major logistical challenge, impeding efforts to restore pollinator health in agricultural landscapes. We quantified neonicotinoid concentrations and botanical species composition in 357 pollen samples collected from 114 commercial honeybee colonies placed along a gradient of agricultural intensity between June and September. Neonicotinoid concentrations increased through the season, peaking at the end of August. As a result, concentrations in pollen were negatively associated with collection from woody and crop plants that flower early-mid season, and positively associated with collection from herbaceous plants that flower mid-late season. Higher clothianidin and thiamethoxam residues were correlated with samples containing a greater proportion of pollen collected from agricultural weeds. The percentage of agricultural land within 1500 m was positively correlated with thiamethoxam concentration; however, this spatial relationship was far weaker than the relationship with the proportion of pollen collected from herbaceous plants. These results indicate that both plant species identity and agricultural dominance are important in determining honeybee neonicotinoid exposure through the pollen diet, but that uncultivated plants associated with agriculture are the source of the greatest acute exposure.

We propose a random forest approach to model, map and assess whether public lands provide protection for AGB in the Rio Doce watershed, one of the most important watercourses of the Atlantic Forest biome. We used 188 field plots and individual and hybrid features from remote sensing, environmental and terrain-related data. The hybrid model improved the AGB prediction by reducing the root mean square error to 33.43 Mg/ha and increasing the coefficient of determination (R-2) to 0.57. The total estimated AGB was 178,967,656.73 Mg, ranging from 20.40 to 167.72 Mg/ha following the seasonal precipitation pattern and anthropogenic disturbance effects. Only 5.76% of the total AGB was located on public protected lands, totalling 10,305,501 Mg, while most of the remaining AGB were located on private properties.

Assessing Space, Time, and Remediation Contribution to Soil Pollutant Variation near the Detection Limit Using Hurdle Models to Account for a Large Proportion of Nondetectable Results	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTAL DATA; PETROLEUM-HYDROCARBONS; CONTAMINATED SOILS	Many emerging, and some legacy, pollutants pose risks to humans and ecosystems near the detection limits (DL) of existing analytical systems. As a result, site assessments and management options are often presented with data sets that are sparse, highly skewed, and left-censored. Existing analysis methods are unable to differentiate effects of treatment from covariates, such as space, obscuring influences of site management. As a case study, we computed the mean and variance of censored soil benzene data across four sites over a three year period by gamma distribution with a maximum likelihood. Further, a combined hurdle model to accommodate left-censored concentrations was applied to analyze factors affecting benzene variation. This approach allowed us to assess the success and spatial dependency of a biostimulatory solution in reducing benzene concentrations at very low concentrations. Benzene concentrations decreased due to the addition of biostimulatory solution and spatial effects, but the detection of soil benzene after biostimulation was highly spatially dependent. By combining computed values for censored observations estimated by the hurdle-gamma model and uncensored observations, we can get the pseudocomplete data sets. The combined model is ideally suited to evaluate existing and emerging pollutants, that pose risks to humans and ecosystems but are typically at or near analytical detection limits.

Some personality types within a species might be better suited to cope with environmental change and therefore might be selected upon under ongoing urbanization.ResultsWe used LED street lamps in a large outdoor enclosure to experimentally investigate the effects of ALAN on activity patterns, movement and interaction of individuals of two species, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius). We analyzed effects combined with individual boldness score. Both species reduced their activity budget during daylight hours. While under natural light conditions home ranges were larger during daylight than during nighttime, this difference vanished under ALAN. Conspecifics showed reduced home range overlap, proximity and activity synchrony when subjected to nighttime illumination. Changes in movement patterns in reaction to ALAN were not associated with differences in boldness score of individuals.ConclusionsOur results suggest that light pollution can lead to changes in movement patterns and individual interactions in small mammals. This could lead to fitness consequences on the population level.

Are all patches worth exploring? Foraging desert birds do not rely on environmental indicators of seed abundance at small scales	BMC ECOLOGY			English	Article						Post-dispersal seed predation; Field experiment; Granivory; Patch exploration; Patch exploitation; Soil seed bank; Vegetation structure; Environmental cues; Predation risk; Arid environments	CENTRAL MONTE DESERT; SOUTH-AMERICAN DESERTS; GRANIVOROUS BIRDS; HABITAT SELECTION; PREDATION RISK; SMALL MAMMALS; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; STATISTICAL-METHODS; MOVEMENT PATTERNS	BackgroundConsumers should show strong spatial preferences when foraging in environments where food availability is highly heterogeneous and predictable. Postdispersal granivores face this scenario in most arid areas, where soil seed bank abundance and composition associates persistently with vegetation structure at small scales (decimetres to metres). Those environmental features should be exploited as useful pre-harvest information, at least to avoid patches predicted to be poor. However, we did not find the expected spatial association in the algarrobal of the central Monte desert by observing foraging seed-eating birds, a field technique influenced by how much they exploit visitedpatches. In this work we tested if the first stage of foraging by granivorous birds (patch visit, encounter or exploration) is positively associated with environmental indicators of patch quality by recording the removal of single seeds from 300 scattered experimental devices during seasonal trials. Spatial selectivity was analysed by comparing the structural characteristics of used vs. available microhabitats, and evaluated against bottom-up and top-down hypotheses based on our previous knowledge on local seed bank abundance, composition and dynamics. Their foraging activity was also explored for spatialautocorrelation and environmental correlates at bigger scales.ResultsPostdispersal granivorous birds were less selective in their use of foraging space than expected if microhabitat appearance were providing them relevant information to guide their search for profitable foraging patches. No microhabitat type, as defined by their vegetation structureand soil cover, remained safe from bird exploration. Analyses at bigger temporal and spatial scales proved more important to describe heterogeneity in seed removal.ConclusionsCloseness to tall trees, probably related to bird territoriality and reproduction or to their perception of predation risk, seemed to determine a first level of habitat selection, constraining explorable space. Then, microhabitat openness (rather than seed abundance) exerted some positive influence on which patches were more frequently visited among those accessible. Selective patterns by birds at small scales were closer to our predictions of a top-down spatial effect, with seed consumptioncreating or strengthening (and not responding to) the spatial pattern and dynamics of the seed bank.

This approach has provided a breakthrough for monarch conservation because it is the only viable means of inferring origins at continental scales. Recently, routine simultaneous analyses of tissue delta H-2 and delta O-18 of organic materials has emerged leading to questions of whether the dual measurement of these isotopes could be used to more accurately infer spatial origins even though the two isotopes are expected to be coupled due to the meteoric relationship. Such refinement would potentially increase the accuracy of isotopic assignment of wintering monarchs to natal origin. We measured a sample of 150 known natal-origin monarchs from throughout their eastern range simultaneously for both delta H-2 and delta O-18 wing values. Wing delta H-2 and delta O-18 values were correlated (r(2) = 0.42). We found that wing delta H-2 values were more closely correlated with amount-weighted growing season average precipitation delta H-2 values predicted for natal sites (r(2) = 0.61) compared to the relationship between wing delta O-18 values and amount-weighted growing season average precipitation delta O-18 values (r(2) = 0.30). This suggests that monarch wing delta H-2 values will be generally more useful in natal assignments than delta O-18 values. Spatial information related to the use of deuterium excess in environmental waters was similarly found to be not useful when applied to monarch wings likely due to the considerable variance in wing delta O-18 values. Nonetheless, we recommend further testing of monarch wing delta H-2 and delta O-18 values from known natal sites with an emphasis on field data across a strong gradient in precipitation deuterium excess.

FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						biodiversity; earthworms; functional groups; land use change; soil degradation; soil threats; rubber tree plantations	LAND-USE; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; ORGANIC-MATTER; QUALITY; IMPACT; INVERTEBRATES; STRATEGIES; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; TRIPURA	The agro-ecological drawbacks of the spread of rubber tree plantations in Cote d'Ivoire since the 1990's are obvious even though they have not been properly investigated. They consist of biodiversity loss, land degradation and food insecurity, which have extended into the existing cocoa-led degraded areas whose rehabilitation have unfortunately not started. This situation increases not only the threat on soil health status but also undermines the capability of soils to deliver ecosystem services that are key to sustainable agricultural production. The current study took advantage of a chronosequence in rubber tree landscapes to assess soil health deterioration in general and possibly earthworm-mediated role in soil health changes. The hypothesis underpinning this study was that earthworms contribute to mitigate soil health deterioration in rubber-dominated landscapes due to their key role in soil functioning. This study confirmed that the conversion of forest to rubber tree plantations significantly impaired all soil biological, physical, and chemical parameters at the beginning (7 years) of the chronosequence; followed further by a restorative trend taking place beneath the plantations from 12 years. However, this study failed to find evidence of a direct role of earthworms in soil health rehabilitation over time. Mesoscale studies along with the use of appropriate models could help unravel this "black box" and shed some light on the contribution of earthworms as key soil ecosystem engineers.

Absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(254)) and 325 nm (a(325)), indices (a(254)/a(365)) and spectral slopes (between 275 and 295 nm, S275-295) were calculated from the dissolved fraction of the UV absorption spectra to describe the amount and quality of CDOM. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were applied to evaluate the relevance of physical and biogeochemical drivers for the variability of CDOM. Besides the low CDOM values, a first division of our data following the Longhurst's biogeographic classification showed significant differences in CDOM levels among provinces. The lowest values of a(254) and a(325) were found in the oligotrophic gyres, particularly in the Indian Ocean, and the highest in the upwelling areas, particularly in the Equatorial Pacific. Opposite distributions were obtained for S275-295 and a(254)/a(365), indicative of higher photobleaching in the gyres. Within each province, whereas a(254) was constant through the photic layer, a(325) increased significantly with depth as a result of the dominance of photobleaching over biological production in the surface layer and the opposite at depth. The Pacific provinces, including the subtropical gyres, showed, however, significantly higher a(325) values, indicative of lower photobleaching/higher biological production. The GAM analysis indicates that a(254) and a(325) were primarily related to chlorophyll a (Chl a), exhibiting a significant positive linear response. Interestingly, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus abundances were related to these absorption coefficients. Apparent oxygen utilization also contributed to explain the distributions of these absorption coefficients, being inversely related to a(254) and directly related to a(325). These results are consistent with the premise that a(254) could be a proxy for the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and a(325) for the aromatic by-products of biological degradation. The GAM analysis also shows that a(254)/a(365) and S275-295 exhibited inverse relationships with solar radiation, indicating that the biological production of CDOM counteracts photodegradation as solar radiation increases. In summary, whereas photobleaching dictates the vertical distribution of CDOM, Chl a explains the CDOM differences among the photic layer of the tropical and subtropical ocean provinces visited during the circumnavigation.

Here, we compare measurement methods used to document community structure and assess changes in marine systems, and explore potential applications in citizen science. The use of photographs for species identifications and monitoring has become a popular and useful data collection tool, but its use requires evaluation of its effectiveness in comparison to data collected from live examinations. We used settlement panels in San Francisco Bay, a well-studied and vital coastal ecosystem, to compare standardized measures of the invertebrate fouling community through examination of live organisms in the field and via photographs. Overall, our study found that live measurements were more accurate and better represented these marine communities, having higher richness, and diversity measurements than photographic measurements. However, photographic analyses accurately captured the relative abundances of some species and functional groups. We suggest that highly recognizable target taxa or broad scale comparisons of functional group composition are easily tracked through photographs and offer the best potential for research conducted by citizen scientists.

However, few studies have considered the role of multiple biotic and abiotic factors in shaping trait variation and spectra. In this study, we determined seven leaf traits of 66 Solidago canadensis populations, and quantified the relative contributions of climate, soil properties, native plant diversity, and S. canadensis-community interactions (in total 16 factors) to leaf trait variation and spectrum with multimodel inference.ResultsOverall, the seven leaf traits had high phenotypic variation, and this variation was highest for leaf dry matter content and lowest for leaf carbon concentration. The per capita contribution of climate to the mean leaf trait variation was highest (7.5%), followed by soil properties (6.2%), S. canadensis-community interactions (6.1%), and native plant diversity (5.4%); the dominant factors underlying trait variation varied with leaf traits. Leaf production potential was negatively associated with leaf stress-tolerance potential, and the relative contributions to this trade-off followed in order: native plant diversity (7.7%), climate (6.9%), S. canadensis-community interactions (6.2%), and soil properties (5.6%). Climate, diversity, soil, and interactions had positive, neutral or negative effects.ConclusionsClimate, soil, diversity, and interactions contribute differentially to the leaf trait variation and economics spectrum of S. canadensis, and their relative importance and directions depend on plant functional traits.

Satellite based remote sensing has evolved as an important technology to spatially map the occurrence of invasive species in space and time. With the new era of the Sentinel missions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral data are now freely available and repeatedly acquired on a high spatial and temporal resolution for the entire globe. However, the high potential of such sensors for automatic mapping procedures cannot be fully harnessed without sufficient and appropriate reference data for model calibration. Reference data are commonly acquired in field surveys, which however, are often relatively expensive and affected by sampling and observer bias. Moreover, a direct transferability to the remote sensing perspective and scale is difficult. Accordingly, we firstly assess the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for semi-automatic reference data acquisition on species cover of three woody invasive species Pinus radiata, Ulex europaeus and Acacia dealbata occurring in Chile. Secondly, we test the upscaling of the estimated species cover to the spatial scale of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The proposed workflow includes the visual sampling of respective canopies in UAV orthomosaics and the subsequent spatial extrapolations using MaxEnt with spectral (RGB, Hyperspectral), textural (2D) and canopy structural (3D) predictors derived from UAV-based photogrammetry. These UAV-based maps are then used to train random forest models with multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map the invasive species cover on large spatial scales. Our results show that the semi-automatic UAV-based mapping of the three invasive species results in accurate predictions. Depending on the predictor combination, the correlation was 0.70, 0.77 and 0.90 for Pinus radiatia, Ulex europaeus, Acacia dealbata, respectively. Among the three species, we observed clear differences in the model performance between the tested photogrammetric predictors and their combinations (spectral, 2D texture or 3D structure). For scaling up the UAV-based estimates to the satellite-scale, the Sentinel-2 data (multispectral) were more important than Sentinel-1 data (SAR). An independent validation revealed that the R-2 of the upscaling accounted for 0.78 or higher for all species and RMSE lower than 12%. Our results hence demonstrate that UAV-based reference data acquisitions are a promising alternative to traditional field surveys if the target species are directly identifiable in the UAV data.

The commonly applied area-based approach (ABA) allows the derivation of wall-to-wall geospatial coverages representing each of the modeled attributes at a grid-cell level, with spatial resolutions typically between 20 and 30 m. The ABA predictive models are developed using stratified inventory data from field plots, the requirement for which can increase the overall cost of the ALS-based inventory. Parsimonious use of ground plots is a key means to control variable costs in the operational implementation of the ABA. In this paper, we demonstrate how the prediction accuracy of Lorey's height (HL, m), quadratic mean diameter (QMD, cm), and gross volume (V, m(3)) vary when existing ABA models are transferred to different areas or are applied to point cloud data with different characteristics than those on which the original model was developed. Specifically, we consider three scenarios of model transferability: (i) same point cloud characteristics, different areas; (ii) different point cloud characteristics, same areas; and (iii) different point cloud characteristics, different areas. We generated area-based models using three modeling approaches: linear regression (OLS), random forests (RF), and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) imputation. Results indicated that the prediction accuracy of area-based models varied by attribute and by modeling approach. We found that when the models were transferred their prediction accuracy decreased, with an average increase in relative bias up to 22.04%, and increase in relative RMSE up to 29.31%. Prediction accuracies for HL were higher than those of QMD or V when models were transferred, and had the lowest average increase in relative bias and relative RMSE of < 5% in the majority of cases. Likewise OLS models for HL had greater prediction accuracies when models were transferred compared to RF and kNN models, especially when the point cloud characteristics were similar. Conversely, we found that for QMD and V, RF models were found to be the most transferable in cases when models were applied to different areas with similar and different point cloud characteristics. While there is potential for cost savings by transferring models and reducing data acquisition costs, our results show the degree of transferability depends more on the attribute being modelled or the modeling approach applied, and less on the characteristics of the point cloud data.

Satellite-based vegetation optical depth as an indicator of drought-driven tree mortality	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Forest mortality; Tree mortality; Vegetation optical depth; Relative water content; Vegetation water content; Climatic water deficit; California drought; AMSR; Random forests	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BARK BEETLE; PHYSIOLOGICAL-MECHANISMS; FOREST MORTALITY; SOIL-MOISTURE; UNITED-STATES; TIME-SERIES; AMSR-E; WATER; IMPACTS	Drought-induced tree mortality events are expected to increase in frequency under climate change. However, monitoring and modeling of tree mortality is limited by the high spatial variability in vegetation response to climatic drought stress and lack of physiologically meaningful stress variables that can be monitored at large scales. In this study, we test the hypothesis that relative water content (RWC) estimated by passive microwave remote sensing through vegetation optical depth can be used as an empirical indicator of tree mortality that both integrates variations in plant drought stress and is accessible across large areas. The hypothesis was tested in a recent severe drought in California, USA. The RWC showed a stronger threshold relationship with mortality than climatic water deficit (CWD) - a commonly used mortality indicator - although both relationships were noisy due to the coarse spatial resolution of the data (0.25 degrees or approximately 25 km). In addition, the threshold for RWC was more uniform than that for CWD when compared between Northern and Southern regions of California. A random forests regression (machine learning) with 32 variables describing topography, climate, and vegetation characteristics predicted forest mortality extent i.e. fractional area of mortality (FAM) with satisfactory accuracy-coefficient of determination R-tmt(2) = 0.66, root mean square error = 0.023. Importantly, RWC was more than twice as important as any other variable in the model in estimating mortality, confirming its strong link to mortality rates. Moreover, RWC showed a moderate ability to aid in forecasting mortality, with a relative importance of RWC measured one year in advance of mortality similar to that of other relevant explanatory variables measured in the mortality year. The results of this study present a promising new approach to estimate drought stress of forests linked to mortality risk.

The spatiotemporally available data offer prospects to advance process understandings across scales. We used continuous 15-min data (2011-2015) from a forest upstream reach and an agricultural downstream reach of the Selke River, Germany. Based on the high-frequency data, we developed a parsimonious approach for regionalizing the autotrophic uptake rate, considering effects of global radiation and riparian shading. For networked modeling, we integrated this approach into the fully distributed mesoscale hydrological nitrate model (mHM-Nitrate). Daily GPP-based uptake rate calculations showed distinct seasonal patterns and ranges in the agricultural and forest streams (mean values were 80.9 and 15.5 mg N m(-2) d(-1)., respectively). Validation in the two streams showed acceptable performance (R-2 = 0.47 and 0.45, respectively) and spatial transferability of the regionalization approach, given its parsimony. Networked modeling results showed high spatiotemporal variability in nitrate transport and uptake throughout the river network. The magnitude of gross uptake increased, whereas uptake efficiency decreased significantly along stream order. Longitudinal analysis in the main stem of the Selke River revealed that riparian shading and inter annual hydrochemical variations strongly influenced daily dynamics of the uptake efficiency. This study provides a parsimonious and transferable procedure for regionalizing in-stream autotrophic nitrate uptake based on high-frequency data at reach scale. Integrating this approach in the mHM-Nitrate model allows detailed nitrate transport and in-stream uptake processes to be investigated throughout river networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
