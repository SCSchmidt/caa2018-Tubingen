This study assessed the Hg impact on the fatty acid (FA) composition and the antioxidant statues in Holothuria forskali body wall tissue. Specimens were exposed to HgCl2 graded doses (40, 80 and 160 mu g L-1) for 96 h. A decrease in linoleic, arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acid levels and an increase of docosahexaenoic acid were mainly observed at the nominal tested dose. The exposure to the upper dose promoted oxidative stress with an increase of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, advanced oxidation protein product, glutathione and non-protein thiols levels. Moreover, a decrease in catalase and an increase in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were observed. Yet, an increase of the metallothionein level was registered in all treated groups. This study confirmed the Hg toxicity on the redox statue of H. forskali and highlighted the usefulness of the FA composition as an early sensitive bioindicators.

Some of these substances (toxic contaminants) stress biological activity at all concentrations, while others (e.g., nutrients) subsidize it at low concentrations and stress it above a threshold, causing subsidy-stress responses. Thus, the overall effects of WWTP effluents depend mostly on their composition and the dilution capacity of the receiving water bodies. We assessed the immediate and legacy effects of WWTP effluents in artificial streams, where we measured the uptake of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) by the biofilm, biomass accrual, benthic metabolism and organic matter decomposition (OMD). In a first phase (32 d), the channels were subjected to a gradient of effluent contribution, from pure stream water to pure effluent. WWTP effluent affected the ecosystem processes we measured, although we found no clear subsidy stress patterns except for biofilm biomass accrual. Instead, most of the processes were subsidized, although they showed complex and process-specific patterns. Benthic metabolism and OMD were subsidized without saturation, as they peaked at medium and high levels of pollution, respectively, but they never fell below control levels. SRP uptake was the only process that decreased with increasing effluent concentration. In a second phase of the experiment (23 d), all channels were kept on pure stream water to analyse the legacy effects of the effluent. For most of the processes, there were clear legacy effects, which followed either subsidy, stress, or subsidy-stress patterns. SRP uptake capacity was stressed with increasing pollution legacy, whereas algal accrual and benthic metabolism continued being subsidized. Conversely, biofilm biomass accrual and OMD showed no legacy effects. Overall, the WWTP effluent caused complex and process-specific responses in our experiment, mainly driven by the mixed contribution of subsidizers and stressors. These results help improving our understanding of the effects of urban pollution on stream ecosystem functioning.

However, the success of such initiatives is highly limited by a low tree growth and high tree mortality rates due to transplant shocks from tree nursery to field. The positive impact of mycorrhiza-based ecological engineering strategies on jujube trees were previously demonstrated in nursery conditions, but field monitoring is necessary to evaluate their sustainability in terms of plant growth and survival. In the current study, local (Tassel) and exotic (Gola) jujube cultivars were tested for their response to mycorrhizal inoculation with the non-native arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis IR 27 and fertilization with rock phosphate. The environmental impacts of both treatments were assessed by characterizing the native AM fungal community in a 13-month-old jujube orchard. Field results demonstrated higher rates of survival and a relative stability of nursery-driven plant benefits of inoculated jujube trees, as well as a potential higher persistence of AM fungal inoculum for the exotic cultivar. The native AM fungal community associated with the local cultivar was the most diverse, but Glomeraceae was predominant in both cultivars. The mycorrhiza-based ecological engineering strategies proposed in this work affected both AM fungal communities, notably Glomeraceae and Gigasporaceae members, but in a higher extent for the local jujube cultivar. Results highlight the strong benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation at the very early stages of tree seedling growth in nursery and their stability in the first year of plantation. Nevertheless, a deeper assessment of mycorrhizal inoculum persistence and spread, and a wider characterization of soil and root microbiome need to be implemented in further field monitoring to better evaluate the environmental impacts.

The approach translates individual terms of the energy balance (radiation, evapotranspiration, heat storage, and convection) into temperature increments. This is exemplified using micrometeorological simulations (ENVI-met) for the quarter "Bayerischer Bahnhof" in Leipzig, Germany, under different wind conditions. In result heat storage and convection provide the principal contributions to UHI. The mapping of Delta T-contributions in a neighbourhood is a new tool facilitating the development of tailored measures for reduction of and adaptation to urban heat. For example, the Delta T-contributions (-6.8, -2.6, -9.2, and 15.7 K, respectively) calculated for a courtyard compensate each other. Applying this decomposition at each individual location, suitable adaptation measures can be developed. Considering the superposition of all local Delta T-contributions can support a cost-benefit analysis creating optimal recommendations for city planners.

The Distribution of Planktivorous Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) on the Great Barrier Reef and the Relative Influences of Habitat and Predation	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						Great Barrier Reef; damselfishes; habitat; predation; planktivory	TROUT PLECTROPOMUS-LEOPARDUS; CORAL TROUT; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FISH COMMUNITIES; TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS; HERBIVOROUS FISHES; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; SHELF; COMPLEXITY	Planktivorous damselfishes (Pomacentridae) are diverse and abundant on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), are important prey for commercially harvested coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) and their feeding mode plays a central role in transferring energy from the plankton to the reef. However, little is known about their distribution patterns throughout the GBR and how those patterns are influenced by predators and habitat despite increasing pressures on both. Here we quantify the distribution and abundance of GBR planktivorous damselfishes, then examine the role of coral trout and habitat in shaping their assemblages. The assemblage structure of planktivorous damselfishes varied across the continental shelf, yet their total abundances varied sub-regionally, dependent on differences in coral habitat. Latitudinal patterns were relatively weak. Damselfish assemblages generally retained characteristics of their sub-regional setting over 20 years and assemblage degradation was only associated with major coral losses. Damselfish numbers were not negatively influenced by top-down control from coral trout. Instead, numbers of coral trout and damselfishes were both positively associated with coral habitat and each other. Our findings suggest that a complexity of factors and interactions shape reef fish assemblages and reinforce the fundamental importance of coral as the foundation of healthy reef communities.

Disentangling Environmental Drivers of Phytoplankton Biomass off Western Iberia	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						chlorophyll a; Western Iberian Coast (WIC); environmental drivers; ocean color remote sensing (OCRS); empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs)	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SHELF VARIABILITY; SIZE CLASSES; COAST; PENINSULA; PORTUGAL; TRENDS; IMPACT	Phytoplankton are the main primary producers in marine ecosystems, supporting important food webs. They are recognized as important indicators of environmental changes in oceans and coastal waters. Ocean color remote sensing has been extensively used to study phytoplankton (i.e., chlorophyll a - CHL - as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass) throughout the world, yet there is still much to understand in terms of what influences phytoplankton communities at regional scales. The main aim of this study was to investigate the drivers of CHL variability in the Western Iberian Coast (WIC), for the period 1998-2016. Satellite CHL data were acquired from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. A positive annual trend of CHL was observed at the Northern coastal WIC, near Galicia, and a negative trend was observed in Southern areas, near the Gulf of Cadiz. An empirical orthogonal function analysis was implemented to identify regions with similar patterns of CHL variability. Six regions were obtained. A set of climate indices, satellite, and model variables were then used as environmental predictors in generalized additive models that explained between 22.8 and 52.8% of the total variance of CHL anomalies calculated from a detrended and deseasoned dataset. In the Northern oceanic region, positive anomalies were linked to high North Atlantic Oscillation values and negative anomalies to high mixed layer depths. In the Southern oceanic region, positive CHL anomalies were found to be associated with high concentrations of nitrogen, that may indicate nitrogen limitation. CHL in coastal areas were found to respond to basin-wide (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) and coastal processes (e.g., upwelling and continental runoff), yielding positive anomalies with low salinity (SAL) values. In coastal areas off major rivers, such as Douro and Guadalquivir, the positive response of CHL to increased nitrogen concentrations and decreased SAL was evident. Considering the changes in climate expected for this region, related to the decrease in precipitation and increase in summer temperatures, as well as some apparent weakening of upwelling, possible significant impacts on the phytoplankton community can be anticipated. These results are therefore also relevant for environmental management, especially in the context of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

In situ growth of deep-sea octocorals after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Corals; Plexauridae; Growth rates; Non-destructive methods; Imagery; Anthropogenic impact	PRIMNOA-RESEDAEFORMIS; CARIBBEAN OCTOCORAL; CORALS; AGE; GULF; SIZE; GORGONIANS; IMPACT; RATES; REPRODUCTION	Although the role of deep-sea corals in supporting biodiversity is well accepted, their ability to recover from anthropogenic impacts is still poorly understood. An important component of recovery is the capacity of corals to grow back after damage. Here we used data collected as part of an image-based long-term monitoring program that started in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to develop a non-destructive method to measure in situ growth rates of Paramuricea spp. corals and characterize the impact of the spill on growth. About 200 individual coral colonies were imaged every year between 2011 and 2017 at five sites (three that were impacted by the spill and two that were not). Images were then used to test different methods for measuring growth. The most effective method was employed to estimate baseline growth rates, characterize growth patterns, estimate the age of every colony, and determine the effects of impact and coral size on growth. Overall growth rates were variable but low, with average annual growth rates per site ranging from 0.14 to 2.5 cm/year/colony. Based on coral size and growth rates, some colonies are estimated to be over two thousand years old. While coral size did not have an influence on growth, the initial level of total impact in 2011 had a significant positive effect on the proportion of new growth after 2014. However, growth was not sufficient to compensate for branch loss at one of the impacted sites where corals are expected to take an average of 50 years to grow back to their original size. The non-destructive method we developed could be used to estimate the in situ growth rates on any planar octocoral, and would be particularly useful to follow the recovery of corals after impact or assess the effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas.

Rock Fracture Sorptivity as Related to Aperture Width and Surface Roughness	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							SPONTANEOUS IMBIBITION; FLUID-FLOW; WATER; PERMEABILITY; ABSORPTION; ANISOTROPY; MECHANICS; PHASE; OIL	Fractures in low-porosity rocks can provide conduits for fluid flow. Numerous researchers have investigated fluid flow through fractures under saturated conditions. However, relatively little information exists on spontaneous imbibition in fractures, whereby a wetting fluid displaces a non-wetting fluid by capillarity. We investigated spontaneous imbibition of water displacing air in a suite of fractured low-porosity sedimentary and igneous rock cores (5.08-cm length by 2.54-cm diameter). Mode I fractures were induced in the cores by compression between opposing parallel flat plates. The following physical properties were measured: bulk density, rho(b); solid-phase density, rho(s); porosity, phi; contact angle, theta(e); fracture aperture width, x(geo); and fracture surface roughness, W-r. The wetting front in each fracture was imaged using dynamic neutron radiography. Early-time uptake exhibited a square root of time dependency, and was quantified by linear regression, with the slope equal to the fracture sorptivity, S-f. Estimates of S-f ranged from 10.1 to 40.5 mm s(-0.5), with a median value of 25.0 mm s(-0.5). There was a statistically significant effect of rock type on S-f, with igneous rocks generally having lower mean values than sedimentary rocks. Differences in rho(b), rho(s), phi, and theta(e) between the rock types did not contribute significantly to the variation in S-f However, x(geo) and W-r were significantly correlated with S-f. These correlations indicated that S-f increases with increasing x(geo), as predicted by early-time capillary theory, and decreases with increasing W-r analogous to the decrease in fracture permeability with increasing surface roughness observed under saturated flow conditions.

Vegetation restoration on the degraded land with open-pit mining is challenging due to great physical and chemical condition changes of the post-mined landscape. In this study, we compared the vegetation community composition and environmental factors along three disturbance gradients (mining area, restoration area, and control area) in four typical open-pit mine types (phosphate, zinc, tin, and iron sites). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that there are significant differences in the vegetation communities along three gradients for these mine sites. Quality species were selected by indicator species analysis for vegetation restoration as follows: Chloris virgata Sw. and Artemisia princeps Pamp at the phosphate site; Coriaria nepalensis Wall., Artemisia princeps Pamp, and Picris hieracioides L. at the zinc site; Artemisia princeps Pamp at the tin site; and Panicum brevifolium L. at the iron site. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordination and Monte Carlo permutation tests were further used to determine the effects of environmental factors on vegetation diversity. The results showed that Cd, As, Zn, Pb, TC, and altitude all had significant effects on vegetation diversity (P < 0.05). Additionally, we found that the integrated effects of these variables on vegetation were greater in the mining area than in the other two gradients based on the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion. These results suggest that any plans for vegetation restoration in open-pit mining areas should take disturbance intensity, mine types, and critical environmental variables into account.

Our main goal is to classify and clarify the forest types based on the changes in basal area (BA), tree density, and species composition of montane forests in Southern Ecuador, and to determine the influence of critical environmental and geomorphological factors. (2) Methods: One hundred thirty-two temporary plots of 400 m(2) were installed in homogeneous and well-conserved forest stands. We identified and measured all trees >10 cm diameter breast height (DBH). We modeled species diversity (Fisher's alpha) change in relation to climatic, altitudinal, and geomorphological gradients using GLM and Kruskall-Wallis analyses. The change in composition was determined using cluster analyses (BIOENV analysis followed by a LINKTREE procedure). Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to analyze changes across climatic and geomorphological gradients. Finally, we used a SIMPER analysis to identify the species that contributed most to the floristic dissimilarity among the identified altitudinal forests types. (3) Results: The floristic groups were determined by altitude, temperature, and isothermality, but also some geomorphological variables and lithology were used. Plots located in low hills have higher alpha diversity compared to the high hills and dissected mountains. (4) Conclusions: Altitude is the most important factor responsible for the division of structural and floristic groups. In addition, those plots located on the whitish tuff have higher alpha value diversity compared with plots in andesitic tuffs. Precipitation on the wettest quarter (>839 mm) and isothermality (>90.5) are the most relevant climatic factors driving the floristic classification.

To contribute to a better understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of fires in the region relative to environmental and anthropogenic influences, we augmented existing fire perimeter data for the US by mapping wildfires that occurred in the Mexican Sky Islands from 1985 to 2011. Results: A total of 254 fires were identified across the region: 99 fires in Mexico (mu = 3901 ha, sigma = 5066 ha) and 155 in the US (mu = 3808 ha, sigma= 8368 ha). The Animas, Chiricahua, Huachuca-Patagonia, and Santa Catalina mountains in the US, and El Pinito in Mexico had the highest proportion of total area burned (>50%) relative to Sky Island size. Sky Islands adjacent to the border had the greatest number of fires, and many of these fires were large with complex shapes. Wildfire occurred more often in remote biomes, characterized by evergreen woodlands and conifer forests with cooler, wetter conditions. The five largest fires (>25 000 ha) all occurred during twenty-first century droughts (2002 to 2003 and 2011); four of these were in the US and one in Mexico. Overall, high variation in fire shape and size were observed in both wetter and drier years, contributing to landscape heterogeneity across the region. Conclusions: Future research on regional fire patterns, including fire severity, will enhance opportunities for collaborative efforts between countries, improve knowledge about ecological patterns and processes in the borderlands, and support long-term planning and restoration efforts.

Plants inhabiting discrete habitats, like lakes and wetlands, experience dispersal limitation, and rely heavily on zoochory for their spatial population dynamics. Granivorous waterbirds may disperse viable seeds of wetland plants over long distances during migration. The limited knowledge of waterbird migration has long hampered the evaluation of the importance of waterbirds in seed dispersal, requiring key metrics such as realistic dispersal distances. Using recent GPS tracking of mallards during spring migration, we built a mechanistic seed dispersal model to estimate realistic dispersal distances. Mallards are abundant, partially migratory ducks known to consume seeds of >300 European plant species. Based on the tracking data, we informed a mallard migration simulator to obtain a probabilistic spring migration model for the mallard population wintering at Lake Constance in Southern Germany. We combined the spring migration model with seed retention curves to develop seed dispersal kernels. We also assessed the effects of pre-migratory fasting and the availability of suitable deposition habitats for aquatic and wetland plants. Our results show that mallards at Lake Constance can disperse seeds in the northeastern direction over median distances of 293 and 413 km for seeds with short and long retention times, respectively, assuming a departure immediately after foraging. Pre-migratory fasting strongly affected the dispersal potential, with only 1-7% of ingested seeds left for dispersal after fasting for 12 h. Availability of a suitable deposition habitat was generally <5% along the migratory flyway. The high probability of seed deposition in a freshwater habitat during the first stopover, after the mallards completed the first migratory flight, makes successful dispersal most likely to happen at 204-322 km from Lake Constance. We concluded that the directed long-distance dispersal of plant seeds, realized by mallards on spring migration, may contribute significantly to large scale spatial plant population dynamics, including range expansion in response to shifting temperature and rainfall patterns under global warming. Our dispersal model is the first to incorporate detailed behavior of migratory waterbirds and can be readily adjusted to include other vector species when tracking data are available.

A first step toward understanding these differences in migratory behavior among individuals is, therefore, to assess the relative contributions of inter-and intra-individual differences to this variation. We did this using light-level geolocators deployed on the breeding grounds to follow continental black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa limosa) throughout their south-and northward migrations over multiple years. Based on repeated tracks from 36 individuals, we found two general patterns in godwit migratory behavior: First, migratory timing in black-tailed godwits varies mostly because individual godwits migrate at different times of the year. Second, individuals also exhibit considerable variation in timing within their respective migratory windows. Although the absolute amount of inter-individual variation in timing decreased over the course of northward migration, individual godwits still arrived at their breeding grounds across a span of more than 5 weeks. These differences in migratory timing among individuals are larger than those currently observed in other migratory bird species and suggest that the selective forces that limit the variation in migratory timing in other species are relaxed or absent in godwits. Furthermore, we could not attribute these individual differences to the sex or wintering location of an individual. We suggest that different developmental trajectories enabled by developmental plasticity likely result in these generally consistent, life-long annual routines. To investigate this possibility and to gain an understanding of the different selection pressures that could be acting during migration and throughout a godwit's life, future studies should track juvenile godwits and other migratory birds from birth to adulthood while also manipulating their spatiotemporal environment during development.

However, Hg effects on biofilm communities are overlooked. Here, we present results of a pilot study on the chronic effects of Hg on biofilms, notably on the potential change of their taxonomic composition. Biofilms were cultivated in microcosms enriched with three different Hg concentrations (11 +/- 2 pM, 121 +/- 9 pM and 1454 +/- 54 pM) for 55 days and examined for their accumulated Hg concentrations and composition. Bioaccumulated Hg concentrations were representative of those encountered in natural environments. Despite the lack of influence on the ash free dry weight and chlorophyll content, the surface coverage of the substrata of biofilms grown in Hg decreased. Algal community were strongly affected by Hg, with a decrease in their richness with Ochrophyta found as the most sensitive phyla. The diversity and richness of bacterial communities did not change upon cultivation in Hg but the presence of Proteobacteria increased with Hg, whereas Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrumicrobia, and Cyanobacteria were negatively impacted. Overall, the above findings suggest that the examination of the algal community composition might be used as a potential biomonitoring tool to assess the impacts of environmental Hg concentrations on aquatic systems, which would merit further investigation.

This paper reports on a fishing impact recovery comparison based on four towed camera surveys over a 15-year period (2001-2015) on a group of small seamounts on the Chatham Rise, east of New Zealand, on which pre-disturbance benthic communities are dominated by thicket-forming scleractinian corals. The six seamounts studied encompass a range of trawl histories, including one with high and persistent levels of trawling throughout the survey period, two with intermittent and intermediate levels of trawling, two which were low/untrawled, and one, 'Morgue', which was closed to trawling in 2001, having been heavily trawled up to that point. Still photographs from all surveys were analyzed for the identification and abundance of all visible benthic fauna with effort made to ensure consistency of data among surveys. Because increases in image resolution and quality over time resulted in a persistent trend of increasing abundances, analyses were concentrated on comparisons among seamounts within surveys and how these relationships changed with time. The abundance, species richness, and diversity of benthic communities were higher on low/untrawled seamounts than on those that had been trawled. Multivariate community structure showed similar patterns at each survey point, the low/untrawled seamounts being strongly dissimilar to the persistently trawled seamount, with the others ranged between these extremes, broadly in accordance with their cumulative trawl histories. Community structure on the persistently trawled seamount was less variable than on the other seamounts throughout the study period, possibly because of regular 're-setting' of the community by disturbance from trawling. Although there was some variability in results between whole seamount and summit sector analyses, in general communities on Morgue remained similar to those on the persistently trawled seamount, showing little indication of steps toward recovery to its pre-disturbance state following its closure. These results indicate low resilience of benthic communities on the seamounts to the effects of bottom trawling.

GPS tracking data reveals daily spatio-ternporal movement patterns of waterfowl	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Activity budgets; Animal movement; Contagion index; Energetics; Fine-scale movement; High frequency GPS; Movement ecology	MALLARD ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS; BLUE-WINGED TEAL; NORTHERN PINTAILS; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; SPRING MIGRATION; HOME-RANGE; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SACRAMENTO-VALLEY; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; FEMALE MALLARDS	Background: Spatio-temporal patterns of movement can characterize relationships between organisms and their surroundings, and address gaps in our understanding of species ecology, activity budgets, bioenergetics, and habitat resource management. Highly mobile waterfowl, which can exploit resources over large spatial extents, are excellent models to understand relationships between movements and resource usage, landscape interactions and specific habitat needs. Methods: We tracked 3 species of dabbling ducks with GPS-GSM transmitters in 2015-17 to examine fine-scale movement patterns over 24 h periods (30 min interval), dividing movement pathways into temporally continuous segments and spatially contiguous patches. We quantified distances moved, area used and time allocated across the day, using linear and generalized linear mixed models. We investigated behavior through relationships between these variables. Results: Movements and space-use were small, and varied by species, sex and season. Gadwall (Mareca strepera) generally moved least (FFDs: 0.5-0.7 km), but their larger foraging patches resulted from longer within-area movements. Pintails (Anas acuta) moved most, were more likely to conduct flights > 300 m, had FFDs of 0.8-1.1 km, used more segments and patches per day that they revisited more frequently, resulting in the longest daily total movements. Females and males differed only during the post-hunt season when females moved more. 23.6% of track segments were short duration (1-2 locations), approximately 1/3 more than would be expected if they occurred randomly, and were more dispersed in the landscape than longer segments. Distance moved in 30 min shortened as segment duration increased, likely reflecting phases of non-movement captured within segments. Conclusions: Pacific Flyway ducks spend the majority of time using smaller foraging and resting areas than expected or previously reported, implying that foraging areas may be highly localized, and nutrients obtainable from smaller areas. Additionally, movement reductions over time demonstrates behavioral adjustments that represent divergent energetic demands, the detection of which is a key advantage of higher frequency data. Ducks likely use less energy for movement than currently predicted and management, including distribution and configuration of essential habitat, may require reconsideration.

Using a mesocosm approach, we investigated OA effects on a subtropical zooplankton community during oligotrophic, bloom, and post-bloom phases under a range of different pCO(2) levels (from similar to 400 to similar to 1480 mu atm). Furthermore, we simulated an upwelling event by adding 650 m-depth nutrient-rich water to the mesocosms, which initiated a phytoplankton bloom. No effects of pCO(2) on the zooplankton community were visible in the oligotrophic conditions before the bloom. The zooplankton community responded to phytoplankton bloom by increased abundances in all treatments, although the response was delayed under high-pCO(2) conditions. Microzooplankton was dominated by small dinoflagellates and aloricate ciliates, which were more abundant under medium-to high-pCO(2) conditions. The most abundant mesozooplankters were calanoid copepods, which did not respond to CO2 treatments during the oligotrophic phase of the experiment but were found in higher abundance under medium- and high-pCO(2) conditions toward the end of the experiment, most likely as a response to increased phyto- and microzooplankton standing stocks. The second most abundant mesozooplankton taxon were appendicularians, which did not show a response to the different pCO(2) treatments. Overall, CO2 effects on zooplankton seemed to be primarily transmitted through significant CO2 effects on phytoplankton and therefore indirect pathways. We conclude that elevated pCO(2) can change trophic cascades with significant effects on zooplankton, what might ultimately affect higher trophic levels in the future.

An experiment was designed to grow two common greening tree saplings, ash (Fraxinus chinensis Roxb.) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.), in environments of both land pavement and drought. The results showed that (1) land pavement increased surface and air temperatures and decreased air humidity as well as net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) of ginkgo significantly; (2) drought significantly decreased Pn, Amax and maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-nmax) as well as other photosynthetic parameters of both ash and ginkgo; (3) the negative effects of the combination of land pavement and drought on photosynthetic parameters were more significant than the effects of drought treatment for both ash and ginkgo. This implies that urban trees, especially those growing on land pavements, will confront harsher environments and a greater decline of photosynthesis under the severe and more frequent droughts predicted in the future. Overall, ash showed more tolerance to land pavement and drought than ginkgo, indicating that the selection of tolerant tree species is important for urban planting. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Then a health risk is possible for consumer groups with high game meat intake. The lead concentrations in three edible parts (marketable meat fromthe area close to thewound channel, saddle and haunch) of meat from red deer (Cervus elaphus) between animals hunted either with lead or non-lead ammunition were compared. Furthermore, lead levels in game meat of lead-shot red deer were compared with those of lead-shot roe deer and lead-shot wild boar. Ninety red deer were shot and killed in the context of this study (64 with lead and 26 with non-lead ammunition). Since the lead concentration for a number of the samples was below the limit of detection or the limit of quantification, statistical methods for left-censored data were applied. The median concentrations of lead in game meat did not differ significantly between lead shot and non-lead shot animals. However, when we analyzed the more elevated lead concentrations, they were significantly higher in edible parts of animals shot with lead ammunition than non-lead ammunition. The highest concentrations were found in samples from edible meat from the area close to the wound channel (max 3442 mg Pb/kg), followed by the saddle (max 1.14 mg Pb/kg) and with the lowest levels in the haunch (max 0.09 mg Pb/kg). A comparison of game species revealed that the lead concentration in haunch and saddle of lead shot red deer was higher than in the corresponding samples of lead shot roe deer. Our results have shown that by the use of non-lead ammunition, a significant reduction of the lead concentration especially in edible parts near the wound channel is possible. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Ocean acidification exacerbates the effects of paralytic shellfish toxins on the fitness of the edible mussel Mytilus chilensis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Physiological energetics; PST; CO2; Mussels; Toxic dinoflagellates; Climate change	DINOFLAGELLATE ALEXANDRIUM-TAMARENSE; PHYSIOLOGICAL ENERGETICS; SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION; PROTOGONYAULAX-TAMARENSIS; CARBONIC-ACID; CO2; TEMPERATURE; DETOXIFICATION; RESPONSES; PH	High latitudes are considered particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, since they are naturally low in carbonate ions. The edible mussel Mytilus chilensis is a common calcifier inhabiting marine ecosystems of the southern Chile, where culturing of this species is concentrated and where algal blooms produced by the toxic dinoflagellate A. catenella are becoming more frequent. Juvenile Mytilus chilensis were exposed to experimental conditions simulating two environmental phenomena: pCO(2) increase and the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) produced by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Individuals were exposed to two levels of pCO(2): 380 mu atm (control condition) and 1000 mu atm (future conditions) over a period of 39 days (acclimation), followed by another period of 40 days exposure to a combination of pCO(2) and PST. Both factors significantly affected most of the physiological variables measured (feeding, metabolismand scope for growth). However, these effects greatly varied over time, which can be explained by the high individual variability described formussels exposed to different environmental conditions. Absorption efficiency was not affected by the independent effect of the toxic diet; however, the diet and pCO(2) interaction affected it significantly. The inhibition of the physiological processes related with energy acquisition by diets containing PST, may negatively impact mussel fitness, which could have important consequences for both wild and cultured mussel populations, and thus, for socioeconomic development in southern Chile.

In Europe, nitrate pollution is considered as one of the main threats for the quality of groundwater in agricultural areas. Treatment wetlands (TWs), also known as Constructed Wetlands, are used for groundwater treatment in areas with an important concentration of nitrogen compounds; total nitrogen removal depends on the type and operation scheme. Cork by-product from the industry has shown clear adsorbent properties to remove organic pollutants. The work is focused on the characterization of microbial communities involved in the nitrate-nitrogen removal process in groundwater polluted from agricultural activities. The experimental design allowed the comparison of nitrate removal efficiency depending on the filter media material, cork by-product or gravel, used in two hybrid TWs (a vertical flow cell followed by a horizontal subsurface flow cell), installed in areas close to two irrigated agricultural plots at the Lleida plain area (Spain). Both physicochemical and microbial results were consistent and confirm the nitrate removal efficiency using cork as a filter media. A significant (p=0.0025) higher removal in Bellvis TW using cork compared with the Vilanova de la Barca gravel system was observed, achieving a removal rate from 80 to 99% compared to the 5-46%, respectively. Regarding the community composition of the two different TWs, microorganisms were mainly related to the phylum Proteobacteria, and included members found to be key players in the nitrogen cycle, such as ammonia and nitrite oxidizers, as well as denitrifiers. Also, the group Bacteroidetes turns to be another abundant phylum from our bacterial dataset, whose members are suggested to be strongly involved in denitrification processes. Some groups showed to prevail depending on the type of media (cork or gravel); Firmicutes and Delta and Epsilonproteobacteria had a significant higher abundance in the TW with cork, while Acidobacteria and Planctomyces were prevalent in gravel. Therefore, cork could be an alternative material used by treatment wetlands to minimize the impact in the environment caused by nitrogen pollution in groundwater bodies. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential health risks caused by TWWirrigation of soils differing in their texture, i. e., soil particle fractions including sand, silt and clay. We predicted that the presence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogens would not be linked to TWWirrigation, yet their abundance would be favored by the smallest soil fraction (similar to 2 nm, e. g., clay) as it provides the largest surface area. To test our hypotheses, culture dependent and independent techniques were used to monitor the presence, abundance and source of FIB and microbial pathogens (bacteria and protists) in water (TWW and potable water) and three irrigated soil types (clay, loam and loamy-sand) in a field study spanning two years. The results showed that FIB and pathogens' abundance were significantly different between water types, yet these differences did not carry to the irrigated soils. The abundance and presence of FIB and potential opportunistic or obligate human pathogens did not significantly differ (p > 0.05) between TWWand potable water irrigated soils. Moreover, the source of the FIB and potential pathogens could not be linked to irrigation with TWW. Yet, soil type significantly altered the potential pathogens' diversity (p > 0.05) and abundance (p > 0.05), and differences were affected by clay content, as predicted. The results gave no indication for potential adverse health effects associated with the application of TWW but demonstrated that clay has a particular stabilizing effect on the potential presence of microbial pathogens.

Has the upper limit of the distribution of the seedlings increased during the period under study, and were the changes proportional to the increase in the mean annual temperature in that period? Data used in our study had been collected in permanent sample plots, distributed regularly over the entire forest area in two national parks. The measurements were taken twice, separated by at least 12 years. We analysed the upper distribution range of the most abundant tree species following tree ontogenic stages for two measurement times. The analysed tree species showed contrasting patterns of the distributions of saplings related to the distributions of mature individuals. In one of the national parks, two species (Silver fir and European beech) showed a significant upward expansion. As three measurements were taken in this park, we found that the expansion has increased over time. In the second national park, located only 45 km to the west from the first one, we found no upward expansion in the distribution of both European beech and Silver fir, while Sycamore maple showed a slight downward trend. We conclude that the dynamics of the tree distributions along the elevation gradient in the mountain areas do not follow a uniform path; the indirect effects of changes in environmental conditions may produce different patterns, reflecting the complex nature of the interactions shaping the distributions of the trees.

Effect of intra-urban temperature variation on tree flowering phenology, airborne pollen, and measurement error in epidemiological studies of allergenic pollen	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aerobiology; Allergic rhinitis; Pollen concentrations; Pollen exposure; Quercus	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; LEAF-OUT PHENOLOGY; ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS; OAK-POLLEN; URBAN; RHINITIS; EXPOSURE; COUNTS; AIR; DISPERSION	Temperature gradients in cities can cause inter-neighborhood differences in the timing of pollen release. However, most epidemiological studies examining allergenic pollen utilize daily measurements from a single pollen monitoring station with the implicit assumption that the measured time series of airborne pollen concentrations applies across the study areas, and that the temporal mismatch between concentrations at the counting station and elsewhere in the study area is negligible. This assumption is tested by quantifying temperature using satellite imagery, observing flowering times of oak (Quercus) and mulberry (Morus) trees at multiple sites, and collecting airborne pollen. Epidemiological studies of allergenic pollen are reviewed and temperatures within their study areas are quantified. In this one-year study, peak oak flowering time was well explained by average February nighttime temperature (R-2 = 0.94), which varied by 6 degrees C across Detroit. This relationship was used to predict flowering phenology across the study region. Peak flowering ranged from April 20-May 13 and predicted a substantial portion of relative airborne oak pollen concentrations in Detroit (R-2=0.46) and at the regional pollen monitoring station (R-2=0.61). The regional pollen monitoring station was located in a cooler outlying area where peak flowering occurred around May 12 and peak pollen concentrations were measured on May 15. This provides evidence that the timing of pollen release varies substantially within a metropolitan area and challenges the assumption that pollen measurements at a single location are representative of an entire city. Across the epidemiological studies, 50% of study areas were not within 1 degrees C (equal to a lag or lead of 4 days in flowering time) of temperatures at the pollen measurement location. Epidemiological studies using a single pollen station as a proxy for pollen concentrations are prone to significant measurement error if the study area is climatically variable.

Assessing social and biophysical drivers of spontaneous plant diversity and structure in urban vacant lots	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Chicago; Ecosystem services; Species evenness; Species richness; Urban plant communities; Urban wastelands	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LAND-USE; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; SPECIES RICHNESS; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; CITIES; TRAITS; URBANIZATION; COMMUNITIES	Vacant lots are typically viewed as urban blight but are also green spaces that provide wildlife habitat and ecosystem services in urban landscapes. Vacant lot vegetation results from interacting biophysical and social forces, and studying vacant lot ecology is an opportunity to examine urban socio-environmental intersections. Here, we assess vegetation patterns in vacant lots across Chicago, IL (USA), and ask two questions: 1) How does diversity and structure vary, and 2) how do social and biophysical drivers contribute to this variation? We conducted vegetation surveys in 35 vacant lots in the summer of 2015. In each lot, we identified all herbaceous plants (excluding turf grasses) and woody seedlings and measured species richness, evenness, vegetation height, and total vegetated area. We used field sampled data about human activities and land use in vacant lots (e.g., presence of a path, trash and turf), coupled with sociodemographic data (e.g., income, ethnicity), and fine-scale land cover to construct two models for each vegetation measure: a best-fit biophysical model and a best-fit social model. We then used variation partitioning to compare the relative strength of these models and any overlap between them. In total, we identified 109 plant species. Species evenness was high, suggesting that there are few rare species in this system. Species richness and vegetation height were better explained by social models, while vegetated area and evenness were better explained by biophysical models. We saw evidence of overlapping explanatory power between the social and biophysical domains. The amount of trash in a lot was the most significant variable, explaining three of our vegetation measures. Lots with higher amounts of trash had higher richness and evenness, and lower vegetated area. This assessment of patterns of vegetation in Chicago's vacant lots provides insight into how habitat differs across the city and informs urban conservation paradigms. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the literature is unclear whether associations between PM10 and adverse birth outcomes were driven by PM2.5 alone or also by PM10-2.5 exposure. Research on the variation in exposure to and risk from PM10-2.5 across populations is also needed to identify potentially vulnerable subgroups. We used birth certificate and ambient airmonitoring data in California from 2002 to 2013 to develop a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women and their infants. Averaged gestational and trimester-specific exposuresofPM(10-2.5) and PM(2.5)were calculated formotherswhose residential zip code tabulation areas were within a 20 km radius of monitors. We assessed the relationship between prenatal exposure to PM10-2.5 and term low birthweight (TLBW) using logistic and linear regression, adjusting for maternal and paternal demographic, environmental, temporal, and health-related covariates. We also conducted analyses stratified by socioeconomic characteristics and regions. We found a relationship between PM10-2.5 exposure during pregnancy and TLBWafter controlling for PM2.5 exposure: odds ratio for second quartile of exposure: 1.00 (95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.03), third quartile: 1.03 (1.00, 1.06), fourth quartile: 1.04 (1.01, 1.07), compared to the first quartile. Associations were strong among Non-Hispanic Black mothers, mothers living in the Central Valley, and fathers without a college degree. Exposure to and risk from PM10-2.5 were heterogeneous across California indicating environmental justice implications. We also found that paternal characteristicswere associated with the risk of TLBWeven after controlling for maternal characteristics. In addition to PM10-2.5 total mass, further research is needed on the components of PM10-2.5 which may be driving these associations. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Increases in salinity following a shift in hydrologic regime in a constructed wetland watershed in a post-mining oil sands landscape	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Athabasca Oil Sands Region; Constructed wetland; Hydrochemistry; Peatland; Reclamation; Sodium	PEAT CHEMISTRY; BOREAL PLAINS; FORT MCMURRAY; RECLAMATION; ALBERTA; VEGETATION; SOIL; GROUNDWATER; OVERBURDEN; SODIUM	Bitumen extraction via surface mining in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region results in permanent alteration of boreal forests and wetlands. As part of their legal requirements, oil companies must reclaim disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems. Despite considerable work establishing upland forests, only two pilot wetlandpeatland systems integratedwithin a watershed have been constructed to date. Peatland reclamation is challenging as it requires complete reconstruction with few guidelines or previous work in this region. Furthermore, the variable sub-humid climate and salinity of tailings materials present additional challenges. In 2012, Syncrude Canada Ltd. constructed a 52-ha pilot upland-wetland system, the Sandhill FenWatershed, which was designed with a pump and underdrain system to provide freshwater and enhance drainage to limit salinization from underlying soft tailings materials that have elevated electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+. The objective of this research is to evaluate the hydrochemical response of a constructed wetland to variations in hydrology and water management with respect to water sources, flow pathways and major chemical transformations in the three years following commissioning. Results suggest that active water management practices in 2013 kept EC relatively low, with mostwetland sites <1000 mu S/cmwith Na+ concentrations <250mg/L. With limitedmanagement in 2014 and 2015, the EC increased in the wetland to N1000 mu S/cm in 2014 and >2000 mu S/cm in 2015. The most notable changewas the emergence of several Na+ enriched zones in the margins. Here, Na+ concentrations were two to three times higher than other sites. Stable isotopes of water support that the Na+ enriched areas arise from underlying process-affected water in the tailings, providing evidence of its upward transport and seepage under a natural hydrologic regime. In future years, salinity is expected to evolve in its flow pathways and diffusion, yet the timeline and extent of these changes are uncertain. (c) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.	[Biagi, K.

Experimental design principles to choose the number of Monte Carlo replicates for stochastic ecological models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Stochastic simulation; Confidence interval; Prediction interval; Inference; Estimation		Ecologists often rely on computer models as virtual laboratories to evaluate alternative theories, make predictions, perform scenario analysis, and to aid in decision-making. The application of ecological models can have real-world consequences that drive ecological theory development and science-based decision and policy making, so it is imperative that the conclusions drawn from ecological models have a strong, credible quantitative basis. In particular it is important to establish whether any predicted change in a model output has ecological and statistical significance. Ecological models may include stochastic components, using probability distributions to represent some modeled processes. An individual run of a stochastic ecological model is a random draw from an infinitely large population, requiring replicate simulations to estimate the distribution of model outcomes. An important consideration is the number of Monte Carlo replicates necessary to draw useful conclusions from the model analysis. A simple framework is presented that borrows from well-understood techniques for experimental design, including confidence interval estimation and sample size power analysis. The desired precision of interval estimates for model prediction, or the minimum desired detectable effect size between scenarios, is established by the researcher in the context of the model objectives and the ecological system. The number of replicates required to achieve that level of precision or detectable effect is computed given an estimate of the variability in the model outcomes of interest. If the number of replicates is computationally prohibitive, then the expected precision or detectable effect for that sample size should be reported. An example is given for a stochastic model of fire spread integrated with an eco-hydrological model.

Incorporating temperature and precipitation extremes into process-based models of African lepidoptera changes the predicted distribution under climate change	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Mechanistic model; Climate change; Thermal physiology; Dehydration; Butterfly; Moth; Pest management	SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; BUSSEOLA-FUSCA; RANGE SHIFTS; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; LATITUDINAL PATTERNS; THERMAL PERFORMANCE; STRESS RESISTANCE; INSECT RESPONSES; CHILO-PARTELLUS	Terrestrial insects are responding to ongoing climate change. While these responses have been primarily linked to rising temperatures, insects are sensitive to desiccation, and the impacts of altered precipitation regimes remain relatively unexplored. Here, we develop a mechanistic model of survival and performance responses to both temperature and desiccation stress, focussing on Lepidoptera in Africa, where a general understanding of such responses to climate change is urgently required. We run the model with climate data from general circulation models at daily time intervals under current (2011-2015) and projected future (2046-2050) climate scenarios. We first simulate four hypothetical, but typical, Lepidoptera that vary in thermal tolerance and developmental physiology, and then add a constraint on survival due to desiccation. Including desiccation stress leads to a 68% decline in the species range, in comparison to simulations where only species mortality due to temperature is considered. Furthermore, in response to predicted changes in both temperature and rainfall, species performances and survival are expected to change in a non-uniform manner across the landscape: species' ranges shift towards coastal regions and into higher latitudes in the southern, but not northern, hemisphere. We validate the model predictions with data from two endemic African Lepidoptera, and find that the model agrees well with their empirical distribution, but note that our model fails to account for range expansion due to water availability unrelated to rainfall (e.g. irrigation). Nonetheless, these final simulations show how the model can be readily applied to insects for which baseline physiological data already exist (or for which appropriate data can be gathered), thereby providing a useful framework with which to explore species responses to future changes in temperature and precipitation.

Among more than 600 stations covering 35 000 km of coastline, about 80% on the Skagerrak coast and about 40% on the North Sea coast were dominated by turf. Various types of turf algae replaced S. latissima in a discontinuous pattern. This large spatial scale event was reported as a possible irrevocable regime shift, not caused by a single factor but related to multiple stressors, where eutrophication and ocean warming were proposed to be the most important. Recent observations have however, revealed that the seabed state has flipped back and forth between sugar kelp and turf algae in several areas and on temporal scales spanning from seasons to years. The relative abundance of S. latissima at monitoring sites at the Norwegian southern coast has fluctuated dramatically during the last 12 years, varying from sparse to common at several of these sites. In 2016, sugar kelp abundance had increased in more than half of the sites, compared to earlier years. Our monitoring data as well as other field observations and field experiments question the regime shift paradigm. Although traditionally considered as a perennial macrophyte, several of our studies indicate that sugar kelp possesses many of the characteristic traits of an opportunistic species, such as high dispersal potential and colonization rate, which enables the species to rapidly colonize available substrate. However, where turf algae persist, space for recolonization of sugar kelp will most likely be minor. In this paper we explore the spatial and temporal shift dynamic between sugar kelp and turf algae based on monitoring data and other studies. Based on a synthesis of mapped fluctuations between the two states, and studies on sugar kelps recolonization abilities, we discuss prerequisites and drivers for an irrevocable regime shift or a continuation of natural fluctuations, as well as possible mitigation actions.

Therefore, optimum rates and timing of resource applications, such as nutrients and irrigation water, may vary as well. It remains a challenge to quantify the spatial variability of a field and to identify effective ways to manage fields in a site-specific manner. The objective of this study was to delineate management zones within a farmer's field based on relatively easily obtainable information that is statistically integrated. Moreover, soil water temporal dynamics should be evaluated regarding their spatial differences in different zones. The set of direct and indirect observations included clay and silt content, apparent electrical conductivity, soil chemical properties (pH; organic matter; and total N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Zn), satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and lidar-based topographic variables in a western Kentucky field. Several key variables and their capability to describe spatial crop yield variability were identified by using principal component analysis: soil clay content, slope, soil organic matter content, topographic wetness index, and NDVI. Two types of cluster analysis were applied to delineate management zones. The cluster analyses revealed that two to three zones was the optimal number of classes based on different criteria. Delineated zones were evaluated and revealed significant differences in corn (Zea mays L.) yield and temporally different soil moisture dynamics.

Early-life social environment predicts social network position in wild zebra finches	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						brood size manipulation; developmental stress; early environment; replication experiment; social behaviour; Taeniopygia guttata	CLUTCH SIZE; INDIVIDUAL OPTIMIZATION; BAND-COLOR; BROOD SIZE; BEHAVIOR; STRESS; CONSEQUENCES; PERSONALITIES; PREFERENCES; POPULATION	Early-life experience can fundamentally shape individual life-history trajectories. Previous research has suggested that exposure to stress during development causes differences in social behaviour later in life. In captivity, juvenile zebra finches exposed to elevated corticosterone levels were less socially choosy and more central in their social networks when compared to untreated siblings. These differences extended to other aspects of social life, with 'stress-exposed' juveniles switching social learning strategies and juvenile males less faithfully learning their father's song. However, while this body of research suggests that the impacts of early-life stress could be profound, it remains unknown whether such effects are strong enough to be expressed under natural conditions. Here, we collected data on social associations of zebra finches in the Australian desert after experimentally manipulating brood sizes. Juveniles from enlarged broods experienced heightened sibling competition, and we predicted that they would express similar patterns of social associations to stress-treated birds in the captive study by having more, but less differentiated, relationships. We show striking support for the suggested consequences of developmental stress on social network positions, with our data from the wild replicating the same results in 9 out of 10 predictions previously tested in captivity. Chicks raised in enlarged broods foraged with greater numbers of conspecifics butwere less 'choosy' and more central in the social network. Our results confirm that the natural range of variation in early-life experience can be sufficient to predict individuals' social trajectories and support theory highlighting the potential importance of developmental conditions on behaviour.

Here we test this concept across the annual cycle of long-distance migratory birds. Using more than 350 migration tracks of small-bodied trans-Saharan migrants, we quantify differences in male and female migration schedules and test for proximate determinants of sex-specific timing. In autumn, males started migration about 2 days earlier, but this difference did not carry over to arrival at the non-breeding sites. In spring, males on average departed from the African non-breeding sites about 3 days earlier and reached breeding sites ca 4 days ahead of females. A cross-species comparison revealed large variation in the level of protandry and protogyny across the annual cycle. While we found tight links between individual timing of departure and arrival within each migration season, only for males the timing of spring migration was linked to the timing of previous autumn migration. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that protandry is not exclusively a reproductive strategy but rather occurs year-round and the two main proximate determinants for the magnitude of sex-biased arrival times in autumn and spring are sex-specific differences in departure timing and migration duration.

Forest passerines as a novel dispersal vector of viable bryophyte propagules	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						bryophyte; dispersal; zoochory; plant-animal; interactions; spore dispersal; avian dispersal	COMMUNITY-LEVEL CONSEQUENCES; SEED DISPERSAL; FORAGING ECOLOGY; BIRDS; DISTANCE; ENDOZOOCHORY; WOODPECKERS; DISJUNCTION; FRAGMENTS; FRAMEWORK	Animal dispersal influences the community structure and diversity of a wide variety of plant taxa, yet the potential effects of animal dispersal in bryophytes (hornworts, liverworts, and mosses) is poorly understood. In many communities, birds use bryophyte-abundant niche space for foraging and gathering nest material, suggesting that birds may play a role in bryophyte dispersal. As highly motile animals with long migratory routes, birds potentially provide a means for both local and long-distance bryophyte dispersal in a manner that differs greatly from passive, aerial spore dispersal. To examine this phenomenon, we collected and germinated bryophyte propagules from the legs, feet and tails of 224 birds from 34 species within a temperate forest community. In total we found 1512 spores, and were able to germinate 242 bryophyte propagules. In addition, we provide evidence that topical (externally-carried) spore load varies by bird species and behaviour. Tail feather spore abundance is highest in bark and foliage gleaning species and is positively correlated with tarsal length. Together, these data suggest that a variety of forest birds exhibit the potential to act as dispersal vectors for bryophyte propagules, including an abundance of spores, and that understanding the effects of animal behaviour on bryophyte dispersal will be key to further understanding this interaction.

Ancestral and offspring nutrition interact to affect life-history traits in Drosophila melanogaster	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						transgenerational epigenetic; inheritance; phenotype; nutrition; starvation; Drosophila	SIZE; MODEL; ADAPTATION; MECHANISMS; PLASTICITY; RESISTANCE; ORIGIN; GENOME; DIET	Ancestral environmental conditions can impact descendant phenotypes through a variety of epigenetic mechanisms. Previous studies on transgenerational effects in Drosophila melanogaster suggest that parental nutrition may affect the body size, developmental duration and egg size of the next generation. However, it is unknown whether these effects on phenotype remain stable across generations, or if specific generations have general responses to ancestral diet. In the current study, we examined the effect on multiple life-history phenotypes of changing diet quality across three generations. Our analysis revealed unforeseen patterns in how phenotypes respond to dietary restriction. Our generalized linear model showed that when considering only two generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily affected by their own diet, and to a lesser extent by the diet of their parents or the interaction between the two generations. Surprisingly, however, when considering three generations, offspring phenotypes were primarily impacted by their grandparents' diet and their own diet. Interactions among different generations' diets affected development time, egg volume and pupal mass more than ovariole number or wing length. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons of diet groups from the same generation revealed commonalities in strong responses to rich versus poor diet: ovariole number, pupal mass and wing length responded more strongly to poor diet than to rich diet, while development time responded strongly to both rich and poor diets. To improve investigations into the mechanisms and consequences of transgenerational, epigenetic inheritance, future studies should closely examine how phenotypes change across a higher number of generations, and consider responses to broader variability in diet treatments.

Global predictors of alien plant establishment success: combining niche and trait proxies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						anthropogenic disturbance; biological invasions; ecological niche; historical biogeography; open-access database	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; AUSTRALIAN ACACIAS; HUMAN FOOTPRINT; DISTRIBUTIONS; INVASIVENESS; EQUILIBRIUM; PHYLOGENIES; MYRTACEAE; EVOLUTION	Biological invasions are on the rise globally. To reduce future invasions, it is imperative to determine the naturalization potential of species. Until now, screening approaches have relied largely on species-specific functional feature data. Such information is, however, time-consuming and expensive to collect, thwarting the screening of large numbers of potential invaders. We propose to resolve such data limitations by developing indicators of establishment success of alien species that can be readily derived from open-access databases. These indicators describe key features of successfully established aliens, including estimates of potential range size, niche overlap with human-disturbed environments, and proxies of species traits related to their palaeoinvasions and local dominance capacities. We demonstrate the utility of this new approach by applying it to two large and highly invasive plant groups: Australian acacias and eucalypts. Our results show that these indicators robustly predict establishment successes and failures in each clade independently, and that they can cross-predict establishment in these two clades. Interestingly, the indicator identified as most important was species potential range size on Earth, a variable too rarely considered as a predictor. By successfully identifying key features that predispose Australian plants to naturalize, we provide an objective and cost-effective protocol for flagging high-risk introductions.

In polyandrous species, male reproductive fitness depends on both mating and fertilization success. Because successful mating is a prerequisite for post-copulatory sexual selection, ejaculate traits are expected to senesce faster than pre-copulatory traits, as precopulatory sexual selection is often deemed to be stronger than post-copulatory sexual selection. This pattern has generally been found in the few empirical studies conducted so far. We tested this prediction in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a livebearing fish characterized by intense sperm competition, by comparing the expression of male sexual traits at two ages (four and nine months). Contrary to prediction, we found that post-copulatory traits senesced at a significantly slower rate than pre-copulatory traits. We also looked at whether early investment in those sexual traits affects longevity, and the interaction between sperm age (duration of sperm storage inside the male) and male age. Our results suggest that the relative senescence rate of pre- and post-copulatory sexual traits may vary among species with different mating systems and ecology.

Yet, the quantification of community recovery in coral reefs has been challenging owing to a paucity of long-term ecological data and high frequency of disturbances. Here we investigate community re-assembly and the bio-physical drivers that determine the capacity of coral reefs to recover following the 1998 bleaching event, using long-term monitoring data across four habitats in Palau. Our study documents that the time needed for coral reefs to recover from bleaching disturbance to coral-dominated state in disturbance-free regimes is at least 9-12 years. Importantly, we show that reefs in two habitats achieve relative stability to a climax community state within that time frame. We then investigated the direct and indirect effects of drivers on the rate of recovery of four dominant coral groups using a structural equation modelling approach. While the rates of recovery differed among coral groups, we found that larval connectivity and juvenile coral density were prominent drivers of recovery for fast growing Acropora but not for the other three groups. Competitive algae and parrotfish had negative and positive effects on coral recovery in general, whereas wave exposure had variable effects related to coral morphology. Overall, the time needed for community re-assembly is habitat specific and drivers of recovery are taxa specific, considerations that require incorporation into planning for ecosystem management under climate change.

Diurnal variation in the production of vocal information about food supports a model of social adjustment in wild songbirds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						collective animal behaviour; foraging; group living; signalling; social information use; vocal recruitment	MIXED-SPECIES FLOCKS; GROUP-SIZE; PREDATION RISK; CALLS; CONFORMITY; GEOMETRY; PREY; TITS	Wintering songbirds have been widely shown to make economic foraging decisions to manage the changing balance of risks from predation and starvation over the course of the day. In this study, we ask whether the communication and use of information about food availability differ throughout the day. First, we assessed temporal variation in food-related vocal information produced in foraging flocks of tits (Paridae) using audio recordings at radio-frequency identification-equipped feeding stations. Vocal activity was highest in the morning and decreased into the afternoon. This pattern was not explained by there being fewer birds present, as we found that group sizes increased over the course of the day. Next, we experimentally tested the underlying causes for this diurnal calling pattern. We set up bird feeders with or without playback of calls from tits, either in the morning or in the afternoon, and compared latency to feeder discovery, accumulation of flock members, and total number of birds visiting the feeder. Irrespective of time of day, playbacks had a strong effect on all three response measures when compared to silent control trials, demonstrating that tits will readily use vocal information to improve food detection throughout the day. Thus, the diurnal pattern of foraging behaviour did not appear to affect use and production of food-related vocalizations. Instead, we suggest that, as the day progresses and foraging group sizes increase, the costs of producing calls at the food source (e.g. competition and attraction of predators) outweigh the benefits of recruiting group members (i.e. adding individuals to large groups only marginally increases safety in numbers), causing the observed decrease in vocal activity into the afternoon. Our findings imply that individuals make economic social adjustments based on conditions of their social environment when deciding to vocally recruit group members.	[Hillemann, F.; Cole, E.

Non-native honey bees disproportionately dominate the most abundant floral resources in a biodiversity hotspot	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						honey bees; Apis mellifera; introduced species; native bees; pollinator visitation; pollination services	POLLINATOR VISITATION; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE; INTRODUCED BEES; PLANT; HYMENOPTERA; MUTUALISM; IMPACTS; DENSITY; SET	Most plant-pollinator mutualisms are generalized. As such, they are susceptible to perturbation by abundant, generalist, non-native pollinators such as the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which can reach high abundances and visit flowers of many plant species in their expansive introduced range. Despite the prevalence of non-native honey bees, their effects on pollination mutualisms in natural ecosystems remain incompletely understood. Here, we contrast community-level patterns of floral visitation by honey bees with that of the diverse native pollinator fauna of southern California, USA. We show that the number of honey bees visiting plant species increases much more rapidly with flower abundance than does that of non-honey bee insects, such that the percentage of all visitors represented by honey bees increases with flower abundance. Thus, honey bees could disproportionately impact the most abundantly blooming plant species and the large numbers of both specialized and generalized pollinator species that they sustain. Honey bees may preferentially exploit high-abundance floral resources because of their ability to recruit nest-mates; these foraging patterns may cause native insect species to forage on lower-abundance resources to avoid competition. Our results illustrate the importance of understanding foraging patterns of introduced pollinators in order to reveal their ecological impacts.

Heterochronic shifts and conserved embryonic shape underlie crocodylian craniofacial disparity and convergence	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Crocodylia; skull; geometric morphometrics; embryonic ontogeny; heterochrony; evolutionary developmental biology	DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS; INTEGRATIVE APPROACH; EVOLUTION; VERTEBRATE; MORPHOLOGY; TRANSITIONS; DIVERSITY; ONTOGENY; REVEALS; TIME	The distinctive anatomy of the crocodylian skull is intimately linked with dietary ecology, resulting in repeated convergence on blunt- and slender-snouted ecomorphs. These evolutionary shifts depend upon modifications of the developmental processes which direct growth and morphogenesis. Here we examine the evolution of cranial ontogenetic trajectories to shed light on the mechanisms underlying convergent snout evolution. We use geometric morphometrics to quantify skeletogenesis in an evolutionary context and reconstruct ancestral patterns of ontogenetic allometry to understand the developmental drivers of craniofacial diversity within Crocodylia. Our analyses uncovered a conserved embryonic region of morphospace (CER) shared by all non-gavialid crocodylians regardless of their eventual adult ecomorph. This observation suggests the presence of conserved developmental processes during early development (before Ferguson stage 20) across most of Crocodylia. Ancestral state reconstruction of ontogenetic trajectories revealed heterochrony, developmental constraint, and developmental systems drift have all played essential roles in the evolution of ecomorphs. Based on these observations, we conclude that two separate, but interconnected, developmental programmes controlling craniofacial morphogenesis and growth enabled the evolutionary plasticity of skull shape in crocodylians.

The evolution of such cephalopod novelties has been attributed at a genomic level to independent gene family expansions, yet the exact association and the evolutionary timing remain unclear. In the octopus genome, one such expansion occurred in the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) repertoire, a superfamily of proteins that mediate signal transduction. Here, we assessed the evolutionary history of this expansion and its relationship with cephalopod novelties. Using phylogenetic analyses, at least two cephalopod- and two octopus-specific GPCR expansions were identified. Signatures of positive selection were analysed within the four groups, and the locations of these sequences in the Octopus bimaculoides genome were inspected. Additionally, the expression profiles of cephalopod GPCRs across various tissues were extracted from available transcriptomic data. Our results reveal the evolutionary history of cephalopod GPCRs. Unexpanded cephalopod GPCRs shared with other bilaterians were found to be mainly nervous tissue specific. By contrast, duplications that are shared between octopus and the bobtail squid or specific to the octopus' lineage generated copies with divergent expression patterns devoted to tissues outside of the brain. The acquisition of novel expression domains was accompanied by gene order rearrangement through either translocation or duplication and gene loss. Lastly, expansions showed signs of positive selection and some were found to form tandem clusters with shared conserved expression profiles in cephalopod innovations such as the axial nerve cord. Altogether, our results contribute to the understanding of the molecular and evolutionary history of signal transduction and provide insights into the role of this expansion during the emergence of cephalopod novelties and/or adaptations.

We assess variation in social-ecological vulnerability to climate change-induced coral bleaching, specifically for reef-based fisheries and tourism, of islands throughout the insular Caribbean, thus providing the first region-wide quantitative analysis of island-scale social-ecological vulnerability to coral bleaching. We show that different components of vulnerability have distinct spatial patterns and that variability in overall vulnerability is driven more by socio-economic than ecological components. Importantly, we find that sovereign islands are less vulnerable on average than overseas territories and that the presence of fisheries management regulations is a significant predictor of adaptive capacity and socio-economic sensitivity, with important implications for island-level governance and policies to reduce climate vulnerability.

The evolution of traits and functions in herbivorous coral reef fishes through space and time	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						parrotfishes; surgeonfishes; rabbitfishes; algal turf removal; macroalgae removal; bioerosion	BIOGEOGRAPHY; PARROTFISHES; EXTINCTION; HISTORY; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ORIGINS; SHIFTS; ROLES; LINES	Herbivory by fishes has been identified as a key ecological process shaping coral reefs through time. Although taxonomically limited, herbivorous reef fishes display a wide range of traits, which results in varied ecosystem functions on reefs around the world. Yet, we understand little about how these trait combinations and functions in ecosystems changed through time and across biogeographic realms. Here, we used fossils and phylogenies in a functional ecological framework to reveal temporal changes in nominally herbivorous fish assemblages among oceanic basins in both trait space and lineage richness among functions. We show that the trait space occupied by extant herbivorous fishes in the Indo-Pacific resulted from an expansion of traits from the ancestral Tethyan assemblages. By contrast, trait space in the Atlantic is the result of lineage turnover, with relatively recent colonization by lineages that arose in the east Tethys/Indo-Pacific. From an ecosystem function perspective, the Atlantic supports a depauperate fauna, with few extant herbivorous reef fish lineages performing each function. Indo-Pacific fishes support both more functions and more lineages within each function, with a marked Miocene to Pleistocene expansion. These disparities highlight the importance of history in explaining global variation in fish functional composition on coral reefs.

Lagerstatten, sites which have historically yielded exceptionally preserved fossils, provide remarkable, yet distorting insights into past life. When examining macroevolutionary trends in the fossil record, they can generate an uneven sampling signal for taxonomic diversity; by comparison, their effect on morphological variety (disparity) is poorly understood. We show here that lagerstatten impact the disparity of ichthyosaurs, Mesozoic marine reptiles, by preserving higher diversity and more complete specimens. Elsewhere in the fossil record, undersampled diversity and more fragmentary specimens produce spurious results. We identify a novel effect, that a taxon moves towards the centroid of a Generalized Euclidean dataset as its proportion of missing data increases. We term this effect 'centroid slippage', as a disparity-based analogue of phylogenetic stemward slippage. Our results suggest that uneven sampling presents issues for our view of disparity in the fossil record, but that this is also dependent on the methodology used, especially true with widely used Generalized Euclidean distances. Mitigation of missing cladistic data is possible by phylogenetic gap filling, and heterogeneous effects of lagerstatten on disparity may be accounted for by understanding the factors affecting their spatio-temporal distribution.

Thus, larger eyes should aid both in finding food as well as detecting predators. On the other hand, eyes are usually very conspicuous and several studies have suggested that eye size is associated with predation risk. However, experimental evidence is scant. In this study, we address how predation affects variation in eye size by performing two experiments using Eurasian perch juveniles as prey and either larger perch or pike as predators. First, we used large outdoor tanks to compare selection due to predators on relative eye size in open and artificial vegetated habitats. Second, we studied the effects of both predation risk and resource levels on phenotypic plasticity in relative eye size in indoor aquaria experiments. In the first experiment, we found that habitat altered selection due to predators, since predators selected for smaller eye size in a non-vegetated habitat, but not in a vegetated habitat. In the plasticity experiment, we found that fish predators induced smaller eye size in males, but not in females, while resource levels had no effect on eye size plasticity. Our experiments provide evidence that predation risk could be one of the driving factors behind variation in eye size within species.

Loss of top-down biotic interactions changes the relative benefits for obligate mutualists	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						trophic cascades; fig-fig wasp mutualism; parasitoids; interspecific interactions	INVASIVE FIG TREE; ENEMY-FREE SPACE; WASP; OVIPOSITION; SEED; SPECIATION; MECHANISM; PARASITES; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY	The collapse of mutualisms owing to anthropogenic changes is contributing to losses of biodiversity. Top predators can regulate biotic interactions between species at lower trophic levels and may contribute to the stability of such mutualisms, but they are particularly likely to be lost after disturbance of communities. We focused on the mutualism between the fig tree Ficus microcarpa and its host-specific pollinator fig wasp and compared the benefits accrued by the mutualists in natural and translocated areas of distribution. Parasitoids of the pollinator were rare or absent outside the natural range of the mutualists, where the relative benefits the mutualists gained from their interaction were changed significantly away from the plant's natural range owing to reduced seed production rather than increased numbers of pollinator offspring. Furthermore, in the absence of the negative effects of its parasitoids, we detected an oviposition range expansion by the pollinator, with the use of a wider range of ovules that could otherwise have generated seeds. Loss of top-down control has therefore resulted in a change in the balance of reciprocal benefits that underpins this obligate mutualism, emphasizing the value of maintaining food web complexity in the Anthropocene.

An experimental test of energy and electrolyte supplementation as a mitigation strategy for white-nose syndrome	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Bats; dehydration; electrolytes; hibernation; white-nose syndrome	EVAPORATIVE WATER-LOSS; BATS; DISEASE	Fungi are increasingly recognised as harmful pathogens of wildlife. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease that has killed millions of hibernating bats in North America. High mortality has driven research to identify management strategies for the disease. Increased energy expenditure and fat depletion, as well as fluid loss, hypotonic dehydration and electrolyte depletion appear to be key aspects of WNS pathophysiology. Bats with WNS spend energy too quickly and also lose fluids containing water and electrolytes from lesions on exposed skin surfaces. During periodic arousals, bats often drink water but, in most of the WNS-affected area, food is not available during winter and, therefore, they cannot maintain energy balance or replace lost electrolytes. Therefore, providing a liquid caloric/electrolyte/nutrient supplement could be useful for treating WNS. We studied captive, hibernating little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to test whether providing supplemental energy and electrolytes (a 1:1 dilution of unflavoured Pedialyte) to hibernating bats could reduce severity of WNS symptoms and increase survival. Infected bats in the Pedialyte-supplemented group generally avoided the Pedialyte and preferentially drank plain water. We did not observe any differences in survival, arousal frequency or blood chemistry, but bats in the Pedialyte-supplemented group had higher fungal load and more UV fluorescence than the control group that was only provided with water. Supplemental electrolytes would be an attractive management strategy because of their low cost and logistic feasibility but our results suggest this approach would be ineffective. However, it could be useful to conduct preference experiments with multiple dilutions and/or flavours of electrolyte solution. Although they did not prefer Pedialyte in our experiment, bats in the hand readily drink it and electrolyte supplementation remains an important tool for rehabilitation of captive bats recovering from WNS and other causes of dehydration.

A meta-analysis of the carbon footprints of different production systems	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Meta-analysis; Life cycle assessment; Carbon footprint; Pasture-based milk production	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; MILK-PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; NEW-ZEALAND; CONFINEMENT; LCA; SENSITIVITY; PARAMETERS; INTENSITY	The global warming potential of milk production is a key aspect in the assessment of its eco-efficiency. The carbon footprint summarises the climate-relevant emissions of the production cycle, with this study focussing on the emissions from cradle to farm gate as boundaries. Numerous life cycle assessments were published in recent years, presenting the carbon footprint for different regions, production systems and management scenarios. However, despite the obvious high scientific interest in this topic, general conclusions on the climate-friendliness of contrasting production systems can hardly be drawn and there is no clear answer to the question of whether or not grazing systems provide an overall more climate friendly alternative to confinement systems. To resolve this discussion, a meta-analysis was applied to a dataset, created with data from a selection of 30 published life cycle assessments, comprising in total 87 carbon footprint values from 15 different countries. After a standardisation process, three production system categories (pasture-based, mixed and confinement) were defined based on feeding parameters. Aside from the comparison of the production systems, the effects of various production variables (pasture and concentrate intake, milk yield per cow, milk yield per kg of metabolic live weight, mineral nitrogen fertilisation, feed efficiency and replacement rate) were analysed. Therefore, linear and level-log mixed models were developed and analyses of covariance performed. As the dataset used for the analysis covered a large range of different intensities per production system, the results are based on a robust analysis and can be extrapolated to any milk production system with known in- and outputs. The results show that increases in milk yield, pasture intake and feed efficiency decreased the carbon footprint of milk significantly, independent of the production system. However, the mitigation potential is limited across production systems with regard to their productivity thresholds. The comparison of the systems without consideration of other production parameters did not reveal any significant differences. When controlling for milk yield, however, the pasture-based system achieved lower carbon footprints compared to the other production systems. Thus, irrespective of the importance of milk yield for emissions and the generally lower milk yields of the pasture-based production system, this system still offers a competitive climate impact.

The core of several recycling systems consists of mechanical comminution, which aims at producing homogeneous mixtures of highly liberated particles. However, the complexity of comminution processes requires adequate models to control and optimize their behavior within the entire recycling system. In the literature, the so-called Population Balance Model has been proposed, which is however limited to the mining industry. In this paper, we examine the applicability of the Population Balance Models in the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment recycling industry. In particular, we include the homogeneity and multiplication assumptions, and analyze the impact of the comminution chamber saturation. These simplifications reduce the number of model parameters to be estimated, as the set of parameters remains the same over a wide range of working conditions. We tested our assumptions on a real system for recycling Printed Circuit Boards. Results showed the validity of the multiplication assumption and a marginal effect of saturation (p values for rotor velocity and saturation were always above 25% in an ANOVA with the Bonferroni correction). The homogeneity assumption is also tenable, with the exception of the initial transient, as the null hypothesis of constant output mass distribution under equivalent shredding times was never rejected at the 5% significance level. Outcomes of an out-of-sample validation confirmed the effectiveness of our simplified Population Balance Model (values of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric lower than 0.1). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In China, emission controls have been implemented to improve air quality during large events, like the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in August 2014 in Nanjing. In this work, six measurement campaigns between January 2014 and August 2015 were undertaken in Nanjing to determine the effects of emission controls and meteorological factors on PM2.5 concentration and composition. PAHs, OPAHs, hopanes, n-alkanes, heavy metals, and several other inorganic elements were measured. PM2.5 and potassium concentrations were the highest in May-June 2014 indicating the prevalence of BB plumes in Nanjing. Emission controls substantially reduced concentrations of PM2.5 (31%), total PAHs (59%), OPAHs (37%), and most heavy metals (44-89%) during the YOG compared to August 2015. In addition, regional atmospheric transport and meteorological parameters partly explained the observed differences between the campaigns. The most abundant PAHs and OPAHs were benzo [b,k] fluoranthenes, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, 1,8-naphthalic anhydride, and 9,10-anthracenedione in all campaigns. Carbon preference index and the contribution of wax n-alkanes indicated mainly biogenic sources of n-alkanes in May-June 2014 and anthropogenic sources in the other campaigns. Hopane indexes pointed to vehicular transport as the major source of hopanes, but contribution of coal combustion was detected in winter 2015. The results provide evidence to the local government of the impacts of the air protection regulations. However, differences between individual components were observed, e.g., concentrations of potentially more harmful OPAHs decreased less than concentrations of PAHs. The results suggest that the proportions of hazardous components in the PM2.5 may also change considerably due to emission control measures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we examined the formation of the regulated DBPs (Trichloromethanes, THM, and Haloacetic acids, HAA) during full-scale water treatment operations both with prechlorination treatment (normal operations for the drinking water plant) and without (altered operations); followed by coagulation, flocculation, filtration, and chlorination. The source water DOM concentration ranged 6.4 to 7.3 mg-C/L. DOM composition was moderately humic and degraded with a mix of microbial- and terrestrial-like characteristics. Removal of raw water prechlorination caused an average reduction in total THM and HAA concentrations of 52.7% and 40.0%, respectively, with the greater reduction noted for chlorinated-DBPs rather than brominated-DBPs. Prechlorination treatment resulted in a higher relative production of Cl3CH and BrCl2CH associated with aromatic, humic, and terrestrial-like DOM. Without prechlorination, the DBP pool had higher proportions of brominated-DBPs (Br3CH, Br2ClCH, Br2CHCOOH, BrClCHCOOH, and BrCH2COOH) associated with microbial-like, processed humic-like, and protein-like DOM. These observed patterns could not be explained by chloride demand and DOM concentration, indicating that DOM composition played an important role in DBP formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While a portion of the Cl- applied as road salt is quickly flushed into streams during melt events via overland flow and flow through storm sewer pipes, the remainder enters the subsurface. Previous studies of individual watersheds have shown that between 28 and 77% of the applied Cl- is retained on an annual basis, however a systematic evaluation of the spatial variability in Cl- retention and potential driving factors has not been carried out. Here we used a mass balance approach to estimate annual Cl- retention in 11 watersheds located in southern Ontario, Canada, which span a gradient of urbanization. We evaluated the influence of multiple landscape variables on the magnitude of Cl- retention as well as the long-term rate of change in stream Cl- concentration for the same systems. We found that mean annual Cl- retention ranged from 40 to 90% and was higher for less urbanized watersheds and for water-sheds with urban areas located farther from the stream outlet. This result suggests that less urbanized watersheds and ones with longer flow pathways have more Cl- partitioned into storage and hence the potential for legacy Cl- effects on aquatic organisms. While we did measure statistically significant increasing trends in stream Cl- concentration in some watersheds, there was no consistent relationship between the long-term rate of change in stream Cl- concentrations and patterns of urbanization and the magnitude of Cl- retention. Based on our results we present a detailed conceptual model of watershed Cl- dynamics that can be used to guide future research into the mechanisms of Cl- retention and release within a watershed.

Because of the scale of re-vegetation and man-made micro-topographies in regions of hillies and gullies, quantifying the effects of land preparation techniques, precipitation, and vegetation on runoff and soil erosion remains challenging, particularly in semi-arid areas. This study investigated the runoff and erosion characteristics associated with different land preparation techniques (level bench, level ditch, fish-scale pits and adverse-grade tableland) in combination with different tree species (i.e., Caragana microphylla, Pinus tabulaeformis, Armeniaca sibirica, Platycladus orientalis) using network and redundancy analyses (RDA). Network analysis was used to identify the factors (rainfall features, vegetation types, and land preparation techniques) influential in surface runoff and erosion, while RDA was used to focus on the relations between surface runoff, soil erosion, and all of the influencing factors. Our results suggested that land preparation technique could reduce runoff generation on steep slopes, a key process that affects soil loss, although the extent was affected largely by the influence of the combination of the design of the engineering structure and the shape of the vegetation canopy. Our study indicated that Network analysis and RDA are practical methods to quantify the interactions and co-dependencies between rainfall features and other critical factors (vegetation type and ecological engineering) on runoff and soil loss that were difficult to assess previously using classical regression.

Previous studies have found climatic factors have an influential role in the transmission of HFMD. Internet search technology has been shown to predict some infectious disease epidemics and is a potential resource in tracking epidemics in countries where the use of Internet search index data is prevalent. This study aims to improve the prediction of HFMD in two Chinese cities, Shantou and Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, applying both meteorological data and Baidu search indices to create a HFMD forecasting model. To this end, the relationship between meteorological factors and HFMD was found to be linear in both cities, while the relationship between search engine data and HFMD was not consistent. The results of our study suggest that using both Internet search and meteorological data can improve the prediction of HFMD incidence. Using comparative analysis of both cities, we posit that improved quality search indices enhance prediction of HFMD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, soil and landscape protective measures, especially afforestations, have been implemented in the Mediterranean region since the early 20th century. This study aims to determine the long term impact of afforestation on soil functioning, in comparison with natural re-vegetation (secondary succession) on abandoned fields and semi-natural vegetation. A comparison of secondary succession and afforestation with the present traditional rain fed cereal fields and semi-natural (open) forest, including natural resource islands, was made as well. Composite soil samples were taken to study the physical (i.e. texture, aggregate stability) and chemical (i.e. carbon content, nutrient availability) soil characteristics after 20 and 40 years of afforestation and secondary natural succession. To take into account the resource island effect, the spatial heterogeneity induced by differences in plant cover, samples were taken both below and in between the tree canopy of the semi-natural and afforested Pinus halepensis trees. Our results indicate that under secondary succession on abandoned fields, soil quality improves non-linearly and only marginally over a time of 40 years. The afforestation showed a much more pronounced linear increase for most soil quality indicators, resulting in soil conditions comparable to what can be found under the semi-natural forest vegetation. Site preparation might have been a crucial factor for the success of ecosystem restoration in the studied dry land area as it improved water availability for the afforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Participatory coastal management through elicitation of ecosystem service preferences and modelling driven by "coastal squeeze"	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Coastal lagoons; Ecosystem-based management; Spatial multi-criteria analysis; Saltmarshes; Biodiversity	STAKEHOLDERS PERCEPTIONS; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; BETA REGRESSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCENARIOS RIA; NATURA 2000; AVEIRO; SALINITY; LAGOON; OPPORTUNITIES	The Baixo Vouga Lagunar (BVL) is part of Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon in Portugal, which is classified as a Special Protection Area under the European Habitats and Birds Directives. This part of the system, corresponding to the confluence of the Vouga River with the lagoon, is very important culturally and socioeconomically for the local communities, taking place several human activities, especially agriculture. To prevent salt water intrusion from the Ria de Aveiro into agriculture fields, a floodbank was initiated in the 90's. In frame of ongoing changes in Ria de Aveiro hydrodynamics, the existing floodbank will be now extended, introducing further changes in the ecological dynamics of the BVL and its adjacent area. As a consequence, the water level in the floodbank down-stream side is expected to rise, increasing the submersion period in tidal wetlands, and leading to coastal squeeze. The aim of this study is to apply an ecosystem based-management approach to mitigate the impacts on biodiversity resulting from the management plan. To do so, we have modelled the implications of the changes in several hydrological and environmental variables on four saltmarsh species and habitats distribution, as well as on their associated ecosystem services, both upstream and downstream of the floodbank. The ecosystem services of interest were prioritized by stakeholders' elicitation, which were then used as an input to a spatial multi-criteria analysis aimed to find the best management actions to compensate for the unintended loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the BVL. According to our results, the main areas to be preserved in the BVL were the traditional agricultural mosaic fields; the freshwater courses and the subtidal estuarine channels. By combining ecology with the analysis of social preferences, this study shows how co-developed solutions can support adaptive management and the conservation of coastal ecosystems.

Extremerainfall can cause extensive flooding of surfacewaters and, eventually, of groundwaters. However, howthe resultant changes in nutrients impact groundwater organisms and the structure of groundwater food webs is largely unknown. 2) We monitored abiotic (nutrients, temperature and more) and biotic (all organismal groups except viruses) conditions in eight groundwater boreholes in two locations in a chalk aquifer over the course of 25 weeks (ten sampling occasions), following an extreme rainfall-and groundwater-flooding event in the UK. 3) Weshowthat groundwater flooding can cause substantial nutrient fertilisation of aquifers - nutrient concentrations (especially dissolved organic carbon) in the groundwater were highest when we started the sampling campaign, directly following the flood event, and then decreased over time while groundwater levels also declined back to their baseline. 4) Bacteria in the open water (i.e. bacteria not associated with sediment) became more abundant as the water table and DOC concentrations decreased. Importantly their functional richness tracked the DOC patterns, illustrating that bacteria were responsible for respiring DOC. Microbial metabolic activity and bacterial respiration, measured using smart tracers, supported this finding; DOC and microbial respiration showed a positive correlation. 5) The other biota (protists, micro- and macro-metazoans) showed different abundance patterns over time, but importantly, the entire sediment community, ranging frombacteria to macrofaunal species, showed a strong community size structure (mean size spectra slope: -1.12). Size spectra changed gradually through time towards steeper slopes, except in the very deep aquifer. 6) Our approach allowed us to demonstrate that groundwater communities track extreme changes in their usually stable environment, highlighting that they potentially buffer environmental change, although we still do not know what the limits of this 'service' might be.

A studywas carried out to compare the capability of four models to estimate seasonal cumulative N2O fluxes from 419 field measurements representing 65 studies across China's croplands. The models were 1) the DAYCENT model, 2) the DNDC model, 3) the linear regression model (YLRM) of Yue et al. (2018), and 4) IPCC Tier 1 emission factors. The DAYCENT and DNDC models estimated crop yields with R-2 values of 0.60 and 0.66 respectively, but both models showed significant underestimation for all measurements. The estimated seasonal N2O emissions with R-2 of 0.31, 0.30, 0.21 and 0.17 for DAYCENT, DNDC, YLRM, and IPCC, respectively. Based on RMSE, modelling efficiency and bias analysis, YLRM performed well on N2O emission prediction under no fertilization though bias still existed, while IPCC performed well for cotton and rapeseed and DNDC for soybean. The DAYCENT model accurately predicted the emissions with no bias across other crop and fertilization types whereas the DNDC model underestimated seasonal N2O emissions by 0.42 kg N2O N ha(-1) for all observed values. Model evaluation indicated that the DAYCENT and DNDC models simulated temporal patterns of daily N2O emissions effectively, but both models had difficulty in simulating the timing of the N2O fluxes following some events such as fertilization and water regime. According to this evaluation, algorithms for crop production and N2O emission should be improved to increase the accuracy in the prediction of unfertilized fields both for DAYCENT and DNDC. The effects of crop types and management modes such as fertilizations should also be further refined for YLRM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this linkage framework >22,000 activity-pressure-ecosystem component interactions were found across seven European case studies. We identified the environmental impact risk posed by each impact chain by first categorically weighting the interactions according to five criteria: spatial extent, dispersal potential, frequency of interaction, persistence of pressure and severity of the interaction, where extent, dispersal, frequency and persistence account for the exposure to risk (spatial and temporal), and the severity accounts for the consequence of the risk. After assigning a numerical score to each risk criterion, we came up with an overall environmental impact risk score for each impact chain. This risk score was analysed in terms of (1) the activities and pressures that introduce the greatest risk to European aquatic domains, and (2) the aquatic ecosystem components and realms that are at greatest risk from human activities. Activities related to energy production were relevant across the aquatic domains. Fishing was highly relevant in marine and environmental engineering in fresh waters. Chemical and physical pressures introduced the greatest risk to the aquatic realms. Ecosystem components that can be seen as ecotones between different ecosystems had high impact risk. We show how this information can be used in informing management on trade-offs in freshwater, coastal and marine resource use and aid decision-making. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A case study on the Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean: Andalusia (Spain) - Morocco	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem condition; Spatial prioritization; Multi-zoning; Marxan with Zones	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FRESH-WATER; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; PRIORITIZATION; ENHANCE; AREAS; NETWORK	Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a network designed and planned to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and to protect biodiversity. Existing GBI designs lacked a systematic method to allocate restoration zones. This study proposes a novel approach for systematically selecting cost-effective areas for restoration on the basis of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and ecosystem condition to give an optimal spatial design of GBI. The approach was tested at a regional scale, in a transboundary setting encompassing the Intercontinental Biosphere Reserve of the Mediterranean in Andalusia (Spain) - Morocco (IBRM), across three aquatic ecosystems: freshwater, coastal and marine. We applied Marxan with Zones to stakeholder-defined scenarios of GBI in the IBRM. Specifically, we aimed to identify management zones within the GBl that addressed different conservation, restoration and exploitation objectives. Although almost all conservation targets were achieved, our results highlighted that the proportion of conservation features (i.e., biodiversity, ecosystem services) that would be compromised in the GBl, and the proportion of provisioning services that would be lost due to conservation (i.e., incidental representation) are potentially large, indicating that the probability of conflicts between conservation and exploitation goals in the area is high. The implementation of restoration zones improved connectivity across the GBI, and also achieved European and global policy targets. Our approach may help guide future applications of GBI to implement the flexible conservation management that aquatic environments require, considering many areas at different spatial scales, across multiple ecosystems, and in transboundary contexts.

In the present work, we tested whether populations of H. didymator were divided in several genetically distinct taxa as described for many other generalist parasitoid species, and whether differences in H. didymator parasitism rates were explained by the insect host species and/or by the plant on which these hosts were feeding on. The genetic analysis of natural populations collected in different regions in France and Spain on seven different insect hosts and seven different host plants (775 individuals) showed that H. didymator populations belong to a unique single taxon. However, H. didymator seems to be somewhat specialized. Indeed, in the fields it more often parasitized Helicoverpa armigera compared to the other host species collected in the present work. Also, H. didymator parasitism rates in field conditions and semi-field experimental studies were dependent on the host plants on which H. armigera larvae are feeding. Still, H. didymator can occur occasionally on non-preferred noctuid species. One hypothesis explaining the ability of H. didymator to switch hosts in natura could be related to fluctuating densities of the preferred host over the year; this strategy would allow the parasitoid to avoid seasonal population collapses.

Characteristics of Positive Deviants in Western Chimpanzee Populations	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						behavioral change; conservation planning; hunting; mimicking; positive deviance; West Africa; Pan troglodytes verus	BRIGHT SPOTS; FOREST COVER; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; NIGERIA	With continued expansion of anthropogenically modified landscapes, the proximity between humans and wildlife is continuing to increase, frequently resulting in species decline. Occasionally however, species are able to persist and there is an increased interest in understanding such positive outliers and underlying mechanisms. Eventually, such insights can inform the design of effective conservation interventions by mimicking aspects of the social-ecological conditions found in areas of species persistence. Recently, frameworks have been developed to study the heterogeneity of species persistence across populations with a focus on positive outliers. Applications are still rare, and to our knowledge this is one of the first studies using this approach for terrestrial species conservation. We applied the positive deviance concept to the western chimpanzee, which occurs in a variety of social-ecological landscapes. It is now categorized as Critically Endangered due to hunting and habitat loss and resulting excessive decline of most of its populations. Here we are interested in understanding why some of the populations did not decline. We compiled a dataset of 17,109 chimpanzee survey transects (10,929 km) across nine countries and linked them to a range of social and ecological variables. We found that chimpanzees seemed to persist within three social-ecological configurations: first, rainforest habitats with a low degree of human impact, second, steep areas, and third, areas with high prevalence of hunting taboos and low degree of human impact. The largest chimpanzee populations are nowadays found under the third social-ecological configuration, even though most of these areas are not officially protected. Most commonly chimpanzee conservation has been based on exclusion of threats by creation of protected areas and law enforcement. Our findings suggest, however, that this approach should be complemented by an additional focus on threat reduction, i.e., interventions that directly target individual human behavior that is most threatening to chimpanzees, which is hunting. Although changing human behavior is difficult, stakeholder co-designed behavioral change approaches developed in the social sciences have been used successfully to promote pro-environmental behavior. With only a fraction of chimpanzees and primates living inside protected areas, such new approaches might be a way forward to improve primate conservation.

When these nutrients reach coastal waters, they could drive the eutrophication process. Here we present the Land Uses Simplified Index (LUSI), an easy-to-use tool for assessing continental pressures on coastal waters. This assessment is done by indirectly estimating continental nutrient loads and concentrations, and their influence on coastal waters. LUSI is based on systematic information describing both the land uses that influence coastal waters by providing nutrient-rich freshwater inflows (urban, industrial, agricultural, and riverine) and the coastline morphology, which can modify this influence, as it determines the degree of coastal water confinement and therefore the likelihood that these inflows will be diluted. A low LUSI value indicates that coastal waters are not or only slightly influenced by continental pressures and/or that these pressures are diluted. On the contrary, a high LUSI value indicates that coastal waters are strongly influenced by continental pressures and/or that these pressures are not diluted. LUSI fulfills a methodological gap, as a simple method to assess coastal pressures when there is a lack of information. Furthermore, it fulfills the requirement of the Water Framework Directive for a true pressure assessment (i.e., not confounded with impact), which for coastal waters imply using pressure data from land. An additional and important feature of LUSI is that it allows the establishment of pressure-impact relationships with impact indicators, such as those related to the Biological Quality Elements of the above Directive. For example, a relationship based on LUSI, as a proxy of pressure, and on the chlorophyll-a concentration, as a proxy of phytoplanktonic biomass and, thus, of the eutrophication impact. By providing insights into the land uses that trigger eutrophication in coastal waters, LUSI aids in the design of measures aimed at remediating anthropogenic damage caused to the environment.

Transfer of PCBs from Microplastics under Simulated Gut Fluid Conditions Is Biphasic and Reversible	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS; PLASTIC RESIN PELLETS; ENHANCED DESORPTION; NEPHROPS-NORVEGICUS; MYTILUS-EDULIS; MARINE DEBRIS; CHEMICALS; TRANSPORT	The role of plastic as a vector for bioaccumulation of toxic chemicals is central to the risk assessment of microplastic for human health and the environment. However, transfer kinetics of sorbed contaminants from ingested microplastics are poorly understood. We develop and parametrize a chemical exchange model on microplastics in a gut fluid mimic of aquatic biota, and also included food to provide a better representation of contaminant dynamics when plastic and food are ingested, as would occur in nature. The transfer kinetics of 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in gut fluid mimic systems under three environmentally relevant exposure scenarios of plastic ingestion by organisms, for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and were evaluated with the model. Chemical transfer was demonstrated to be biphasic and fully reversible, with fast exchange within hours followed by a slow transfer lasting for weeks to months. In clean gut systems, the bioavailability of plastic-associated PCBs for lugworms and cod ranged from 14 to 42% and 45-83% respectively. However, in contaminated gut systems, clean microplastic was capable of rapidly extracting ("cleaning") PCBs from food inside the gut, thus demonstrating that the effect of microplastic is context dependent. Therefore, chemical contamination and cleaning are likely to occur simultaneously due to the ingestion of microplastic.

Oxygen Half-Saturation Constants for Pharmaceuticals in Activated Sludge and Microbial Community Activity under Varied Oxygen Levels	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; BETA-BLOCKERS; REMOVAL; BIOTRANSFORMATION; BIODIVERSITY; OXIDATION; BACTERIA; FATE	Aeration accounts for the largest energy demand in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment. Emerging aeration control strategies for energy conservation have significantly reduced operational bulk liquid dissolved oxygen (DO) from above 2 mg/L to at or below 0.5 mg/L. As we move toward low DO treatment processes, there is a need to understand how low DO impacts the kinetics of micropollutant biotransformation. The objective of this study was to characterize the impact of DO concentration on pharmaceutical biotransformation rates via two approaches: (1) Determine oxygen half saturation constants that describe the community-wide impact of DO on biotransformation rates. (2) Evaluate shifts in the microbial community 16S rRNA pool due to DO concentration. Batch experiments were performed at several DO concentrations using biomass from a full-scale wastewater treatment plant. Results reveal that substantial reductions in bulk liquid DO concentrations to 0.5 mg-O-2/L are possible without compromising pharmaceutical biotransformation rates. Sequencing of cDNA generated from community rRNA revealed that diverse, low abundance community members may play important roles in pharmaceutical transformation. The results of this work advance our ability to predict and model the impact of DO on pharmaceutical biotransformations during wastewater treatment and identify taxonomic groups associated with those biotransformations.

Sensitivities of an endemic, endangered California smelt and two non-native fishes to serial increases in temperature and salinity: implications for shifting community structure with climate change	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; Delta Smelt; Largemouth Bass; Mississippi Silverside; salinity; temperature	SAN-FRANCISCO ESTUARY; THREATENED DELTA SMELT; LARGEMOUTH BASS; MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES; FINAL MATURATION; PELAGIC FISHES; WATER; TOLERANCE; PATTERNS; STRESS	This study showed that in three quite different fish species from the San Francisco Estuary, stress from elevated temperature or salinity did not reduce their ability to cope with subsequent stressors. Abstract In many aquatic systems, native fishes are in decline and the factors responsible are often elusive. In the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) in California, interactions among native and non-native species are key factors contributing to the decline in abundance of endemic, endangered Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Climate change and drought-related stressors are further exacerbating declines. To assess how multiple environmental changes affect the physiology of native Delta Smelt and non-native Mississippi Silverside (Menidia beryllina) and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides), fishes were exposed to serial exposures of a single stressor (elevated temperature or salinity) followed by two stressors (elevated temperature and salinity) to determine how a single stressor affects the capacity to cope with the addition of a second stressor. Critical thermal maximum (CTMax; a measure of upper temperature tolerance) was determined after 0, 2, 4 and 7 days following single and multiple stressors of elevated temperature (16 degrees C vs. 20 degrees C) and salinity (2.4 vs. 8-12 ppt, depending on species). Under control conditions, non-native fishes had significantly higher CTMax than the native Delta Smelt. An initial temperature or salinity stressor did not negatively affect the ability of any species to tolerate a subsequent multiple stressor. While elevated salinity had little effect on CTMax, a 4 degrees C increase in temperature increased CTMax. Bass experienced an additive effect of increased temperature and salinity on CTMax, such that CTMax further increased under multiple stressors. In addition, Bass demonstrated physiological sensitivity to multiple stressors demonstrated by changes in hematocrit and plasma osmolality, whereas the physiology of Silversides remained unaffected. Non-native Bass and Mississippi Silversides showed consistently higher thermal tolerance limits than the native Delta Smelt, supporting their abundance in warmer SFE habitats. Continued increases in SFE water temperatures predicted with climate change may further impact endangered Delta Smelt populations directly if habitat temperatures exceed thermal limits.

Rapid adaptation to cold in the invasive cane toad Rhinella marina	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cane toad; cold-tolerance; invasive species; phenotypic plasticity; rapid evolution; Rhinella marina	PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; NATURAL EXPERIMENT; EVOLUTION; TOLERANCE; FROG; INTRODUCTIONS; ACCLIMATION; RESPONSES; TADPOLES; COSTS	Invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in northern Florida experience the coldest temperatures anywhere in their native or invasive range. We test the thermal limits of toads from northern and southern Florida and find that northern toads are more tolerant of cold and have rapidly adapted to this novel environment. Abstract Understanding rapid adaptation to novel environments is essential as we face increasing climatic change. Invasive species are an ideal system for studying adaptation as they are typically introduced to novel environments where they must adapt if they are to persist. We used the invasive cane toad, Rhinella marina, to investigate the contribution of plasticity and evolution to rapid adaptation in a novel environment. Rhinella marina is a neotropical toad that has invaded areas with climates outside of its native environmental niche. The goal of this research was to understand how cane toads persist in northern Florida, the coldest region of their combined natural and invasive range, and originally thought to be beyond their thermal breadth. We measured Critical thermal minima in cane toads from the original, warm introduction location (Miami), and their northern range edge (Tampa) to determine whether northern toads were more cold-tolerant, and to examine the contribution of adaptive plasticity and evolution to any changes in tolerance. Our results show that following acclimation to cold temperatures, southern toads are less tolerant of cold than northern toads. This persistent population difference implies selection for cold-tolerance in northern populations. Differences in individual responses indicate that plasticity is also involved in this response. Our findings have implications for conservation because predatory cane toad invasions threaten local faunas, especially native amphibians. Characterizing specific adaptive mechanisms that allow R. marina to expand its range will identify evolutionary processes that shape a highly successful invasive species.

Combined effects of warming and hypoxia on early life stage Chinook salmon physiology and development	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Chinook salmon; climate change; developmental physiology; hypoxia; temperature	ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS EMBRYOS; CRITICAL THERMAL MAXIMUM; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; ATLANTIC SALMON; SWIMMING PERFORMANCE; COMMON KILLIFISH; GENE-EXPRESSION; REDUCED OXYGEN; PACIFIC SALMON; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Early life stages of salmonids are particularly vulnerable to warming and hypoxia, which are common stressors in hyporheic, gravel bed, rearing habitat (i.e. a redd'). With the progression of global climate change, high temperatures and hypoxia may co-occur more frequently within redds, particularly for salmonid species at their southern range limit. Warming and hypoxia have competing effects on energy supply and demand, which can be detrimental to energy-limited early life stages. We examined how elevated temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined stressors affected the survival, physiological performance, growth, and development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We reared late fall-run Chinook salmon from fertilization to the fry stage in a fully factorial design of two temperatures [10 degrees C (ambient) and 14 degrees C (warm)] and two oxygen levels [normoxia (100% air saturation, 10 mg O-2/l) and hypoxia (50% saturation, 5.5 mg O-2/l)]. Rearing in hypoxia significantly reduced hatching success, especially in combination with warming. Both warming and hypoxia improved acute thermal tolerance. While rearing in hypoxia improved tolerance to acute hypoxia stress, warming reduced hypoxia tolerance. Hypoxia-reared fish were smaller at hatch, but were able to reach similar sizes to the normoxia-reared fish by the fry stage. High temperature and normoxia resulted in the fastest rate of development while low temperature and hypoxia resulted in the slowest rate of development. Despite improved physiological tolerance to acute heat and hypoxia stress, hypoxia-reared embryos had reduced survival and growth, which could have larger population-level effects. These results suggest that both warming and hypoxia are important factors to address in conservation strategies for Chinook salmon.

The interplay between propagule pressure, seed predation and ectomycorrhizal fungi in plant invasion	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						Biotic resistance; granivory; invasion mechanism; mutualism; Pins; seed dispersal	BIOTIC RESISTANCE; HOST PLANTS; HYPOTHESES; SPREAD; GRANIVORY; ECOLOGY	There are many hypotheses aiming to explain invasion success, but evaluating individual hypotheses in isolation may hinder our ability to understand why some species invade and others fail. Here we evaluate the interaction between propagule pressure, seed predation and missed mutualism in the invasion success of the pine, Pinus ponderosa. We evaluated the independent and interactive effects of propagule pressure and seed predation at increasing distances from a pine plantation. Additionally, because pines arc obligate mutualists with ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) and pine invasions fail in the absence of their EMF symbionts, we evaluated EMF availability through a growth chamber bioassay. In this bioassay we measured root colonization by EMF with soil samples collected from the different distances from the plantation. We found that propagule pressure overwhelms seed predation only at the edge of the pine plantation, while seed predation overcomes propagule pressure at 25 m and further distances from the plantation. We also found that EMF root colonization decreases with distance from the plantation. However, pine roots were colonized up to 200 m from the plantation, suggesting that EMF may not be hindering invasion, at least not on the scale of this experiment. Taken together our results demonstrate that seed predation may be limiting the invasion of P. ponderosa in the study region as propagule pressure only overcomes seed predation at the plantation edge. Here we provide evidence of how strong biotic resistance can suppress an invasion, regardless of the variation in propagule pressure and the availability of mutualists.

A field study was conducted to investigate whether pest and natural enemy abundance was higher in organic compared with conventional strawberry fields, and whether the non-managed vegetation surrounding the field impacted natural enemy abundance and diversity in and around the field sites. The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), and predatory mites were sampled from strawberry leaflets and the leaves of wild herbaceous plants from the surrounding vegetation. Insect predators, hymenopteran parasitoids, spiders and herbivores were collected from the same habitats. Abundance of T. urticae was ten-fold higher in conventional compared to organic strawberry fields, whereas the ratio of spider mite to predatory mites was 9.5 times lower in organic compared with conventional strawberry fields. The 14 species of predatory mites identified were all from the family Phytoseiidae, and predominantly found on stinging nettle, Urtica dioica L. (Rosales: Urticaceae) (> 80% of individuals), in the surrounding vegetation. There was no significant effect of cropping practice on the density of insect predators and spiders, while the density of insect parasitoids and insect herbivores was higher in the organic compared to the conventional sites. Total species richness at the edge of organic fields and in the surrounding vegetation of both organic and conventional sites was higher than in the other sampling sites. This study demonstrates the major impact of cropping practice on T. urticae abundance and on the prey to predator ratio, whilst also emphasizing the importance of the surrounding vegetation as a source of natural enemies of phytophagous arthropods.

Reduced nitrate leaching in a perennial grain crop compared to maize in the Upper Midwest, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nitrate leaching; Perennial grains; Lysimeter; DNDC model; Intermediate wheatgrass; Switchgrass; Maize; Intercropping	PRAIRIE FILTER STRIPS; INTERMEDIATE WHEATGRASS; NITROGEN; BIOENERGY; GROUNDWATER; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; MODEL; WATER; CORN	Global expansion of high-input annual grain crops and associated nitrogen (N) fertilizer use can have negative consequences for the environment and human health. Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching from fertilized annual crops can contaminate groundwater and pollute natural aquatic ecosystems and rural drinking water sources. Intermediate wheatgrass (IWG; Thinopyrum intermedium) is a perennial grass being domesticated to serve as the world's first widely available perennial grain crop. Our objective was to measure water quality variables and crop yields in order to model NO3-N leaching beneath IWG, maize, and switchgrass under three N fertilizer treatments; low N (0 kg N ha(-1)), medium N (maize = 80, switchgrass and IWG = 40 kg N ha(-1)), and high N (maize = 160, switchgrass and IWG = 120 or 160 kg N ha(-1)). The switchgrass and IWG medium N treatments also included alfalfa as an intercrop. The NO3-N concentration in soil solution 50 cm below the surface was one and two orders of magnitude lower in high N fertilized IWG compared to switchgrass and maize, respectively. Soil solution NO3-N increased with N fertilizer in all crops. Soil water content was less at 50 and 100 cm depths in IWG compared to switchgrass and maize but was unaffected by N fertilizer treatment. Using the Denitrification and Decomposition (DNDC) model, average annual NO3-N leaching estimates in the high N treatments were 21.7 kg N ha(-1) for maize and 3.7 and 0.2 kg N ha(-1) for switchgrass and IWG, respectively. Despite consistent biomass yields through time, IWG grain yields decreased with stand age at all N fertilizer treatments. Alfalfa did not persist in the IWG and switchgrass medium N treatments, thus other legumes should be tested for intercropping with perennial grain crops. Intermediate wheatgrass has great potential to provide food-quality grain and biomass while preventing NO3-N leaching.

Local and landscape-scale heterogeneity shape spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) activity and natural enemy abundance: Implications for trophic interactions	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Field margin; Habitat management; Landscape configuration; Landscape heterogeneity; Metabarcoding; Molecular gut content analysis; MGCA; Predator-Prey interactions; Vegetation management	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; SPECIAL-ISSUE; PEST-CONTROL; CROP PEST; DIVERSITY; EDGE; AGROECOSYSTEMS; IMPLEMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY	Like natural enemies, invasive polyphagous pests may respond positively to local and landscape-scale diversity, making them more serious challenges to sustainable management than specialists. Yet the current view of landscape effects on pests rarely considers perennial systems or polyphagous pests. We investigated Drosophila suzukii (SWD) and natural enemy distributions and trophic interactions in blueberry systems of the southeast US in relation to local management and landscape structure. Fields were nested in 1-km landscapes along gradients of crop and forest heterogeneity (landscape compositional diversity) and field border and crop border lengths (landscape configurational diversity). Yeast-sugar bait traps were used to collect SWD and canopy suction sampling for natural enemies. Management practices at the local scale did not influence SWD abundance, but natural enemy abundance was higher in organic systems and fields with vegetation present between rows. Landscape configurational diversity and greater proportion of non-cropping habitat promoted higher SWD populations. Natural enemy communities were composed of highly generalized species, and contrary to our predictions, we observed lower abundances in landscapes with higher proportion of non-cropping area. Few predators were detected to have fed on SWD, and communities were dominated by predators with low specialization on prey in blueberry. Our results indicate that local and landscape features in blueberry landscapes have differential effects on a polyphagous pest and generalist natural enemies.

Crop protection against common voles is a complex task that requires the consideration of a set of preventive and control measures within an integrated pest management strategy. A possible option could be to modify farming practices to reduce the availability of refuges for rodents and the damage to crops that they subsequently cause. Farming, however, must simultaneously meet multiple goals including the reduction of the carbon (C) emissions, soil erosion and water use, and the improvement of soil quality. Crop establishment through conservation agriculture strategies, like zero-tillage, would reduce crop management investment, but is also promoted in many regions to reduce C emissions and increase soil organic matter. It could, however, create favourable refuge habitats for fossorial rodent crop pests, like common voles, benefitting from reduced soil disturbance between crop rotations and thus increasing burrow persistence. Assessing the impact that tillage practices, their interaction with different crops and the influence of proximity to potential common vole sources, have on common vole occupancy could provide a valuable tool within an integrated management strategy. Using a 2-ha experimental field with 62 plots 180 m(2) (each roughly matching common vole home range size) located experimental plots in north-western Spain, we tested how tillage practices, crop type (wheat, barley, vetch, Narbonne vetch, pea and fallow) and distances from possible colonization sources affect field use by common vole during low population density conditions. Our results show that tillage practices have more influence on common vole occurrence (zero tillage > reduced and conventional tillage) than other aspects such as crop type thus supporting the hypothesis that tillage practices play a key role in common vole habitat use.

Heterogeneous landscapes provide a wider range of resources and often sustain higher levels of biodiversity than homogeneous ones. Across the globe, agricultural expansion has resulted in large-scale homogenisation of landscapes with associated declines in many taxa. However, during the early stages of agricultural development, in terms of area and intensity, increased landscape heterogeneity and changes in local productivity through fertilizer inputs can potentially increase resource availability for some species. Agriculture in Iceland is currently neither highly intensive nor extensive, and primarily occurs as hayfields (> 90% of agricultural land) embedded within a mosaic of semi-natural wetlands and heaths. These landscapes support internationally important breeding populations of several wader species but the role of agricultural land in promoting or constraining breeding wader densities is currently unknown, Understanding the relationship between cultivation and wader populations is important as the area of cultivated land is predicted to expand in Iceland in near future, largely through conversion of the remaining semi-natural wetlands. Here we (a) quantify relationships between breeding wader densities in lowland Iceland and the amount of cultivated land and wetland in the surrounding landscape using density estimates from 200 transects in common semi-natural habitats, (b) assess the extent to which cultivated land affects wader densities in these landscapes, and the potential effects of future agricultural expansion at the expense of wetlands on wader populations. Wader densities in semi-natural habitats were consistently greater when surrounding landscapes had more wetland at scales ranging from 500 m to 2500 m, indicating the importance of wetland availability. However, the effects of cultivated land in the surrounding landscape varied with altitude (ranging from 0 to 200 m); in lowlying coastal areas, wader numbers decline with increasing amounts of cultivated land (and the lowest densities (< 1 km(2)) occur in areas dominated with cultivated land), the inverse occurs at higher altitudes (> 100 m a.s.l., where lowest densities occur in areas without cultivated land). This suggests that additional resources provided by cultivated land may be more important in the less fertile uplands. Further agricultural conversion of wetlands in low-lying areas of Iceland is likely to be detrimental for breeding waders, but such effects may be less apparent at higher altitudes.

Applying manure precisely is a challenge because the nutrient content of manures is inherently variable and the accuracy of sampling protocols are unknown. This study aimed to quantify the accuracy of sampling protocols for static solid manure piles considering both the number and depth of grab samples entering a composite sample. Over 35 grab samples were collected from each of ten static piles of dairy manure in California's Central Valley. Grab samples were individually analyzed for dry matter (DM), ash, total nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous concentrations. Resampling simulations quantified the precision and bias of sampling protocols varying in both grab sample number and depth. Results showed that number of grab samples required for measurements to meet an accuracy standard of +/- 10% of the true value varied significantly by pile makeup. Over 25 grab samples were often required for multi source manure piles, where an average of six grab samples were required from single source piles. The DM concentration of manure piles decreased at depths greater than 0.4 m, and sampling simulations showed that measurements were biased unless 70-80% of grab samples were collected from the pile interior. Both the number and location of grab samples necessary to create a representative composite require resource investments by farmers, and should be considered to manage nutrient applications cropland.

Improving understanding of carbon storage in wood in landfills: Evidence from reactor studies	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Wood; Carbon; Landfill; Methane; Decay; Bacteria	ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; LONG-TERM; DECOMPOSITION; PRODUCTS; DECAY; BIODEGRADATION; OXIDATION; HARDWOOD	Approximately 1.5 million tonnes (Mt) of wood waste are disposed of in Australian landfills annually. Recent studies have suggested that anaerobic decay levels of wood in landfills are low, although knowledge of the decay of individual wood species is limited. The objective of this study was to establish the extent of carbon loss for wood species of commercial importance in Australia including radiata pine, blackbutt, spotted gum and mountain ash. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions designed to simulate optimal anaerobic biodegradation in a landfill. Bacterial degradation, identified by both light microscopy and electron microscopy, occurred to a varying degree in mountain ash and spotted gum wood. Fungal decay was not observed in any wood samples. Mountain ash, the species with the highest methane yield (20.9 mL CH4/g) also had the highest holocellulose content and the lowest acid-insoluble lignin and extractive content. As the decay levels for untreated radiata pine were very low, it was not possible to determine whether impregnation of radiata pine with chemical preservatives had any impact on decay. Carbon losses estimated from gas generation were below 5% for all species tested. Carbon losses as estimated by gas generation were lower than those derived by mass balance in most reactors, suggesting that mass loss does not necessarily equate to carbon emissions. There was no statistical difference between decay of blackbutt derived from plantation and older, natural forests. Addition of paper as an easily digestible feedstock did not increase carbon loss for the two wood species tested and the presence of radiata pine had an inhibitory effect on copy paper decay. Although differences between some of the wood types were found to be statistically significant, these differences were detected for wood with carbon losses that did not exceed 5%. The suggested factor for carbon loss for wood in landfills in Australia is 1.4%. This study confirms that disposal of wood in landfills in Australia results in long-term storage of carbon, with only minimal conversion of carbon to gaseous end products. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The size of protected riparian areas and their conservation has become a controversial topic after changes implemented in the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC): a set of laws that regulates the size of Permanent Protection Areas (PPA). Here, we investigate the influence of distance from water bodies on bat-species and guild composition in a lowland Amazonian rainforest. Our hypotheses were that bat assemblages would change depending on the distance to the water body and that the abundance of herbivorous bats (frugivorous and nectarivorous) would be greater in areas close to water. Bats were captured with mist-nets in 24 riparian and 25 non-riparian plots within a trail grid in an old-growth terra-firme forest, northeast of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Each plot was sampled three times in a total of 7056 net-hours. We captured 1191 bats, comprising 51 species. We used model selection based on AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to compare linear and piecewise regressions to estimate the ecological thresholds for different bat assemblages. Piecewise models with one breakpoint were more parsimonious than linear models for abundance data, and the species and guild composition of animalivorous and frugivorous bats. Animalivorous-bat abundance increased from the stream to about 181 m, and frugivorous-bat abundance decreased within 50 m of the stream. The patterns of guild abundance suggest that frugivorous bats may need greater access to streams than animalivorous bats. The most conservative model suggests that most of the variation in bat composition occurs close to the stream and extends to up 114 m from the banks. Therefore, the 30 m wide strip of riparian forest protected by Brazilian law would maintain a relatively small fraction of bat-species assemblages in Ducke Reserve, and is insufficient to represent most of the assemblage-composition variation within the riparian zone. The suggestion to reduce the width of the protected riparian zone from 30 to 15 m for streams smaller than 10 m wide, as is under discussion, would likely be prejudicial for bat assemblages.

Phytoremediation, consisting in covering the soil with specific plants with the possible addition of amendments, represents an interesting way of enhancing the quality of mine soils by retaining contaminants and reducing soil erosion. In order to study the effect of an assisted phytoremediation (with willow and ryegrass) on the properties of soil pore water (SPW), we investigated the impact of amendment with biochar (BC) combined with the planting of willow and ryegrass on the behavior of several metal(loid)s (Pb, Zn, Ba, As, and Cd) in a mine soil. Data on the physicochemical parameters and concentrations of the different metal(loid)s in both SPW and in plant tissues of willow and ryegrass highlight the importance of BC for SPW properties in terms of reductions in soluble concentrations of Pb and Zn, although there was no effect on the behavior of As and Cd. BC also increased soluble concentrations of Ba, probably related to ion release by the BC. By improving major ions available in mine soil, BC improved the lifetime of plants and enhanced their growth. Plant development did not appear to significantly affect the physicochemical parameters of SPW. Willow and ryegrass growing on soil with BC incorporated Cd and Ba into their tissues. The influence of plants on the behavior of metal(loid)s was noticeable only for ryegrass growing in soil with 2% BC, where it modified the behavior of Pb and Ba.

Pathways of change: Predicting the effects of fire on flammability	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Flammability; Prescribed burning; Wildfire; Succession; Fire management; Forest; Heathland; woodland	DRY EUCALYPT FOREST; WILDFIRE SEVERITY; SEED-GERMINATION; FUEL TREATMENT; LEAF TRAITS; SMOKE; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; LITTER; HEAT	Impacts of wildfire on humans are increasing as urban populations continue to expand into fire prone landscapes. Effective fire risk management can only be achieved if we understand and quantify how ecosystems change in response to fire and how these changes affect flammability. However, there have been limited studies to this effect with the dominant paradigm being the assumption that recently burnt vegetation is less flammable than older vegetation. To better quantify changes in flammability, we first need to quantify trajectories of changes in response to fire within individual vegetation communities. Second, we need to examine the extent to which these changes alter flammability. Here, we quantify the flammability pathways with increasing time since fire for five vegetation communities in south-eastern Australia. A total of 116 sites were measured across a range of heathland, woodland and forest ecosystems. Flammability was measured using an ecological point based mechanistic fire behaviour model that estimates three measures of flammability relevant to both fire management and research. Predicted changes in flammability varied between vegetation types with heathland and wet forests generally increasing in flammability with time since fire and tall mixed, foothills and forby forests decreasing or showing limited changes with time since fire. Variations in flammability pathways suggest fire management activities that alter fuel structure, such as prescribed burning, may only reduce flammability in a limited set of ecosystems. Incorporating these results into a landscape analysis will improve the quantification of fire risk.

Plant selection is crucial to retention performance, as it is influenced by how well plants dry out substrates between rainfall events. While the role of plants in evapotranspiration (ET) on green roofs is well-studied, their potential influence on retention via their impacts on water movement through substrates is poorly understood. We used a simulated rainfall experiment with plant species with different water use strategies to determine the key drivers of green roof retention performance. Overall per-event retention was very high (89-95%) and similar for all plant species and unplanted modules for small events. However, for larger events, some species showed lower retention than unplanted modules or low-water using succulent species. Despite the fact that these species were more effective at replenishing storage between rainfall events due to their higher ET, they reduced the maximum storage capacity of the substrate, likely due to their root systems creating preferential flow paths. This finding has important implications for green roofs, as although ET represents the primary means by which the storage capacity of green roofs can be regenerated, if species with high ET also reduce the maximum storage capacity, effective retention performance is reduced. Therefore, we suggest that species selection must first focus on how plants affect storage capacity in the first instance and consider water use strategies as a secondary objective.

Biochar fails to enhance nutrient removal in woodchip bioreactor columns following saturation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Denitrifying bioreactor; Biochar; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Column experiment	HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME; NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; DENITRIFYING BIOREACTORS; NITRATE REMOVAL; DENITRIFICATION BIOREACTORS; PHOSPHORUS SORPTION; CARBON; WATER; PERFORMANCE; MITIGATION	Denitrifying bioreactors are edge-of-field structures that remove excess nitrogen (N) from intercepted agricultural drainage by supporting the activity of denitrifying microorganisms with a saturated organic carbon substrate. Although these bioreactors successfully mitigate N export, the typical woodchip systems have little effect on phosphorus (P), which is also often present in environmentally harmful quantities in drainage waters. Currently, the evidence that amending woodchip bioreactors with biochar enhances both N and P removal rates is mixed, but more work is required to test this hypothesis under controlled conditions. To determine the effect of biochar amendment on nitrate (NO3-N) and phosphate (PO4-P) removal in woodchip bioreactors, three media types-aged woodchips (W), 10% (B-10) and 30% (B-30) biochar by volume-were tested under different operational conditions during five-day laboratory trials with horizontal, flow-through columns. Nutrient removal was observed under different flow rates yielding hydraulic residence times of 3, 6, and 12 hours with four formulations of simulated agricultural drainage, all combination of 16.1 or 4.5 mg L-1 NO3-N and 1.9 or 0.6 mg L-1 PO4-P. Each unique treatment with respect to media type, HRT, and influent formulation was tested in triplicate using independent columns. All treatments successfully removed NO3-N, but PO4-P removal was inconsistent. Cumulative NO3-N removal efficiencies ranged 15-98% with an average removal rate of 11.0 g m(-3) d(-1); biochar amendment enhanced removal only in response to sufficiently high loading rates. Cumulative PO4-P removal efficiencies ranged from 66% removal to 170% export of the influent load; biochar addition was associated with increased export. These results indicate that pine-feedstock biochar poses a substantial increase to PO4-P leaching risk and only modestly enhances NO3-N removal given sufficiently high loading.	[Coleman, Brady S.

Terrain mobility estimation using TWI and airborne gamma-ray data	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Forest trafficability; Rut depth; Can bus data; Gamma-ray radiation; Topographic wetness index	FOREST; MODEL; IMPACT; SOILS	Since one purpose of forestry laws and certification standards is to guide loggers to minimize the damage caused by forest operations, information regarding internal variations in site trafficability is needed for both economic and ecological reasons. The aim of this work was to test the prediction of terrain mobility from open data sources in Finland. New Lidar-based data sources were available for calculating terrain features and a gamma-ray-based soil wetness parameter. Rut depths were measured and can bus data were collected from a forwarder in two logging areas. Net power at the forwarder's drive shaft, total resistance and rolling resistance were calculated from the can bus data and augmented by means of a digital elevation model (DEM), soil data, aerogeophysical gamma-ray radiation data and a topographic wetness index (TWI). The rut depth was explained best either by TWI calculated from a 2 m grid DEM or the combination of a 16 m grid TWI, gamma radiation from thorium and engine net power (r(2) = 0.20-0.33). In the areas concerned here the gamma-ray results may have detected the soil type more precisely than the soil type class, and the gamma radiation from thorium may also have detected wet places inside the site type, labelled as sandy till, and will therefore have explained the variation in rut depth.

A choice experiment was carried out to elicit preferences of the tourists for alternative options of natural resource management in a case study in Italy and data were collected by means of personal interviews. Indicators to assess the planned behaviour of respondents were collected by means of Likert scales that were then included in the choice model. Differently from previous research on planned behaviour we use an extended version of the theory that includes moral norms and explicitly account for endogeneity of the indicators with a hybrid mixed logit model, in which a latent variable is used to explain both answers to the indicators and management choices. Results suggest a general preference of respondents for local governance and indicate that the latent variable has a significant effect on explaining preference heterogeneity and improve model fit. In addition, results suggest that the theory of planned behaviour is appropriate to model individuals' behavioural intention and can be used to tailor marketing activities aiming at increasing people's pro-environmental behaviours.

Unravelling associations between tree-seedling performance, herbivory, competition, and facilitation in high nature value farmlands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Plant-animal interactions; Tree mortality; Mediterranean ecosystem; Leaf herbivores; Plant fitness; Path analysis	CARBON-NUTRIENT BALANCE; INSECT HERBIVORY; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; PLANT-GROWTH; QUERCUS-ILEX; RAIN-FOREST; OAK; RECRUITMENT; SHRUBS; HYPOTHESIS	Herbivory, plant facilitation, and competition have complex impacts on tree regeneration which are seldom investigated together. Grazing exclosure experiments have allowed quantification of the effects of large herbivores on tree regeneration dynamics but have often ignored the effect of herbivorous insects. We experimentally tested how folivory (percentage of leaf damaged by insects) and microenvironment (tree canopy cover and herbs) jointly alter performance (growth and survival) of seedlings of two dominant Mediterranean oak-species within ungulate exclosures in a 3-year field study. An agroforestry system dominated by cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Q. rotungolia) was assessed in south-east Portugal. We aimed also to determine whether the two oak species differed in the interdependences between folivory, microenvironment, covaring factors, and seedling performance. Unexpectedly, under the low-moderate insect defoliation, growth and survival of cork and holm oak seedlings were positively associated with herbivore damage. Herb removal increased oak folivory by 1.4 times. Herb removal was also positively associated with growth, directly and indirectly through its negative effect on oak folivory. Tree canopy favored insect folivory upon cork oak seedlings directly and upon holm oak indirectly via decreasing light availability. Folivory was threefold greater upon cork than upon holm oak-seedlings. Our study shows that tree canopy, herbs, and covarying factors can affect cork and holm oak-seedling performances through complex pathways, which markedly differ for the two species. The combined effect of insect herbivory and positive and negative plant-plant interactions need to be integrated into future tree regeneration efforts toward tackling the regeneration crisis of oak agroforestry systems of the Mediterranean.

This paper aims to predict the potential agronomical and ecological effects of these trends and clarify about the versatility of cattle and sheep systems in adapting to climate changes in the Mediterranean basin. We monitored livestock management in the dry grasslands of evora (2012 to 2016) and investigated for the effect of livestock type (TLivest) on (a) sward's characteristics, (b) vegetation taxonomic diversity, and (c) in conforming vegetation communities and promoting species of agronomical interests (SAIs). Generalized linear mixed models were used to link management descriptors and vegetation parameters with TLivest. Redundancy analysis was used to analyse the changes due to TLivest on floristic composition and SAIs. Sheep fields presented (a) higher number of days under grazing and lower instantaneous stocking rates than cattle or mixed fields and (b) lower vegetation height in April in wet years and higher green vegetation cover in May; alpha- and gamma-diversity were poorly related with TLivest, but beta-diversity was lower under mixed grazing than under sheep or cattle grazing. The highest richness of legume species was found in permanent grasslands grazed by sheep. Redundancy analysis provided a good discrimination of TLivest but a poor segregation of vegetation communities. As a conclusion, sheep grazing can be seen as a more powerful tool to increase sward heterogeneity, and thus, a loss of grassland heterogeneity can be expected under cattle grazing. The lower versatility of cattle systems suggests narrower opportunities in adapting to climate change.

In the current study, we sampled terrestrial vegetation in spontaneously revegetated and forestry reclaimed spoil heaps after brown coal mining differing in age in three regions across Central Europe (Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hungary). The main objective was to compare the course of vegetation development and species richness between the two restoration methods over a large geographical scale. In all geographical regions, species richness was higher on spontaneously revegetated sites. Although the starting point differed across regions, trajectories to woodland development converged with time. In addition, spontaneous revegetation was comparably as fast as forestry reclamation in developing towards woodland. Spontaneous revegetation proved to be more valuable and cost-effective in terms of nature conservation and should be considered as an alternative restoration strategy to forestry reclamation in Central Europe.

Agriculture, diversions, and drought shrinking Galilee Sea	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Kinneret; Hydrology; Global change; Anthropocene; Aral Sea syndrome; Agricultural consumptive water use	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; JORDAN RIVER; WATER-RESOURCES; LAKE KINNERET; DEAD-SEA; NORTH-AMERICA; SALINE LAKES; ARAL SEA; LAND-USE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION	In water-limited regions worldwide, climate change and population growth threaten to desiccate lakes. As these lakes disappear, water managers have often implicated climate change-induced decreases in precipitation and higher temperature-driven evaporative demand-factors out of their control, while simultaneously constructing dams and drilling new wells into aquifers to permit agricultural expansion. One such shrinking lake is the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret), whose decadal mean level has reached a record low, which has sparked heated debate regarding the causes of this shrinkage. However, the relative importance of climatic change, agricultural consumption, and increases in Lebanese water consumption, remain unknown. Here we show that the level of the Sea of Galilee would be stable, even in the face of decreasing precipitation in the Golan Heights. Climatic factors alone are inadequate to explain the record shrinkage of the Sea of Galilee. We found no decreasing trends in inflow from the headwaters of the Upper Jordan River located primarily in Lebanon. Rather, the decrease in discharge of the Upper Jordan River corresponded to a period of expanding irrigated agriculture, doubling of groundwater pumping rates within the basin, and increasing of the area of standing and impounded waters. While rising temperatures in the basin are statistically significant and may increase evapotranspiration, these temperature changes are too small to explain the magnitude of observed streamflow decreases.

However, the occurrence of runoff and marine pollution, as well as its ecological effects in South Atlantic coral reefs are still poorly understood. The aim of the present work is to characterize the terrigenous influence and contamination impact on the environmental health of five reefs located along a gradient of distance from a river source, using geochemical, water quality, and ecological indicators. Stable isotopes and sterols were used as geochemical indicators of sewage and terrigenous organic matter. Dissolved metal concentrations (Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) were used as indicators of water quality. Population density, bleaching and chlorophyll a content of the symbiont-bearing foraminifer Amphistegina gibbosa, were used as indicators of ecological effects. Sampling was performed four times during the year to assess temporal variability. Sediment and water quality indicators showed that reefs close to the river discharge experience nutrient enrichment and sewage contamination, and metals concentrations above international environmental quality guidelines. Higher levels of contamination were strongly related to the higher frequency of bleaching and lower density in A. gibbosa populations. The integrated evaluation of stable isotopes, sterols and metals provided a consistent diagnostic about sewage influence on the studied reefs. Additionally, the observed bioindicator responses evidenced relevant ecological effects. The water quality, geochemical and ecological indicators employed in the present study were effective as biomonitoring tools to be applied in reefs worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, our knowledge is limited on how the functional features of stream organisms vary along the gradient of hydrological disturbance (i.e. flow regime changes) and how flow regimes mediate the functional features in lowland streams. We analyzed the functional traits of benthic diatoms (unicellular siliceous algae) that are most sensitive and tolerant to flow regime changes along a nationwide scale of 246 sites in Denmark. We combined RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to explore the co-variation between hydrological variables (R table) and species traits (Q table), constrained by the relative abundance of each species (L table) as observed in each of the sampling sites. Further, we examine the relationships between functional features (i.e., functional redundancy and diversity) and hydrological variables by multivariate statistical analyses. Results show that species turnover with displacement of sensitive species by tolerant species was the dominating process in benthic diatom communities during high flow disturbances. Functional features, as indicated by functional diversity and redundancy indices, were mediated mainly by high and low flow magnitude. Median daily flow magnitude shows a consistent positive relationship with functional redundancy and richness indices indicating that larger streams are more resilient to flow perturbations. In addition flow regime changes are less important than median daily flow magnitude and show inconsistent correlation to functional features likely due to the interaction of multiple environmental stressors. Our study highlights the robustness of trait-based approaches for identifying flow regime changes in streams, and strongly suggests that biodiversity conservation and water resource management should focus on protecting natural base flow in headwater streams and generally reduce flow regulation for sustaining stream ecosystems under future global changes.

Zooplankton grazing pressure is insufficient for primary producer control under elevated warming and nutrient levels	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Cascading effects; Coastal ecosystems; Grazing; Nutrient pollutant; Phytoplankton; Zooplankton	MARINE PRIMARY PRODUCTION; PSEUDODIAPTOMUS-HESSEI; PLANKTONIC COPEPODS; SIZE STRUCTURE; FEEDING RATES; PHYTOPLANKTON; FOOD; TEMPERATURE; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN	Within a given ecosystem, species persistence is driven by responses to the effects of biotic and abiotic stressors. Ongoing climatic shifts and increased pollution pressure have created the need to assess potential effects and interactions of physical and biotic factors on coastal ecosystem processes to project ecosystem resilience and persistence. In coastal marine environments, primary production dynamics are driven by the interaction between bottom-up abiotic effects and biotic effects induced by top-down trophic control. Given the many environmental and climatic changes observed throughout coastal regions, we assessed the effects of interactions among temperature, nutrients and grazing in a laboratory-based microcosm experiment. We did this by comparing chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations at two temperatures in combination with four nutrient regimes. To test for subsequent cascading effects on higher trophic levels, we also measured grazing and growth rates of the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei. We observed different phytoplankton and zooplankton responses to temperature (17 degrees C, 24 degrees C) and nutrients (nitrogen only (N), phosphates only (P), nitrogen and phosphates combined (NP), no nutrient additions (C)). Contributions of predictors to model fit in the boosted regression trees model were phosphates (42.7%), copepods (23.8%), nitrates (17.5%) and temperature (15.9%), suggesting phosphates were an important driver for the high chl-a concentrations observed. There was an increase in total phytoplankton biomass across both temperatures, while nutrient addition affected the phytoplankton size structure prior to grazing irrespective of temperature. Phytoplankton biomass was highest in the NP treatment followed by the N treatment. However, the phytoplankton size structure differed between temperatures, with microphytoplankton being dominant at 24 degrees C, while nanophytoplankton dominated at 17 degrees C. The P and C treatments exhibited the lowest phytoplankton biomass. Copepod abundances and growth rateswere higher at 17 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. This study highlights that bottom-up positive effects in one trophic level do not always positively cascade into another trophic level. It was, however, evident that temperature was a limiting factor for plankton abundance, productivity and size structure only when nutrients were limiting, with top-down pressure exhibiting minimal effects on the phytoplankton.

These stations were characterized by a diversity of land use, implying different water pesticide contamination profiles. In each, Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) deployment (14 days) and grab water samples (1 per period) were performed 6 times in 2016 in order to obtain contamination levels (29 pesticides monitored). The large amount of data collected during this 1-year monitoring required specific graphical and map processing to compare the information provided by POCIS and grab samples. Graphical projections demonstrated that with POCIS the number of quantified pesticides and the quantification frequencies were higher than with grab samples. Additionally, projections showed that POCIS provided better temporal representativeness of monthly contamination levels. Indeed, the POCIS data showed seasonal trends which were directly linked with the use of each pesticide (application period) and the land use of each sampling site, that was not visible with the grab samples data. Map projections of the measured concentrations, using a common scale for the two sampling strategies, clearly showed the strengths of the POCIS deployment and the link between measured contamination levels, quantified pesticides and land use. Finally, this study shows that the combination of grab sample data (magnitude of contamination peaks) and POCIS data (average concentration over a given period) provided more complete and reliable knowledge of the contamination levels in the Basin than either method alone.

Field-chamber green-house gas fluxes and site characteristics were analysed in two Mediterranean peri-urban pine forests showing degradation symptoms. We examined the effect of different thinning interventions on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes, addressing the relationships with the environmental variables and C and N contents along forest floor-soil layers. Soil temperature resulted as the main driving variable for CO2 efflux and CH4 uptake. Soil moisture content and organic matter availability affected CO2 emission patterns in the two sites. N2O fluxes showed a positive correlation with soil moisture under wetter climatic conditions only. GHG fluxes showed significant correlations with C and N content of both forest floor and mineral soil, especially in the deepest layers, suggesting that it should be considered, together with environmental variables when accounting GHG fluxes in degraded forests. Short-term effects of thinning on CO2 emissions were dependent on disturbance induced by logging operations and organic matter inputs. After thinning CH4 uptake increased significantly under selective treatment, independently from specific site-induced effects. N2O fluxes were characterized by low emissions in both sites and were not affected by treatments. Soil CO2 efflux was the largest component of global warming potential (GWP) from both sites (11,553 kg ha(-1) y(-1) on average). Although it has a large global warming potential, N2O contribution to GWP was about 131 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1) y(-1). The contribution of CH4-CO2 equivalent to total GWP showed a clear and significant CH4 sink behaviour under selective treatment (36 kg ha(-1) y(-1) on average). However, in the short-term both thinning approaches produced a weak effect on total GWP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An uncertain future for the endemic Galliformes of the Caucasus	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Birds; Climate change; Conservation; Land use; Species distribution modelling	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; EXTINCTION RISK; COUPLED MODEL; RICHNESS; MLOKOSIEWICZI; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; PREDICTION	Impacts of climate change are already evident in ecosystems worldwide. High-latitude and altitude regions are at greatest risk because the effects of climate change are greater in these regions, and species from these areas have limited ability to track their climate envelopes. The Caucasian snowcock (Tetraogallus caucasicus) and the Caucasian grouse (Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi) are both high-altitude specialists that are endemic to a restricted range in the Caucasus mountains of Europe. Little research has been performed to determine the status of the populations or the potential impacts of climate change. We investigated how climate and land use change may impact both species in future and determined whether their life history traits may increase their vulnerability using a combined exposure and trait-based index. We compared several climate models, and in all instances, both species showed drastic range contractions although the extent of the contraction varied with each model. Traits like habitat specialism, ground nesting and incubation period meant that both species may be considered "most vulnerable" in the exposure and trait-based index. Given that both species already occur near the maximum elevations of the Caucasus, and that they lack any dispersal capabilities due to the isolation from alternative mountainous areas, research efforts need to be prioritized to improve our knowledge about their population status, to monitor future trends and to begin developing species action plans that conserve these endemic and iconic species of Europe. Both species are flagship and umbrella species and may serve as indicator species, their protection may therefore benefit a whole range of other species inhabiting this vulnerable Alpine ecosystem. Especially the Caucasian grouse has a high aesthetic value and is favoured by hunters in the region. The potential demise of this species may therefore also be negative for local communities.

Previous studies have identified relationships between the presence of CECs in water and broad-scale watershed characteristics. However, relationships between the presence of CECs and source-related watershed characteristics have not been explored across the Great Lakes basin. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analyses were used to develop predictive models of CEC occurrence in water and sediment throughout 24 U.S. tributaries to the Great Lakes. Models were based on the distribution of both broad-scale and source-related watershed characteristics. Twenty-one upstream watershed characteristics, including land cover, number of permitted point sources, and distance to point sources were used to develop models predicting the probability of CEC occurrence in surface water and bottom sediment. Total accuracy of BRT models ranged from 66% to 94% for both matrices. All 21 watershed characteristics were important predictor variables in at least one surface-water model; twenty were important in at least one bottom-sediment model. Among the model variables, developed land use and distance to point sources were important predictors of the presence of CEC classes in both water and sediment. Although limitations exist, BRT models are one tool available for assessing vulnerability of fisheries and aquatic resources to CEC occurrences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The impacts of MP pollution on ecosystems and their functioning remain poorly quantified, with most research hitherto focusing on marine ecosystems. There is a paucity of information on the impacts of MPs in freshwater ecosystems, despite the broad range of pathways through which MPs can proliferate and the extensive range of species which actively ingest MPs in these systems. Of particular interest are organisms that bridge aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The present study thus examines the uptake, ontogenic transference and effect of different concentrations (0, 50, 100 and 200 MPs mL(-1)) and sizes (2 and 15 mu m) of polystyrene MPs between aquatic and terrestrial life stages of Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes. Both 2 and 15 mu m MPs transferred from the aquatic larval to terrestrial adult stage of Culex mosquitoes, and uptake correlated tightly with initial exposure concentration. However, neither concentration nor size of MPs significantly influenced mortality rates between the aquatic larval and terrestrial adult stage. There was also no impact of MPs on the weight of emerging mosquito adults. We thus demonstrate that MPs can be transferred ontogenically through organisms with complex life histories, presenting a potential pathway for dispersal of MPs into terrestrial environments. We also show that MPs exposure does not affect mortality rates between life stages of freshwater Culex populations. This suggests that MPs do not impact nutritional uptakes, with unhampered development to adulthood facilitating subsequent dispersal of MPs aerially and between freshwater and terrestrial habitats.

The present study evaluated toxicity of mining site sediments from western Tasmania by conducting bioassays with two Australian freshwater species (Chironomus tepperi and Austrochiltonia subtenuis). The present study used multiple lines of evidence (LoE) to assess risk to aquatic biota and the potential sources of that risk at these sites using a sediment quality guideline (SQG) comparison approach (i.e. comparing chemical concentrations at the site (in this case metals, sulfate, and acidic pH) to sediment guideline values) as well as a statistical approach (principle component analysis). Five of the nine mining site sediments showed significant toxicity to both species using survival (A. subtenuis and C. tepperi) and emergence (C. tepperi) as endpoints. Each LoE (SQG comparison and PCA analysis) provided a list of possible contaminants of concern for toxic sites, each list differing from one another. Evaluating these LoE collectively resulted in a stronger characterization of causality and reduced the potential contaminants of concern to a select few, including mainly: copper, sulfate, and acidic pH. Although using multiple lines of evidence reduced the number of potential contaminants of concern, the causality results were still not entirely conclusive, thus we also conducted preliminary investigations using toxicity identification evaluations (TIEs). These TIE investigations, showed the overall importance of acidic pH in these sediments, but also show the need for further work to improve the TIE technique for these types of sediment. The present study illustrates the strengths of using multiple LoE in assessing aquatic risk, especially in the assessment of complex sediments such as those in mining areas of Tasmania. The study, perhaps more importantly, also provides the foundation for more focused work to be conducted in the future to better understanding the implications of mining in western Tasmania.

In August 2016, a total of 72 peat samples were collected from twelve 20 m long transects perpendicular to access roads, with a further six samples collected fromundisturbed reference areas. Sampling locations represent a range in three variables associated with roads: 1) side of the road (upstream/downstream), 2) distance to a culvert (longitudinal; <2 and >20 m), and 3) distance from the road (lateral; 2, 6, and 20 m). Phenol oxidase and hydrolase (glucosidase, sulfatase, xylosidase, glucosaminidase, and phosphatase) enzyme activities were determined for each sample, in addition to water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH, and peat temperature. The average hydrolase activities in the fen were similar to four times higher than in the bog. At the bog, the water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH and the activities of phenol oxidase, sulfatase, glucosidase, xylosidase and glucosaminidase were all significantly influenced by one or more road associated factors. The highest enzyme activities in the bog occurred on the downstream side of the road at plots located far from the culvert. In contrast, the flow of water in the fen was not perpendicular to the road. Consequently, no significant variations in water table depth, phenolic concentration, pH or enzyme activity were found with respect to road associated factors. Results indicate that road crossings in boreal peatlands can indirectly alter enzyme activities, likely as part of a causal chain following changes to hydrology and redox conditions. Two of six investigated enzymes had significantly higher activities in the road disturbed areas compared to undisturbed areas, suggesting ultimately that roads may enhance organic matter decomposition rates. However, adequate hydrologic connections through culverts and road construction parallel to the water flow can minimize the road-induced impacts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ship-borne observations provided the first high-resolution spatial data of GLUC activity in large water bodies as rapid indication of fecal pollution and were used to identify associations with hydrological conditions and land use. The utility of this novel approach for water quality screening was evaluated by surveys of the Columbia River, the Mississippi River and the Yahara Lakes, covering up to a 500 km river course and 50 km(2) lake area. The ship-borne measurements of GLUC activity correlated with standard E. coli analyses (R-2 = 0.71) and revealed the effects of (1) precipitation events and urban run-off on GLUC activity in surface waters, (2) localized point inlets of potential fecal pollution and (3) increasing GLUC signals along gradients of urbanization. We propose that this ship-borne water quality screening to be integrated into future water inventory programs as an initial or complementary tool (besides established fecal indicator parameters), due to its ability to provide near real-time spatial information on potential fecal contamination of large surface water resources and therefore being helpful to greatly reduce potential human health risks.

The effects of climate change-induced melting on the microbial ecology in different glacial-fed aquatic systems have been well illuminated, but the resolution of seasonal dynamics was still limited. Here, we studied bacterial community composition and diversity in a glacial-fed Tibetan lake, Lake Ranwu, to elucidate how glacial-fed aquatic ecosystems respond to the seasonal glacial melting. Obvious seasonal variations of bacterial dominant groups were found in Lake Ranwu and inlet rivers. In April, the majority of OTUs belonged to the Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The Proteobacteria increased to the most abundant phylum in July and November, while the Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria decreased about 50% over seasons. Most key discriminant taxa of each season's community strongly associated with specific environmental variables, suggesting their adaptation to seasonal environments. Bacterial alpha diversity varied among seasons and exhibited strongly negative correlations with conductivity. Conductivity was the major driving force in determining the seasonal variation of bacterial community composition. Fluctuated conductivity was one of the consequences of seasonal melting of glaciers. This study offered evidence for the unique seasonal dynamics pattern of bacterial communities responding to glacial melting. Moreover, this study may provide a reference for assessing the long-term effects of glacial retreat on glacial-fed aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ecological facilitation, the positive effect of density of individuals on the individual's survival across a stress gradient, is a complex phenomenon. A large number of tree individuals coupled with soil moisture, temperature, and water stress data across a long temporal period were followed. Data-driven analysis in the absence of hypothesis was performed. Information theoretic analysis of multiple statistical models was employed in order to quantify the best data-driven index of vegetation density and spatial scale of interactions. Sequentially, tree survival was quantified as a function of the size of the individual, vegetation density, and time at the optimal spatial interaction scale. Land surface temperature and soil moisture were also statistically explained by tree size, density, and time. Results indicated that in space both facilitation and competition co-exist in the same ecosystem and the sign and magnitude of this depend on the spatial scale. Overall, within the optimal data-driven spatial scale, tree survival was best explained by the interaction between density and year, sifting overall from facilitation to competition through time. However, small sized trees were always facilitated by increased densities, while large sized trees had either negative or no density effects. Tree size wasmore important predictor than density in survival and this has implications for nature-based solutions: maintaining large tree individuals or planting species that can become large-sized can safeguard against tree-less areas by promoting survival at long time periods through harsh environmental conditions. Large trees had also a significant effect in moderating land surface temperature and this effect was higher than the one of vegetation density on temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Heterogeneity of soil contamination by Sr-90 and its absorption by herbaceous plants in the East Ural Radioactive Trace area	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Kyshtym accident; EURT; Grasses; Strontium-90; Concentration ratio; Aggregated transfer factor	HEAD PART; RADIONUCLIDES; ZONE; ECOSYSTEMS; ACCIDENT; KYSHTYM	A nuclear accident occurred at the production association Mayak in the Urals in 1957. Approximately 74 PBq of radioactive substances were released into the environment, which resulted in the contamination of a vast area, named the East Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT). We have studied the current levels of contamination of soils and plants by Sr-90 in the head part of the EURT. The heterogeneity of soil contamination (concentrations and contamination densities) in the EURT zone was considered at three scales. 1) At the macro-level, the soil contamination by Sr-90 decreased by three orders of magnitude in the cross section of the zone. 2) At the meso-level, the variability of the soil contamination was estimated within several sectors, selected by the results of macro-scale mapping. 3) At the micro-level, differences in soil contamination between individual samples (0.01 m(2)) selected at the site (1000 m(2)) exceeded the one order of magnitude. The similarity of geometric mean (GM) values of the soil contamination was shown, based on the measurements of 3, 25 and 30 soil samples at the micro-level. In 57% of cases, the value of the GM obtained by 3 measurements differed by no >20% from the GM value by 25 measurements. In the most of cases, the differences in GM obtained by these two methods did not exceed 40%. Thus, in small sites it is possible to take only three soil samples to assess the level of soil contamination. We evaluated the absorption variability of Sr-90 for six species of herbaceous plants (Rumex confertus, Leonurus quinquelobatus, Arctium tomentosum, Urtica dioica, Lathyrus pratensis, Bromopsis inermis). The range of concentration ratios (CRwo-soil) for Sr-90 was 0.003-0.49, and the diapason of aggregated transfer factors (T-ag) was 0.56-7.3. The 'plant species' factor determined about 55% of the total variability of CRwo-soil and T-ag. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Mikhailovskaya, L. N.; Modorov, M. V.; Pozolotina, V.

A graph theory tool for assessing structural sediment connectivity: Development and application in the Mercurey vineyards (France)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sediment connectivity; Graph theory; Vineyards; GIS	SOIL-EROSION; CATCHMENT; RUNOFF; SPACE; RATES; YIELD	In agricultural lands, assessing how the spatial patterns of landscapes affect sediment connectivity is a key factor in understanding the nonlinear behavior of sediment transfer to the outlet. Important questions remain regarding this relationship. For example, to what extent is sediment travel disconnected from the flows that transport sediments? What connections exist between the components of the sediment cascade? The answers to this methodological problem are particularly important to land managers and farmers. In this paper, we further explore graph theory as a tool for assessing structural sediment connectivity at the catchment scale. Our approach combines two graph theory indices, the accessibility index and the flow index, to create the residual flow (RF) index, which is used to assess structural sediment connectivity. We apply the method to the case study of Mercurey (Burgundy, France), where agricultural activities (i.e., wine growing) have resulted in environmental issues, such as soil loss and flooding. In this area, vine-growers have developed specific structures (such as concrete pits, drainage ditches or curved paths) to collect and trap sediments that have been eroded from vine plots, which can then be used to backfill parcels upslope. These man-made structures modify the spatial pattern of the sediment cascade. The indices mentioned above can be used to highlight and quantify these changes. In particular, the influence of linear features (such as roads and hedges) and artificial sinks can be determined. Additionally, we find that unexpected behaviors of the sediment cascade system can result from dysfunctions in the management structures. The RF index shows promising results as a tool for rapidly assessing structural connectivity at the catchment scale, although further methodological advances will help ensure reproducibility.

Revising the index of watershed integrity national maps	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Index of watershed integrity; Index of catchment integrity; StreamCat; Water quality; Anthropogenic stressors; Random forest models	FRESH-WATER; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; STREAMS; THREATS; SCALE	Watersheds provide a range of services valued by society, incorporating biotic and abiotic functions within their boundaries. Recently, an operational definition of watershed integrity was applied and indices of watershed integrity (IWI) and catchment integrity (ICI) were developed and mapped for the conterminous United States. However, these indices were originally derived using equally-weighted first-order approximations of relationships between anthropogenic stressors (obtained from the U.S. EPA's StreamCat dataset) and six watershed functions. In addition, the original calculations of the IWI and ICI did not standardize metrics across these differing scales, resulting in IWI and ICI values that are not directly comparable. We provide an example of how to iteratively update the stressor-watershed function relationships using random forest models and a nationwide response metric representative of one of the six watershed functions. Specifically, we focused on the chemical regulation function (CHEM) of IWI and ICI by relating a composite metric of chemical water quality from 1914 samples to land use metrics explicit to CHEM to refine the nature of these relationships (e.g., non-linear versus linear). The rate of nitrogen fertilizer, agricultural land use, and urban land use were found to be the three most important stressors predicting the national water quality response metric. Revision of CHEM values improved the prediction of several regional- to national-scale water quality indicators. In all cases, exponential decay curves replaced the original negative linear relationship for CHEM. Therefore, the original IWI and ICI values are probably over-estimates of the actual integrity of the Nation's watersheds and catchments. With these revisions, we provide updated national maps of IWI and ICI. The methods outlined here can be implemented iteratively as more and better data become available for all six of the watershed functions to elevate the accuracy and applicability of these indices to various land management issues.

Nevertheless, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of habitat transformation remain less understood than those from habitat fragmentation. Transformed habitats are structurally simpler, altering species composition and their ecological interactions, potentially compromising gene flow and genetic diversity. We focused on a tripartite mutualistic system composed of a mistletoe (Tristerix corymbosus), its pollinator (Sephanoides sephaniodes) and its seed disperser (Dromiciops gliroides) to assess changes in their ecological and evolutionary dynamics as a result of habitat transformation. We used eight microsatellite markers to compare genetic diversity, relatedness and gene flow among five mistletoe groups inhabiting native and transformed habitats (abandoned Eucalyptus globulus plantations). We found that these groups were genetically structured, with greater allelic richness and genetic diversity in their native habitat. Also, we found higher relatedness among mistletoe individuals in transformed habitats, which varied as a function of the geographic distance among plants, probably as a result of larger resource availability, which influenced mutualist visitation rates. We did not find differences in the current migration patterns, which suggests that Tristerix corymbosus may be resilient to habitat transformation. Yet, its highly specialized interactions along with changes in its spatial configuration depict a more complex scenario, which probably impose a cost in terms of lower genetic diversity and increased relatedness that might compromise its long-term viability.

There are >50 analogues described, which could be biotransformed into a molecular form of greater or lesser toxicity. The Alagados Reservoir is used for water supply, and persistent cyanobacterial blooms as well as PSTs concentrations have been found in this water body since 2002. The aims of this study were to quantify the concentrations of PSTs in the water and fish samples from the Alagados Reservoir. In addition, we evaluated the elimination of PSTs for 90 days in fish and estimated the potential risk to human health. Water and fish samples were collected from the reservoir. For the water samples the phytoplankton and chemical analyses were carried out. Fish were divided into two sample times: Field Samples (IS) and Elimination Experiment Samples (EES), which were maintained for 90 days in filtered and dechlorinated water. For chemical analysis, the muscles of FS were collected on the fish sampling day and the muscles and feces of EES were collected at 7, 15, 30,45, 60, 75 and 90 days. PSTs concentrations were present in water and fish samples, and they were estimated as a potential risk to humans; mainly for children. In addition, toxins were accumulated, biotransformed to other analogues and excreted by the fish. However, after 90 days, the toxins were still present in the water and fish muscle. Therefore, PSTs can remain for a long period in water, and fish can be a carrier of these neurotoxins. New approaches of monitoring and management are necessary in the actual global context of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Trophic position and foraging ecology of Ross, Weddell, and crabeater seals revealed by compound-specific isotope analysis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Ross seal; Weddell seal; Crabeater seal; Compound-specific isotopes; Amino acids; Antarctica; Foraging ecology; Trophic dynamics	AMINO-ACID DELTA-N-15; STABLE-ISOTOPES; OMMATOPHOCA-ROSSII; ANTARCTIC SEALS; FOOD-WEB; PHYTOPLANKTON DYNAMICS; HABITAT SELECTION; EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; DIET COMPOSITION; MCMURDO SOUND	Ross seals Ommatophoca rossii are one of the least studied marine mammals, with little known about their foraging ecology. Research to date using bulk stable isotope analysis suggests that Ross seals have a trophic position intermediate between that of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii and crabeater Lobodon carcinophaga seals. However, consumer bulk stable isotope values not only reflect trophic dynamics, but also variations in baseline isotope values, which can be substantial. We used compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSI-AA) to separate isotopic effects of a shifting baseline versus trophic structure on the foraging ecology of these ecologically important Antarctic pinnipeds. We found that Ross seals forage in an open ocean food web, while crabeater and Weddell seals forage within similar food webs closer to shore. However, isotopic evidence suggests that crabeater seals are likely following sea ice, while Weddell seals target productive areas of the continental shelf of West Antarctica. Our CSI-AA data indicate that Ross seals have a high trophic position equivalent to that of Weddell seals, contrary to prior conclusions from nitrogen isotope results on bulk tissues. CSI-AA indicates that crabeater seals are at a trophic position lower than that of Ross and Weddell seals, consistent with a krill-dominated diet. Our results redefine the view of the trophic dynamics and foraging ecology of the Ross seal, and also highlight the importance of quantifying baseline isotope variations in foraging studies.

We investigated trophic interactions of the mixotrophic red tide dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum in coastal waters off southern California, USA. We conducted 2 laboratory experiments using a natural plankton community in which we manipulated the presence of potential competitors/prey (<20 mu m) and the presence of zooplankton consumers (<110 mu m) through size fractionation. We further tested the grazing impact of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans on L. polyedrum in both size fractions containing natural plankton and in a final experiment using a gradient of different L. polyedrum concentrations in culture. Overall, our experiments demonstrated that nanoplankton presence negatively affected L. polyedrum abundances, indicating that the mixotrophic dinoflagellate could not benefit from the presence of potential prey. L. polyedrum was strongly controlled by N. scintillans in the natural plankton community, while natural microzooplankton, mainly consisting of tintinnids and copepod nauplii, were positively correlated with L. polyedrum abundances. This could indicate an indirect positive effect of natural microzooplankton on L. polyedrum, presumably through feeding on other phytoplankton, resulting in the dinoflagellate's competitive release. The final experiment investigating the density-dependence of N. scintillans grazing on L. polyedrum demonstrated that N. scintillans is able to increase its population size and control the growth of L. polyedrum after an initial lag phase, and up to a certain cell concentration, and may thus play an important role in bloom regulation and possibly even termination.

Presently, their ability to persist under polar night conditions might be significantly affected by increasing winter temperatures. We assessed physiological parameters (photosynthesis, pigment content, respiration, carbohydrate storage) in 2 species of Arctic kelp, the boreal-temperate Saccharina latissima and the Arctic-endemic Laminaria solidungula, during the polar night 2016/17. Algae were sampled from Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, shortly before the onset of the dark period in October, and at the end of the polar night in early February. Analyses were conducted for different tissue sections along the phylloid (meristem, centre region, distal region). Data suggest that kelp maintain their photosynthetic competence throughout the entire winter period, as indicated by photosynthesis vs. energy (PE) curve parameters and photosynthetic pigment contents. Overall laminarin content was reduced by 96% in S. latissima and by 90% in L. solidungula during winter, indicating that this storage glucan fuelled metabolic function during the polar night. Marked differences in laminarin content between the phylloid regions and across species indicated specific adaptive mechanisms between boreal-temperate and Arctic-endemic kelp. We suggest that laminarin turnover represents a sensitive parameter for assessing kelp physiology under a changing temperature regime.

Between 2007 and 2012, we studied an annually occurring green tide of Ulva rigida in the PCB-contaminated Superfund site of New Bedford Harbor, MA, USA. Ulva PCB concentrations were highest (95-99 mg kg(-1) dry weight) near the contamination source and decreased to only 2-4 mg kg(-1) at the site's southern end, approximately 2.5 km away. To assess the bloom's potential role as a PCB contributor to higher trophic levels, we performed stomach content analysis on the system's primary mid-trophic level predator, the salt marsh mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, and stable isotope analysis on associated potential energy sources. In addition to detritus and macroinvertebrate prey, Ulva was a major component of mummichog stomach contents, and a N-15-labeled feeding experiment demonstrated that mummichogs can assimilate ingested Ulva. Among invertebrate prey, stable isotope mixing models showed Uiva as the main diet source for amphipods Gammarus spp., while grass shrimp Palaemonetes spp. and sandworms Nereis spp. relied on a mix of Lava and Spartina or particulate organic matter, respectively. Sandworms and grass shrimp were the main mummichog energy sources, suggesting that this estuarine keystone species is linked to the (Eva bloom mainly through predation on Ova-consuming grazers rather than direct ingestion. Our data provide evidence for a potentially overlooked impact of macroalgal blooms-namely, their potential role in the trophic transfer of PCBs and other bioaccumulated pollutants.

Reproductive strategy changes across latitude in a clonal sea anemone	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Gametogenesis; Life history plasticity; Asexual reproduction; Latitudinal variations; Reproductive patterns; Temperature; Diadumene lineata	ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION; BODY-SIZE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISSION RATE; TEMPERATURE; GROWTH; CORAL	Understanding the forces that govern allocation to growth, asexual, and sexual reproduction is a major goal for understanding life history diversity in the sea. Environmental conditions influence the costs and benefits of various life history strategies, so different strategies may be favored across geographic gradients. We describe latitudinal patterns in population density, body size, and gamete production in the clonal sea anemone Diadumene lineata. Fission rate in this species is highly correlated with temperature, so the rate of asexual reproduction declines with latitude. We measured the relationships among body size, gamete production, and environmental variables using individuals from 20 sites in intertidal estuaries and harbors from Florida to Maine across the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Average body size increased with latitude and decreased with temperature. Body size strongly predicts both the probability of having gametes and the number of gametes produced, such that there is a latitudinal transition from low per capita gamete production in the south to higher production in central and northern populations, with a peak in the Mid-Atlantic region. This gradient in per capita gamete production in this species runs counter to a known gradient in fission rate along the US Atlantic coast, supporting a latitudinal dine in the reproductive strategy in this species.

Consistent spatial patterns in multiple trophic levels occur around artificial habitats	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Artificial structure; Artificial reef; Reef fish; Fisheries acoustics; Shipwreck; Splitbeam echosounder; Trophic ecology	CORAL-REEF FISHES; ZOOPLANKTON; AGGREGATIONS; ASSEMBLAGES; IMPACTS; FLOW; BAY	With increasing global rates of urbanization, it is important to understand the ecological functions of artificial structures. One way to assess the ecological functions of such structures is to test whether they function similarly to natural habitats. In marine systems, naturally occurring structured habitats, such as coral reefs and rocky reefs, support aggregations of planktivorous fish, often inducing spatial patterns in prey and predators. Whether similar spatial patterns occur around submerged artificial structures, which often have more abrupt topographies than natural habitats, remains less well understood. We tested whether consistent spatial patterns in planktivorous fish, their prey (zooplankton), and their predators (piscivorous fish) were present around artificial structures. We first documented spatial distributions of these 3 trophic groups around 15 marine artificial structures (shipwrecks) using acoustic surveys and then asked how spatial distributions of each trophic group relate to the others. We found that the center of planktivorous fish aggregations occurred an average of 39 m from habitat edges. Zooplankton prey were detected throughout nearly 25% of surveyed areas around habitats. Piscivorous fish predators concentrated closest to habitats. Further analyses revealed that these patterns sometimes related to environmental factors, such as water current magnitude and direction. Because spatial distributions of planktivorous fish, their prey, and their predators were consistent across sampled artificial structures, our findings suggest that artificial structures influence spatial patterns across adjacent trophic levels. This finding adds to a growing body of evidence that artificial habitats provide important ecological functions.	[Paxton, Avery B.; Peterson, C.

A sex-influenced flexible foraging strategy in a tropical seabird, the magnificent frigatebird	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Fregata magnificens; Tracking; Seabird; Feeding ecology; Video logger	GREAT FRIGATEBIRDS; WANDERING ALBATROSSES; PARENTAL CARE; AUK ALLE; BEHAVIOR; LONG; BIRDS; CHICK; DIMORPHISM; RESOURCE	To successfully exploit resources, animals must be adapted to operate under phenotypic and environmental constraints. The strategies that predators use to locate prey are therefore diverse, particularly for breeding central-place foragers that must balance investment in reproduction and self-maintenance. Magnificent frigatebirds Fregata magnificens are tropical seabirds with intriguing morphology and feeding ecology, which display strikingly unequal levels of parental care (males deserting offspring months before females). These unusual traits can better help us understand the links between movement behaviour and breeding strategies in this poorly studied species. Using archival GPS, GPS-GSM loggers, bird-borne cameras and dietary data, we investigated the foraging ecology of chick-rearing magnificent frigatebirds from a breeding population in the Cayman Islands. This population engages in 2 main foraging strategies: (1) coastal trips over the continental shelf, where individuals target reef species and engage in kleptoparasitism, and (2) offshore trips during which birds feed on schooling pelagic prey. Differences in strategy use were partially linked to sex, with males (which invest less in offspring) roaming further from nests, and showing a higher propensity to forage offshore. Video data further indicated differences in social information use between strategies: foraging with conspecifics was more prevalent in coastal environments than pelagic. We suggest that observed variation in at-sea behaviour may partially be mediated by sex-based differences in parental roles, and/or size differences leading to intraspecific competition. Our study provides evidence of bimodal foraging and sheds new light on the importance of both pelagic and coastal feeding in this enigmatic species.

We asked whether yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventer) alarm calls varied as a function of parasite infection and/or neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios (a measure of immunological challenge). We found that marmots infected with Eimeria, an intestinal parasite, had noisier calls. This is potentially because of an immunostimulating effect of Eimeria infection which may draw energy from nonvital functions. The results suggest calls potentially contain information about parasite status which could be used by receivers to estimate a caller's condition. Future studies are required to determine whether infection influences caller reliability and how receivers respond to alarm calls from parasitized individuals.

How Do Trait-Mediated Non-lethal Effects of Predation Affect Population-Level Performance of Mosquitoes?	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Aedes aegypti; non-lethal predation; larval competition; life-table; larval development time; body size; fecundity; population-level traits	AEDES-AEGYPTI DIPTERA; OVIPOSITION HABITAT SELECTION; WATER-BORNE CUES; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; LARVAL COMPETITION; PREY INTERACTIONS; HOST-SEEKING; LIFE-CYCLE; BODY-SIZE	Non-lethal, trait-mediated effects of predation impact prey behavior and life-history traits. Studying how these effects in turn influence prey demography is crucial to understand prey life-history evolution. Mosquitoes are important vectors that claim several million lives every year worldwide by transmitting a range of pathogens. Several ecological factors affect life-history traits of both larval and adult mosquitoes, creating effects that cascade to population-level consequences. Few studies have comprehensively explored the non-lethal effects of predation and its interactions with resources and competition on larval, adult, and population traits of mosquitoes. Understanding these interactions is important because the effects of predation are hypothesized to rescue prey populations from the effects of density-dependence resulting from larval competition. Aedes aegypti larvae reared at two different larval densities and subjected to three non-lethal predator treatments were monitored for survival, development time, and adult size through the larval stages to adult eclosion, and adult females were monitored for survival and reproduction through their first gonotrophic cycle. Intraspecific competition increased larval development time, yielded small-bodied adults, and reduced fecundity in individuals exposed to predatory chemical cues as larvae. Exposure to cues from a living predator affected both body size and latency to blood feed in females. Analysis of life-table traits revealed significant effects of competition on net reproductive rate (R-0) of mosquitoes. The interaction between competition and predator treatments significantly affected the cohort rate of increase (r) and the index of performance (r'). The index of performance, which estimates rate of population change based on the size-fecundity relationship, was significantly and positively correlated with r, but overestimated r slightly. Lack of significant effect of predator treatments and larval density on cohort generation time (T-c) further suggests that the observed effects of treatments on r and r' were largely a consequence of the effects on R-0. Also, the significant effects of treatment combinations on larval development time, adult body size and fecundity were ultimately manifested as effects on life-table traits estimated from adult survival and reproduction.

Ecological Niche Modeling of Three Species of Stenella Dolphins in the Caribbean Basin, With Application to the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Stenella; potential distribution area; Caribbean Basin; Seaflower Biosphere Reserve; Maxent; ecological niche modeling; niche overlap	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; UPWELLING SYSTEM; CETACEAN-HABITAT; SPOTTED DOLPHINS; AQUATIC MAMMALS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE; ATLANTIC; GUAJIRA; CONSERVATION	Dolphins of the genus Stenella occur in pelagic waters of both tropical and warm-temperate oceans. Three species, the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis), the pantropical spotted dolphin (S. attenuata), and the spinner dolphin (S. longirostris) are abundant worldwide, but in the Caribbean Basin they have been poorly studied and information on their distribution patterns is scarce. Specifically, in Colombia's remote Seaflower Biosphere Reserve (SFBR) S. attenuata has been reported occasionally, but S. frontalis and S. longirostris have never been recorded before. To address this information gap, an ecological niche modeling approach was used to determine the potential distribution patterns of these three dolphin species in the region. Records of these species for the Caribbean Basin were compiled, including both published and unpublished data. Environmental information, including bathymetry, bathymetric slope, distance to shore, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and chlorophylla concentration was gathered from public databases (MARSPEC and Bio-ORACLE) in raster format. The maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent) for modeling species' geographic distributions with presence-only data was used. After filtering the data, 210 records of S. attenuata, 204 of S. frontalis, and 80 of S. longirostris were used to run models. The best configuration for each model was chosen based on the Delta A/Cc criterion. For all three species, the final ecological niche models returned AUC test values higher than 0.8, indicating satisfactory model performance. The resulting potential distribution maps suggested that areas closest to continental shorelines of the Caribbean Basin and surrounding islands had the highest environmental suitability for all species (>70%). All models reported high environmental suitability for S. attenuata and S. longirostris in the SFBR, mainly in the southernmost part surrounding San Andres and Providence Archipelago. Assessment of niche overlap from the predictions of species distributions using the similarity statistic and pairwise map overlap indicated that S. frontalis and S. longirostris had niches slightly more similar in comparison to S. attenuata. As this was a first effort to fill a gap in our understanding of the distribution of species in the genus Stenella in the Caribbean Basin, further studies are necessary using both niche modeling and biological/ecological approaches.

Species distribution modeling using a machine learning approach provides novel tools for mapping areas of interest for restoration projects. Here we use stacked-species distribution models (s-SDMs) to identify candidate locations for installment of manmade reefs, a useful management tool for restoring structural habitat complexity and the associated biota in marine ecosystems. We created species distribution models for 21 species of commercial, recreational, ecological, or conservation importance within the Southern California Bight based on observations from long-term reef surveys combined with high resolution (200 m x 200 m) geospatial environmental data layers. We then combined the individual species models to create a stacked-species habitat suitability map, identifying over 800 km(2) of potential area for reef restoration within the Bight. When considering only the 21 focal species, s-SDM scores were positively associated with observed bootstrap species richness not only on natural reefs (linear model: slope = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.17-0.36, w = 1), but also this result was supported by two independent test datasets. The predicted richness from this linear model was associated with observed species richness when considering only the focal species on manmade reefs (linear model: slope = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.130-92, w = 1) and also when considering 204 other non-focal species on both natural and manmade reefs in southern California (slope = 3.65, 95% CI = 2.93-4.37, w = 1). Finally, our results demonstrate that the existing manmade reefs included in our study on average are located in regions with habitat suitability that is not only less suitable than natural reefs (t-value = -5.4; p < 0.05), but also only slightly significantly better than random (p < 0.05), demonstrating a need for more biologically informed placement of manmade reefs. The stacked-species distribution model provides insight for marine restoration projects in southern California specifically, but more generally this method can also be widely applied to other types of habitat restoration including both marine and terrestrial.

Identifying Causes of Temporal Changes in Acropora cervicornis Populations and the Potential for Recovery	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						demographic monitoring; time series; disease; fireworm; long-term monitoring; Florida	JAMAICAN CORAL-REEFS; WHITE-BAND DISEASE; ECOLOGY; GROWTH; DISTURBANCE; PREVALENCE; MORTALITY; PALMATA; FLORIDA	Corals, specifically the Atlantic staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis, are under major threat as disturbance events such as storms and disease and predation outbreaks increase in frequency. Since its population declines due to a wide spread disease event in the early 1980s, limited long-term monitoring studies describing the impact of current threats and potential recovery have been completed. The aim of this study was to document the impacts of environmental (tropical storms, increased wind) and biological (disease and predation) threats on A. cervicornis to further understand its population dynamics and potential for recovery. Two high-density A. cervicornis patches (greater than 1 hectare each) were surveyed tri-annually (winter, summer, fall) from 2008-2016. A. cervicornis percent cover, canopy height, census of individuals, and prevalence and occurrence of disease, predation, and bleaching were evaluated within permanent 3.5 m radial plots (n = 27 and 31). Temporal variability was observed in mean percent live cover at both patches and showed an overall loss of tissue. Frequent disturbances such as tropical storms, hurricanes, and disease events, caused increased, prolonged, and widespread mortality. Periods void of disturbance allowed for recovery and growth. Prevalence and occurrence of disease and predation were highly variable between monitoring events. They were also found to be significantly higher on masses (individuals >= 1.5 m) than on colonies and during summer surveys (June-August). These data indicate that substantial length of time between major disturbance events is necessary for recovery and growth of this species. The implication of these results is that given the current rates of growth, recruitment, and storm frequency, natural species recovery is unlikely unless large scale issues like climate change and ocean warming, which affect the intensity and frequency of disease and predation, are addressed.

Probably originating from the Canary Islands and Madeira, the species is well established in Western Europe and large parts of the Mediterranean area and has spread recently into California and South America, while Central European populations were not known until 2011. We report on long-time observations that reveal that at least two flourishing populations in Germany (Cologne) have been present for over five years, while in Ecuador one population has been observed between 2014 and 2018 and several other records were made in other parts of the country. Data obtained from the British Spider Recording Scheme demonstrate that the species moved significantly northwards since the report of the first populations in the very South of England, after several decades of relative stasis. The sudden northward expansion highly correlates with a massive rise in press coverage of the species. In the Americas, S. nobilis is currently known from four countries (USA, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia), and available DNA barcoding data obtained for specimens from this area suggest that multiple introductions occurred within each country. Using ecological niche modeling, we identified suitable climate regions for the species and discuss possible reasons for its current spread. We propose that seaside cities and villages with a temperate oceanic or Mediterranean climate are especially favourable potential habitats for S. nobilis and will face the highest colonization pressure in the future, while tropical upland regions with temperate climates arc also vulnerable to invasion by S. nobilis.

Measurements of dissolved pollutants before and after the bios wale often justify their ability to clean this runoff, but research addressing the physical and chemical sequestration of these pollutants is scarce. Soil samples were taken from an arid bioswale and analyzed for concentrations of aluminum, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, lead, vanadium and zinc. Heat maps of the concentration of these metals in soil were generated via Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) and demonstrate that location-specific sequestration differs between metals within the same swale. Sequential extraction with a modified Tessier et al. (1979) protocol coupled with profiles of metal concentration versus distance along the main flow axis in the bioswale illustrate that the carbonate soil fraction contains elevated concentrations of zinc, lead, cobalt, and manganese, metals sequestered by the bioswale with statistical significance.

Conjunctive use of in situ gas sampling and chromatography with geospatial analysis to estimate greenhouse gas emissions of a large Amazonian hydroelectric reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						GHG fluxes; Tucurui; Amazon; Diffusive emissions; Spatial interpolation	METHANE EMISSIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SURFACES; FLUXES; CO2	Hydroelectric power reservoirs are considered potential contributors to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere through the emittance of methane and carbon dioxide. We combined in situ sampling and gas chromatography with geostatistical and remote sensing approaches to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a large hydropower reservoir. We used remote sensing data to estimate the water surface and geospatial interpolation to calculate total emissions as a function of reservoir surface area. The CH4 and CO2 gas concentrations were linearly correlated to sampling time, confirming the adequacy of the in situ sampling method to measure GHG diffusive fluxes fromreservoirwater surfaces. The combination of high purity (99.99%) ISO-normgas standardswith a gas chromatograph, enabled us to achieve low measurement detection limits of 0.16 and 0.60 mu mol mol-1, respectively, for CH4 (using a flame ionization or FID detector) and CO2 (using a thermal conductivity or TCD detector). Our results show that CO2 emissions are significantly (an order of 5.10(2) - 10(3)) higher than those of CH4 in both the spatial and temporal domain for this reservoir. The total diffusive GHG emissions over a year (June 2011 to May 2012) of the Tucurui hydropower reservoir being in operation, in units of tons of carbon, added up to 6.82 x 10(3) for CH4 and 1.19 x 10(6) for CO2. We show that in situ GHG sampling using small floating gas chambers and high precision gas chromatography can be combined with geospatial interpolation techniques and remote sensing data to obtain estimates of diffusive GHG emissions from large water bodies with fluctuating water surfaces such as hydropower reservoirs. We recommend that more measurements and observations on these emissions are pursued in order to support and better quantify the ongoing discussions on estimates and mitigation of GHG emissions from reservoirs in the Amazon region and elsewhere in the world.

KARST.; PICEA-ABIES; PAIRWISE RELATEDNESS; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; PRACTICAL GUIDE; QUALITY TRAITS; TREE GROWTH; AGE; MICROSATELLITES; ADAPTATION	Cambial growth is a phenotypic trait influenced by various physiological processes, numerous biotic and abiotic drivers, as well as by the genetic background. By archiving the outcome of such complex interplay, tree-rings are an exceptional resource for addressing individual long-term growth responses to changing environments and climate. Disentangling the effects of the different drivers of tree growth, however, remains challenging because of the lack of multidisciplinary data. Here, we combine individual dendrochronological, genetic and spatial data to assess the relative importance of genetic similarity and spatial proximity on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) growth performances. We intensively sampled five plots from two populations in southern and central Europe, characterizing a total of 482 trees. A two-step analytical framework was developed. First, the effects of climate and tree age on tree-ring width (TRW) were estimated for each individual using a random slope linear mixed-effects model. Individual parameters were then tested against genetic and spatial variables by Mantel tests, partial redundancy analyses and variance partitioning. Our modelling approach successfully captured a large fraction of variance in TRW (conditional R-2 values up to 0.94) which was largely embedded in inter-individual differences. All statistical approaches consistently showed that genetic similarity was not related to variation in the individual parameters describing growth responses. In contrast, up to 29% of the variance of individual parameters was accounted by spatial variables, revealing that microenvironmental features are more relevant than genetic similarity in determining similar growth patterns. Our study highlights both the advantages of modelling dendrochronological data at the individual level and the relevance of microenvironmental variation on individual growth patterns. These two aspects should be carefully considered in future multidisciplinary studies on growth dynamics in natural populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The pharmaceutical pollutant fluoxetine alters reproductive behaviour in a fish independent of predation risk	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Antidepressant; Antipredator behavior; Reproduction; Behavioural ecotoxicology; Pharmaceutical pollution; Sexual selection	SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR; GUPPIES POECILIA-RETICULATA; PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; ENVIRONMENTALLY-RELEVANT CONCENTRATIONS; SIAMESE FIGHTING FISH; MALE-MALE COMPETITION; FEMALE MATE CHOICE; ANTIDEPRESSANT FLUOXETINE; SEXUAL SELECTION; WASTE-WATER	Pharmaceutical pollutants constitute a major threat to wildlife because of their capacity to induce biological effects at low doses. One such pollutant is the antidepressant fluoxetine, which has been detected in surface waters globally at levels that recent studies suggest can alter physiology and behaviour in aquatic organisms. However, wildlife exposed to pharmaceutical contaminants are typically confronted with multiple stressors simultaneously, including predation risk, which is a particularly important natural stressor that can have direct (e.g. mortality) and indirect (e.g. changed prey behaviour) fitness effects. Accordingly, we investigated potential impacts of environmentally realistic fluoxetine exposure on reproductive behaviour in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) under predation risk. Specifically, we tested whether fluoxetine exposure altered mating behaviour in male and female guppies in the presence of either a predatory spangled perch (Leiopotherapon unicolor) or a non-predatory rain bowfish (Melanotaenia splendida) control. We found that fluoxetine and the presence of a predatory spangled perch did not interact to affect reproductive behaviour. We also found that, independent of a predatory threat, fluoxetine exposure altered male mating strategy, with males in the high treatment conducting significantly more coercive 'sneak' copulations, whereas the number of courtship displays performed was not significantly affected. Moreover, while fluoxetine exposure did not significantly affect the amount of time that males and females spent following one another, we found that females, but not males, followed a potential partner less when in the presence of the predatory fish. Finally, both sexes reacted to the risk of predation by spending less time in close proximity to a predator than a non-predator. In combination, our findings highlight the capacity of fluoxetine to influence processes of sexual selection at field-realistic concentrations and emphasise the importance of considering multiple stressors when assessing impacts of pharmaceutical pollutants on the behaviour of wildlife.

Signs of adaptation to trace metal contamination in a common urban bird	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lead exposure; Avian; Ecotoxicity; Local adaptation; Passer domesticus	DEVELOPMENTAL LEAD-EXPOSURE; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION; GENE-EXPRESSION; MARINE IGUANAS; INNER-EAR; AUSTRALIA; HEALTH; OPERATIONS; PATHWAY	Metals and metalloids at elevated concentrations can be toxic to both humans and wildlife. In particular, lead exposure can act as a stressor to wildlife and cause negative effects on fitness. Any ability to adapt to stress caused by the negative effects of trace metal exposure would be beneficial for species living in contaminated environments. However, mechanisms for responding adaptively to metal contamination are not fully understood in free-living organisms. The Australian populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) provides an excellent opportunity to study potential adaptation to environmental lead contamination because they have a commensal relationship with humans and are distributed broadly across Australian settlements including many long-term mining and smelting communities. To examine the potential for an evolutionary response to long-term lead exposure, we collected genomic SNP data using the house sparrow 200 K SNP array, from 11 localities across the Australian distribution including two mining sites (Broken Hill and Mount Isa, which are two genetically independent populations) that have well-established elevated levels of lead contamination as well as trace metals and metalloids. We contrast these known contaminated locations to other lesser-contaminated environments. Using an ecological association genome scan method to identify genomic differentiation associated with estimates of lead contamination we identified 60 outlier loci across three tests. A total of 39 genes were found to be physically linked (within 20 kbps) of all outliers in the house sparrow reference genome. The linked candidate genes included 12 genes relevant to lead exposure, such as two metal transporters that can transport metals including lead and zinc across cell membranes. These candidate genes provide targets for follow up experiments comparing resilience to lead exposure between populations exposed to varied levels of lead contamination. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing the impact of long-term changes in climate and atmospheric deposition on a shallow alpine lake from southeast Tibet	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Atmospheric deposition; Climate warming; Catchment erosion; Lake-water TOC; Nitrogen stable isotope; Algae	ANTHROPOGENIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION; ASIAN MONSOON; ICE-CORE; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; REACTIVE NITROGEN; MOUNTAIN LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; SEDIMENTS; HOLOCENE; TRENDS	Regional warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition have been widely recorded to impact remote catchments and alpine lakes; however, their independent roles and interactions have rarely been identified. Here, we combined down-core analyses of sedimentary mercury (Hg) and aluminum (Al) with multiple proxies (i.e. nitrogen stable isotope, chlorophyll a pigments, diatoms) for a radiometrically-dated sediment core of an alpine lake in southeast Tibet to track the atmospheric deposition of pollutants, and to examine possible effects of climate and catchment forcing over the past three centuries. The sediment data revealed that airborne deposition of Hg was recorded from the similar to 1860s, with an accelerating increase in anthropogenic Hg flux since the similar to 1960s. A synchronous decrease in reconstructed lake-water TOC indicated that acid deposition may have affected lake-water carbon concentrations and impaired catchment export of decomposed organic matter (OM). A moderate depletion of bulk sediment delta N-15 started from the similar to 1820s, but was followed by an enriching trend after the similar to 1970s. This positive shift of delta N-15 was associated with elevated sedimentOMand decreased catchment runoff of clastic materials (as inferred by Al). Sediment OM content displayed an accelerating increase from the similar to 1960s, with an increased input of autochthonous sources (i.e. lower bulk sediment C: N ratios), such as algae (as inferred by sedimentary chlorophyll a pigments). Meanwhile, climate warming and decreased lake-water TOC enhanced the production of algae, which was characterized by a more enriched delta N-15 signal than that of allochthonousOM. Furthermore, atmospheric acid deposition was significantly related to diatom assemblage changes, with an increase in acidophilous taxa. Our sediment evidence revealed the dominating impact of climate and catchment processes on lake-water chemistry and algal shifts in the context of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, and highlighted an increasing link of external forcing with in-lake processes in enriching sediment delta N-15 signal over the last few decades.

The lack of standardized methods to identify and quantify microplastics in soils is an obstacle to research. Existing techniques are time-consuming and field data are seldom collected. To tackle the problem, we explored the possibilities of using a portable spectroradiometer working in the near infrared range (350-2500 nm) to rapidly assess microplastic concentrations in soils without extraction. Four sets of artificially polluted soil samples were prepared. Three sets had only one polymer polluting the soil (low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polyvinyl chloride (PVC)). The fourth set contained random amounts of the three polymers (Mix). The concentrations of microplastics were regressed on the reflectance observed for each of the 2150 wavelengths registered by the instrument, using a Bayesian approach. For a measurement range between 1 and 100 g kg(-1), results showed a root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) of 8, 18, and 10 g kg(-1) for LDPE, PET, and PVC. The Mix treatment presented an RMSD of 8, 10, and 5 g kg(-1) for LDPE, PET, and PVC. The repeatability of the proposed method was 0.2-8.4, 0.1-5.1, and 0.1-9.0 g kg(-1) for LDPE, PET, and PVC, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that vis-NIR techniques are suitable to identify and quantify LDPE, PET, and PVC microplastics in soil samples, with a 10 g kg(-1) accuracy and a detection limit approximate to 15 g kg(-1). The method proposed is different than other approaches since it is faster because it avoids extraction steps and can directly quantify the amount of plastic in a sample. Nevertheless, it seems to be useful only for pollution hotspots. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Fluxes were measured using closed incubation chambers connected to a CRDS analyzer. They were performed during low tide at light, in the dark, and in the dark after having removed the top 1-2 mm of soil, which may contain biofilm. CO2 and CH4 fluxes ranged from 31.34 to 187.48 mmol m(-2) day(-1) and from 39.36 to 428.09 mu mol m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Both CO2 and CH4 emissions showed a strong seasonal variability with higher fluxes measured during the warm season, due to an enhanced production of these two gases within the soil. Furthermore, CO2 fluxes were higher in the dark than at light, evidencing photosynthetic processes at the soil surface and thus the role of biofilm in the regulation of greenhouse gasemissions from mangrove soils. The mean delta(13) C-CO2 value of the CO2 fluxes measured was -19.76 +/- 1.19%, which was depleted compared to the one emitted by root respiration (-22.32 +/- 1.06%), leaf litter decomposition (-21.43 +/- 1.89%) and organic matter degradation (-22.33 +/- 1.82%). This result confirmed the use of the CO2 produced within the soil by the biofilm developing at its surface. After removing the top 1-2 mm of soil, both CO2 and CH4 fluxes increased. Enhancement of CH4 fluxes suggests that biofilm may act as a physical barrier to the transfer of GHG from the soil to the atmosphere. However, the delta C-13-CO2 became more enriched, evidencing that the biofilm was not integrally removed, and that its partial removal resulted in physical disturbance that stimulated CO2 production. Therefore, this study provides useful information to understand the global implication of mangroves in climate change mitigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The potential toxicity of these burdens was evaluated by calculation of toxic equivalents (TEQs). Concentrations of total PAHs (Sigma PAHs) were significantly greater in blacktip and bonnethead sharks than bull sharks in liver, but did not exhibit differences in muscle among species. Hepatic concentrations of Sigma PAHs in these sharks (range ofmeans: 1560-2200 ng/gwetwt.) were greater than concentrations previously reported in oysters from Galveston Bay (range of means: 134-333 ng/g dry wt.), which suggests that trophic dilution of PAHs may not be reflected in sharks. Total PCBs (Sigma PCBs) were significantly greatest in bull sharks and lowest in bonnetheads, while blacktips were intermediate to these species. EROD activity was greater in bonnetheads than the other species, whereas GST activity was significantly higher in blacktips and bonnetheads than in bull sharks. Integration of hepatic burdens with biomarker activity via constrained multivariate analysis found correlations for only a small number of individual PAH/PCB congeners. Hepatic TEQ measurements suggest potential physiological effects of these burdens compared to established TEQ thresholds for other taxa, although the likelihood of similar effects in sharks requires further study and the inclusion of toxic endpoints. Our findings indicate that sharks may be prone to the accumulation of PAHs and PCBs, which may result in negative health outcomes for these cartilaginous fishes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Strontium in fin whale baleen: A potential tracer of mysticete movements across the oceans?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sr; Balaenoptera physalus; Keratin; North Atlantic Ocean; Marine mammals; Baleen plates	NORTH-ATLANTIC; HUMAN HAIR; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; ISOTOPE RATIOS; MINKE WHALES; BALAENOPTERA-PHYSALUS; SEAWATER; WATER; METALS; ACUTOROSTRATA	Strontium is a metal broadly distributed in oceanic waters, where its concentrations follow gradients mainly driven by oceanographic and biological factors. Studies on terrestrial vertebrates show that Sr can accumulate in mammalian hair in amounts mainly related to the external environment, a property that has been scarcely investigated in aquatic mammals. Cetaceans are marine mammals whose skin is generally hairless, but the species belonging to the mysticete group feed through a filtering apparatus made of keratinous baleen plates that, like hair, grow continuously. During their annual latitudinal migrations, mysticetes cross water masses with variable chemo-physical characteristics that may be reflected in these tissues. In the present study, baleen plates were sampled from 10 fin whales obtained from NW Spain (N = 5) and SW Iceland (N = 5) to investigate Sr concentrations along the plates growth axis. Samples were taken longitudinally at regular 1 cm-intervals on each plate. Sr concentrations, determined through mass spectrometry, ranged from 5 to 40 mg kg(-1) and increased from proximal to distal positions along plates. These results suggest a progressive adsorption of Sr on the plate surface, a process that also occurs in mammalian hair. Increasing trends were similar in the two regions but overall concentrations were significantly higher in NW Spain, reflecting different Sr baseline concentrations in the two areas and indicating isolation between the two whale populations. Some oscillations in Sr longitudinal trends were also detected, likely indicating that whales migrate across water masses with different Sr baselines. These results suggest that Sr concentrations in keratinous tissues of marine mammals can be used as ecological tracers of their migrations and habitat use. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial trends in congenital malformations and stream water chemistry in Southern Brazil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agricultural output; Pesticide; Organochlorine; Chloride; Congenital anomaly; Spatial analysis	ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; DDT; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; DEFECTS; MOTHERS; DIOXINS	The incidence of variable congenital malformation (CM) among 399 municipalities in the state of Parana, southern Brazil, suggests the etiological role of environmental factors. This study examined a) environmental concentrations of chlorine anions (Cl-) associated with organochlorines (OCs) and b) associations between these chemicals and agricultural output with CMs using a geographical information system. In one of the three years during the sampling period (2008, 2009 or 2010) Cl-, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p, p'-DDE), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p'-DDD), and endosulfan levels were measured in 465 (465/736, 63%) catchment basins. Agricultural outputs for crops during 2006-2010 were also evaluated (t/km(2)). Further, CM kernel density for the 399 municipalities in Parana during 2007-2014 was investigated. Cl- levels increased significantly in one of the three years (2008, 2009 or 2010) in western catchment basins, compared to 1996 (p < 0.0001). The municipalities were divided according to the obtained Cl- levels, where sub-region C2 (central-southern) < 1.8mg/L <= sub-regions C1 (northern-western) and C3 (eastern-southern). We identified 8756 cases of CMs among 1,221,287 newborns (NB) in all sub-regions. C1 had higher DDT-DDE-DDD (p,p'-DDT + p,p'-DDE + p,p'-DDD) concentrations, agricultural output, and CM kernel density. C2 and C3 had minor agricultural outputs (per square kilometer) and CM densities. A 2.96 mg/L increase in Cl- between sub-regions C1 and C2 was co-localized with a 45% increase in CM density (spatial relative risk = 1.45, CI 95%: 1.36-1.55). C1 had the highest log likelihood ratios (p = 0.001) identified via SaTScan clustering analyses. Organochlorines and other toxic chlorinated chemicals may contribute to CMs in humans, and these chemicals are ultimately transformed and release Cl- in rivers. Higher Cl- levels were correlated significantly with higher agricultural productivity, DDT-DDE-DDD levels, and CMs in some parts of the northern and western sub-regions (C1).

Spatial mismatch in fish and coral loss following 2016 mass coral bleaching	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Great Barrier Reef; Coral bleaching; Acropora; Damselfish; Cyanobacteria	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; SITE FIDELITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT DEGRADATION; INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; HOMING BEHAVIOR; HOME-RANGE; MORTALITY; ASSEMBLAGES	Record-breaking temperatures between 2015 and 2016 led to unprecedented pan-tropical bleaching of scleractinian corals. On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the effects were most pronounced in the remote, northern region, where over 90% of reefs exhibited bleaching. Mass bleaching that results in widespread coral mortality represents a major disturbance event for reef organisms, including reef fishes. Using 133 replicate 1 m(2) quadrats, we quantified short-term changes in coral communities and spatially associated reef fish assemblages, at Lizard Island, Australia, in response to the 2016 mass bleaching event. Quadrats were spatially matched, permitting repeated sampling of fish and corals in the same areas: before, during and 6 months after mass bleaching. As expected, we documented a significant decrease in live coral cover. Subsequent decreases in fish abundance were primarily driven by coral-associated damselfishes. However, these losses, were relatively minor (37% decrease), especially compared to the magnitude of Acropora loss (>95% relative decrease). Furthermore, at a local, 1 m(2) scale, we documented a strong spatial mismatch between fish and coral loss. Post-bleaching fish losses were not highest in quadrats that experienced the greatest loss of live coral. Nor were fish losses associated with a proliferation of cyanobacteria. Several sites did, however, exhibit increases in fish abundance suggesting substantial spatial movements. These results challenge common assumptions and emphasize the need for caution when ascribing causality to observed patterns of fish loss at larger spatial scales. Our results highlight the potential for short-term resilience to climate change, in fishes, through local migration and habitat plasticity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This calls for comprehensive management strategies to counteract, or even prevent, long-termimpacts on habitats and their biodiversity, as well as on their ecological functions and services. The basis for the efficient management and effective conservation of any ecosystem is sufficient knowledge on the state of the system and its response to external influence factors. In freshwater ecosystems, state information is currently drawn from ecological assessments at the reach or site scale. While these assessments are essential, they are not sufficient to assess the expected outcome of different river restoration strategies, because they do not account for important characteristics of the whole river network, such as habitat connectivity or headwater reachability. This is of particular importance for the spatial prioritization of restoration measures. River restoration could be supported best by integrative catchment-scale ecological assessments that are sensitive to the spatial arrangement of river reaches and barriers. Assessments at this scale are of increasing interest to environmental managers and conservation practitioners to prioritize restoration measures or to locate areas worth protecting. We present an approach based on decision support methods that integrates abiotic and biotic ecological assessments at the reach-scale and aggregates them spatially to describe the ecological state of entire catchments. This aggregation is based on spatial criteria that represent important ecological catchment properties, such as fish migration potential, resilience, fragmentation and habitat diversity in a spatially explicit way. We identify the most promising assessment criteria from different alternatives based on theoretical considerations and a comparison with biological indicators. Potential applications are discussed, particularly for supporting the strategic, long-term planning and spatial prioritization of restoration measures. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Our study evaluated the association between ambient PM2.5 concentration and preterm births in Beijing, China. Daily preterm birth data were collected from a hospital in Beijing during 2006 to 2013; a time-series of daily PM2.5 concentrations during the same period is assembled with measured data at three monitoring sites in Beijing. An extension of the Poisson regression and a time-series model were applied to simultaneously estimate the acute and chronic effects of exposure to PM2.5, with mutual adjustment for short- and long-term exposure as well as for confounders. During the study period, the PM2.5 concentration was 70.4 +/- 60.6 mu g/m(3) and was found to be associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. In the study cohort, a 0.52% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.09%, 0.96%) and 3.13% (95% CI: 1.92%, 4.35%) increase in preterm births was estimated for each 10-mu g/m(3) increase in short-and long-term exposure, respectively. This association was significantly modified by season (p < 0.05). With mutual adjustments for short- and long-term exposure, a more robust association (3.16%, 95% CI: 1.95%, 4.39%; per 10-mu g/m(3) increment in PM2.5) was observed for chronic effects. The exposure-response relationships for both short- and long-term exposure were linear, without a threshold, over the relatively low exposure range and flattened out at higher concentration levels. The maximum effect for long-term exposure to PM2.5 (33.6%) was much greater than that for short-term exposure (19.9%). These findings indicate that air quality improvements over a long period could yield significant health benefits. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Impact of the widespread pharmaceutical pollutant fluoxetine on behaviour and sperm traits in a freshwater fish	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Animal behaviour; Antidepressant; Behavioural syndrome; Anxiety; Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; Reproduction; Sexual selection	MOSQUITOFISH GAMBUSIA-HOLBROOKI; SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; SIAMESE FIGHTING FISH; FEMALE MATE CHOICE; EASTERN MOSQUITOFISH; BETTA-SPLENDENS; ANTIDEPRESSANT PHARMACEUTICALS; POECILIA-RETICULATA; DISPERSAL TENDENCY; SEXUAL SELECTION	Pharmaceutical pollutants are detected in aquatic habitats and wildlife tissues globally. One widespread contaminant of major concern is the antidepressant fluoxetine, which can affect behavioural and physiological processes in non-target species. Despite this, effects of fluoxetine on wildlife behaviour have seldom been investigated across multiple fitness-related contexts, especially at environmentally realistic concentrations. Accordingly, we examined impacts of 35-day fluoxetine exposure at two environmentally relevant concentrations (31 and 374 ng/L) across a suite of fitness-related contexts in wild-caught male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). First, we investigated anxiety-related behaviours (boldness, exploration and activity) in a novel environment (maze arena) and found no significant impacts of exposure. Second, we tested effects of fluoxetine in a reproductive context, including mating behaviour and sperm quality. We found that, relative to controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in males spending a greater amount of time pursuing females. Further, low-exposed males were more likely to attempt copulation than unexposed males. Lastly, we investigated across-context behavioural correlations, and how fluoxetine exposure might affect such relationships. A significant positive correlation was detected in control fish between activity levels in the maze and time spent pursuing females in the reproductive assay. This relationship was disrupted by fluoxetine at both exposure levels. This is the first evidence that field-detected concentrations of a pharmaceutical pollutant can disturb across-context behavioural correlations in wildlife. Our findings provide clear evidence that fluoxetine can produce context-specific behavioural effects in fish and underscore how pharmaceutical exposure at field-detected concentrations can induce important shifts in wildlife behaviour.

However, compared with carbon (C) stock, little is known about the size and spatial distribution of permafrost N stock. By combining measurements from 519 pedons with two machine learning models (supporting vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)), we estimated the size and spatial distribution of N stock across the Tibetan alpine permafrost region. We then compared these spatially-explicit N estimates with simulated N stocks from the Community Land Model (CLM). We found that N density (N amount per area) in the top three meters was 1.58 kg N m(-2) (interquartile range: 1.40-1.76) across the study area, constituting a total of 1802 Tg N (interquartile range: 1605-2008), decreasing from the southeast to the northwest of the plateau. N stored below 1 m accounted for 48% of the total N stock in the top three meters. CLM4.5 significantly underestimated the N stock on the Tibetan Plateau, primarily in areas with arid/semi-arid climate. The process of biological N fixation played a key role in the underestimation of N stock prediction. Overall, our study highlights that it is imperative to improve the simulation of N processes and permafrost N stocks in land models to better predict ecological consequences induced by rapid and widespread permafrost degradation.

Impact of sediment dredging on sediment phosphorus flux in a restored riparian wetland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Legacy phosphorus; Water quality; Wetland restoration; Area of concern	FRESH-WATER WETLANDS; INTERNAL PHOSPHORUS; HYDROLOGIC RECONNECTION; RETENTION CAPACITY; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; RELEASE; RESTORATION; INTERFACE; EXCHANGE; SHALLOW	Many riverine wetlands have been drained for the creation of agricultural land; however, global declines in freshwater biodiversity have begun to motivate wetland restoration projects around the world. Legacy phosphorus (P) increases the risk that wetland restoration may liberate excess P to the water column and connecting waterbodies, resulting in a trade-off of restored habitat for degraded water quality. To avoid this trade-off, we dredged a former agricultural parcel prior to hydrologic reconnection, and evaluated restoration success by comparing sediment P dynamics before and after dredging. First, results from P adsorption isotherm experiments suggested that after dredging, the sediment would act as a sink for dissolved P only when water column soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations exceeded 40 mu g L-1. Additionally, the dredging depth (similar to 1 m on average) exposed sedimentwith significantly reduced P sorption capacities. Second, P release ratesweremeasured in sediment cores that were incubated under two water temperatures (ambient; + 2 degrees C) and two oxygen levels (oxic; hypoxic). Average maximumtotal phosphorus (TP) release rates ranged from 40 to 85 mgm(-2) d(-1) before dredging and from 0 to 7 mg m(-2) d(-1) after dredging, resulting in a 95-99% reduction in TP release rates after dredging. Similar reductions were measured also for SRP release rates. The significant reduction in sediment P release after dredging now creates a high potential for this restored wetland to reduce net P loads into downstream waters by facilitating the deposition and burial of particulate P. We conclude that sediment dredging can be a useful technique for balancing the goals of habitat restoration and water quality improvements in wetlands restored on former agricultural lands.

Metal concentration is influenced by various species-specific physiological and ecological traits, including individual diet composition and foraging habitat. The impact of trophic ecology and habitat preference on Hg accumulation was analyzed through total Hg concentration and stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in the muscle of 132 fish belonging to 23 different species from the Senegalese coast (West Africa), where the marine ecosystem is submitted to nutrient inputs from various sources such as upwelling or rivers. Species-specific ecological traits were first investigated and results showed that vertical (i.e. water column distribution) and horizontal habitat (i.e. distance from the coast) led to differential Hg accumulation among species. Coastal and demersal fish were more contaminated than offshore and pelagic species. Individual characteristics therefore revealed an increase of Hg concentration in muscle that paralleled trophic level for some locations. Considering all individuals, the main carbon source was significantly correlated with Hg concentration, again revealing a higher accumulation for fish foraging in nearshore and benthic habitats. The large intraspecific variability observed in stable isotope signatures highlights the need to conduct ecotoxicological studies at the individual level to ensure a thorough understanding of mechanisms driving metal accumulation in marine fish. For individuals from a same species and site, Hg variation was mainly explained by fish length, in accordance with the bioaccumulation of Hg over time. Finally, Hg concentrations in fish muscle are discussed regarding their human health impact. No individual exceeded the current maximum acceptable limit for seafood consumption set by both the European Union and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. However, overconsumption of some coastal demersal species analyzed here could be of concern regarding human exposure to mercury. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Local climate heat-wave scenarios show an increase of its mean intensity close to 2 degrees C (reaching temperatures of up to 38.8 degrees C) and an average increase of the maximum intensity of 3.6 degrees C (temperature of up to 41.5 degrees C) with respect to a historic period (1971-2000) for the RCP8.5 scenario at the end of the century. The duration of heat waves will increase by 7 days at the end of the century (total average duration of 12 days). The future intensity and duration of cold-wave episodes will remain stable. Local climate change scenarios for daily maximum temperatures show a gradual increase throughout the 21st century. The greatest increases will occur during the summer at the end of the century, reaching values of up to 7 degrees C for the RCP 8.5 scenario. The minimum temperature increases show similar behaviours to the maximum temperatures, but with less marked increases (3 degrees C and 5.6 degrees C for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively in summer at the end of the century). The highest temperatures and the intensity of the heat waves will be especially intense in the Ebro Valley, the most populated area. In addition, the Pyrenees will suffer the longest heat waves, especially at the end of the century, and the greatest increases in maximum temperatures. The downscaling of the CMIP5 models, offers accurate scenarios-both spatially and temporally-of extreme temperatures and heat and cold waves, useful for decision-making for local adaptation to climate change but also as a reference for other European regions.

Spatiotemporal Bayesian modeling of West Nile virus: Identifying risk of infection in mosquitoes with local-scale predictors	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Spatiotemporal; West Nile; Vector-borne disease; Arboviral; Bayesian; Local variables	CULEX-PIPIENS DIPTERA; LAND-COVER DATABASE; UNITED-STATES; NEW-YORK; VARIABLE SELECTION; AEDES-ALBOPICTUS; ABUNDANCE; CULICIDAE; DISEASE; TRANSMISSION	Monitoring and control of West Nile virus(WNV) presents a challenge to state and local vector control managers. Models of mosquito presence and viral incidence have revealed that variations in mosquito autecology and land use patterns introduce unique dynamics of disease at the scale of a county or city, and that effective prediction requires locally parameterized models. We applied Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling to West Nile surveillance data from 49 mosquito trap sites in Nassau County, New York, from 2001 to 2015 and evaluated environmental and sociological predictors of West Nile virus incidence in Culex pipiens-restuans. A Bayesian spike-and-slab variable selection algorithm was used to help select influential independent variables. This method can be used to identify locally-important predictors. The best model predicted West Nile positives well, with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.83 on holdout data. The temporal trend was nonlinear and increased throughout the year. The spatial component identified increased West Nile incidence odds in the northwestern portion of the county, with lower odds in wetlands on the south shore of Long Island. High Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) areas, wetlands, and areas of high urban development had negative associations with WNV incidence. In this study we demonstrate a method for improving spatiotemporal models of West Nile virus incidence for decision making at the county and community scale, which empowers disease and vector control organizations to prioritize and evaluate prevention efforts.

Mixed forests can be more resilient to extreme events, but are the individual trees in mixed forests also more resilient to drought? Methods: We sampled 275 trees in 53 temperate forest stands in northern Belgium: monocultures, two-species mixtures, and the three-species mixture of Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur, and Q. rubra. We related the annual basal area increment of individual trees to drought severity from 1955 to 2015 and calculated growth resistance, recovery, and resilience for six contrasting drought episodes (spring, summer, or full-year drought). Results: Tree growth of the diffuse-porous F. sylvatica was more sensitive to drought, summer drought in particular. The ring-porous Q. robur and Q. rubra were mainly affected by spring drought. In general, a tree's growth response to drought was not affected by tree species diversity, but some identity effects emerged. Conclusion: The asynchrony in drought responses among the tree species (a large and immediate decrease in growth followed by swift recovery in F. sylvatica vs a smaller delayed response in Quercus) might stabilize productivity in forests in which both are present. The impact of the predicted increasing drought frequency will depend on the timing of the droughts (spring vs summer). (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Factors controlling sediment and nutrient fluxes in a small microtidal salt marsh within the Venice Lagoon	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nutrient fluxes; Sediment fluxes; Salt marshes; Lagoon	TIDAL WETLAND; SEA-LEVEL; ESTUARY; MODEL; BAY	Coastal salt marshes are among the Earth's most productive ecosystems and provide a number of ecosystem services. Water quality regulation by storing, transforming and releasing nutrients, organic matter and suspended sediment is recognized as one of the most important functions of salt marshes. The self-purification capacity of intertidal ecosystems contributes to mitigating nutrient inputs, acting as a buffer zone between watersheds and coastal waters, especially in relation to climate change and the increasing frequency of impulsive extreme events. Understanding sediment and nutrient fluxes and assessing the mechanisms that control them are valuable for the preservation and future restoration of salt marshes and for enhancing their effectiveness in providing water quality regulation services. To investigate the main driving factors in microtidal environments, changes in suspended sediment and nutrient concentrations were measured during several tidal cycles in a small microtidal reconstructed salt marsh in the Venice Lagoon, which was selected as the experimental site. The tidal amplitude, nutrients and total suspended solid concentrations were measured during 6 tidal cycles between September 2011 and October 2013. The water discharge was derived by forcing the hydrodynamic MIKE-DHI numerical model with the measured tidal levels. Fluxes were assessed by coupling field data with the calculated discharges. The salt marsh filtering function was related to the inflow matter concentrations and tidal amplitude. When high suspended solid and nutrient concentrations enter the salt marsh, accumulation processes prevail on release. In contrast, in the case of low concentrations and high tidal excursion, the salt marsh functions as a nutrient and sediment source. During all campaigns, the nitrogen removal function was more effective within the intertidal vegetated areas. Sediment release was the dominant process in the outermost creek, whereas sedimentation prevailed in the inner area of the salt marsh because of the attenuation of hydrodynamic forcing during tide propagation.

Deriving nutrient criteria to support 'good' ecological status in European lakes: An empirically based approach to linking ecology and management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Eutrophication; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Nitrogen; Macrophytes; Water Framework Directive	SHALLOW LAKES; SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES; ASSESSING EUTROPHICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; VEGETATION ABUNDANCE; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; LOADING REDUCTIONS; SURFACE WATERS; CHLOROPHYLL-A; DANISH LAKES	European water policy has identified eutrophication as a priority issue for water management. Substantial progress has been made in combating eutrophication but open issues remain, including setting reliable and meaningful nutrient criteria supporting 'good' ecological status of the Water Framework Directive. The paper introduces a novel methodological approach - a set of four different methods - that can be applied to different ecosystems and stressors to derive empirically-based management targets. The methods include Ranged Major Axis (RMA) regression, multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, logistic regression, and minimising the mismatch of classifications. We apply these approaches to establish nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) criteria for the major productive shallow lake types of Europe: high alkalinity shallow (LCB1; mean depth 3-15 m) and very shallow (LCB2; mean depth < 3 m) lakes. Univariate relationships between nutrients and macrophyte assessments explained 29-46% of the variation. Multivariate models with both total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) as predictors had higher R-2 values (0.50 for LCB1 and 0.49 for LCB2) relative to the use of TN or TP singly. We estimated nutrient concentrations at the boundary where lake vegetation changes from 'good' to 'moderate' ecological status. LCB1 lakes achieved 'good' macrophyte status at concentrations below 48-53 mu g/l TP and 1.1-1.2 mg/l TN, compared to LCB2 lakes below 58-78 mu g/l TP and 1.0-1.4 mg/l TN. Where strong regression relationships exist, regression approaches offer a reliable basis for deriving nutrient criteria and their uncertainty, while categorical approaches offer advantages for risk assessment and communication, or where analysis is constrained by discontinuous measures of status or short stressor gradients.

Trace metal characterization and fluxes from the Guadiana, Tinto-Odiel and Guadalquivir estuaries to the Gulf of Cadiz	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Riverine inputs; Biogeochemical cycles; Metal; Gibraltar Strait; Pollution; Land uses	FRESH-WATER; HEAVY-METALS; SW SPAIN; SOUTHWESTERN SPAIN; IBERIAN PENINSULA; MEDITERRANEAN-SEA; SCHELDT ESTUARY; COASTAL WATERS; NORTHERN GULF; SALT-MARSHES	Metals transported into the coastal zone by the South Iberian rivers are key to understand the biogeochemical cycles and distribution of trace elements in the Gulf of Cadiz (GoC hereinafter) and the exchange with the Mediterranean Sea. Previous studies carried out in the 80s have suggested that metal enrichment in the Alboran Sea (Western Mediterranean) is related with fluvial inputs from acid mine drainage from the Tinto and Odiel rivers. The present study evaluates the contribution of dissolved trace metal concentrations (i.e. Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) from the three main rivers discharging into the GoC (i.e. Guadiana, Tinto-Odiel and Guadalquivir rivers). Our results show that the metal composition of water discharged from each river is impacted by the activities developed in the course of the rivers, which clearly influence the GoC coastal surface waters composition. Metal fluxes from the Guadalquivir river are quantitatively higher than those from the Tinto-Odiel (e.g. up to 73% and 19% higher for Ni and Cu, respectively). Although the metal concentrations spatial distributions in the GoC are dominated by the circulation pattern between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, the concentrations within the GoC continental shelf could be explained by a greater contribution from the Guadalquivir estuary (e.g. 80.5%, 54.6%, 56.5% and 56.6% for Ni, Cu, Mo, and V respectively).

While many cities are expanding vertically, such models typically ignore the vertical dimension. Methods: Wetook integrated measurements of NO2 at up to three different floors on the facades of 25 buildings in the mid-sized European city of Basel, Switzerland. We quantified the decrease in NO2 concentration with increasing height at each facade over two 14-day periods in different seasons. Using predictors of traffic load, population density and street configuration, we built conventional land use regression (LUR) models which predicted ground floor concentrations. We further evaluated which predictors best explained the vertical decay rate. Ultimately, we combined ground floor and decay models to explain the measured concentrations at all heights. Results: We found a clear decrease in mean nitrogen dioxide concentrations between measurements at ground level and those at higher floors for both seasons. The median concentration decrease was 8.1% at 10 m above street level in winter and 10.4% in summer. The decrease with height was sharper at buildings where high concentrations were measured on the ground and in canyon-like street configurations. While the conventional ground floor model was able to explain ground floor concentrations with a model R-2 of 0.84 (RMSE 4.1 mu g/m(3)), it predicted measured concentrations at all heights with an R-2 of 0.79 (RMSE 4.5 mu g/m(3)), systematically overpredicting concentrations at higher floors. The LUR model considering vertical decay was able to predict ground floor and higher floor concentrations with a model R-2 of 0.84 (RMSE 3.8 mu g/m(3)) and without systematic bias. Discussion: Height above the ground is a relevant determinant of outdoor residential exposure, even inmedium-sized European cities without much high-rise. It is likely that conventional LUR models overestimate exposure for residences at higher floors near major roads. This overestimation can be minimized by considering decay with height.

In this work, we addressed methodological aspects of the measurement of coral growth variables and the implications of their variability. A core of Orbicella faveolata was collected from the Puerto Morelos coral reef, in the Mexican Caribbean, and we measured and analysed 10 parallel transects of a core slab, covering 30 years. Density calibration was performed by measuring a high-quality and well-characterised wedge of Tridacna maxima, and the interval of interest was adjusted to the measured coral optical densities. The measurement uncertainties of extension rate, density and calcification rate were 0.011%, 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively. However, for density and calcification rate, overall variability was 29% and 33%, respectively, of which about half was attributed to intra-band growth variability. The intra-band variability of extension rate was only 0.68%, indicating the suitability of extension rate as a precise environmental proxy. These results likely differ by coral species, environments and experimental conditions, such as the exact location of the core within the colony and the method used to determine density. Uncertainties of coral growth variables should be carefully considered when reconstructing past environmental conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of buffer strip width and selective logging on streamside plant communities	BMC ECOLOGY			English	Article						Biodiversity; Conservation; Forest management; Mosses; Selective logging; Vascular plants; Woodland key habitats	BOREAL FOREST; MICROCLIMATIC GRADIENTS; NORTHERN EUROPE; RIPARIAN; VEGETATION; MANAGEMENT; RETENTION; HABITAT	BackgroundRiparian forests surrounding streams host high biodiversity values, but are threatened by clear-cut logging. Narrow buffer strips of about 15m are commonly left between the stream and the clear-cut, but studies suggest that the buffer width should be at least 30m to protect riparian plant communities. Moreover, selective logging is often allowed on the buffer strips in order to increase economic gain. We used an experiment of 43 riparian sites where buffer strip width and selective logging within the strip were manipulated and supplemented with unlogged control sites. We report the short-term changes in the community composition of vascular plants and mosses near the stream (0-15m distance).Results15-meter buffers are not enough to protect the vascular plant communities from changes caused by a clear-cut irrespective of the selective logging on the buffer strip. For moss communities 15-m buffers were not enough if they were selectively logged. Relative to the control sites, we observed no significant changes in community composition of vascular plants or mosses in the sites with 30-m buffer strips, whether selectively logged or not.ConclusionsWe conclude that buffer strips of 15m are not sufficient to protect streamside plant communities even in the short term, but that buffers of 30m should be left on both sides of the stream. Selective logging appears not to have effects on buffers that are at least 30m wide. Thus, it may be more reasonable to increase buffer width and to allow selective logging on the wider buffer in order to compensate for the economic losses than to leave all trees on a narrow and ecologically insufficient buffer.

However, despite a vast body of literature, our understanding of how species' traits influence demographic vital rates in anthropogenically-modified habitats is remarkably scant. Such an understanding is crucial because vital rates determine population viability in modified habitats, and underlie emergent occupancy, abundance and community-level patterns. I used capture-recapture analyses to estimate variation in survival of birds in intact and logged tropical montane forest in the eastern Himalayas. In general, variation in body mass and alternative behavioral strategies (e.g., mixed-species flocking vs. solitary behavior) were not associated with survival differences in intact forest. However, year-round residents, and species that did not participate in mixed-species flocks had appreciably lower survival in logged forest compared with intact forest. Solitary foragers, for instance, faced a 30% decline in survival in logged forest compared with intact forest. Non-migratory habit and solitary foraging behavior might make species vulnerable to extinction in logged forest through reduced survival, an especially important process in influencing population viability. Identifying how species' traits modulate their response to land-use change is crucial to predict population responses to forest modification, and to better plan and manage biodiversity-friendly forest use.

Impact of "The Blob" and "El Nino" in the SW Baja California Peninsula: Plankton and Environmental Variability of Bahia Magdalena	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						The Blob; upwellings; nutrients; plankton biomass; phytoplankton structure	PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES; CHLOROPHYLL; PACIFIC; WATER; SEA; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; CLIMATE; DIATOMS; SYSTEM	Bahia Magdalena is a coastal lagoon with an enormous biological and fishing wealth; it is located in the Pacific coast of Baja California (Mexico), a transitional zone between tropical and temperate regions which is strongly affected by the global-scale climate phenomena. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of the unusual and consecutive warming events known as The Blob (TB2013-2015) and the 2015-2016 El Nino on the hydrological characteristics and plankton communities, the lower levels of the trophic web, from January 2015 to December 2017. This coastal lagoon lacks river runoff and primary producers depend on the upwelling's nutrient supply. The environmental variables analyzed were the upwelling index (PFEL-NOAA), the air and sea temperature, salinity, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a. The species composition, species richness and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index were used to describe some aspects of the phytoplankton community structure and its phenology. The biomass and mortality of zooplankton also were analyzed. The seasonal pattern of hydrology was described with data collected in nine sampling stations. An alternative approach used with both biological and environmental datasets was to select representative sampling stations located in the vicinity of the inlet and in the interior of the lagoon. Chla-fluorescence imagery collected by the MODIS-Aqua satellite was used as an indicator of phytoplankton abundance. Statistical analyses included bi- and multivariate parametric and non-parametric tests. Principal component analysis was used to describe the seasonality of hydrological data and the canonical correlation analysis to relate environmental and biological datasets. The increase of temperature at a global and local scale in 2015 had as consequence an atypical increase in the water temperature in the fall of 2015, coincident with the abrupt diminishing of upwelling strength and input of nutrients advected from the ocean. A recovery of these two variables was recorded in 2016 at the end of the El Nino. The most abundant group of phytoplankton species were diatoms. Algal blooms were composed by species adapted to high temperatures and nutrients depletion in 2015, while in 2016 and 2017 were composed by ruderal-strategist species and they were boosted by the nutrient pulses associated with the spring upwellings. The fall algal bloom, typical of subtropical coastal lagoons, was observed only in 2016 and it was confined to the interior of the lagoon where there are local inputs of nutrients. In 2015 and 2016 there was a succession of diatoms and dinoflagellates related to the rising of temperature while in 2017 this pattern changed because of the strong upwellings. The relationships of water temperature and silicate with a ratio of diatoms' cell abundance, was analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs), showing significant correlations but different trends in some years. The species richness of diatom blooms was high; on the other hand, species diversity increased at the end of spring and early summer. The seasonal pattern of zooplankton biomass showed changes along the 3 years, but the most noticeable was an increase during winter and early spring 2015 and the lack of the usual high values of June-July in 2017. The seasonal pattern of the phytoplankton abundance was different in comparison with the 1982-1983 El Nino while the zooplankton was similar among the three strongest El Nino. The changes we observed strongly suggest that the warming caused by those phenomena highly affected the upwelling strength, the length of the temperate and warm seasons and the hydrology. Phenology of phytoplankton and zooplankton changed after the strong perturbation under the El Nino, and possibly The Blob. The recovery of phytoplankton biomass began in 2017, but its taxonomic composition was not adequate to support the zooplankton recovery.

Climate Indices, Water Temperature, and Fishing Predict Broad Scale Variation in Fishes on Temperate Reefs	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						anthropogenic impacts; community assemblage; habitat; marine ecosystems; recreational fishing; temperate reef	LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEM; RECREATIONAL FISHERIES; ASSEMBLAGES; IMPACT; REORGANIZATION; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; VARIABLES; COLLAPSE	Determining what abiotic and biotic factors affect the diversity and abundance of species through time and space is a basic goal of ecology and an integral step in predicting current and future distributions. Given the pervasive effect of humans worldwide, including anthropogenic factors when quantifying community dynamics is needed to understand discrete and emergent effects of humans on marine ecosystems, especially systems with economically important species. However, there are limited studies that combine a large-scale ecological survey with multiple natural and anthropogenic factors to determine the drivers of community dynamics of temperate reef systems. We combined data from a 24-year fish survey on temperate reefs along the Southeast United States coast with information on recreational and commercial fisheries landings, surface and bottom temperature, habitat characteristics, and climate indices to determine what factors may alter the community structure of fishes within this large marine ecosystem. We found that both abundance and richness of temperate reef fishes declined from 1990 to 2013. Climate indices and local temperature explained the greatest variation, and recreational fishing explained slightly more variation compared to commercial fishing in the temperate reef fish community over a multi-decadal scale. When including habitat characteristics in a 3 year analysis, depth, and local temperature explained the greatest variation in fish assemblage, while the influence of habitat was comparatively minimal. Finally, the interaction between predictor variables and fish traits indicated that bigger and longer-lived fishes were positively correlated with depth and winter temperature. Our findings suggest that lesser-studied anthropogenic impacts, such as recreational fishing, may influence communities throughout large ecosystems as much as other well-studied impacts such as climate change and commercial fishing. In addition, climate indices should be considered when assessing changes, natural or anthropogenic, to fish communities.	[Geraldi, Nathan Robert; Kellison, G.

Disruptive coloration is a form of camouflage in which high-contrast patterns obscure internal features or break up an animal's outline. In particular, edge enhancement creates illusory, or 'fake' depth edges within the animal's body. Disruptive coloration often co-occurs with background matching, and together, these strategies make it difficult for an observer to visually segment an animal from its background. However, stereoscopic vision could provide a critical advantage in the arms race between perception and camouflage: the depth information provided by binocular disparities reveals the true three-dimensional layout of a scene, and might, therefore, help an observer to overcome the effects of disruptive coloration. Human observers located snake targets embedded in leafy backgrounds. We analysed performance (response time) as a function of edge enhancement, illumination conditions and the availability of binocular depth cues. We confirm that edge enhancement contributes to effective camouflage: observers were slower to find snakes whose patterning contains 'fake' depth edges. Importantly, however, this effect disappeared when binocular depth cues were available. Illumination also affected detection: under directional illumination, where both the leaves and snake produced strong cast shadows, snake targets were localized more quickly than in scenes rendered under ambient illumination. In summary, we show that illusory depth edges, created via disruptive coloration, help to conceal targets from human observers. However, cast shadows and binocular depth information improve detection by providing information about the true three-dimensional structure of a scene. Importantly, the strong interaction between disparity and edge enhancement suggests that stereoscopic vision has a critical role in breaking camouflage, enabling the observer to overcome the disruptive effects of edge enhancement.

In metazoans, a striking exception from strictly maternal inheritance of mitochondria is doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI). This unique system involves the maintenance of two highly divergent mtDNAs (F- and M-type, 8-40% of nucleotide divergence) associated with gametes, and occasionally coexisting in somatic tissues. To address whether metabolic differences underlie this condition, we characterized the OXPHOS activity of oocytes, spermatozoa, and gills of different species through respirometry. DUI species express different gender-linked mitochondrial phenotypes in gametes and partly in somatic tissues. The M-phenotype is specific to sperm and entails (i) low coupled/uncoupled respiration rates, (ii) a limitation by the phosphorylation system, and (iii) a null excess capacity of the final oxidases, supporting a strong control over the upstream complexes. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a phenotype resulting from direct selection on sperm mitochondria. This metabolic remodelling suggests an adaptive value of mtDNA variations and we propose that bearing sex-linked mitochondria could assure the energetic requirements of different gametes, potentially linking male-energetic adaptation, mitotype preservation and inheritance, as well as resistance to both heteroplasmy and ageing.

The effects of offspring sex on maternal longevity, however, have only been tested in humans. Human studies produced mixed results and considerable debate mainly owing to the difficulty of distinguishing the effects of sexual dimorphism from sociocultural factors. To advance this debate, we examined how the relative number of sons influenced maternal longevity in four species of free-living ungulates (Soay sheep Ovis aries; bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis; red deer, Cervus elaphus; mountain goat, Oreamnos americanus), with high male-biased sexual size dimorphism but without complicating sociocultural variables. We found no evidence for a higher cumulative cost of sons than of daughters on maternal longevity. For a given number of offspring, most females with many sons in all four populations lived longer than females with few sons. The higher cost of sons over daughters on maternal lifespan reported by some human studies may be the exception rather than the rule in long-lived iteroparous species.

Reefs are also bound by the natural biophysical environment within which they exist. In this context, a key challenge for effective management is understanding how anthropogenic and biophysical conditions interact to drive distinct coral reef configurations. Here, we use machine learning to conduct explanatory predictions on reef ecosystems defined by both fish and benthic communities. Drawing on the most spatially extensive dataset available across the Hawaiian archipelago-20 anthropogenic and biophysical predictors over 620 survey sites-we model the occurrence of four distinct reef regimes and provide a novel approach to quantify the relative influence of human and environmental variables in shaping reef ecosystems. Our findings highlight the nuances of what underpins different coral reef regimes, the overwhelming importance of biophysical predictors and how a reef's natural setting may either expand or narrow the opportunity space for management interventions. The methods developed through this study can help inform reef practitioners and hold promises for replication across a broad range of ecosystems.

Dispersal success is determined by the state of individuals at emigration and the costs incurred after emigration. However, quantification of such costs is often difficult, due to logistical constraints of following wide-ranging individuals. We investigated the effects of dispersal on individual body mass and stress hormone levels in a cooperative breeder, the meerkat (Suricata suricatta). We measured body mass and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations from 95 dispersing females in 65 coalitions through the entire dispersal process. Females that successfully settled lost body mass, while females that did not settle but returned to their natal group after a short period of time did not. Furthermore, dispersing females had higher fGCM levels than resident females, and this was especially pronounced during the later stages of dispersal. By adding information on the transient stage of dispersal and by comparing dispersers that successfully settled to dispersers that returned to their natal group, we expand on previous studies focusing on the earlier stages of dispersal. We propose that body mass and stress hormone levels are good indicators to investigate dispersal costs, as these traits often play an important role in mediating the effects of the environment on other life-history events and individual fitness.

For example, skin sloughing has been shown to reduce pathogen loads on the skin, such as the lethal fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), but interspecific variation in sloughing frequency is largely unknown. Using phylogenetic linear mixed models, we assessed the relationship between skin turnover rate, skin morphology, ecological traits and overall evidence of Bd-driven declines. We examined skin sloughing rates in 21 frog species from three continents, as well as structural skin characteristics measured from preserved specimens. We found that sloughing rate varies significantly with phylogenetic group, but was not associated with evidence of Bd-driven declines, or other skin characteristics examined. This is the first comparison of sloughing rate across a wide range of amphibian species, and creates the first database of amphibian sloughing behaviour. Given the strong phylogenetic signal observed in sloughing rate, approximate sloughing rates of related species may be predicted based on phylogenetic position. While not related to available evidence of declines, understanding variation in sloughing rate may help explain differences in the severity of infection in genera with relatively slow skin turnover rates (e.g. Atelopus).

The aim of the software is to improve the quality of metabolic rate estimates based on a straightforward pipeline: background respiration correction, detection of mechanical problems, conduction of QC tests, and filtration based on user-defined criteria. Abstract Intermittent-flow respirometry is widely used to measure oxygen uptake rates and subsequently estimate aerobic metabolic rates of aquatic animals. However, the lack of a standard quality-control software to detect technical problems represents a potential impediment to comparisons across studies in the field of evolutionary and conservation physiology. Here, we introduce FishResp', a versatile R package and its graphical implementation for quality-control and filtering of raw respirometry data. Our goal is to provide a straightforward, cross-platform and free software to help improve the quality and comparability of metabolic rate estimates for reducing methodological fragmentation in the field of aquatic respirometry. FishResp accepts data from various respirometry systems, allows users to detect potential mechanical problems which can occur during oxygen uptake measurements (e.g. chamber leaking, poor water circulation), and offers six options to correct raw data for microbial oxygen consumption. The software performs filtering of raw data based on user criteria, and produces accurate and unbiased estimates of absolute and mass-specific metabolic rates.

GCs elevated with food scarcity and correlated negatively with feeding time. Attenuated GCs in fragmented forest groups suggest a downregulated response to a chronically poor environment. Abstract Glucocorticoids are metabolic byproducts of animals' physiological responses to ecological or social challenges and are thought to represent an adaptive response allowing beneficial responses to short-term challenges. Glucocorticoid metabolites (GCs) can be assayed non-invasively through faeces and therefore can be a useful tool to gauge the health of populations experiencing natural and/or anthropogenic stressors. However, the response of GCs to anthropogenic stressors varies, with both higher and lower GC levels reported. Here, we describe variation in GC secretion within eight diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) groups across 1 year. These groups span a gradient of anthropogenic habitat disturbance, including groups in continuous forest (CONT') and disturbed fragments (FRAG'), and indicators of health suggest that FRAG groups are negatively impacted by habitat disturbance. We monitored phenology, used focal animal follows to quantify diet and collected faeces (n = 547) from which we quantified GC content using enzyme immunoassay. All groups showed elevated lean-season GCs, but with a single, brief peak. GCs were inversely correlated with feeding time. No overall effect of habitat (CONT vs. FRAG) was found, but the lean-season peak was significantly higher in CONT groups. There was a significant season*age-sex interaction; adult females had an attenuated lean-season response compared with groupmates. The observed lean-season challenge' is consistent with previous lemur studies, as well as mammals in general. Low and largely invariable GC levels in FRAG, within the context of observed health and nutritional declines, suggest that FRAG groups employ a strategy whereby the adrenal response to stressors is downregulated. More research is needed to contextualize our observations of GC variation and health on an individual level, both in terms of corroborating evidence for ecological and social stressors, and longer-term quantification of reproductive success and fitness.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a generalist aphidophagous coccinellid and an important natural enemy in many agroecosystems including orchards. Coccinellid species have been observed to consume non-prey food like nectar and pollen, but the value of these foods for A. bipunctata is poorly known. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different prey and non-prey diets on A. bipunctata larval development and adult longevity and fecundity. Larval development was studied on three prey diets: The aphids Dysaphis plantaginea and Myzus persicae and Lepidopteran eggs of Ephestia kuehniella; five flower diets: Matricaria chamomilla, Daucus carota, Fagopyrum esculentum, Anethum graveolens, and Sinapis alba; four pollen diets from three plant species: Typha angustifolia, Malus pumila (two varieties) and A. graveolens; and 1 M solutions of three sugars: glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Adult longevity and fecundity were tested on one prey diet (E. kuhniella eggs), three flower diets (F. esculentum, A. graveolens, and S. alba); the same four pollen diets and three sugar diets with larvae: and finally a mixed diet of sucrose and A. graveolens pollen. A water-only (starvation) control was used for both larval development and adult longevity and fecundity. Adult lipid content was assessed as a measure of how non-prey food affects the ladybeetles' nutritional status. Larvae did not develop beyond the first instar on any of the non-prey diets, but they lived more than twice as long as on F esculentum and sugar diets than on water. Sugar and flower diets improved A. bipunctata adult longevity (71-92 days and 10-66 days, respectively) over a pure pollen diet (6-7 days). Fecundity was nil on all non-prey diets, and within a normal range on E. kuhniella eggs. The results suggest that pure floral diets do not support A. bipunctata molting or reproduction, but flowering plants can prolong A. bipunctata larval survival and adults longevity considerably when prey are absent. Adults on sugar diets had high lipid content, indicating that sugar feeding can improve overwintering survival. The findings could be used in agroecosystem design, such as the composition of flower strips for optimal functional diversity.

Here we assess Hg concentrations in three commercial tuna species (bigeye, yellowfin, and albacore, n = 1000) from the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). Models were developed to map regional Hg variance and understand the main drivers. Mercury concentrations are enriched in southern latitudes (10 degrees S-20 degrees S) relative to the equator (0 degrees-10 degrees S) for each species, with bigeye exhibiting the strongest spatial gradients. Fish size is the primary factor explaining Hg variance but physical oceanography also contributes, with higher Hg concentrations in regions exhibiting deeper thermoclines. Tuna trophic position and oceanic primary productivity were of weaker importance. Predictive models perform well in the Central Equatorial Pacific and Hawaii, but underestimate Hg concentrations in the Eastern Pacific. A literature review from the global ocean indicates that size tends to govern tuna Hg concentrations, however regional information on vertical habitats, methylmercury production, and/or Hg inputs are needed to understand Hg distribution at a broader scale. Finally, this study establishes a geographical context of Hg levels to weigh the risks and benefits of tuna consumption in the WCPO.

Multi-Scale Phenology of Temperate Grasslands: Improving Monitoring and Management With Near-Surface Phenocams	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						phenology; phenocam; grassland; vegetation dynamics; remote sensing	DECIDUOUS BROADLEAF FOREST; DIGITAL CAMERA IMAGES; LAND-COVER CHANGE; VEGETATION PHENOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; REPEAT PHOTOGRAPHY; TIME-SERIES	Grasslands of the Australian Southern Tablelands represent a patchwork of native and exotic systems, occupying a continuum of C-3-dominated to C-4-dominated grasslands where composition depends on disturbance factors (e.g., grazing) and climate. Managing these complex landscapes is both challenging and critical for maintaining the security of Australia's pasture industries, and for protecting the biodiversity of native remnants. Differentiating C-3 from C-4 vegetation has been a prominent theme in remote sensing research due to distinct C-3/C-4 seasonal productivity patterns (phenology) and high uncertainty about how C-3/C-4 vegetation will respond to a changing climate. Phenology is used in northern hemisphere ecosystems for a range of purposes but has not been widely adopted in Australia, where dynamic climate often results in non-repetitive seasonal vegetation patterns. We employed time-lapse cameras (phenocams) to study the phenology of twelve grassland areas dominated by cool season (C-3) and warm season (C-4), native or exotic grasses near Canberra, Australia. Our aims were to assess phenological characteristics of the functional types and to determine the drivers of phenological variability. We compared the fine-scale phenocam seasonal profiles with field sampling and MODIS/Landsat satellite products to assess paddock-to-landscape functioning. We found C-3/C-4 species dominance to be the primary driver of phenological differences among grassland types, with C-3 grasslands demonstrating peak greenness in spring, and senescing rapidly in response to high summer temperatures. In contrast, C-4 grasslands showed peak activity in Austral summer and autumn (January-March). Some sites displayed primary and secondary peaks dependent on rainfall and species composition. We found that the proportion of dead vegetation is an important biophysical driver of grassland phenology, as were grazing pressures and species-dependent responses to rainfall and temperature. The satellite and field datasets were in general agreement with the phenocam results. However, the higher temporal fidelity of the cameras captured changes in vegetation not observed in the coarser satellite or field results. Our phenocam data shows consistent periods of increasing and decreasing greenness over as little as 5 days. Applications for management of grasslands in temperate Australia include the identification of remnant native grasslands, tracking biosecurity issues, and assessing productivity responses to climate variability.

Copper (Cu) belongs to the repertoire of essential trace nutrients for bacterial growth, yet physiological responses of marine heterotrophic bacteria to Cu deficiency remain unexplored. Here, we examined these responses in oceanic and coastal isolates of heterotrophic bacteria from ecologically significant microbial clades (Flavobacteriia class from Bacteroidetes phylum, and marine Roseobacter Glade within Alphaproteobacteria class and Alteromonadales within Gammaproteobacteria class, both from Proteobacteria phylum). Bacterial growth, Cu quotas (Cu:P), macronutrient content and stoichiometry (cellular C, N, P, S, and C:N, S:P), as well as carbon metabolism (respiration, productivity, carbon demand, growth efficiency) were monitored across a gradient of Cu conditions, characteristic of coastal and open-ocean surface waters. Cu deficiency had most severe effects on a Flavobacteriia member Dokdonia sp. strain Dokd-P16 for which we observed significant reductions in growth, C metabolism and Cu quotas. Other strains did not significantly reduce their growth rate, but adjusted their Cu content and some C metabolic rates (Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, Roseobacter Glade) or were unaffected (Pseudoalteromonas sp. strains PAlt-P26 and PAlt-P2, Alteromonadales Glade). These diverse bacterial responses were accompanied by constant cellular composition of major elements and stoichiometric ratios. Changes in bacterial Cu quotas occurred within a modest range (similar to 5-fold range) relative to the 50-fold variation in total Cu in the media. We hypothesize that this may reflect a well-controlled Cu homeostasis in marine heterotrophic bacteria. In a preliminary assessment, we found that Cu quotas of bacteria and those of eukaryotic phytoplankton are not statistically different. However, compared to eukaryotic phytoplankton, the variability of Cu quotas in marine heterotrophic bacteria is smaller, which could reflect differences in their Cu homeostasis. Using Cu quotas obtained in our study, we assessed the contribution of bacterial Cu to the biogenic Cu pool in an oceanic euphotic zone in the NE Pacific. These preliminary estimates suggest that up to 50% of the biogenic Cu could be contained in the biomass of marine heterotrophic bacteria. Our study sheds light on the interactions between Cu and marine heterotrophic bacteria, demonstrating the potential for Cu to influence microbial ecology and for microbes to play role in Cu biolgeochemical cycle.

However, a clear understanding about how the distinct physicochemical and biological properties of the SML affect gas exchange is lacking. We used an automatic microprofiler with Clark-type microsensors to measure small-scale profiles of dissolved oxygen in the upper 5 cm of the water column in a laboratory tank filled with natural seawater. We aimed to link changing oxygen concentrations and profiles with the metabolic activity of plankton and neuston, i.e., SML-dwelling organisms, in our artificial, low-turbulence set-up during diel cycles. We observed that temporal changes of the oxygen concentration in near surface water (5 cm depth) could not be explained by diffusive loss of oxygen, but by planktonic activity. Interestingly, no influence of strong neuston activity on oxygen gradients at the air-water interface was detectable. This could be confirmed by a modeling approach, which revealed that neuston metabolic activity was insufficient to create distinct curvatures into these oxygen gradients. Moreover, the high neuston activity in our study contributed only <= 7.1% (see Supplementary Table 4) to changes in oxygen concentration in the tank. Overall, this work shows that temporal and vertical variation of oxygen profiles across the air-water interface in controlled laboratory set-ups is driven by biological processes in the underlying bulk water, with negligible effects of neuston activity.

We have evaluated the shifts in climatic niche occupation of the species Astrophytum coahuilense and its potential distribution in Mexico. We understand niche occupation as the geographic zones with available habitats and with the presence of the species. To assess shifts in climatic niche occupation, we used niche overlap analysis, while potential distribution modeling was performed based on the principle of maximum entropy. The results indicate that this species presents a limited amplitude in its climate niche. This restriction of the climatic niche of A. coahuilense limits its ability to colonize new geographical areas with different climatic environments. On the other hand, the potential distribution models obtained from the present study allow us to identify potential zones based on the climatic requirements of the species. This information is important to identify high priority areas for the conservation of A. coahuilense.

In total, 2968 individuals belonging to 4 orders, 11 families, 26 genera and 37 species were collected. Cypriniformes emerged as the most species-rich order, accounting for 62.2% of the total species. The dominant species were Pseudogastromyzon fangi, Zacco platypus, Acrossocheilus parallens and Erromyzon sinensis. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed that fish assemblages were not affected by habitat type. However, one-way ANOVA results showed that species richness, fish abundance, fish density and Shannon index were significantly affected by habitat type. Redundancy analysis (RDA) further revealed that altitude, velocity, conductivity, turbidity, depth and wetted width had significant relationships within fish assemblages, whereas water temperature, dissolved oxygen and substrate size were less important in this study, and different fish species preferred different environmental variables potentially due to differences in species' ecological requirements. Although habitat type did not affect overall fish assemblages, habitat heterogeneity played an important role in fish diversity. Hence, maintaining diverse stream habitats or restoring them are of key importance for fish diversity conservation and sustainability management of rivers.

Diet is a mediator of mercury exposure and evidence suggests that nutritional status modifies aspects of mercury toxicity. However, health impacts beyond the nervous system are poorly understood. This study evaluates antibody responses to six vaccines from the expanded program on immunization (EPI), including hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type B, measles, pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria in children with variable hair mercury and malnutrition indicators. Methods: An observational cohort study (n = 98) was conducted in native and non-native communities in Madre de Dios, Peru, a region with elevated mercury exposure from artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Adaptive immune responses in young (3-48 months) and older children (4-8 year olds) were evaluated by vaccine type (live attenuated, protein subunits, toxoids) to account for differences in response by antigen, and measured by total IgG concentration and antibody (IgG) concentrations of each EPI vaccine. Mercury was measured from hair samples and malnutrition determined using anthropometry and hemoglobin levels in blood. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate associations with each antibody type. Results: Changes in child antibodies and protection levels were associated with malnutrition indicators, mercury exposure, and their interaction. Malnutrition was associated with decreased measles and diphtheria-specific IgG. A one-unit decrease in hemoglobin was associated with a 0.17 IU/mL (95% CI: 0.04-0.30) decline in measles-specific IgG in younger children and 2.56 (95% CI: 1.01-6.25) higher odds of being unprotected against diphtheria in older children. Associations between mercury exposure and immune responses were also dependent on child age. In younger children, one-unit increase in log(10) child hair mercury content was associated with 0.68 IU/mL (95% CI: 0.18-1.17) higher pertussis and 0.79 IU/mL (95% CI: 0.18-1.70) higher diphtheria-specific IgG levels. In older children, child hair mercury content exceeding 1.2 mu g/g was associated with 73.7 higher odds (95% CI: 2.7-1984.3) of being a non-responder against measles and hair mercury content exceeding 2.0 mu g/g with 0.32 IU/mL (95% CI: 0.10-0.69) lower measles-specific antibodies. Log(10) hair mercury significantly interacted with weight-for-height z-score, indicating a multiplicative effect of higher mercury and lower nutrition on measles response. Specifically, among older children with poor nutrition (WHZ = -1), log(10) measles antibody is reduced from 1.40 to 0.43 for low (<1.2 mu g/g) vs. high mercury exposure, whereas for children with good nutritional status (WHZ = 1), log(10) measles antibody is minimally changed for low vs. high mercury exposure (0.72 vs. 0.81, respectively). Conclusions: Child immune response to EPI vaccines may be attenuated in regions with elevated mercury exposure risk and exacerbated by concurrent malnutrition.

Refuge as major habitat driver for wolf presence in human-modified landscapes	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						breeding areas; human-wildlife coexistence; Canis lupus; species range; Iberian Peninsula; large carnivores; nested-scale models; refuge availability	CANIS-LUPUS-SIGNATUS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; IBERIAN WOLF; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; RENDEZVOUS SITES; SELECTION; CONSERVATION; WOLVES; SUITABILITY; CARNIVORE	Despite severe population declines and an overall range contraction, some populations of large carnivores have managed to survive in human-modified landscapes. From a conservation perspective, it is important to identify the factors allowing for this coexistence, including the relevant habitat characteristics associated with the presence of large carnivores. We evaluated the role of several environmental factors describing habitat quality for wolves Canis lupus in the humanised Iberian Peninsula, which currently holds an important wolf population at European level. We used maximum entropy and generalized linear model approaches in a nested-scale design to identify the environmental factors that are related to wolf presence at three spatial scales and resolutions: (1) distribution range: wolf presence on a 10 x 10 km grid resolution, (2) wolf habitat use: wolf occurrence on a 2 x 2 km grid and (3) dens/rendezvous sites: breeding locations on a 1 x 1 km grid. Refuge availability, as defined by topography, seemed to be the key factor determining wolf presence at the multiple scales analysed. As a result, wolf populations may coexist with humans in modified landscapes when the topography is complex. We found that a significant amount of favourable habitat is not currently occupied, suggesting that the availability of suitable habitat is not the limiting factor for wolves in the Iberian Peninsula. Habitat suitability outside the current range indicates that other factors, such as direct persecution and other sources of anthropogenic mortality, may be hampering its expansion. We suggest that priorities for conservation should follow two general lines: (1) protect good quality habitat within the current range; and (2) allow dispersal to unoccupied areas of good quality habitat by reducing human-induced mortality rates. Finally, we still need to improve our understanding of how wolves coexist with humans in modified landscapes at fine spatiotemporal scales, including its relationship with infrastructures, land uses and direct human presence.

Effectiveness and Accuracy of Track Tubes for Detecting Small-Mammal Species Occupancy in Southeastern Herbaceous Wetlands and Meadows	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							FALSE-POSITIVE DETECTIONS; ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; IDENTIFICATION; ABUNDANCE; FOOTPRINTS; MODELS	As a non-invasive approach for sampling small mammals, track tubes may be especially useful in species occupancy studies that do not require marking of individuals. However, such studies may involve significant uncertainty in identifying many tracks to species. Using 37 study sites in eastern Alabama and Tennessee, we compared relative differences in detection probabilities with track tubes vs. live traps for Peromyscus (deermice), Oryzomys palustris (Marsh Rice Rat), and Sigmodon hispidus (Hispid Cotton Rat). In analyses that ignored identification uncertainty or that used false-positive occupancy models to address this uncertainty, track tubes and live traps had similar detection probabilities. When uncertain detections were omitted from analysis, effective detectability was lower with track tubes. False-positive occupancy modeling indicated that track-identification uncertainty could not be ignored, as there was a non-zero probability of false-positive detections. False-positive occupancy designs have high relevance to track-tube studies; in addition, such studies should ensure that track identification is done under the oversight of an experienced tracker.

Completing the hybridization triangle: the inheritance of genetic incompatibilities during homoploid hybrid speciation in ragworts (Senecio)	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Genetic incompatibility; genetic mapping; genomic rearrangement; reproductive isolation; transmission ratio distortion	TRANSMISSION RATIO DISTORTION; CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENTS; MIMULUS-GUTTATUS; MOUNT-ETNA; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; POSTZYGOTIC ISOLATION; SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; SQUALIDUS ASTERACEAE; BRITISH-ISLES; GENOME	A new homoploid hybrid lineage needs to establish a degree of reproductive isolation from its parent species if it is to persist as an independent entity, but the role hybridization plays in this process is known in only a handful of cases. The homoploid hybrid ragwort species, Senecio squalidus (Oxford ragwort), originated following the introduction of hybrid plants to the UK approximately 320 years ago. The source of the hybrid plants was from a naturally occurring hybrid zone between S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius on Mount Etna, Sicily. Previous studies of the parent species found evidence for multiple incompatibility loci causing transmission ratio distortion of genetic markers in their hybrid progeny. This study closes the hybridization triangle by reporting a genetic mapping analysis of the remaining two paired cross combinations between S. squalidus and its parents. Genetic maps produced from F-2 mapping families were generally collinear but with half of the linkage groups showing evidence of genomic reorganization between genetic maps. The new maps produced from crosses between S. squalidus and each parent showed multiple incompatibility loci distributed across the genome, some of which co-locate with previously reported incompatibility loci between the parents. These findings suggest that this young homoploid hybrid species has inherited a unique combination of genomic rearrangements and incompatibilities from its parents that contribute to its reproductive isolation.

Patterns of habitat use by three threatened mammals 10 years after reintroduction into a fenced reserve free of introduced predators	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article							MYRMECOBIUS-FASCIATUS; MACROTIS-LAGOTIS; GREATER BILBY; CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; BIODIVERSITY; MARSUPIALIA; DYNAMICS; SURVIVAL; NUMBAT	Introduced predators are a major driver of global biodiversity loss. Over the last 200 years, the distribution and abundance of critical-weight-range mammals in Australia has declined, with many species now locally extinct or confined to small isolated refuges. From 2004 onwards as part of a major conservation initiative, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy reintroduced three threatened mammal species, the Greater Bilby (Macrons lagotis), Bridled Nailtail Wallaby (Onychogalea fraenata) and Numbat (Myrrnecobitts fctsciatus), into an 8000-hectare area protected by conservation fencing at Scotia Sanctuary in semi-arid New South Wales. Our study examined habitat selection for these species following multiple generations in a fenced area free of introduced predators. We used nocturnal spotlighting and diurnal search transect data collected over a two-year period to identify habitat preferences for these species, a decade after release. We used a Distance Sampling approach to examine differences in detectability between vegetation types, and Chi-Squared tests to identify differences in habitat use relative to availability. We used a Utilization Distribution (UD) analysis to identify how the spatial distribution of habitat affected its usage at Scotia Sanctuary. Habitat use of each species was compared with the results of a study conducted shortly after initial releases. We found that patterns of habitat use for these species differed to those identified following their initial release. We found a strong preference for shrub vegetation communities for all species relative to availability, as well as some variation in habitat preferences between two fenced areas (Stage 1 and Stage 2). The UD analysis revealed patterns of habitat use for one species (Bilby) that were not apparent from Chi-squared analysis, highlighting the importance of considering the spatial heterogeneity and proximity of different vegetation types when identifying species preferences. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of introduced predators these threatened species are able to use all of the vegetation types available, and by altering their habitat use over time, to persist following reintroduction into contemporary contexts within their historic ranges.

Understanding the relationship between forest cover and bird functional guilds may serve as a valuable tool to assess how much forest is necessary to conserve significant portions of typical forest assemblages. We sampled birds (198 species, 6883 encounters) along a full gradient of deforestation across 4000 km(2) of forest-dominated landscapes in Southwest Cameroon and applied multivariate adaptive regression splines to model alpha-, beta- and gamma-richness of guilds in relation to forest cover. Overall, beta- and gamma-richness remained constant above 42% forest cover. However, total alpha-richness as well as all richness partitions of Guinea-Congo biome-restricted, large-bodied arboreal foliage gleaning, tree nesting, and frugivorous species declined when forest cover was below 74%. Moreover, ant-followers and terrestrial insectivores showed their highest diversity at zero deforestation. In contrast, open-land, granivorous, opportunistic insectivorous and widespread species strongly increased below 42% forest cover. High beta-diversity at intermediate deforestation conditions indicate that the sharp decline of original forest bird diversity may only be compensated by habitat and foraging generalists, which benefit from high habitat heterogeneity. Our study implies that Afrotropical forest bird diversity decreases non-linearly with forest loss. Critical habitat thresholds estimated by us at above 70% are much higher than those previously reported and highlight the need to integrate substantial proportions of natural vegetation within wildlife friendly farming schemes.

Even widespread species like the European freshwater duck mussel Anodonta anatina face population declines in many countries and regions. Due to an obligate parasitic phase in its life cycle, knowledge on host fish use is essential for effective conservation of A. anatina. Therefore, in this study host suitability of ten different fish species (native and invasive to Europe) from four different fish families was tested by simultaneously infesting them with the glochidia of A. anatina. Nine out of ten fish species were identified as suitable hosts, but infestation rates, duration of metamorphosis phase as well as duration and rate of juvenile mussel excystment differed significantly between all host species. The bitterling (Rhodeus amarus) was the only fish species with no juvenile mussel excystment. Surprisingly, one of the tested invasive fish (Ctenopharyngodon idella) turned out to be the second best host for the larvae of A. anatina, suggesting that the general assumption that non-native fishes would be a threat to native mussel populations no longer holds true. Compared to the second native Anodonta species in Europe (Anodonta cygnea), this study revealed that A. anatina had higher infestation rates and rates of juvenile mussels excystment as well as a different host compatibility than A. cygnea. These findings illustrate that species-specific assessments of host suitability form an urgent basis for evidence-based conservation and restoration of freshwater mussel populations and the ecosystem services they provide.

Regulation of lead fishing weights results in mute swan population recovery	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Anthropogenic impacts; Conservation intervention; Ecological time-series; Lead poisoning; Legal restriction; Population dynamics	CENTRAL ENGLAND TEMPERATURE; NONTOXIC SHOT REGULATIONS; CYGNUS-OLOR; GREAT-BRITAIN; HABITAT; INGESTION; GUNSHOT; SERIES; DUCKS; BIRDS	Legal regulation of human activities is a key mechanism for alleviating anthropogenic impacts on wildlife populations. Conservationists frequently request the regulation of toxic substances such as lead, which can be harmful to animals even at low levels of exposure. However, without assessments of the effectiveness of legislation, such regulations may be undermined or revoked and opportunities to make amendments to improve the legislation may be missed. Here we carried out a population level study of the effectiveness of regulating the use of lead. We show that the increase in population size of a charismatic waterbird (the mute swan Cygnus olor) in Great Britain over 39 years was best explained by the regulation of lead fishing weights, rather than by changes in food supplies, habitat quality, or winter temperature. The proportion of individuals dying of lead poisoning dropped following regulation, from 0.34 to 0.06, suggesting that higher survival rates were the demographic driver of increased population size. Legal restriction therefore succeeded in alleviating, although not eliminating, the impact of poisoning on mute swans. Restrictions on the use of toxic substances, and their release into the environment, would provide an effective conservation mechanism for reducing negative effects of human activities on wildlife populations. At a time when many policy makers prefer to rely on voluntary actions or market forces to achieve change, our study highlights that legal regulations on human activities can be an effective means of alleviating anthropogenic impacts on wildlife.

This study assesses megafauna catch and composition in handline, longline, bottom-set and drift gillnet fisheries of the southwestern Indian Ocean. Observers monitored 21 landing sites across Kenya, Zanzibar and northern Madagascar for 12 months in 2016-17. Landings (n = 4666) identified 59 species, including three sea turtles, two small cetaceans and one sirenian (Dugong dugon). Primary gear threats to investigated taxa were identified as bottom-set gillnets (marine mammals, sea turtles and batoids), drift gillnets (marine mammals, batoids and sharks) and longlines (sharks). Overall, catch was dominated by small and moderately sized coastal requiem sharks (Carcharhiniformes) and whiprays (Dasyatidae). Larger coastal and oceanic elasmobranchs were also recorded in substantial numbers as were a number of deeper-water species. The diversity of catch demonstrates the potential for small-scale fisheries to have impacts across a number of ecosystems. From the observed catch rates we calculated annual regional elasmobranch landings to be 35,445 (95%CI 30,478-40,412) tonnes, 72.6% more than officially reported in 2016 and 129.2% more than the 10-year average (2006-16), constituting 2.48 (95%CI 2.20-2.66) million individuals. Productivity-Susceptibility Analyses indicate that small and moderately sized elasmobranchs are most vulnerable in the small-scale fisheries. The study demonstrates substantial underreporting of catches in small-scale fisheries and highlights the need to expand efforts globally to assess the extent and impact of small-scale fisheries on vulnerable marine species and their respective ecosystems.

Genetic non-invasive sampling (gNIS) provides cost-effective access to demographic information, though its application to small mammals is still scarce. We used gNIS to infer on the demography of an endemic small mammal, the Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae), occurring as a spatially-structured population in a 462-ha Mediterranean farmland landscape. We intensively sampled fresh vole feces in four seasons, extracted the DNA, and performed individual identification based on genotypes built using nine microsatellites. We then estimated population size and individual survival relative to environmental variables, controlling for heterogeneity in capture probabilities using capture-mark-recapture modelling. Population size increased during the wet season and decreased during the dry season, while survival remained constant across the study period. Individuals captured along road-verges and around water-bodies survived longer than those captured near agricultural fields. The use of gNIS on a heterogeneous landscape such as our study area allowed us to demonstrate that human land-use activities affect Cabrera vole demographic parameters in Mediterranean farmland, with implications for conservation planning towards its long-term persistence. Our approach can be widely applied to other elusive small mammals of conservation concern, but for which informative demographic data are still scarce.

Grazing improves habitat suitability for many ground foraging birds in Mediterranean wooded grasslands	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Wooded pastures; Grazing impact; Ground-foraging birds; Landscape management; Conservation; Agroecosystems	PITFALL TRAPS; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; PASTURES; ASSEMBLAGES; INTENSITY; LANDSCAPE; WOODLAND; TIME; REGENERATION	Wooded grasslands, usually grazed, cover vast areas in Southern Europe and Northern Africa. They host rich resident bird communities and, in winter, receive large numbers of migrants from Central and Northern European woodlands. Many species are partly or entirely dependent on ground foraging and, since in winter food is often the most limiting factor for birds, maintaining suitable ground habitat is crucial. To study how grazing influences suitability of winter ground habitat for birds, we carried out an experiment in a wooded grassland in Southern Iberia, whereby grazing was controlled in 12 purposely fenced two-hectare plots (4 x 15 sheep/ha, 4 x 3 sheep/ha and 4 x no grazing). We quantified ground habitat features, food abundance and intensity of use by ground-foraging birds in each of these 12 plots. In addition, we made focal observations of birds feeding on the ground and compared the habitat of 1m(2) foraging patches with those of nearby control patches. We found that virtually all birds prefer to forage in patches with short ground vegetation and high food abundance. Measurements of these parameters in the experimental plots showed that while grazing shortens vegetation it decreases food availability, and thus has opposing effects on important determinants of habitat suitability. Nevertheless, the numbers of birds foraging in the plots indicate that, overall, grazing benefits the assemblage of ground-feeding birds, presumably because for most species the advantages of foraging in less cluttered habitats more than compensate the lower abundance of prey. However, arboreal bird species that make short foraging forays to the ground had lower numbers in grazed plots. Most bird species that forage on the ground benefited from grazing, and although they can forage under a broad range of grazing levels, some showed clear preferences along the gradient of grazing intensity. Such preferences should be taken into consideration by managers. In general, grazing should be maintained at a level sufficient to open up ground vegetation, increasing the area occupied by patches of short vegetation, in which almost all bird species prefer to forage. At moderate levels, grazing is thus a valuable management tool to promote winter bird habitat quality in Mediterranean wooded grasslands, while increasing the economic value of these threatened landscapes.

Dryland organic farming increases floral resources and bee colony success in highly simplified agricultural landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Bombus impatiens colony fecundity; Colony relative growth rate; Conventional and organic farming; Lipid content; Pollen; Wing wear	BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; WING WEAR; FORAGING DISTANCES; SPECIES RICHNESS; POLLEN; BUMBLEBEE; GROWTH; HYMENOPTERA; REPRODUCTION; POLLINATION	Agricultural intensification has contributed to declines in wild bee populations at local and regional scales. The Northern Great Plains is a key region for small grain, forage, pulse, and oilseed production, yet the impact of available floral resources on colony success of eusocial bees is unknown. To assess the effects of farming system on bee colony success (relative growth rate and fecundity) and worker condition (lipid content and wing wear), we placed 60 mini-colonies of Bombus impatiens in six conventional and six organic spring wheat fields near Big Sandy, Montana, USA over two growing seasons. Consistent with our expectations, we found that flower density and forb richness were positively associated with colony relative growth rate and fecundity. Similarly, flower density, forb richness, and the relative growth rate and fecundity of B. impatiens colonies were greater in organic fields when compared to conventional fields. Workers from organic fields had lower mean wing wear and marginally greater average body lipid content. However, there were no differences in the number of reproductives (queens, workers, and males) between two systems. Lastly, though the overall composition of colony-collected pollen was not different across the farming systems, colony-collected pollen species richness was greater in organic fields in one of the two sampled growing seasons. We conclude that by increasing B. impatiens colony success and individual worker condition, the greater floral resources observed in organic systems can contribute to better biodiversity-based indirect ecosystem services in the highly simplified agricultural landscapes that dominates the Northern Great Plains.

Although agri-environment scheme (AES) prescriptions on hedgerow management have the potential to reverse the detrimental effect of over-trimming on wildlife, their effectiveness has rarely been addressed. The aims of the study were to (i) assess moth responses to trimming regimes; and (ii) investigate the influence of the surrounding landscape on moth assemblages. We specifically tested the effectiveness of the trimming regime recommended by the targeted AES that was implemented on farms near greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) colonies since it represented the most sympathetic hedgerow management option among English AES options. We sampled adult micro- and macro-moths along 64 hedgerows located within 20 English farms using light traps, and classified moths into two guilds reflecting their larval food preferences, namely grass/herb- and shrub/tree-feeders. Our results suggest that reducing trimming has a positive impact on macro-moth species richness as well as on shrub/tree-feeder abundance and species richness. It also benefited four moth species that are significantly declining in Britain. Furthermore, while the proportion of woodland at a large spatial scale (3.0 km radius around the sampling sites) was positively associated with the abundance of macro-moths and grass/herb-feeders, woodland connectivity had a positive effect on the species richness of grass/herb- and shrub/tree-feeders at large and medium (1.5 km radius) scales, respectively. Both the abundance and species richness of macro-moths and the abundance of shrub/tree-feeders were negatively affected by the presence of arable fields adjacent to hedgerows. Overall, these findings reveal the wider biodiversity benefits of targeted AESs focusing on habitat improvement for R. ferrumequinum, and the importance of woodland in the wider landscape. We therefore strongly recommend implementing a multi-scale management approach (i.e. from field to landscape) through the use of adequate AES prescriptions to conserve moths in agricultural landscapes.

Land-use components, abundance of predatory arthropods, and vegetation height affect predation rates in grasslands	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Land use; Mowing; Grasing; Fertilising; Arthropods; Predation; Multitrophic interactions; Carabids; Ants	USE INTENSITY; USE INTENSIFICATION; INVERTEBRATE HERBIVORY; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; BEETLE COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; SPIDERS; ANTS	Land use is a major driver of biodiversity loss in many taxa including the mega-diverse arthropods, but consequences for arthropod-mediated processes are still little understood. Using a rapid ecosystem function assessment (REFA), we approximated predation by quantifying predation attempts on artificial sentinel prey. Dummies were placed on the soil surface of 83 managed temperate grasslands across a broad range of land-use intensities (grazing intensity, mowing frequency, and the amount of applied fertiliser) in two regions of Germany. Additionally, we measured vegetation height and assessed the abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall traps. We documented predation marks left by arthropods, rodents, and birds. The proportion of dummies with predation marks (i.e. predation rates) differed between regions. Vegetation height was the strongest predictor for predation in our study but correlated only weakly with land use. Predation rates increased with increasing vegetation height, for rodents and for all predator groups combined. All three land-use components affected predation, which was most prominent for arthropod predation. Arthropod predation increased with higher grazing intensity and decreased with higher mowing frequency and higher fertilisation intensity. Also, the abundances of ground-dwelling arthropods affected predation. While predation rates generally increased with a higher abundance of carabids and decreased with higher abundance of ants, the effects of spider abundance interacted with region. Our results demonstrate that different components of land use can have counteracting effects on predation rates acting together with changes in the abundance of different predator groups and vegetation height. This suggests that land-use practices that sustain high vegetation and ground-dwelling predator abundances increase predation rates in grasslands and consequently the potential to provide ecosystem services in the form of pest control.

Livestock grazing effects on riparian bird breeding behaviour in agricultural landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Woodland birds; Farmland birds; Australia; Riparian restoration; Population persistence; Bird conservation	WOODLAND BIRDS; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; POPULATION TRENDS; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITIES; AUSTRALIA; HABITAT; CONSERVATION; VEGETATION; IMPACTS	Globally, many bird species that rely on native woodland or forest environments are declining due to vegetation clearing for livestock pastures and cereal cropping. In many landscapes, woodland remnants are restricted to waterways and roadsides in narrow, sometimes degraded patches, and not all patches can necessarily provide the resources required to support bird populations. This study investigated the influence of livestock grazing and vegetation characteristics on bird breeding activity in riparian zones in northern Victoria, Australia, where much of the landscape is used for production and has experienced significant loss of woodland. Birds were broadly categorised as 'woodland' or 'non-woodland' species, based on dependency on woodlands for breeding. The majority of woodland species detected were relatively common, and where riparian zones were heavily grazed, there was significantly lower woodland bird breeding activity compared to non-woodland bird breeding activity (the latter increasing with grazing intensity). Woodland and non-woodland birds had consistently opposite responses to grazing intensity, vegetation and landscape characteristics, suggesting that the factors influencing breeding differ markedly between these two groups. Thus, where riparian zones are intensively grazed, the bird community shifts from predominantly woodland to largely non-woodland species. This has implications for the conservation of both rare and common woodland bird species in southern Australia. Simple changes in land management, for example, livestock exclusion from important breeding habitat, may confer large gains for population persistence of woodland bird species.

Gradients in abundance and diversity of ground dwelling arthropods as a function of distance to tree rows in temperate arable agroforestry systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Alley cropping; Grass strip; Ground dwelling arthropods; Maize; Tree row; Winter cereals	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; SILVOARABLE AGROFORESTRY; INTERCROPPING SYSTEM; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; SOUTHERN ONTARIO; NATURAL ENEMIES; FIELD MARGINS; BIODIVERSITY	Ground dwelling arthropods present in agricultural systems regulate multiple ecosystem services (ES), such as nutrient and carbon cycling and biological pest control. The presence of semi-natural landscape features, such as the tree component of agroforestry systems (AFS), can contribute to functional agrobiodiversity and optimize the delivery of such ES in agricultural landscapes. In temperate AFS, however, potential patterns in abundance and diversity have scarcely been investigated for detritivorous soil dwelling arthropods and only to a limited extent for predatory arthropods. Therefore, we have assessed the abundance and diversity of woodlice (Isopoda), millipedes (Diplopoda), rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) as a function of the distance to the tree row in a set of temperate arable AFS. Abundance and diversity of woodlice and millipedes were significantly higher in the tree rows than in the arable zone. In the case of mature trees, a higher abundance of detritivores was also observed in the arable zone close to the trees. Tree presence did not consistently lead to higher abundance of predatory arthropods, but a limited increase in carabid diversity was observed in the arable zone close to the tree rows. These results indicate that in temperate AFS, the trees and the associated understory vegetation strip contribute to the preservation of arthropod biodiversity and the enhancement of associated ES in the tree rows and in the arable field zone.

Most studies of ground-active arthropods in fields rely on activity-density measurement using pitfall traps. Assemblages locally observed are likely to composed both resident and immigrant species, and that is especially true for arthropods exhibiting high dispersal abilities and/or larval development that is very different from the adults. Using a spatially paired design of emerging traps vs pitfall traps in 10 pairs of organic (OF) and conventional (CF) fields, we quantified how circulating and emerging assemblages of an abundant taxa of mobile and holometabolous insects, carabid beetles, were impacted by different field farming systems and landscape characteristics. Field sampling was carried out during 5 months of 2015 in Brittany (Western France), during which 24,726 individuals belonging to 85 species were captured. Our results revealed that the number of individuals and species of both emerging and circulating assemblages were significantly higher in OF compared to CF, reinforcing the idea that OF provide more suitable conditions for both resident and mobile arthropods. Landscape and local factors had a similar influence on emerging carabid assemblages, whereas local factors were stronger drivers for circulating carabid assemblages. This study highlights the importance of distinguishing resident (emergent) and mobile (circulating) individuals when assessing the differential role of local vs. landscape factors in community assembly. It also reinforces the idea that spatiotemporal movements of predatory arthropods are impacted by spillover from and between croplands, resulting in source-sink dynamics with habitat quality being the major driver of these processes.

Diel CO2 cycles and parental effects have similar benefits to growth of a coral reef fish under ocean acidification	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						parental effects; phenotypic plasticity; acclimation; pH variability; daily fluctuations; coral reefs	CARBON-DIOXIDE; IMPACTS; CALCIFICATION; RESPONSES	Parental effects have been shown to buffer the negative effects of within-generation exposure to ocean acidification (OA) conditions on the offspring of shallow water marine organisms. However, it remains unknown if parental effects will be impacted by the presence of diel CO2 cycles that are prevalent in many shallow water marine habitats. Here, we examined the effects that parental exposure to stable elevated (1000 matm) and diel-cycling elevated (1000 +/- 300 matm) CO2 had on the survival and growth of juvenile coral reef anemonefish, Amphiprion melanopus. Juvenile survival was unaffected by within-generation exposure to either elevated CO2 treatment but was significantly increased (8%) by parental exposure to diel-cycling elevated CO2. Within-generation exposure to stable elevated CO2 caused a significant reduction in juvenile growth (10.7-18.5%); however, there was no effect of elevated CO2 on growth when diel CO2 cycles were present. Parental exposure to stable elevated CO2 also ameliorated the negative effects of elevated CO2 on juvenile growth, and parental exposure to diel CO2 cycles did not alter the effects of diel CO2 cycles on juveniles. Our results demonstrate that within-generation exposure to diel-cycling elevated CO2 and parental exposure to stable elevated CO2 had similar outcomes on juvenile condition. This study illustrates the importance of considering natural CO2 cycles when predicting the long-term impacts of OA on marine ecosystems.

New Caledonian crows exhibit strong population-specific material preferences for the manufacture of hooked stick tools, but it is unknown how they identify their favourite plants. We investigated experimentally whether crows pay attention to the stems of plants (from which the tools are made) and/or their leaves (which are usually discarded during manufacture but may enable rapid and reliable species identification at a distance). Subjects were highly selective in choice trials with multiple plant species. Two additional treatments with experimental leaf-stem combinations revealed that birds can identify their preferred plant species by its stems alone, and possibly also its leaves. These findings encourage future experiments that investigate whether New Caledonian crows attend to features of the stem that are required for the production of efficient hooked stick tools. Our study provides one of the most detailed assessments to date of how non-human animals identify raw materials for tool manufacture.

In such societies, the growth and size of individuals can be a strategic response to their social environment: in fishes, individuals may decrease their growth rate to remain small and retain a subordinate position; in mammals, individuals may increase their growth rate to become large and attain a dominant position-a strategy called competitive growth. Here, we investigate whether the clown anemonefish, Amphiprion percula, exhibits competitive growth also. We show that juvenile clownfish paired with a size-matched reproductive rival increase their growth rate and size relative to solitary controls. Remarkably, paired individuals achieved this, despite being provided with the same amount of food as solitary controls. Our results demonstrate that clownfish are able to increase their growth rate in response to social competition. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that the growth of social vertebrates can be a fine-tuned plastic response to their social environment.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Surrogate species; Biodiversity indicator; Cuculus spp.; Species richness; AUC; ROC	SPECIES RICHNESS; SURROGATE MEASURES; BIRD; INDICATOR; ACCURACY; DIVERSITY; PARADIGM; MODELS	The ongoing rapid loss of biodiversity is urging conservationist to develop biodiversity monitoring methods that are both effective and inexpensive. The identification of areas that are rich in biodiversity is an essential prerequisite to guide further conservation actions. Next to several data-intensive and more complex modelling approaches to identify biodiversity 'hotspots', there are also many conservation scientists and practitioners that are looking for approaches based on surrogate species or taxa. In certain cases, single-species surrogates have been proposed to represent a certain aspect of a broader set of species, but their effectiveness is a highly debated issue. A number of recent studies have suggested the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) to be an extremely effective, yet inexpensive, single-species surrogate to map and monitor avian biodiversity across continents and at different spatial scales. If this would indeed be the case, the implications towards conservation planning would be tremendous, which raises the question: Has the holy grail of avian biodiversity conservation been found? In this paper, the methodology and significance of the results of these studies are questioned and, hence, the use of the common cuckoo as a single-species surrogate for avian biodiversity. The studies all heavily rely on the AUC value to assess model accuracy of estimating common cuckoo occurrence using species richness (and not vice versa). Using simulations of different scenarios of relative species commonness and evenness, I show that the underlying statistical dependency between species richness and occurrence of a species results in highly inflated and volatile AUC values for the majority of the 300 simulated species, depending on their commonness and the overall species evenness. As such, I hope to be able to discourage conservation scientists and practitioners from investing time, effort, and money in using the common cuckoo as a single-species surrogate for avian biodiversity conservation.

IRES are widespread, abundant and increasing in extent, but developing biomonitoring programmes to determine their ecological quality is challenging. To date, quality assessments have focused on the aquatic organisms present during wet phases, whereas dry-phase communities remain poorly characterized. We examined multiple biotic groups present in dry IRES channels, to compare assemblages at sites impacted and unimpacted by human activity and to evaluate the potential of each group as an ecological quality indicator. We explored existing, unpublished data for three biotic groups: an aquatic microflora (diatoms), an aquatic fauna (the invertebrate `seedbank'), and a mixed flora (aquatic and terrestrial plants); notably, we did not source data for terrestrial assemblages with high potential to act as indicators. Diatom and plant assemblage composition differed between impacted and unimpacted sites, and the latter assemblages were more diverse and included more indicator taxa. Invertebrate seedbank taxa richness was higher at unimpacted sites but compositional differences were not detected, probably due to the coarse taxonomic resolution to which abundant taxa were identified. Performance of standard indices of ecological quality was variable, but differences were identified between impacted and unimpacted conditions for all biotic groups. Our results can inform the enhancement of biomonitoring programmes designed to characterize IRES ecological quality in relation to legislative targets. We highlight the need to integrate wet- and dry-phase survey data in holistic quality assessments. Although we suggest diatoms, aquatic plants and the aquatic invertebrate seedbank as having the potential to inform assessment of dry-phase ecological quality, we highlight the need for research to further characterize these aquatic groups and, crucially, to explore terrestrial assemblages with high potential to act as dry-phase quality indicators.

Moreover, functional traits provide the possibility to understand and predict the structure of plant communities as well as ecosystem performance better than species-specific identity-based approaches. Therefore, the main aim of this research was to assess the response of the plant functional diversity to environmental gradients in rangeland areas. As study case, we selected Iran which has 90 million hectares of rangelands that occupy nearly 54.6% of the total area and 65% of natural resources with 8000 plant species showing a richness genetic storage. Specifically, this research was carried out in Lasem, a mountain rangeland of the Mazandaran province. However, this area suffers from unsuitable conditions because of mismanagement as well as the high livestock intensity that cause a decreasing trend in species diversity. To achieve the above-mentioned goals, we applied three functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and height) for 114 of the most common species. A set of functional indices were then calculated for these traits within 350 experimental plots including Community Weighted Mean (CWM), Functional Regularity (FRo), Functional Richness (FRic), Functional Divergence (FDiv) and Functional Evenness (FEve). Together with the functional indices, we also considered the mean, 5th and 95th quartiles of the trait values. The main results showed that the models of functional traits can provide a powerful tool to assess ecological patterns in the landscape. The most powerful models were the Community Weighted Mean index and Functional Divergence index, while the predictive power of the functional evenness models was consistently the weakest in our study. The results indicated that single-trait diversity indices were better predictor rather than multiple- trait diversity. We conclude that aggregated traits at the community level can give new insights into the ecosystem processes, services, and resilience.

The study of the entire fish community size-structure provides valuable information about food web capacity, food web stability and ecological efficiency of aquatic ecosystems. One of the most used representations of community size structure is the Normalized Abundance Spectra (NAS) that provides an approximation of the total fish abundance and food web capacity (through the parameter y-intercept) and an estimation of food web efficiency (through the slope of the linear regression). In this study we explored NAS of the lower Ebro River fish community by integrating data from monthly electrofishing samplings during a whole year (November 2014- October 2015). We found that the percentage of total alien and alien-prey individuals were directly related with y-intercept and inversely related with slope of NAS. This is because the bulk of the community consists of introduced species of small body length. Furthermore, we detected significant relationships between NAS-related parameters and the hydrological variables describing diel flow oscillations and daily flow variability. Based on this, we suggest that high flow variability conditions and, above all, high hydro-peaking conditions, caused a diminution of the total abundance of fish and a decrease of the proportion of small sized fish (i.e. lower y-intercept and flatter slopes of NAS, respectively). Finally, a significant interaction between hydro-peaking and the percentage of alien-predators suggests that high hydro-peaking conditions benefit predation by facilitating predator-prey encounters. This is reflected by strong linear relationship between NAS parameters and percentage of piscivorous at high hydropeaking conditions that disappears at low hydro-peaking fluctuations. We concluded that the high proportion of alien fishes and the presence of a hydropower generation plant that operates by hydro-peaking are important factors determining fish size structure in the lower Ebro River.

Monitoring of the blooms is complicated due to their spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature. For adequate assessment of the water quality, phytoplankton dynamics needs to be tracked in large areas with high monitoring frequency. The main objectives of this study were (1) to describe phytoplankton community composition by pigment-based chemotaxonomy and validate the results with microscopy; (2) to improve the retrieval of information about phytoplankton community by combining remote sensing with laboratory based approaches (3) to develop a region-specific algorithm to calculate cyanobacterial blomass from reflectance spectra; (4) to detect and quantify potentially toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria with molecular methods. In our study the reflectance-based chlorophyll a (Chl a) values overestimated the High-performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) values although the correlations with HPLC Chl a measurements were very strong (r(p) similar to 0.8, p < 0.001). We found that 709 nm/620 nm reflectance ratio correlated strongly (r(p) = 0.75, p < 0.01) to cyanobacteria wet biomass in CDOM-rich Vainameri even at low cyanobacterial biomass levels. Correlations between pigment-based chemotaxonomy and microscopy were significant in case of cyanobacteria (r(p) = 0.73, p < 0.01), cryptophytes (r(p) = 0.71, p < 0.05) and dinoflagellates (r(p) = 0.64, p < 0.05).

Marine protected areas (MPAs) offer an important management tool for enhancing ecosystem structure and function. This study investigated whether a non-lethal indicator of trophic position (TP) could be used to evaluate fishery health in southern California MPAs. We hypothesized that a common predator, kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), would occupy a higher TP and smaller niche space inside MPAs than at fished reference sites, and that these patterns would be supported by trends in abundance and gut contents. Stable isotope analysis of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) were used to estimate the TP and niche space of kelp bass (N = 125) collected inside and outside of four MPAs during summer 2016-2017. Although all MPA sites supported a significantly higher biomass of kelp bass than reference sites, there was no consistent pattern in TP and niche space inside versus outside of MPAs. Gut contents showed that exploitation of ephemeral pelagic foods may reduce localized effects of MPAs on prey availability for this species. Our findings suggest that MPAs will not have consistent impacts on food web dynamics for higher level generalist predators and that ecosystem-level responses to protection may vary across locations within a bioregion. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for site-specific differences in food web structure before applying ecosystem-based metrics to fishery management.

Using data from minimally disturbed lakes (n = 151) and relatively easily obtained environmental variables, we modeled the probability of taxon occurrence and taxon-specific biomass (mg L-1) of 183 phytoplankton taxa using variables characterizing spatial context, ecosystem size and land cover. Data from lakes putatively affected by one or more pressures (n = 162) were used to evaluate responses to anthropogenic stress. Longitude and latitude were the two best predictors of phytoplankton biomass, followed by the percent of catchment area classified as coniferous forest area and altitude. Model accuracy was highest for relatively predominant taxa, and taxa with relatively wide distributions did not improve model accuracy. Assemblage similarity (1-BC index) and the phytoplankton trophic index (PTI) calculated using predicted and observed phytoplankton assemblages were used to evaluate model performance. Significant changes in phytoplankton assemblages were associated with agricultural and forestry pressures. Encouragingly the PTI index responded as predicted to agricultural land use but not forestry, implying that PTI was a robust indicator of agricultural effects and that forestry effects on assemblage composition were not related to increased nutrients. Combined, our findings showed that phytoplankton assemblages can be reliably predicted using a few, often readily available, environmental variables, and that predictions of assemblage composition and taxon-specific biomass and biological metrics based on phytoplankton taxon-specific biomass are reliable indicators of anthropogenic pressures, supporting their use in lake management.

We previously showed that constitutive differences in overall GA levels are correlated with feeding preference of the grey field slug (GFS; Deroceras reticulatum). One particularly preferred accession, ZD11, contained low GA levels, but high levels of previously unknown structurally related uronic acid conjugated compounds (UACs). Here we test whether different slug species as well as insect herbivores show similar feeding preferences among six S. dulcamara accessions with different GA chemotypes. In addition, we investigate whether slug feeding can lead to induced changes in the chemical composition and affect later arriving herbivores. A leaf disc assay using greenhouse-grown plants showed that three slug species similarly preferred accessions with low GA levels. Untargeted metabolomic analyses showed that previous slug feeding consistently increased the levels of N-caffeoyl-putrescine and a structurally related metabolite, but not the levels of GAs and UACs. Slug-induced responses only affected slug preference in one accession. A common garden experiment using the same six accessions revealed that ZD11 received the highest natural gastropod feeding damage, but suffered the lowest damage by specialist flea beetles. The latter preferred to feed on accessions with high GA levels. Our study indicates that different selection pressures imposed by generalist gastropods and specialist insects may explain part of the observed chemical diversity in S. dulcamara.

During dispersal and host colonization, MPB identify suitable host trees by olfaction of monoterpene volatiles, contend with host terpene defenses, and communicate with conspecifics using terpenoid and other pheromones. Cytochromes P450 (P450s) have been proposed to function in MPB olfaction, terpene detoxification, and pheromone biosynthesis. Here, we identified P450s that were abundant in the antennae transcriptome. Analysis of transcript levels across different life stages and tissues in females and males showed additional expression of most of these P450s in the midgut or fat body. These expression profiles suggest specific or overlapping functions in olfaction, detoxification, and pheromone biosynthesis.

However, lack of knowledge about the influence of physical constraints (e.g. ice-melting associated gradients) on organic matter sources, quality, and transfers in systems such as fjords can impede predictions of the evolution of benthic-pelagic coupling in response to global warming. Here, sources and quality of particulate organic matter (POM) and sedimentary organic matter (SOM) were characterized along an inner-outer gradient in a High Artic fjord (Young Sound, NE Greenland) exposed to extreme seasonal and physical constraints (ice-melting associated gradients). The influence of the seasonal variability of food sources on 2 dominant filter-feeding bivalves (Astarte moerchi and Mya truncata) was also investigated. Results revealed the critical impact of long sea ice/snow cover conditions prevailing in Young Sound corresponding to a period of extremely poor and degraded POM and SOM. Freshwater inputs had a very local impact during summer, with relatively more degraded POM at the surface compared to bottom waters that were less nutritionally depleted but more heterogeneous among the sampled stations. Terrestrial inputs contributed to the SOM composition but showed a large variability along the fjord. Finally, diet analyses underlined the contrasted nutritional conditions, showing much higher lipid reserves in A. moerchi than in M. truncata during winter. Under a scenario with increased freshwater input, such results suggest a decline in organic matter quality and production in Young Sound, with subsequent impacts on benthic food webs.

Here, we evaluated the potential impact of season and habitat (characterized by sediment grain size and seagrass biomass) on the magnitude of density dependence in shell growth of 3 infaunal bivalve species dominating the tropical intertidal benthic communities of Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania. Two of our focal species were filter feeders (Senilia senilis and Pelecyora isocardia) and one was a facultative mixotroph (Loripes orbiculatus), mainly relying on organic carbon provided by sulphide-oxidizing endosymbiotic gill-bacteria (i.e. chemosymbiotic). Distinguishing 2 seasons, winter and summer, we manipulated local bivalve densities across habitats (from bare sandy sediments to seagrass-covered mud). In situ growth of individually tagged and relocated clams was measured and compared with those of tagged clams that were allocated to adjacent sites where local bivalve densities were doubled. Growth was negatively density-dependent in both winter and summer in P. isocardia and L. orbiculatus, the 2 species that mainly inhabit seagrass sediments, but not in S. senilis, usually found in bare sediments. As reproduction and survival rates are generally size-dependent in bivalves, our results suggest that in our tropical study system, the bivalve community of seagrass-covered sediments is more strongly regulated than that of adjacent bare sediments, regardless of species-specific feeding mode or season. We suggest that ecosystem engineering by seagrasses enhances environmental stability, which allows bivalve populations within tropical seagrass beds to stay close to carrying capacity.

A comprehensive understanding of how organisms will respond to these complex environmental changes can come only from observing and studying species within their natural environment. To this end, the effects of environmental drivers - pH, dissolved oxygen content, salinity, and temperature-on Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas physiology were evaluated in an outplant experiment. Sibling juvenile oysters were outplanted to eelgrass and unvegetated habitat at 5 different estuarine sites within the Acidification Nearshore Monitoring Network in Washington State, USA, to evaluate how regional environmental drivers influence molecular physiology. Within each site, we also determined if eelgrass presence, which buffered pH conditions, changed the oyster's expressed proteome. A novel, 2-step, gel-free proteomic approach was used to identify differences in protein abundance in C. gigas ctenidia tissue after a 29 d outplant by (1) identifying proteins in a data-independent acquisition survey step and (2) comparing relative quantities of targeted environmental response proteins using selected reaction monitoring. While there was no difference in protein abundance detected between habitats or among sites within Puget Sound, C. gigas outplanted at Willapa Bay had significantly higher abundances of antioxidant enzymes and molecular chaperones. Environmental factors at Willapa Bay, such as higher average temperature, may have driven this protein abundance pattern. These findings generate a suite of new hypotheses for lab and field experiments to compare the effects of regional conditions on physiological responses of marine invertebrates.

The acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides is the most widespread intertidal barnacle in the Northern Hemisphere. At its southernmost European distribution limit in northwestern Iberia (Galicia, northwestern Spain), winter temperatures are close to the thermal limit for penis development, and it is expected that a temperature increase would acutely reduce reproductive success. We studied the effect of temperature on penis development in the laboratory and related the results to field data to estimate fertilization probabilities at different temperatures and population densities. Exposure to colder water temperatures (14 and 17 degrees C) allowed full penis development, but this was inhibited at warmer temperatures (20 and 23 degrees C). Penis annulations and penis length were greater in barnacles exposed to colder water treatments than in those held at warmer temperatures. In the laboratory experiments, fertilization probability was higher at the lowest temperature (similar to 100%). In the field, fertilization probability was higher in the localities with colder temperature as well as those with higher barnacle density. The results support the prediction that rising temperatures will likely reduce reproductive success of S. balanoides at its southernmost distribution limit through failure in fertilization. If similar mechanisms apply in other boreal species, climate change may shrink distribution ranges through large-scale reproductive failures at the southern limits.

However, habitat complexity comprises several interrelated attributes, such as number, size, and spatial arrangement of complexity-forming elements. Understanding the roles of these attributes in determining how associated organisms use biogenic habitats remains an elusive task. Here, we assessed the relationships between several structural-complexity attributes of the kelp Lessonia trabeculata and the abundance and distribution of egg depositions by the red-spotted catshark Schroederichthys chilensis. Over 1 yr, we conducted seasonal SCUBA surveys (i.e. ca. every 10 wk) of egg capsule depositions across individual and patch scales. The number of eggs per kelp plant was modeled as a function of kelp maximum frond length, holdfast diameter, number of stipes, percentage cover, plant density, and plant aggregation. The analysis of zero-inflated generalized linear models and second-order Akaike's information criterion indicated that the models incorporating maximum frond length and percentage cover consistently showed the best balance between fit and complexity. In general, these attributes were positively, but not necessarily linearly, linked to egg counts. The presence of egg capsules in advanced developmental stages at the end of the year indicated a high temporal persistence of eggs, particularly those occurring in taller, thicker kelps. These findings suggest that catsharks select for taller, physically stable, and thicker kelps to deposit egg capsules. Moreover, our results allow us to enhance the accuracy of the definition of shark nursery grounds, a central concept for shark conservation.

Atlantic salmon of North American origin feed along the coast of West Greenland from August to November and are exposed to a variety of different ecosystems and hydrographic and environmental regimes that affect marine food webs. Here we used stable isotopes to assess the reliance of Atlantic salmon feeding on inshore prey resources and its associated seasonal variation, and examine the correlations of varying inshore resource use with size, condition and trophic niche width. On average, Atlantic salmon relied on inshore resources for 38% of their diet (range of 0-84 %). The reliance on inshore prey increased throughout the season, as did size and condition. Although differences between inshore and offshore feeding fish were small, the resulting implications of associated differences in size and condition on subsequent survival and spawning success suggest important biological consequences of feeding habitat choice. The variation in inshore resource isotope values mirrored hydrographic variation and associated changes in prey related to glacial input, frontal zones between inshore and offshore water masses and nutrient input from run-off. Increasing reliance on inshore feeding may be due to a high abundance of spawning capelin Mallotus villosus in the fjords. Omnivory was found to be highest in fish using both the inshore and offshore environments, suggesting a greater diversity of diet in these fish.

A promising way towards understanding the impacts of such stressors on community composition is by considering species traits rather than species identity. Here, we describe the spatio-temporal dynamics in fish community traits using >30 yr of species abundance data from the North Sea combined with trait information on body size, life history, growth rate, reproduction and trophic level for demersal fish species in the area. We assessed whether the derived patterns and trends in community-weighted mean traits could be explained by a range of environmental stressors and fishing. Our results revealed strong spatial structuring and long-term changes in the trait composition of North Sea fish, with temporal changes not being uniformly distributed in space. Among the environmental drivers investigated, depth was one of the best predictors, primarily explaining the spatial variation in lifespan, growth rate, trophic level and fecundity. This can be explained by variables that co-vary with depth, e.g. temperature, seasonality, salinity and productivity. Finally, we found only weak relationships between fishing and the spatial variation of traits, suggesting that the spatial trait composition of the community is mostly determined by the environment. Yet, long-term changes in trait composition, primarily in body size, have previously been shown to be affected by size-selective fishing. Our study exemplifies how traits can be used to summarize complex community dynamics and responses to environmental and anthropogenic stressors as well as their usefulness for ecosystem-based management.

Models to predict fireline-average exposure to each inhalation hazard were developed and fit to the available data. The models identify factors to consider when defining similar exposure groups and designing future data collection. Task-based rather than shift-average data collection is important because the work activity representing the majority of fireline time, the position up- or downwind of the fire, and the proportion of time this combination represented were significant factors in the model for carbon monoxide, and all but wind position were significant for respirable particulate matter. The wind position versus the fire was not important for respirable quartz exposure. The crew type was an important factor in each model.

Analysing radon accumulation in the home by flexible M-quantile mixed effect regression	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Environmental radioactivity; Building factors; Radon-prone areas; Hierarchical mixed models; Penalised splines; Lombardy region	RESIDENTIAL RADON; LUNG-CANCER; SPATIAL ASSOCIATION; ROBUST ESTIMATION; RISK; PREDICTION	Radon is a noble gas that occurs in nature as a decay product of uranium. Radon is the principal contributor to natural background radiation and is considered to be one of the major leading causes of lung cancer. The main concern revolves around indoor environments where radon accumulates and reaches high concentrations. In this paper, a semiparametric random-effect M-quantile model is introduced to model radon concentration inside a building, and a way to estimate the model within the framework of robust maximum likelihood is presented. Using data collected in a monitoring survey carried out in the Lombardy Region (Italy) in 2003-2004, we investigate the impact of a number of factors, such as geological typologies of the soil and building characteristics, on indoor concentration. The proposed methodology permits the identification of building typologies prone to a high concentration of the pollutant. It is shown how these effects are largely not constant across the entire distribution of indoor radon concentration, making the suggested approach preferable to ordinary regression techniques since high concentrations are usually of concern. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our model provides a natural way of identifying those areas more prone to high concentration, displaying them by thematic maps. Understanding how buildings' characteristics affect indoor concentration is fundamental both for preventing the gas from accumulating in new buildings and for mitigating those situations where the amount of radon detected inside a building is too high and has to be reduced.

The performed comparisons are based on case studies, while a study providing large-scale results on the subject is missing. Herein, we compare 11 stochastic and 9 ML methods regarding their multi-step ahead forecasting properties by conducting 12 extensive computational experiments based on simulations. Each of these experiments uses 2000 time series generated by linear stationary stochastic processes. We conduct each simulation experiment twice; the first time using time series of 100 values and the second time using time series of 300 values. Additionally, we conduct a real-world experiment using 405 mean annual river discharge time series of 100 values. We quantify the forecasting performance of the methods using 18 metrics. The results indicate that stochastic and ML methods may produce equally useful forecasts.

The current overarching objective is to reveal the significance of employing different weighting techniques in the application of the Standardized Drought Vulnerability Index (SDVI) and demarcate any pertinent implications that may emerge in drought decision making. Greece, as it is very often facing the catastrophic effects of droughts, presents an almost ideal case for the SDVI testing. SDVI outcomes were tested utilizing five weighting techniques deriving from four weighting methods. The analyses indicated that the use of complex weighting models may not be necessary in all cases and that the simple equal weighting method seems more effective to estimate drought vulnerability. It also seems more important to address the search for valid, reliable and relevant individual indicators forming the complex index as well as appropriate index development processes that would measure performance of water bodies, systems and schemes, monitor the process of equitable sharing, and provide mechanisms for monitoring the state and changes in interdependent water systems.

Light pollution may create demographic traps for nocturnal insects	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial light; Courtship; Population sink; Predator-prey	ARTIFICIAL-LIGHT; COLEOPTERA LAMPYRIDAE; COLOR PATTERNS; AMBIENT LIGHT; LAND-USE; NIGHT; FIREFLIES; IMPACTS; COMMUNICATION; BIODIVERSITY	Light pollution impacts both intra- and inter-specific interactions, such as interactions between mates and predator-prey interactions. In mobile organisms attracted to artificial lights, the effect of light pollution on these interactions may be intensified. If organisms are repelled by artificial lights, effects of light pollution on intra- and inter-specific interactions may be diminished as organisms move away. However, organisms repelled by artificial lights would likely lose suitable habitat as light pollution expands. Thus, we investigated how light pollution affects both net attraction or repulsion of organisms and effects on intra- and inter-specific interactions. In manipulative field studies using fireflies, we found that Photuris versicolor and Photinus pyralis fireflies were lured to artificial (LED) light at night and that both species were less likely to engage in courtship dialogues (bioluminescent flashing) in light-polluted field plots. Light pollution also lowered the mating success of P pyralis. P versicolor is known to prey upon P pyralis by mimicking the flash patterns of P pyralis, but we did not find an effect of light pollution on Photuris-Photinus predator-prey interactions. Our study suggests, that for some nocturnal insects, light-polluted areas may act as demographic traps, i.e., areas where immigration exceeds emigration and inhibition of courtship dialogues and mating reduces reproduction. Examining multiple factors affecting population growth in concert is needed to understand and mitigate impacts of light pollution on wildlife. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fiir Okologie.

Tree mortality submodels drive simulated long-term forest dynamics: assessing 15 models from the stand to global scale	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						climate change impacts; forest dynamics; model comparison; mortality modeling; succession	TERRESTRIAL CARBON-CYCLE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION MODELS; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; GAP MODELS; ECOSYSTEM; DROUGHT; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; VARIABILITY	Models are pivotal for assessing future forest dynamics under the impacts of changing climate and management practices, incorporating representations of tree growth, mortality, and regeneration. Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10-40% per century under current climate and 20-170% under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics.

Indicators for assessing tropical alpine rehabilitation practices	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						ecological indicators; grassland; overgrazing; pastoralism; rehabilitation; restoration	ECUADORIAN PARAMO; ORGANIC-MATTER; SOIL QUALITY; RESTORATION; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT; ALPACA; POPULATIONS; PASTORALISM	In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of indicators for rehabilitation practices in high mountain landscapes that were aimed at increasing grassland palatability and biomass accumulation. Focusing on the department of Huancavelica in Peru, the importance of rehabilitation practiced in this area involves the relationship of alpaca pastoralists and their need to produce wool. Overgrazing in this area has decreased the carrying capacity of the system, which may be problematic for continuing their present levels of grazing. Therefore, rehabilitation practices, including herbivory exclusion, exclusion with added irrigation, and exclusion with water collecting ditches, were installed to increase vegetation biomass and palatability of the vegetation. The effects of the rehabilitation practices were assessed using six indicators: vegetation coverage, species richness, Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index, below and aboveground biomass, and soil organic matter, which were analyzed using mixed-effects models. The indicators show that some practices, such as exclusion and ditches, are positively affecting vegetation coverage while negatively affecting species richness. Additionally, biomass showed lower accumulation in areas not excluded from grazing. Therefore, although some of the treatments were initiated as recently as 2013, we can already observe changes in the indicators involving vegetation composition and structure. In the long term, these indicators may allow us to fully understand the effect of the rehabilitation practices on maintaining the carrying capacity of the system. Furthermore, the general approach should be widely applicable in other utilized landscapes.

Incorporating biophysical gradients and uncertainty into burn severity maps in a temperate fire-prone forested region	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						conifer forest; disturbance ecology; fire ecology; Landsat; normalized burn ratio (NBR); remote sensing; Rocky Mountains	POSTFIRE TREE REGENERATION; STAND-REPLACING FIRE; DAKOTA BLACK-HILLS; WILDLAND FIRE; LANDSCAPE PATTERNS; WILDFIRE SEVERITY; BEETLE OUTBREAKS; BETA REGRESSION; VEGETATION; CLIMATE	As forest fire activity increases worldwide, it is important to track changing patterns of burn severity (i.e., degree of fire-caused ecological change). Satellite data provide critical information across space and time, yet how satellite indices relate to individual measures of burn severity on the ground (e.g., tree mortality or surface charring) and how these relationships change across biophysical gradients remain unclear. To address these knowledge gaps, we used Bayesian hierarchical zero-one-inflated beta (ZOIB) regression models with nearly 600 plots of individual field measures of burn severity distributed across the U.S. Rocky Mountains. We asked the following: How do three commonly used satellite indices of burn severity relate to individual field measures of canopy bum severity and forest-floor bum severity (Q1)? Then, using the highest ranked satellite index, how is reliability affected by biophysical gradients that can be captured in accessible geospatial data (e.g., latitude, slope) (Q2) and stand-structure data typically available only with field data (Q3)? The Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) outperformed the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and the Relative Burn Ratio (RBR) across canopy and forest-floor measures of bum severity, but differences among index performances were minor. Overall, indices performed better for field measures of canopy burn severity than for forest-floor measures. The relationship between RdNBR and individual field measures of burn severity changed across several biophysical gradients. For example, the same value of RdNBR corresponded to different field levels of burn severity depending on latitude, pre-fire forest structure, and pre-fire beetle outbreaks-and effects of biophysical gradients were often different for canopy vs. forest-floor measures of bum severity. We show that estimating field measures of burn severity using satellite indices can be improved by including biophysical information, but if variables that are difficult to obtain without field data (e.g., pre-fire beetle outbreak severity) are lacking, we suggest caution in interpreting satellite indices of burn severity across gradients of pre-fire biophysical conditions. Finally, using an example fire, we illustrate contrasting maps of burn severity that arise from differences in the relationship between individual field measures of burn severity and RdNBR after accounting for error in those relationships.

Over six winters (2010-2015) and four study areas (>1.1 million ha) in Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, we studied the responses of wolverines (Gulo gulo) to backcountry winter recreation. We fit Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to 24 individual wolverines and acquired >54,000 GPS locations over 39 animal-years during winter (January-April). Simultaneously, we monitored winter recreation, collecting similar to 6000 GPS tracks (similar to 200,000 km) from backcountry recreationists. We combined the GPS tracks with trail use counts and aerial recreation surveys to map the extent and relative intensity of motorized and non-motorized recreation. We integrated our wolverine and backcountry recreation data to (1) assess patterns of wolverine habitat selection and (2) evaluate the effect of backcountry recreation on wolverine habitat relationships. We used resource selection functions to model habitat selection of male and female wolverines within their home ranges. We first modeled habitat selection for environmental covariates to understand male and female habitat use then incorporated winter recreation covariates. We assessed the potential for indirect habitat loss from winter recreation and tested for functional responses of wolverines to differing levels and types of recreation. Motorized recreation occurred at higher intensity across a larger footprint than non-motorized recreation in most wolverine home ranges. Wolverines avoided areas of both motorized and non-motorized winter recreation with off-road recreation eliciting a stronger response than road-based recreation. Female wolverines exhibited stronger avoidance of off-road motorized recreation and experienced higher indirect habitat loss than male wolverines. Wolverines showed negative functional responses to the level of recreation exposure within the home range, with female wolverines showing the strongest functional response to motorized winter recreation. We suggest indirect habitat loss, particularly to females, could be of concern in areas with higher recreation levels. We speculate that the potential for backcountry winter recreation to affect wolverines may increase under dimate change if reduced snow pack concentrates winter recreationists and wolverines in the remaining areas of persistent snow cover.

These allochthonous resources can influence the structure and function of adjacent ecosystems, yet their effect on arthropod consumer populations remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated how flying adult midges influence terrestrial arthropod food webs in subarctic grasslands by blocking midge inputs over four years in 2 x 2-m plots near the shore of Lake Myvatn, Iceland, where midge abundances are naturally high. We examined responses of terrestrial arthropods by measuring their densities, community composition, and stable isotopes (delta C-13) in midge-exclusion and open (control) plots. Cage treatments significantly reduced midge deposition into exclusion plots (99% reduction) relative to control plots but were designed to allow ground-active arthropods to move freely among plots. Predator densities (e.g., spiders and harvestmen) were on average 30% lower in exclusion plots relative to control plots, while no other trophic guild (detritivores, omnivores, or herbivores) showed a response to midge exclusion. As a result, blocking midges shifted arthropod communities toward a composition dominated by springtails, mites, and aphids relative to large predators such as wolf spiders and harvestmen. All trophic guilds (detritivores, omnivores, and predators), except for herbivores, were more depleted in delta C-13 in midge-exclusion plots, indicating an increased reliance on terrestrial (i.e., plant-based) resources when midge inputs were blocked. Arthropod predators were the only guild that had both a depleted delta C-13 and a negative density response to midge exclusion. Apart from predators, these results indicate a weak association between resource type (aquatic vs. terrestrial) and density responses across most arthropod guilds in this grassland system. Overall, our findings suggest that aquatic insect subsidies have significant effects on terrestrial arthropod communities, but predators appear most responsive to insect allochthony in subarctic grasslands.

Fuelbreak are a class of fuel treatment that remove fuels within a wide strip of land, with an overarching objective to reduce fire behavior and provide safe access for suppression. In an empirical analysis of shaded fuelbreaks that burned during the 2014 Bald Fire (15,950 ha on the Lassen National Forest, California, USA), we found that overall fire severity was reduced in the treated areas relative to untreated. A non-linear mixed effects model estimates that the reduction was detected more than 400 m into the treated area, greater than the standard width of the prescribed fuelbreak. Both pre- and post-fire species composition differed between treated and untreated forest, with few living stems remaining in the measured untreated areas. In the post-fire treated area, we documented a mixed conifer forest dominated by larger diameter Pinus, implying that the fuelbreak did result in a more resilient post-fire structure and composition. These results indicate that fuelbreak design may need to be wider than generally prescribed and that even during extreme fire conditions fuel treatments can result in resilient forest structures.

Repeated fires reduce plant diversity in low-elevation Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems (1984-2014)	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis; biodiversity; Bromus tectorum; cheatgrass; community composition; fire; fire frequency; repeated fire; sagebrush	ANNUAL GRASS INVASION; GREATER SAGE-GROUSE; BROMUS-TECTORUM; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; WILDFIRE; BASIN; VEGETATION; RECOVERY; CLIMATE; STEPPE	Sagebrush is one of the most imperiled ecosystems in western North America, having lost about half of its original 62 million hectare extent. Annual grass invasions are known to be increasing wildfire occurrence and burned area, but the lasting effects (greater than five years post-fire) that the resulting reburns have on these plant communities are unclear. We created a fire history atlas from 31 yr (1984-2014) of Landsat-derived fire data to sample along a fire frequency gradient (zero to three fires) in an area of northern Nevada that has experienced frequent fire in this time period. Thirty-two percent of our study area (13,000 km(2)) burned in large fires (over 404 ha) at least once, 7% burned twice, and 2% burned three or more times. We collected plant abundance data at 28 plots (N = 7 per fire frequency), with an average time since fire of 17 yr. We examined fire's effect on plant diversity using species accumulation curves, alpha diversity (Shannon's dominance, Pielou's evenness, and number of species), and beta diversity (Whittaker, Simpson, and Z indexes). For composition, we used non-metric multidimensional scaling. We then used PERMANOVA models to examine how disturbance history, temperature, precipitation, and aridity around the time of the fire affected subsequent community composition and diversity. One fire fundamentally changed community composition and reduced species richness, and each subsequent fire reduced richness further. Alpha diversity decreased after one fire. Beta diversity dedined after the third fire. Cover of exotics was 10% higher in all burned plots, and native cover was 20% lower than in unburned plots, regardless of frequency. PERMANOVA models showed fire frequency and antecedent precipitation as the strongest predictors of beta diversity, while time since fire and vapor pressure deficit for the year of the fire were the strongest predictors of community composition. Given that a single fire has such a marked effect on species composition, and repeated fires reduce richness and beta diversity, we suggest that in lower elevation big sagebrush systems fire should be minimized as much as possible, perhaps even prescribed fire. Restoration efforts should be focused on timing with wet years on cooler, wetter sites.

Although the importance of these factors in the success of reintroductions is well-accepted, they are typically evaluated independently, which can miss important interactions. For species that persist in metapopulations, movement through and interaction with the landscape is predicted to be a vital component of persistence. Simulation-based approaches are a promising technique for evaluating the independent and combined effects of these factors on the outcome of various reintroduction and associated management actions. We report results from a simulation study of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) reintroduction to three watersheds of the Pend Oreille River system in northeastern Washington State, USA. We used an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to evaluate how reintroduction strategies, life history variation, and riverscape structure (e.g., network topology) interact to influence the demographic and genetic characteristics of reintroduced bull trout populations in three watersheds. Simulation scenarios included a range of initial genetic stocks (informed by empirical bull trout genetic data), variation in migratory tendency and life history, and two landscape connectivity alternatives representing a connected network (isolation-by-distance) and a fragmented network (isolation-by-barrier, using the known existing barriers). A novel feature of these simulations was the ability to consider the interaction of both demographic and genetic (i.e., demogenetic) factors in riverscapes with implicit asymmetric movement probabilities across the barriers. We found that connectivity (presence or absence of barriers) had the largest effect on demographic and genetic outcomes over 200 yr, with a greater effect than both initial genetic diversity and life history variation. We also identified regions of the study system in which bull trout populations persisted across a wide range of demographic, life history, and environmental connectivity parameters. Finally, we found no evidence that initial neutral genetic diversity influenced genetic diversity and structure after 200 yr; instead, genetic drift due to stray rate and population isolation dominated and erased any initial differences in genetic diversity. Our results highlight the utility of spatially explicit demogenetic approaches in exploring and understanding population dynamics and their implications for management strategies-in fresh waters.

However, widespread wildfires in these systems have been recently observed. Large areas of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) scrub scattered in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts were impacted by wildfires in 2005, after a series of years with above-average precipitation. It has been hypothesized that exotic invasive grasses, for example, Schismus arabicus, are responsible as they are able to grow in the open and may produce sufficient biomass to carry fires during high-rainfall years. However, there has been little experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. We conducted a field experiment exploring the response of the annual plant community to increased rainfall in two creosote-dominated sites in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts by manipulating precipitation levels, fire history, soil disturbance, and exotic-annual-plant seed availability. We examined how these treatments impacted fuel loads (biomass) and species distributions as a function of distance from shrubs. We found that enhanced rainfall produces a general increase in biomass and density of annual plants. At the Sonoran site, rainfall tends to increase the density of exotic annuals. At the Mojave site, it is the opposite, where native annuals benefit more from higher rainfall. However, it is important to note that in the Mojave site, native annuals produce higher biomass under shrubs and exotic annuals produce higher biomass in the open in response to increased rainfall. The introduction of fire at both sites slightly increased biomass production as well. Soil disturbance and seed addition had only subtle effects. From our results, it is dear that increased rainfall in southwestern U.S. deserts is conducive to increasing biomass of annual plants, especially in the inter-shrub areas, which in turn can lead to enhanced fire risk. The potential to shift toward higher dominance by exotic annuals with fire at the Sonoran site could further enhance this risk. With several consecutive years of high rainfall, increased seed production by exotics would potentially amplify this effect.

To examine the influence of several potential drivers of forest cover change, we used supervised dassifications of historical (1938-1940) and contemporary (2015) aerial imagery covering a 2932-km(2) study area in the northern Front Range (NFR) of Colorado and we linked observed changes in forest cover with abiotic factors, land use, and fire history. Forest cover in the NFR demonstrated broadscale changes 1938-2015 and overall cover increased 7.8%, but there was notable spatial variability and many sites also experienced Forest Loss. Recent (1978-2015) wildfire was the largest single driver of Forest Loss, with fires burning 14.3% of the total study area. Recently burned areas showed net losses of 36.9% forest cover. Reasons for Forest Gain were more complex, with elevation, past mining density, fire history, and topographic heat load index being the strongest predictors of increases in forest cover. Historical mining activity is one of the dominant anthropogenic impacts in ecosystems in the NFR and it had a complex, non-linear relationship with 20th-century changes in forest cover. Subalpine stands originating after stand-replacing fires circa mid-1800s to early 1900s showed some of the greatest gains in forest cover, indicative of slow and continuous post-fire recovery through the 20th century. We also investigated factors such as land ownership, road density, forest management activities, and development intensity, which played detectable, but more minor roles in observed change. Twentieth-century changes in forest cover throughout the NFR are a result of ecological disturbances and anthropogenic influences operating at varying time-scales and overlaid upon variability in the abiotic environment.

Plant community regulates decomposer response to freezing more strongly than the rate or extent of the freezing regime	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Arctic; climate warming; decomposition; freeze dynamics; nitrogen cycling; shrub expansion; tundra	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS; ARCTIC TUNDRA SOILS; MICROBIAL ACTIVITY; PERMAFROST CARBON; COLD-SEASON; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; SHRUB EXPANSION; FROZEN SOIL; SNOW DEPTH	Arctic tundra ecosystems are warming disproportionately in the winter, including a delayed autumn soil freeze-up. Because microbial processes are extremely sensitive to change in temperature below freezing, overwinter warming strongly stimulates decomposition and nutrient mineralization and ultimately promotes the conversion of sedge-dominated tussock tundra into shrub tundra. We characterized the responses of decomposition in shrub tundra and tussock tundra soils to changes in the rate and extent of freezing using laboratory simulations to study a range of active layer freeze-up scenarios that included variation in time held above 0 degrees C (an acclimation period) and final temperature (-2 degrees C to -20 degrees C). We hypothesized that shrub soil decomposers would be more sensitive to the rate of the freezing process than tussock soil decomposers, but less sensitive to the extent of freezing. Although freezing strongly influenced microbial processes, the effects of freezing tended to not significantly vary across the range freezing regimes tested. Unexpectedly, the tussock-derived soil decomposer community was more sensitive than shrub-derived soil to the freezing treatments. Freezing conditions stimulated tussock soil to release more water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) that was composed of a greater proportion of microbially derived materials than shrub soil under the same conditions. Freezing-driven changes in the tussock WEOC pool coincided with reduced microbial decomposer biomass, while the shrub decomposer biomass was relatively insensitive to the freezing treatments. These findings suggest that the microbial community of shrub-dominated soils is more resistant to the soil freezing process than the tussock-dominated decomposer community and increases available soil N while reducing labile C release as the soils freeze. Because autumn nutrient dynamics set the stage for overwinter tundra biogeochemical conditions, increasing shrub dominance in tussock tundra may therefore promote both plant N availability and decomposer C limitation during thaw.

Ecological evaluation of a marine protected area network: a progressive-change BACIPS approach	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						conservation; coral reef; impact assessment design; marine spatial planning; partially protected areas; progressive-change BACIPS; protection regime	IMPACT ASSESSMENT; FISH POPULATIONS; RESERVES; RECOVERY; SPILLOVER; BIOMASS; SIZE; CONSERVATION; FISHERIES; TRENDS	Marine protected area (MPA) networks, with varying degrees of protection and use, can be useful tools to achieve both conservation and fisheries management benefits. Assessing whether MPA networks meet their objectives requires data from Before the establishment of the network to better discern natural spatiotemporal variation and preexisting differences from the response to protection. Here, we use a Progressive-Change BACH'S approach to assess the ecological effects of a network of five fully and three moderately protected MPAs on fish communities in two coral reef habitats (lagoon and fore reef) based on a time series of data collected five times (over three years) Before and 12 times (over nine years) After the network's establishment on the island of Moorea, French Polynesia. At the network scale, on the fore reef, density and biomass of harvested fishes increased by 19.3% and 24.8%, respectively, in protected areas relative to control fished areas. Fully protected areas provided greater ecological benefits than moderately protected areas. In the lagoon, density and biomass of harvested fishes increased, but only the 31% increase in biomass in fully protected MPAs was significant. Non-harvested fishes did not respond to protection in any of the habitats. We propose that these responses to protection were small, relative to other MPA assessments, due to limited compliance and weak surveillance, although other factors such as the occurrence of a crownof-thorns starfish outbreak and a cyclone after the network was established may also have impeded the ability of the network to provide benefits. Our results highlight the importance of using fully protected MPAs over moderately protected MPAs to achieve conservation objectives, even in complex social-ecological settings, but also stress the need to monitor effects and adapt management based on ongoing assessments.

Within mutualisms, resistance to any partner can impact the mutualism as a whole. Larvae of the globally invasive Sirex woodwasp Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) complete their development in the sapwood of Pinus spp. (Pinaceae) only in the presence of the fungus, Amylostereum areolatum (Basidiomycota). In the Southern Hemisphere where Pinus are introduced, Sirex noctilio is an outbreak invasive pest, but in North America where Pinus is indigenous it has not irrupted to economic levels 15+ yr since introduction. To test the biotic resistance hypothesis, we characterized the arthropod community attracted to and co-infesting Pinus resinosa trees at the geographic frontier of its introduced North American range, quantified antagonistic interactions observed within trees, and assayed competition of fungal species under laboratory conditions. A suite of potential natural enemies and competitors inhabited Sirex-infested P. resinosa trees. Trees experimentally exposed to ovipositing Sirex noctilio females and to physical wounding attracted greater numbers of saprophagous beetles (Cerambycidae: Xylotrechus sagittatus and Curculionidae: Ips pint) and parasitoid wasps (Ichneumonidae: Ibalia leucospoides) compared to undamaged controls. Recruitment of Xylotrechus and Thalia was positively related to numbers of oviposition scars left by Sirex females. Within xylem tissue, abundant Xylotrechus larvae killed and consumed more than 10% of Sirex larvae. This facultative intraguild predation was positively density-dependent but nonlinear, with a unimodal peak at intermediate Sirex density. Sirex density in xylem was weakly, negatively related to Ips bark beetle density, suggesting potential competition between fungal associates (Ascomycota: Ophiostoma ips) for sapwood resources. Benchtop experiments in natural and artificial media supported the hypothesis of competition between Ips and Sirex fungal associates, with faster growth and competitive dominance of the bluestain fungus under most scenarios tested. Altogether, this study provides evidence for multiple mechanisms of biotic resistance, whereby a resident community reduces survival or performance of both an invasive insect and its fungal mutualist.

Here, we use dosed mesocosms to test the prediction that higher temperatures decrease species richness and increase assemblage similarity more and faster than lower temperatures. We incubated two temperate forest soil types at constant temperatures from 10 degrees to 35 degrees, destructively sampling mesocosms at 30, 180, and 440 d. We quantified taxonomic richness and assemblage similarity of soil bacteria using 16S rRNA gene amplicons. As predicted, mesocosms at higher temperatures lost more taxa than those at lower temperature. Contrary to predictions, the simplified assemblages at higher temperatures became less similar to each other over time. After 440 d of incubation, the number of taxa lost was a linear function of the difference between treatment temperature and site mean annual temperature, while assemblage similarity decreased as an accelerating function of this temperature difference.

Bayesian Analyses of 17 Winters of Water Vapor Fluxes Show Bark Beetles Reduce Sublimation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						sublimation; spruce beetle; energy balance; canopy interception; eddy covariance; Bayesian statistics	ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE; VEGETATION LEAF-AREA; EDDY-COVARIANCE; SNOW ACCUMULATION; TURBULENT FLUXES; TREE MORTALITY; BOUNDARY-LAYER; FOREST CANOPY; COLD REGIONS; SURFACE	Sublimation is an important hydrological flux in cold, snow-dominated ecosystems. In high-elevation spruce-fir forests of western North America, spruce beetle outbreaks have killed trees, reduced the canopy, and altered processes that control sublimation. We evaluated two hypotheses related to effects of disturbance on sublimation in this ecosystem: (1) the dominant source for sublimation is canopy intercepted snow and (2) the loss of canopy following a beetle disturbance leads to less total sublimation. To incorporate uncertainty hierarchically across multiple data sources and address phenomenological parsimony, Bayesian statistics were used to analyze 17years (2000-2016) of winter eddy covariance flux data at the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Sites AmeriFlux sites where a spruce beetle outbreak caused 75-85% basal area mortality. Our analysis revealed that resistances to sublimate snow from the canopy were an order of magnitude less than from the snowpack, and the maximum snow loading capacity in disturbed canopies was reduced to 34% of its pre-outbreak value. Total sublimation has decreased since 2010, 2years after the main outbreak, declining 24% (with a 95% credible interval, C.I., between 18% and 38%) during 2014-2016 due to a 32% decrease in canopy sublimation. Snowpack sublimation only increased 3% over this period. With less total sublimation, the forest retained 6.1% (4.5-12.3% C.I.) more snowpack mass or equivalently 4.4% (3.2-8.8 C.I.) of the annual precipitation. Considering tree growth and ecological succession are slow in spruce-fir forests, this decrease in sublimation should persist as an increased snowpack for decades, with substantial impacts on catchment hydrologic processes and potentially streamflow.

Forest succession and climate variability interacted to control fire activity over the last four centuries in an Alaskan boreal landscape	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Boreal forest; Fire; Paleoecology; Multi-proxy; Climate; Black spruce	SEDIMENT-CHARCOAL RECORDS; NORTH-AMERICA; WILDLAND FIRE; IMPACTS; REGIMES; VEGETATION; LIMITS; HISTORY; RANGE; COAST	ContextThe boreal forest is globally important for its influence on Earth's energy balance, and its sensitivity to climate change. Ecosystem functioning in boreal forests is shaped by fire activity, so anticipating the impacts of climate change requires understanding the precedence for, and consequences of, climatically induced changes in fire regimes. Long-term records of climate, fire, and vegetation are critical for gaining this understanding.ObjectivesWe investigated the relative importance of climate and landscape flammability as drivers of fire activity in boreal forests by developing high-resolution records of fire history, and characterizing their centennial-scale relationships to temperature and vegetation dynamics.MethodsWe reconstructed the timing of fire activity in interior Alaska, USA, using seven lake-sediment charcoal records spanning CE 1550-2015. We developed individual and composite records of fire activity, and used correlations and qualitative comparisons to assess relationships with existing records of vegetation and climate.ResultsOur records document a dynamic relationship between climate and fire. Fire activity and temperature showed stronger coupling after ca. 1900 than in the preceding 350yr. Biomass burning and temperatures increased concurrently during the second half of the twentieth century, to their highest point in the record. Fire activity followed pulses in black spruce establishment.ConclusionsFire activity was facilitated by warm temperatures and landscape-scale dominance of highly flammable mature black spruce, with a notable increase in temperature and fire activity during the twenty-first century. The results suggest that widespread burning at landscape scales is controlled by a combination of climate and vegetation dynamics that together drive flammability.

Such a complex topography complicates the accurate quantification of forest C dynamics at larger scales.ObjectivesWe determined the effects of altitude and aspect on forest C cycling in a typical, mountainous catchment in the Northern Limestone Alps.MethodsForest C pools and fluxes were measured along two altitudinal gradients (650-900m a.s.l.) at south-west (SW) and north-east (NE) facing slopes. Net ecosystem production (NEP) was estimated using a biometric approach combining field measurements of aboveground biomass and soil CO2 efflux (SR) with allometric functions, root:shoot ratios and empirical SR modeling.ResultsNEP was higher at the SW facing slope (6.603.01tCha(-1)year(-1)), when compared to the NE facing slope (4.36 +/- 2.61 tCha(-1)year(-1)). SR was higher at the SW facing slope too, balancing out any difference in NEP between aspects (NE: 1.30 +/- 3.23tCha(-1)year(-1), SW: 1.65 +/- 3.34tCha(-1)year(-1)). Soil organic C stocks significantly decreased with altitude. Forest NPP and NEP did not show clear altitudinal trends within the catchment.Conclusions Under current climate conditions, altitude and aspect adversely affect C sequestering and releasing processes, resulting in a relatively uniform forest NEP in the catchment. Hence, including detailed climatic and soil conditions, which are driven by altitude and aspect, will unlikely improve forest NEP estimates at the scale of the studied catchment. In a future climate, however, shifts in temperature and precipitation may disproportionally affect forest C cycling at the southward slopes through increased water limitation.

Dissimilar effects of human and elephant disturbance on woodland structure and functional bird diversity in the mopane woodlands of Zambia	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Savanna woodlands; Functional traits; Alpha diversity; Beta diversity; Bayesian mixed models	CHARCOAL PRODUCTION; AFRICAN SAVANNA; TREE COVER; IMPACTS; DEGRADATION; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; NESTEDNESS; HERBIVORES; DYNAMICS	ContextHumans and elephants are major disturbance agents in the African savanna woodlands. While both species remove trees, humans selectively harvest larger stems, which are less vulnerable to elephants. Increasing human pressures raise the question of how the altered disturbance regime will modify woodland structure, and in turn biodiversity and ecosystem function.ObjectivesHere we investigate this process in the mopane woodlands of Zambia by examining relationships between woodland structure, species and functional bird diversity, and human and elephant disturbance intensity.MethodsWe conducted a single-season comparison of 178 plots from 45 sites using Bayesian mixed models.ResultsThe effect of elephants on tree density (-7.71.6%; deviation from intercept) and bird species richness (-15 +/- 6%) was greater than that of humans (density: -3.5 +/- 1.5%; bird richness: -11.6 +/- 4.7%). Despite this, elephants did not significantly affect woody biomass or functional bird diversity, whereas humans had a negative effect on both (woody biomass: -9.3 +/- 2.3%; functional bird diversity: -5 +/- 2%). Elephants were associated with reductions in species and functional turnover (5.3 +/- 2.5% and 6 +/- 3%, respectively).Conclusions Replacement of elephants by humans is likely to reduce woody biomass and functional bird diversity affecting the woodland structure, sustainability, and functioning. Concentrated elephant disturbance could lead to spatial homogeneity in bird species and functional compositions, potentially reducing the spatial resilience of bird communities. This is the first study to highlight how the difference between elephant and human disturbances leads to dissimilar effects on biodiversity.

Understanding how landscape heterogeneity influences movement is thus critical for testing theory and developing conservation strategies. Consequently, studies are needed that link movement data with landscape features influencing dispersal.ObjectivesWe used experimental translocations to test whether forest fragmentation constrains movements of two fragmentation-sensitive bird species. We also tested for evidence of multiple behavioral movement phases (i.e., exploring, homing) and evaluated whether fragmentation effects varied between them.MethodsOver two breeding seasons we translocated territorial Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina; n=36) and Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla; n=19) 1-1.2km across landscapes spanning a fragmentation gradient and recorded spatial (movement path) and temporal (return time) homing data using VHF transmitters and receivers.ResultsNinety-one percent of individuals returned home, taking up to 72.2h. Movements of 98% of returning birds indicated distinct exploring (i.e., short, undirected movements and course reversals) and homing (i.e., large, fast steps towards home) movement phases. Both species chose steps minimizing gap exposure in both phases. However, landscape fragmentation had no negative effect on homing times or path straightness.ConclusionsOur results suggest movement limitation does not drive fragmentation sensitivity in these species. Discrepancy between step- and path-level analyses either indicate that fine-scale movement data do not reflect landscape connectivity, or that artificially motivated animals respond unnaturally to behavioral barriers. Given evidence for dichotomous movement behavior, future studies linking these behaviors to life stages will elucidate when and how landscape features influence movement.

Potential anthropogenic hazards were identified across migratory pathways and related to conservation strategies.MethodsJourney North citizen scientist monarch overnight roost data from 2002 to 2016 were used to model the fall migration at 10km spatial resolution with MaxEnt and KDEMs. Potential anthropogenic threats to the fall migration were spatially identified along core migratory routes.ResultsThe KDEM migratory pathways best represented patterns of monarch movement towards overwintering locations. Migratory routes varied as much as 200km from east to west in the southern Central Flyway, which was also the only area identified with monarch roadkill hotspots. Potential threats from mosquito adulticide ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying were concentrated along Eastern Flyway coastal areas. Potential nectar resource loss or contamination from high usage of glyphosate herbicide and neonicotinoid insecticides was greatest in the Midwest, within the core route of the Central Flyway.ConclusionsMaxEnt and KDEM were complementary in modeling monarch migratory pathways. Monarch roadkill estimation and mitigation strategies are most needed in the southern core migratory pathways through Texas and Mexico. High quality nectar resourceenhancement could help to mitigate potential threats from mosquito ULV spraying and nectar resource loss or contamination in coastal areas and the Midwest, respectively.

Here we combine molecular genetic analyses with species distribution modeling to assess the nativity of Phalaris and determine potential drivers of non-native Phalaris invasion in riparian areas across a large region of the semiarid northwestern USA. Based on our genetic analyses, we found that throughout our study region Phalaris is largely non-native, and no modern-day samples from our study region were of native North American origin. At least half of the four species distribution models suggested that non-native Phalaris invasion across the region was associated with warmer temperatures, more growing days, wetter summers, drier winters, higher nitrogen levels, shallower stream slopes, and at sites closer to roads and without a history of grazing. These findings can be used to determine the best locations for targeted monitoring. Furthermore, there is the potential for increased Phalaris invasion with climate change-induced temperature increases.

Wetland Soil Properties and Resident Bacterial Communities Are Influenced by Changes in Elevation	WETLANDS			English	Article						Spatial and temporal community change; Coastal wetland; 16S rRNA genes; Elevation gradient; Estuary	TIDAL FRESH-WATER; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; DIVERSITY; GRADIENT; CARBON; PH; SUCCESSION; VEGETATION; SEDIMENTS	Soils from four sites distributed along an elevation gradient from marsh to coastal forest in a wetland bordering the Gulf of Mexico were sampled over a 16-months period. In addition to measuring a suite of environmental conditions, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of the resident bacterial communities were performed. Wetland soil bacterial communities varied across both space and time, with all measured variables (temperature, pH, percentage of soil organic matter, salinity, and concentrations of sulfide, NH4+, NO3-, and soluble reactive phosphorus) showing significant site by time interactions. Analyses of bacterial communities showed both marsh zones (Spartina and Cladium) supported similar communities, as did the ecotone and coastal forest. Bacterial communities within coastal forest soils were significantly different than those within marsh soils, and the ecotone communities were significantly different from the Spartina marsh soil. Temperature and pH were the most influential environmental factors impacting bacterial community composition but no predictable patterns were identified, suggesting that community changes are likely the result of intrinsic factors that are affected by local-scale processes. The dynamic nature of the physiochemical variables within wetlands suggests that more work is needed to determine potential interactive effects on bacterial community structure.

Modeling the Relationship between Water Level, Wild Rice Abundance, and Waterfowl Abundance at a Central North American Wetland	WETLANDS			English	Article						Hierarchical modeling; Migration; Waterfowl; Wetlands; Zizania palustris	FIELDS; BIRDS; MANAGEMENT; MIGRATION	Recent evidence suggests wild rice (Zizania palustris), an important resource for migrating waterfowl, is declining in parts of central North America, providing motivation to rigorously quantify the relationship between waterfowl and wild rice. A hierarchical mixed-effects model was applied to data on waterfowl abundance for 16 species, wild rice stem density, and two measures of water depth (true water depth at vegetation sampling locations and water surface elevation). Results provide evidence for an effect of true water depth (TWD) on wild rice abundance (posterior mean estimate for TWD coefficient,(TWD) = 0.92, 95% confidence interval=0.111.74), but not for an effect of wild rice stem density or water surface elevation on local waterfowl abundance (posterior mean values for relevant parameters overlapped 0). Refined protocols for sampling design and more consistent sampling frequency to increase data quality should be pursued to overcome issues that may have obfuscated relationships evaluated here.

Long-term changes on estuarine ciliates linked with modifications on wind patterns and water turbidity	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Tintinnids; Oligotrichs; Acartia tonsa; Wind; Turbidity; Estuaries	BAHIA-BLANCA ESTUARY; SEA-LEVEL; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIOGENIC CARBON; SUSPENDED CLAY; DIVERSITY; SHALLOW; VARIABILITY; DRIVEN	Planktonic ciliates constitute a fundamental component among microzooplankton and play a prominent role in carbon transport at the base of marine food webs. How these organisms respond to shifting environmental regimes is unclear and constitutes a current challenge under global ocean changes. Here we examine a multi-annual field survey covering 25 years in the Bahfa Blanca Estuary (Argentina), a shallow, flood-plain system dominated by wind and tidal energy. We found that the estuary experienced marked changes in wind dominant regimes and an increase in water turbidity driven from the joint effect of persistent long-fetch winds and the indirect effect of the Southern Annular Mode. Along with these changes, we found that zooplankton components, i.e. ciliates and the dominant estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa, showed a negative trend during the period 1986-2011. We showed that the combined effects of wind and turbidity with other environmental variables (chlorophyll, salinity and nutrients) consistently explained the variability of observed shifts. Tintinnids were more vulnerable to wind patterns and turbidity while showed a loss of synchrony with primary productivity. Water turbidity produced a dome-like pattern on tintinnids, oligotrichs and A. tonsa, implying that the highest abundance of organisms occurred under moderate values (similar to 50 NTU) of turbidity. In contrast, the response to wind patterns was not generalizable probably owing to species-specific traits. Observed trends denote that wind induced processes in shallow ecosystems with internal sources of suspended sediments, are essential on ciliate dynamics and that such effects can propagate trough the interannual variability of copepods.

The biomechanical properties of their skeletal structures are of great importance for their individual fitness, because the skeleton provides the means for locomotion, grazing and protection from predators. Sea urchin skeleton is composed of discrete calcite plates attached to each other at sutures by organic ligaments. The present study addressed the fate of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816) skeleton in acidified oceans, taking into account the combined effect of reduced pH and macroalgal diet, with potential cascading consequences at the ecosystem level. A breaking test on individual plates of juvenile specimens fed different macroalgal diets has been performed, teasing apart plate strength and stiffness from general robustness. Results showed no direct short-term effect of a decrease in seawater pH nor of the macroalgal diet on single plate mechanical properties. Nevertheless, results from apical plates, the ones presumably formed during the experimental period, provided an indication of a possible diet-mediated response, with sea urchins fed the more calcified macroalga sustaining higher forces before breakage than the one fed the non-calcified algae. This, on the long term, may produce bottom-up effects on sea urchins, leading to potential shifts in the ecosystem equilibrium under an ocean acidified scenario.

Autotrophic carbon conservation in mangroves remains controversial. In this sense, autotrophic nutrient assimilation by crabs can highlight their ecosystem function. This study aims to identify the relationship between quality sources and food partitioning in two leaf-eating crabs, Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis cruentata. Quantification of the litterfall biomass, analysis of the soil, the C/N ratio and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were used to evaluate food sources and crab tissues in two mangrove forests. The litterfall and soil C contents and C/N ratios of the Pacoti River (PR) were higher than those of the Jaguaribe River. The higher C/N ratios of the litterfall of the PR led to higher nitrogen ingestion from complementary food sources (soil and omnivorous invertebrates). The nutritional requirements and food partitioning behavior of both species emphasize the ecosystem functions of leaf-eating crabs concerning the assimilation and conservation of autotrophic carbon and nitrogen in mangroves.

Understanding the natural variability of resident organisms in such critical areas is integral for deciphering human-induced perturbations to formulate appropriate management strategies. Five marine hotspots along northwest India, comprising three active harbours and two marine protected areas, were surveyed seasonally to understand the macrofaunal distribution patterns and functional traits. Among the 33 macrobenthic taxa, Polychaeta constituted the dominant taxon. Spatial variability was prominent due to differences in terms of polychaete species types, relative abundances and functional trait matrices. Monsoonal hypoxia altered the macrobenthic species and functional composition. CCA revealed a combination of natural (texture, DO, salinity) and anthropogenic (PHc, SS, ammonia) hydro-sedimentological variables as key drivers for the polychaete distribution patterns. The results are expected to improve the understanding of the variability and functioning of polychaete taxocommunity within the ecologically and economically significant "marine hotspots".

However, our understanding of dynamics in benthic space holders, following such disturbances, is limited. To address this, we quantified successional dynamics of the ascidian, Didemnum cf. molle using a series of temporally and spatially matched photoquadrats across both the 2016 and 2017 mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef. Unlike corals, D. cf. molle appeared to flourish in the warm temperatures and rapidly expanded. Indeed, colony density increased nearly 6-fold over two years with one quadrat experiencing an increase of over 1000 ind. m(-2). However, this increase did not simply track the increase in space due to coral mortality, but may have benefitted from reduced predation or increased nutrient availability following mass coral mortality. This study highlights the potential for D. cf molle to expand under bleaching conditions and to become a more prominent component of future reef configurations.

In addition, fertility damage in invertebrates has been addressed as a major problem that may pose a threat to the maintenance of populations. In this context, the present study proposes a methodology based on the measurement of sperm DNA integrity to evaluate the impact of paternal damaged DNA on the reproductive success of Palaemon serratus. A preliminary methodological optimization step was carried out to assess the kinetics of response of spermatozoa as well as the sensitivity of the spermatozoa according to their location in the genital tract. Spermatozoa appeared to be sensitive to a short in vivo exposure to the direct acting agent methyl methanesulfonate (i.e. MMS; 2 days), with a persistence of damage even after a 30 days' recovery in a clean environment, suggesting a probable lack of DNA repair machinery. Moreover, our results revealed no difference in the level of DNA damage in mature spermatozoa whatever the exposure in spermatophore located in the terminal ampulla or in the proximal and distal part of the vas deferens. Finally, a significant decrease in the percentage of naturally bred prawns has been observed at the highest concentration of MMS (i.e. 100 mu M). Nevertheless, no reproduction impairment (i.e. fertilization rate and early embryo development) following a paternal exposure has been shown in spite of very high levels of sperm DNA damage. In regard to the literature, this result raises questions concerning the kinetics of expression of genotoxic damage on progeny in the Palaemon model and future work will be led in this way.

Since predicting long-term storage security is difficult, different CO2 leakage scenarios and impacts on marine ecosystems require evaluation. Submarine CO2 vents may serve as natural analogues and allow studying the effects of CO2 leakage in a holistic approach. At the study site east of Basiluzzo Islet off Panarea Island (Italy), gas emissions (90-99% CO2) occur at moderate flows (80-120 Lm(-2) h(-1)). We investigated the effects of acidified porewater conditions (pH(T) range: 5.5-7.7) on the diversity of benthic bacteria and invertebrates by sampling natural sediments in three subsequent years and by performing a transplantation experiment with a duration of one year, respectively. Both multiple years and one year of exposure to acidified porewater conditions reduced the number of benthic bacterial operational taxonomic units and invertebrate species diversity by 30-80%. Reduced biodiversity at the vent sites increased the temporal variability in bacterial and nematode community biomass, abundance and composition. While the release from CO2 exposure resulted in a full recovery of nematode species diversity within one year, bacterial diversity remained affected. Overall our findings showed that seawater acidification, induced by seafloor CO2 emissions, was responsible for loss of diversity across different size-classes of benthic organisms, which reduced community stability with potential relapses on ecosystem resilience.

ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cloud forest; Environmental filtering; Functional convergence; Mexico; Oreomunnea mexicana	ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION; ASSEMBLY RULES; DIVERSITY; MECHANISMS; COMMUNITIES; FRAMEWORK; LIGHT	Several ecological processes intervene in the assembling of plant communities, such as environmental filtering and biotic interactions (e.g., competition, facilitation). The analysis of the distribution of the functional traits of plants helps to identify which of these processes is involved in the succession of a plant community assembly. We analyzed the distribution patterns of two groups of functional traits in a chronosequence spanning the first 40 years of secondary succession (SS) of a plant community of the tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF). One group of traits (leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf phosphorous and leaf nitrogen) is associated to the resource-acquisition strategy, and the second group to the conservation strategy (wood density, leaf dry mass per area unit, leaf density and leaf carbon). For each group, two multi-trait indices were quantified, namely functional divergence and dispersion. The number of individuals per plot was randomized in order to produce a null model and analyze the simulated index-distribution patterns. Then, the standardized size effect (SES) was calculated. Our results showed that both, divergence and dispersion, decreased towards the end of the successional gradient, leading to convergent patterns in the conservation traits group. The SES acquired negative values, which suggests that convergent patterns may be driven by environmental filtering. Functional diversity showed a tendency to decrease even when a species turnover between successional stages had occurred (ANOSIM, R Global = 0.64, P = 0.01). The dominance of Oreomunnea mexicana, at the end of the chronosequence, may have a particularly important role in the observed functional convergence.

The species are considered invasive and introduction can lead to substantial alteration of floodplain vegetation communities and ecosystem functioning. Invasive spread of different Salicaceae have been attributed to differences in flood tolerance, growth and dispersal between it and co-occurring native species, suggesting a comparative approach examining key traits to be a profitable strategy in elucidating and predicting patterns of Salicaceae invasion. Here we study incipient Salix fragilis invasions in Chilean Patagonia on the western slopes of the Andes. Our approach combines vegetation transect data with dendroecological analysis to compare patterns of niche position along the hydrogeomorphic gradient, niche breadth, and growth rate among S. fragilis and co-occurring species. We evaluated these traits because they are thought to be key to species' capacity to colonize, survive, grow and reproduce in dynamic floodplain habitats. Transect data showed that relative to the most common native trees and shrubs, S. fragilis has the broadest environmental tolerance along the hydrogeomorphic gradient and has a mean niche position closest to severely disturbed and highly flooded channel margins. Moreover, growth models showed that S. fragilis grows faster relative to native species, especially at juvenile stages. Our data suggest that a unique set of trait values allows S. fragilis to occupy a previously under-occupied and abundantly distributed niche, and will continue to colonize, survive, grow and reproduce in morphodynamically disturbed river margins. This is the first report of invasive S. fragilis in Chile, and we comment on potential impacts to native vegetation communities, soil development and ecosystem function.

Consistent sorting but contrasting transition zones in plant communities along bioclimatic gradients	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bioclimatic transect; Climate change; Climate sensitivity; Ecotone; Compositional turnover; Transition zone	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BETA DIVERSITY; GLOBAL CHANGE; COMPOSITIONAL TURNOVER; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SPECIES RICHNESS; VEGETATION; RAINFALL; SAVANNA; IMPACTS	Correlations between plant species occurrences and climate are used as evidence of ecological sorting and climate sensitivity. However, because observed patterns may be spatially and historically contingent, interpretations of compositional responses to spatial differences in climate should ideally consider past climatic fluctuations, edaphic factors, nonlinear turnover rates and transition zones (ecotones) in environmental and geographic space. We tested whether drivers of plant community compositional turnover and transition zones are consistent, rather than spatially contingent, across spatially isolated and biologically contrasting (independent) ecosystems. We used four broad-scale transects in Australia, which are spatially isolated and climatically and ecologically diverse: NATT (Northern Territory); BATS (New South Wales); SWATT (Western Australia) and TREND (South Australia). We used Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling to ascertain the relative contributions of space (geographic distance) and environmental variables to compositional turnover. We mapped transition zones using modelled nonlinear responses. Purely spatial contributions were estimated using variance partitioning. Models explained 26-52% of deviance in compositional dissimilarity. Mean annual rainfall and geographic distance were the most important explanatory variables, although topographic relief outranked rainfall for the topographically complex BATS transect. Purely spatial structure accounted for only 7-12% of explained deviance, pointing to the shared prevalence of species sorting along spatially structured rainfall gradients. Zones of rapid compositional turnover across bioclimatic gradients were evident across the contrasting ecosystems. These transitions zones tended to occur at the arid extremes of rainfall gradients and as plains transitioned into complex topography. Responses to other variables were inconsistent among transects. Transition zones were spatially contingent, influenced by local topography, and generally occurred within different subintervals (value ranges) along gradients. The somewhat idiosyncratic compositional responses suggest that assessment of broadscale compositional drivers including climate change should incorporate regional variation. However, the consistently strong species sorting along rainfall gradients demonstrates a common key response to moisture limitation.

Spatial variation in sex ratio and density explains subtle changes in the strength of size-assortative mating in Edessa contermina (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Intrasexual competition; Male-male competition; Male mate choice	NEZARA-VIRIDULA HEMIPTERA; MALE-MALE COMPETITION; GREEN STINK BUG; COPULATORY SUCCESS; MATE CHOICE; SELECTION; HERITABILITY; POPULATION; INTENSITY; DYNAMICS	Size-assortative mating (SAM) is usually explained by the mate-choice hypothesis. However, this hypothesis does not consider the effects of variations in the intensity of mating competition on mate choice and SAM. For example, in populations with male-biased operational sex ratios (OSR) and high densities, large males will have more advantages during mating competition and will have access to the most mating opportunities with large, preferred females (i.e. mating competition hypothesis). In this study, we investigated the effects of mating competition and mate choice on the strength of SAM in Edessa contermina (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). We also described sexual size dimorphism and the mating system of this Neotropical stink bug in a conservation area of the Brazilian savanna. We used density as a proxy for mating competition intensity because it was positively correlated with OSR. Size-assortative mating was more consistent under intense mating competition. However, males copulated with relatively larger females as population density increased. Males assortatively mated based on size in the first and second copulation events observed, while both female matings were random. Thus, male mate choice may promote SAM in E. contermina, but its strength is affected by variations in the intensity of mating competition. Hence, we provided empirical support for mating competition as a potential mechanism promoting subtle changes in SAM. We discussed potential implications of this mechanism on the mating patterns of pentatomids.

However, tri-trophic interactions often are context-dependent highlighting the importance of assessing both the overall top-down effect on plant fitness and predator behavioral and physiological attributes that shape that outcome. We studied the effect of the flower-dwelling crab spider Misumenops pallidus on the perennial herb Anemone multifida in a low-thicket in Northwestern Patagonia. We measured pollinator visitation frequency, florivory rate, plant fitness, spider abundance, and spider's physiological (e.g. camouflage) and behavioral attributes (e.g. host selection, fidelity) that aid to define its possible ecological role. Misumenops pallidus showed a generalist diet (mostly pollinators), camouflage strategies, and intraspecific selection for plants bearing higher number and longer trichomes. Additionally, it displayed host fidelity with long periods of permanence in the selected host plant, occupying similar to 25% of plant population. However, the presence of these spiders did not affect pollinator visitation rate, florivory or plant fitness, indicating a commensalism role. Our findings suggested that the asymmetric benefit in this plant-spider association may be attributed to a combination of factors. In particular, the low-to-moderate spider abundance, generalist diet and cryptic camouflage; all of which weaken the top-down effect on pollinators and plant fitness, especially whenever ecological redundant pollinators are present. However, temporal and/or spatial variation on spider population might enhance this asymmetric benefit for the spider, potentially changing its role from commensalism to antagonism.

Using a multi-specific approach, the present study aimed at testing the effect of grazing intensity on NSC concentration in tiller bases. We selected five grazing-tolerant grass species (Agrostis stolonifera, Cynosurus cristatus, Hordeum secalinum, Lolium perenne and Poa trivialis) and collected plants in a grassland subjected to two cattle grazing intensities (intensive versus moderate) for years. We measured NSC concentrations (starch, fructans, sucrose, glucose and fructose) in tiller bases. We found that fructan and sucrose concentrations before the grazing season (April) were higher under intensive than moderate grazing. By contrast, no significant effect of the grazing intensity on these NSC concentrations in tiller bases remained at the end of the grazing season (October). These results suggest that the level of reserves available before the onset of disturbance caused by grazing as well as the reserve replenishment capacity during the grazing season are modified by the intensity of grazing.

Using functional responses to quantify notonectid predatory impacts across increasingly complex environments	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Predator-prey; Biological control; Functional response; Habitat complexity; Anisops debilis; Culex pipiens	HABITAT COMPLEXITY; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; CYCLOPOID COPEPODS; CULEX-PIPIENS	Predation is a key biotic interaction that influences both the structure and functioning of ecosystems, and is relevant in the biological control context. Levels of habitat complexity in aquatic ecosystems are highly variable and can profoundly affect predator-prey interactions through the presence of prey refugia, which can in turn reduce predatory efficacy. Here, we use functional responses (FRs, resource use under different resource densities) to quantify the predatory impact of the notonectid Anisops debilis towards larvae of the mosquito Culex pipiens under a habitat complexity gradient. Anisops debilis displayed a potentially population-destabilising Type II FR towards larval C. pipiens prey across the habitat complexity gradient. Attack rates were highest in simple environments, however handling times were not significantly affected by habitat complexity. Maximum feeding rates of A. debilis towards C. pipiens larvae were thus robust to habitat complexity variations. Our results demonstrate the substantial predatory impacts of notonectids towards larval mosquito prey irrespective of habitat complexities, which may assist in the biological control of pests and vectors in aquatic systems.

Interindividual variations in plant and fruit traits affect the structure of a plant-frugivore network	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Atlantic forest; Birds; Individual-based network; Centrality; Foraging behaviour; Fruit selection	SEED DISPERSAL; ATLANTIC FOREST; INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION; FLESHY FRUITS; CONSEQUENCES; SELECTION; RAIN; BIRDS; NEIGHBORHOOD; NESTEDNESS	Frugivores select their food in a hierarchical way, from plants to individual fruits, to meet their nutritional requirements. According to the optimal diet theory, finding, handling, and digesting fruits is costly, thus plant species that increase attractiveness and reward are usually preferred by frugivores. The same should be expected for individual plants of the same population, which differ from one another in traits related to frugivore attraction. We tested the hypothesis that plant traits that increase attractiveness and reward to frugivores would be strongly selected by birds in a population of Henriettea succosa (Melastomataceae). In 20 h of focal observation in 19 individual trees (380 h in total), we measured plant and fruit traits known to influence frugivore attraction and reward: plant height, fruit size, and fruit sugar content. In addition, we recorded bird behaviour during fruit consumption. We built two weighted networks of birds and individual plants: one monolayer network and a multilayer network with four layers, one for each type of behaviour. First, we evaluated three weighted descriptors of network structure: nestedness, modularity, and specialization. Then, we calculated metrics of centrality and correlated them with plant traits. We recorded 271 visits by 22 bird species of eight families. The network is modular and specialized, showing that subgroups of H. succosa trees with different trait combinations attract different subsets of bird species, in a way that specialist trees are not connected to a subset of the bird species that visit generalist trees. We also found that centrality metrics reached higher scores in plants with lower height, larger fruits, and intermediate sucrose content. Fruit handling was the predominant foraging behaviour in the multilayer network and represented 90 percent of the interactions. Downscaling a plant-frugivore network to its individual trees showed that the structure of the system is influenced by interindividual variations in the tree population, in which individuals with the best combination of traits occupied central positions in the network.

Rapid land use change threatens provisioning ecosystem services in miombo woodlands	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM			English	Article						Livelihoods; rural poor; Tanzania; deforestation; non-timber forest products	POVERTY ALLEVIATION; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITIES; EXPERIENCES; DIVERSITY	Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa rely upon provisioning ecosystem services (ES) to support their livelihoods, yet in areas where rapid land use change is occurring the relationship between environmental change, provisioning ES availability and livelihoods is not fully understood. This relationship is explored here within a typical rural miombo woodland landscape in south-west Tanzania, which is undergoing rapid land use change due to expanding tobacco cultivation. The types of provisioning ES used, who uses them, changes in their availability, and the possible future impacts of these changes were explored using a mixed-method approach. Our findings identify 19 provisioning ES used by households regardless of economic status. Firewood, building materials, and fresh water are used by almost all households, and these are perceived to be declining in availability. Households identified this as a negative environmental impact of land use change and that provisioning ES loss would be 'bad' for their households. Given the multi-purpose nature of miombo woodlands, an adaptive co-management approach, which can achieve multiple objectives through encouraging participation, learning, and empowerment of local communities, could be an appropriate strategy to achieve sustainable land use management and maintain the provision of ES within miombo woodland landscapes of sub-Saharan Africa.

Linking variability in climate to wetland habitat suitability: is it possible to forecast regional responses from simple climate measures?	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Wetland hydroregime; Climate; Water availability; Annual dynamics; Wetland-breeding amphibians; Habitat suitability	DROUGHT SEVERITY INDEX; GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT; BREEDING PHENOLOGY; TEMPORARY WETLANDS; SOIL-MOISTURE; VERNAL POOLS; HYDROPERIOD; SALAMANDER; AMPHIBIANS	Temporary wetlands have value to both ecological and social systems. Interactions between local climate and the surrounding landscape result in patterns of hydrology that are unique to temporary wetlands. These seasonal and annual fluctuations in wetland inundation contribute to community composition and richness. Thus, predicting wetland community responses to environmental change is tied to the ability to predict wetland hydroregime. Detailed monitoring of wetland hydroregime is resource-intensive, limiting the scope and scale of forecasting. As an alternative, we determine which freely available measures of water availability best predict one component of wetland hydroregime, habitat suitability (i.e., the predictability of water in a wetland) within and among geographic regions. We used data from three North American regions to determine the climate index that best explained year-to-year variation in habitat suitability during a key phenological periodamphibian breeding. We demonstrate that simple, short-term climate indices based solely on precipitation data best predict habitat suitability in vernal pools in the northeast, montane wetlands in the west and coastal plain wetlands in the southeast. These relationships can help understand how changes in short-term precipitation patterns as a result of climate change may influence the overall hydroregime, and resulting biodiversity, of temporary wetlands across disparate biomes.

Assessing the effects of mesh enclosures on invertebrates and litter breakdown in a floodplain forest of the Southeastern USA	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Litter breakdown; Mesh; Invertebrate; Microclimate; Floodplain; Chinese privet	PRIVET LIGUSTRUM-SINENSE; DECOMPOSITION; MICROARTHROPODS	The litter bag method has been used to study litter breakdown for over 50years but remains a criticized technique. One major criticism is the effect of mesh enclosures, specifically the use of two or more mesh sizes to evaluate the role of arthropods, on litter breakdown. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new basket-style mesh enclosure in mitigating microclimatic mesh effects while still excluding invertebrates. We evaluated five basket treatments constructed from 300-mu m mesh: no basket, closed basket, closed basket with bottom slits, open basket, and open basket with bottom slits, which held invasive Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense) litter on the Oconee-River floodplain, GA, USA. After 134days, we found that temperature and humidity did not vary among treatments but that litter breakdown rates (k) and invertebrate composition were different among treatments. Litter breakdown was faster in the no basket treatment (the most open treatment) than in closed baskets without slits (the most closed treatment). Microinvertebrates were not effectively excluded from baskets but most macroinvertebrates were excluded from baskets (open and closed) without slits, except for some small predators. Unexpectedly, we found some evidence that using litter bags of two different mesh sizes may have a secondary trophic effect on litter breakdown, further complicating how best to evaluate the impact of arthropods on litter breakdown.

For all 3years, the population dynamics and biodiversity of NTAs were analyzed to determine if any differences might be attributable to the genetically modified (GM) maize being evaluated. The main NTAs in these fields were Aphidoidea, Pentatomidae,Araneae, and Coccinellidae. Temporal variation in NTA diversity across sample dates within a year showed no significant differences between the Bt maize and the non-Bt maize field in the total number of individuals of the dominant arthropod species per 25 plants, the Shannon index (H), Pielou index (J), Simpson index (D), and Bray-Curtis index. The cultivation of Bt corn failed to show any detrimental evidence on individuals, H, J, D, and Bray-Curtis index of NTAs, and these parameters were identical in Bt and non-Bt corn plots. These results provide further evidence of the lack of ecological impact of GM maize.

This study aimed to investigate the interaction between the effects of plant intraspecific diversity and a root-knot nematode on primary production and community evenness. Methods A greenhouse experiment was conducted by using intraspecific diversity of a clover-grass community through sowing 2-, 4-, 8- and 16-cultivar mixtures of Trifolium pratense L. and Lolium perenne L. and by adding the nematode Meloidogyne hapla. We investigated the effects of plant intraspecific diversity and M. hapla on biomass of plant community, biomass of cultivar individuals and community evenness. Important Findings We found that L. perenne dominated the communities, yet its biomass was not affected by the treatments. Meloidogyne hapla influenced the effect of plant intraspecific diversity on aboveground biomass of T. pratense at the four-cultivar mixture level of plant intraspecific diversity. Community evenness increased linearly with increasing plant intraspecific diversity, and M. hapla affected community evenness at the four-cultivar mixture level. Both T. pratense and L. perenne cultivars differed in aboveground biomass. Depending on plant intraspecific diversity and cultivar identity, nematode addition positively affected the aboveground biomass of T. pratense individuals. The response of T. pratense cultivars to M. hapla and to various plant intraspecific diversity levels influenced the intraspecific diversity-productivity relationship. This study highlights the influence of M. hapla on the effect of plant intraspecific diversity on aboveground biomass of T. pratense, suggesting that future research on the impact of intraspecific plant diversity on ecosystem functions should consider the effects of soil organisms.

Indigenous agricultural practices in the western Amazon Basin are known as chakras, and their structure and dynamics are seemingly optimal for forest management. However, the variability in tree species and the degree of forest recovery after abandonment is poorly documented in this agroforestry system (AFS). The goals of this study were: (i) to investigate whether the different AFSs (chakras) preserve similar levels of forest diversity, (ii) to determine the effect of transformation of mature forests (MF) to chakras, in particular, forest alpha and beta diversity levels, and (iii) to investigate whether native tree species recovery leads to the original forest structure following chakra abandonment. Methods We assessed the floristic composition in three AFSs (cassava, corn, and cocoa), the secondary forest (SF), and the forest remnants in the buffer zone of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA). All tree species with a diameter at breast height (dbh) 10 cm were inventoried in 61 plots (0.28 ha average) representing 17.44 ha. Alpha diversity was calculated in all systems to determine the levels of variability using species richness and the Shannon diversity index. Also, beta diversity was examined to evaluate the degree of dissimilarity among all AFSs with the MF in order to analyze changes in floristic composition. The divergence between the SF and the MF was analyzed to ascertain forest recovery after chakra abandonment. Important Findings A total of 4,060 trees (dbh 10 cm) representing 109 species, 96 genera, and 43 plant families were inventoried in 17.44 ha sampled in five systems in the buffer zone of the NEA. The most dominant plant families were Arecaceae, Myristicaceae, Fabaceae, Meliaceae, and Malvaceae, and the most representative genera included Iriartea, Virola, Guarea, Ocotea, Cordia, Chrysophyllum, and Inga. The MF in this zone is composed of 81 tree species circumscribed in 74 genera and 30 plant families. Transforming this MF to different chakras leads to a decrease of alpha diversity between 52% and 75%, particularly in AFS practiced for local food security (corn and cassava). However, all the AFSs preserve ca. 56% of the native flora existing in the MF, in which at least 8% of the species are threatened; however, the status of the remaining 92% of species is still unknown, indicating that the assessment of the rarity of the native trees is virtually unexplored. Additionally, all sites investigated consistently formed three clusters that corresponded to AFS, MF, and SF. Thus, the trend of forests to recover the original structure is facilitated by native trees left intact in the chakras. These results strongly support the potential to execute sustainable forest management and preservation of endangered tree species practicing this AFS.	[Vera, Roy R. V.; Cota-Sanchez, J.

Several researchers have hypothesized that a patchy distribution of soil nutrients could result in size-asymmetric root competition. We tested this hypothesis. Methods In a greenhouse experiment, Triticum aestivum (wheat) individuals of different initial sizes were grown alone or with below-ground competition from one neighbour, in 1 m tall, narrow containers in a nitrogen-poor field soil with (i) no added nitrogen, (ii) nitrogen fertilizer mixed into the upper 50 cm, and (iii) the same amount of fertilizer mixed into a 20-30 cm deep layer. We measured total leaf length throughout the experiment, and above-ground biomass and nitrogen concentration at harvest. We also measured root depth and frequency over time in a subset of containers. Important Findings Competing plants were half the size of non-competing plants, meaning that root competition was very strong. Root competition was size-asymmetric to some degree in all soil treatments. Neighbours larger than the target plant showed a greater per-unit-size effect on target growth than neighbours smaller than the target. Size variation increased over time for competing individuals, but decreased for non-competing pairs. Contrary to expectations, the presence of a high-nutrient patch reduced the strength and size asymmetry of competition temporarily. Size asymmetry in poor, deep soils may result from directionality in resource interception as roots compete for limited nutrients by growing deeper into soil layers that have not yet been exploited. Root competition can be size asymmetric, but not to the same degree as competition for light.

Environmental landscape determinants of maximum forest canopy height of boreal forests	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						forest succession; vegetation structure; quantile regression; remote sensing; airborne laser scanning (ALS)	OLD-GROWTH; GLOBAL PATTERNS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIDAR; LIMITS; TREE; DISTURBANCE; DIVERSITY; INDEX; MAPS	Aims Canopy height is a key driver of forest biodiversity and carbon cycling. Accurate estimates of canopy height are needed for assessing mechanisms relating to ecological patterns and processes of tree height limitations. At global scales forest canopy height patterns are largely controlled by climate, while local variation at fine scales is due to differences in disturbance history and local patterns in environmental conditions. The relative effect of local environmental drivers on canopy height is poorly understood partly due to gaps in data on canopy height and methods for examining limiting factors. Here, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data on vegetation structure of boreal forests to examine the effects of environmental factors on potential maximum forest canopy height. Methods Relationships between maximum canopy height from ALS measures and environmental variables were examined to assess factors limiting tree height. Specifically, we used quantile regression at the 0.90 quantile to relate maximum canopy height with environmental characteristics of climate (i.e. mean annual temperature [MAT] and mean annual precipitation), terrain (i.e. slope) and depth-to-water (DTW) across a 33000 km(2) multiple use boreal forest landscape in northeast Alberta, Canada. Important Findings Maximum canopy height was positively associated with MAT, terrain slope and terrain-derived DTW, collectively explaining 33.2% of the variation in heights. The strongest explanatory variable was DTW explaining 26% of canopy height variation with peatland forests having naturally shorter maximum canopy heights, but also more sites currently at their maximum potential height. In contrast, the most productive forests (i.e. mesic to xeric upland forests) had the fewest sites at their potential maximum height, illustrating the effects of long-term forest management, wildfires and general anthropogenic footprints on reducing the extent and abundance of older, taller forest habitat in Alberta's boreal forest.

The present study aims to understand the ways in which niche-based and spatially based processes influence community assembly in areas in different climatic conditions and how these processes change during the transition from seedling to adult. Methods In this study, we investigated how taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity in seedling and adult stages of forest trees change across three elevational transects in tropical, subtropical and subalpine forests in Southwest China, and the relationships of these changes to the environment and inter-site distances. We quantified the relative contribution of environmental conditions and spatial distribution to taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity of both seedling and adult life stages along each elevational transect. We also quantified the taxonomic and phylogenetic similarity between seedlings and adult trees along elevations. Important Findings Taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity of both seedlings and adult trees increased with an increase in both environmental distance and spatial distance in all three transects. On both taxonomic and phylogenetic levels, the effects of environmental filtering and spatial disposition varied between life stages and among forest types. Phylogenetic similarity between seedlings and adult trees increased with elevation, although the taxonomic similarity did not show clear elevational patterns. Our results suggest that the relative contribution of niche-based and space-based processes to taxonomic and phylogenetic assemblages varies across major plant life stages and among forest types. Our findings also highlight the importance of ontogenetic stages for fully understanding community assembly of long-lived tree species.

K.			The function of floral orientation in bluebells: interactions with pollinators and rain in two species of Mertensia (Boraginaceae)	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						floral orientation; male and female fitness; Mertensia; pollinators; rain	FLOWER ORIENTATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; AQUILEGIA-FORMOSA; FACING FLOWERS; POLLEN; SYSTEM; WATER	Aims Pollinators are traditionally considered to be the primary agent of selection on floral traits. However, floral traits may also be under selection from abiotic agents (e.g. rain), which makes considering the relative importance of pollinators and abiotic selective agents on floral traits essential. The functional significance of floral orientation is often ascribed to pollinator attraction, but orientation can also protect reproductive structures from rain. Therefore, a study that incorporates both factors will enhance our understanding of the ecological roles of floral orientation in plant fitness. Mertensia brevistyla and M. fusiformis are herbaceous species that differ in their floral orientations. A series of field and laboratory experiments was used to investigate the adaptive function of floral orientation in these species, particularly with respect to pollinators and rain. Methods We measured and compared floral orientation and visitor assemblages between M. brevistyla and M. fusiformis populations in western Colorado, USA. We manipulated floral stems and conducted a choice experiment with floral visitors, and also compared orientations of pollinator-visited stems with those of unvisited stems in a natural setting. We examined pollinator- and rain-mediated selection on floral orientation by manipulating orientation, conducting supplemental pollinations, applying watering treatments and measuring subsequent seed set. We also experimentally tested the likelihood of rain contact with anthers, and the effect of rainwater on pollen germinability. Important Findings Mertensia brevistyla had a significantly more upright floral orientation than M. fusiformis, and seed set was highest in upright M. brevistyla and in horizontal/pendant M. fusiformis stems, supporting an adaptive function (via female fitness) of the interspecific difference in orientation. However, floral visitor assemblages did not differ significantly between the two species; visitors did not exhibit significant preference for either orientation; and pollinator-mediated selection on orientation was undetectable. Similarly, there was little effect of water on seed set in either species, regardless of floral orientation. However, pollen germinability was reduced in both species by immersion in water; and water was more likely to contact anthers in M. fusiformis than in M. brevistyla, due to interspecific differences in floral morphology. We conclude that pollinators are likely not the primary selective agent driving differences in orientation in these Mertensia species. Instead, the negative effect of rain on pollen germinability helps explain the more pendant orientation of M. fusiformis, while short anthers in more upright M. brevistyla provide an alternative adaptation to rain. The selective agent driving effects of orientation on seed set remains unclear. This study illustrates the necessity of considering male fitness and abiotic agents in interpreting the functional significance of inflorescence traits.	[Lin, Shang-Yao; Forrest, Jessica R.

Pollination studies are currently flourishing at all possible levels of interaction organization (i.e., species, guild, group and network), and different methodological protocols aimed to define the resilience of pollination interactions have been proposed. However, the temporal dimension of the resilience of pollination interactions has been often overlooked. In the light of these considerations, we addressed the following questions: does a temporal approach help to reveal critical moments during the flowering season, when pollination interactions are less resilient to perturbations? Do pollination interactions evaluated at species, guild, group and network level show different patterns when assessed through time? Methods We monitored contacts between plant and pollinator species in dry grassland communities every 15 days during the overall community flowering season (12 surveys). For each survey, we built a quantitative plant-pollinator interaction matrix and we calculated two sets of metrics characterizing, respectively, the diversity and the distribution of interactions across hierarchical levels. To describe the diversity of interactions, we calculated partner diversity (PD) at the species level, vulnerability/generality (V/G) at the guild level, and interaction diversity and evenness at the network level. The distribution of interactions was characterized by calculating selectiveness at the species and the network level, and modularity at the group level. We assessed the temporal variation of PD, V/G at the level of plants and pollinators, and species selectiveness, by means of Linear Mixed Models (LMMs). To investigate the temporal variation of indexes calculated at group and network level, we applied simple linear and quadratic regressions after checking for temporal autocorrelation in residuals. Important Findings When taking into account the temporal dimension of interactions, the diversity of interactions showed different patterns at different levels of organization. At the species level, no relationship was disclosed between PD and time, when assessing the temporal trend of V/G separately for the guild of plants and pollinators we observed an asymmetric structure of interactions. Pollination interactions showed to be asymmetric throughout the flowering season; however, evenness of interactions and network selectiveness showed significant positive relationships with time, revealing a poorer network of interactions during the end of the flowering season. The temporal analysis of pollination interactions revealed a stronger risk of secondary extinctions at the end of the flowering season, due to a lower degree of redundancy and thus of resilience of the overall network of interactions.

In order to determine whether certain species have a competitive advantage over others, we explored the water-relations and leaf-gas exchange of four co-occurring species in a forest in northern Aotearoa-New Zealand. We studied the ecologically and culturally significant foundation species, Agathis australis (a conifer), two additional conifers, Phyllocladus trichomanoides and Podocarpus totara and the angiosperm Knightia excelsa. Methods We measured sap flow, leaf-gas exchange and xylem water potentials of leaves and terminal branches with concurrent measures of micrometeorological data on days with very few clouds. We derived whole tree hydraulic conductance and instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUEi) at our remnant forest in west Auckland during February 2015 (southern hemisphere summer). Important Findings The four species behaved similarly in their diurnal curves of gas exchange and water potential. Rates of assimilation, stomatal conductance and WUEi were similar among trees of different species. Whole tree hydraulic conductance was also similar among species. These results indicate functional convergence in water relations, possibly driven by low nutrient soils at the site. Our results suggest that there is no species with a clear adaptive advantage over the others in the context of climate change.

However, not all lineages are affected equally. From an anthropocentric perspective, it is often purported that humans hold a unique place on Earth. Here, we show that our current impacts on the natural world risk realizing that expectation. We simulated species loss on the mammalian phylogenetic tree, informed by species current extinction risks. We explored how Homo sapiens could become isolated in the tree if species currently threatened with extinction disappeared. We analyzed correlates of mammal extinctions risks that may drive this isolation pattern. We show that, within mammals, and more particularly within primates, extinction risks increase with the number of known threat types, and decrease with geographic range size. Extinctions increase with species body mass, trophic level, and the median longitudinal extent of each species range in mammals but not within primates. The risks of extinction are frequently high among H.sapiens close relatives. Pruning threatened primates, including apes (Hominidae, Hylobatidae), from the tree of life will lead to our species being among those with the fewest close relatives. If no action is taken, we will thus not only lose crucial biodiversity for the preservation of Earth ecosystems, but also a key living reference to what makes us human.

Black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) (Rosaceae) is a forest tree species widespread in eastern North America, and found sporadically in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Guatemala. IBD has been studied in relatively few North American plant taxa, and no study has rigorously sampled across the range of such a widespread species. In this study, IBD and overall genetic structure were assessed in eastern black cherry (P. serotina Ehrh. var. serotina), the widespread variety of eastern North America. Eastern North America. Prunus serotina Ehrh. var. serotina (Rosaceae). Dense sampling across the entire range of eastern black cherry was made possible by genotyping 15 microsatellite loci in 439 herbarium samples from all portions of the range. Mantel tests and STRUCTURE analyses were performed to evaluate the hypothesis of IBD and genetic structure. Mantel tests demonstrated significant but weak IBD, while STRUCTURE analyses revealed no clear geographic pattern of genetic groups. The modest geographic/genetic structure across the eastern black cherry range suggests widespread gene flow in this taxon. This is consistent with P.serotina's status as a disturbance-associated species. Further studies should similarly evaluate IBD in species characteristic of low-disturbance forests.

Spatial ecology of a range-expanding bumble bee pollinator	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						colonization; foraging distance; genetic structure; invasive species; microsatellite; population biology	FORAGING DISTANCE; NEST DENSITY; MICROSATELLITE DNA; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; SIBSHIP INFERENCE; R-PACKAGE; CONSERVATION; PARENTAGE; PATERNITY; PROGRAM	Molecular methods have greatly increased our understanding of the previously cryptic spatial ecology of bumble bees (Bombus spp.), with knowledge of the spatial ecology of these bees being central to conserving their essential pollination services. Bombus hypnorum, the Tree Bumble Bee, is unusual in that it has recently rapidly expanded its range, having colonized much of the UK mainland since 2001. However, the spatial ecology of B.hypnorum has not previously been investigated. To address this issue, and to investigate whether specific features of the spatial ecology of B.hypnorum are associated with its rapid range expansion, we used 14 microsatellite markers to estimate worker foraging distance, nest density, between-year lineage survival rate and isolation by distance in a representative UK B.hypnorum population. After assigning workers to colonies based on full or half sibship, we estimated the mean colony-specific worker foraging distance as 103.6m, considerably less than values reported from most other bumble bee populations. Estimated nest density was notably high (2.56 and 0.72 colonies ha(-1) in 2014 and 2015, respectively), estimated between-year lineage survival rate was 0.07, and there was no evidence of fine-scale isolation by distance. In addition, genotyping stored sperm dissected from sampled queens confirmed polyandry in this population (mean minimum mating frequency of 1.7 males per queen). Overall, our findings establish critical spatial ecological parameters and the mating system of this unusual bumble bee population and suggest that short worker foraging distances and high nest densities are associated with its rapid range expansion.

A description of nesting behaviors, including factors impacting nest site selection, in black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						communal breeding; creche; infant parking; lemuriform; Madagascar; strepsirrhines	MATE CHOICE; PARENTAL BEHAVIOR; PENDULINE TITS; VULPES-VULPES; NATIONAL-PARK; DEN SITES; RED FOX; SUCCESS; INFORMATION; HABITAT	Nest site selection is at once fundamental to reproduction and a poorly understood component of many organisms' reproductive investment. This study investigates the nesting behaviors of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, a litter-bearing primate from the southeastern rainforests of Madagascar. Using a combination of behavioral, geospatial, and demographic data, I test the hypotheses that environmental and social cues influence nest site selection and that these decisions ultimately impact maternal reproductive success. Gestating females built multiple large nests throughout their territories. Of these, females used only a fraction of the originally constructed nests, as well as several parking locations as infants aged. Nest construction was best predicted by environmental cues, including the size of the nesting tree and density of feeding trees within a 75m radius of the nest, whereas nest use depended largely on the size and average distance to feeding trees within that same area. Microhabitat characteristics were unrelated to whether females built or used nests. Although unrelated to nest site selection, social cues, specifically the average distance to conspecifics' nest and park sites, were related to maternal reproductive success; mothers whose litters were parked in closer proximity to others' nests experienced higher infant survival than those whose nests were more isolated. This is likely because nesting proximity facilitated communal creche use by neighboring females. Together, these results suggest a complex pattern of nesting behaviors that involves females strategically building nests in areas with high potential resource abundance, using nests in areas according to their realized productivity, and communally rearing infants within a network of nests distributed throughout the larger communal territory.

Landscape genetics reveal broad and fine-scale population structure due to landscape features and climate history in the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) in North Dakota	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						amphibians; isolation by distance; paleoclimate; post-Pleistocene recolonization; species distribution model; watershed	GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; LITHOBATES-PIPIENS; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; HOLOCENE CLIMATE; GLACIAL REFUGIA; GREAT-PLAINS; MOON LAKE; WOOD FROG; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION	Prehistoric climate and landscape features play large roles structuring wildlife populations. The amphibians of the northern Great Plains of North America present an opportunity to investigate how these factors affect colonization, migration, and current population genetic structure. This study used 11 microsatellite loci to genotype 1,230 northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) from 41 wetlands (30 samples/wetland) across North Dakota. Genetic structure of the sampled frogs was evaluated using Bayesian and multivariate clustering methods. All analyses produced concordant results, identifying a major east-west split between two R. pipiens population clusters separated by the Missouri River. Substructuring within the two major identified population clusters was also found. Spatial principal component analysis (sPCA) and variance partitioning analysis identified distance, river basins, and the Missouri River as the most important landscape factors differentiating R.pipiens populations across the state. Bayesian reconstruction of coalescence times suggested the major east-west split occurred similar to 13-18kya during a period of glacial retreat in the northern Great Plains and substructuring largely occurred similar to 5-11kya during a period of extreme drought cycles. A range-wide species distribution model (SDM) for R.pipiens was developed and applied to prehistoric climate conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (21kya) and the mid-Holocene (6kya) from the CCSM4 climate model to identify potential refugia. The SDM indicated potential refugia existed in South Dakota or further south in Nebraska. The ancestral populations of R.pipiens in North Dakota may have inhabited these refugia, but more sampling outside the state is needed to reconstruct the route of colonization. Using microsatellite genotype data, this study determined that colonization from glacial refugia, drought dynamics in the northern Great Plains, and major rivers acting as barriers to gene flow were the defining forces shaping the regional population structure of R.pipiens in North Dakota.

Effects of soil nitrogen on diploid advantage in fireweed, Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						adaptation; autopolyploidy; fitness; global change; resource allocation strategies; soil nitrogen	PLANT POLYPLOIDY; FOLIAR HERBIVORY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; GENOME SIZE; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE; DEPOSITION; LIMITATION; EVOLUTION	In many ecosystems, plant growth and reproduction are nitrogen limited. Current and predicted increases of global reactive nitrogen could alter the ecological and evolutionary trajectories of plant populations. Nitrogen is a major component of nucleic acids and cell structures, and it has been predicted that organisms with larger genomes should require more nitrogen for growth and reproduction and be more negatively affected by nitrogen scarcities than organisms with smaller genomes. In a greenhouse experiment, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the amount of soil nitrogen supplied differentially influenced the performance (fitness, growth, and resource allocation strategies) of diploid and autotetraploid fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium). We found that soil nitrogen levels differentially impacted cytotype performance, and in general, diploids were favored under low nitrogen conditions, but this diploid advantage disappeared under nitrogen enrichment. Specifically, when nitrogen was scarce, diploids produced more seeds and allocated more biomass toward seed production relative to investment in plant biomass or total plant nitrogen than did tetraploids. As nitrogen supplied increased, such discrepancies between cytotypes disappeared. We also found that cytotype resource allocation strategies were differentially dependent on soil nitrogen, and that whereas diploids adopted resource allocation strategies that favored current season reproduction when nitrogen was limiting and future reproduction when nitrogen was more plentiful, tetraploids adopted resource allocation strategies that favored current season reproduction under nitrogen enrichment. Together these results suggest nitrogen enrichment could differentially affect cytotype performance, which could have implications for cytotypes' ecological and evolutionary dynamics under a globally changing climate.

However, there is little basic information on eDNA, including the eDNA shedding and degradation processes. This study focused on water temperature and fish biomass and showed that eDNA shedding, degradation, and size distribution varied depending on water temperature and fish biomass. The tank experiments consisted of four temperature levels and three fish biomass levels. The total eDNA and size-fractioned eDNA from Japanese Jack Mackerels (Trachurus japonicus) were quantified before and after removing the fish. The results showed that the eDNA shedding rate increased at higher water temperature and larger fish biomass, and the eDNA decay rate also increased at higher temperature and fish biomass. In addition, the small-sized eDNA fractions were proportionally larger at higher temperatures, and these proportions varied among fish biomass. After removing the fish from the tanks, the percentage of eDNA temporally decreased when the eDNA size fraction was >10 mu m, while the smaller size fractions increased. These results have the potential to make the use of eDNA analysis more widespread in the future.

By adjusting filtering assumptions, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets can be reused to give new insights into the genetic basis of divergence and speciation without targeted resampling of specimens. Filtering only for missing data and minor allele frequency, we used a combination of principal components analysis and linkage disequilibrium network analysis to distinguish three cohorts of variable SNPs in the mountain pine beetle in western Canada, including one that was sex-linked and one that was geographically associated. These marker cohorts indicate genomically localized differentiation, and their detection demonstrates an accessible and intuitive method for discovering potential islands of genomic divergence without a priori knowledge of a species' genomic architecture. Thus, this method has utility for directly addressing the genomic architecture of species and generating new hypotheses for functional research.	[Trevoy, Stephen A.

In southern Sweden, the moth-pollinated orchid Platanthera bifolia occurs as a woodland and a grassland ecotype that differ in dominating pollinators. The woodland ecotype is taller (expected to influence pollinator attraction) and produces flowers with longer spurs (expected to influence efficiency of pollen transfer) compared to the grassland ecotype. We examined whether plant height and spur length affect pollination and reproductive success in a woodland population, and whether effects are non-additive, as expected for traits influencing two multiplicative components of pollen transfer. We reduced plant height and spur length to match trait values observed in the grassland ecotype and determined the effects on pollen removal, pollen receipt, and fruit production. In addition, to examine the effects of naturally occurring variation, we quantified pollinator-mediated selection through pollen removal and seed production in the same population. Reductions of plant height and spur length decreased pollen removal, number of flowers receiving pollen, mean pollen receipt per pollinated flower, and fruit production per plant, but no significant interaction effect was detected. The selection analysis demonstrated pollinator-mediated selection for taller plants via female fitness. However, there was no current selection mediated by pollinators on spur length, and pollen removal was not related to plant height or spur length. The results show that, although both traits are important for pollination success and female fitness in the woodland habitat, only plant height was sufficiently variable in the study population for current pollinator-mediated selection to be detected. More generally, the results illustrate how a combination of experimental approaches can be used to identify both traits and agents of selection.

Long-term declines in winter body mass of tits throughout Britain and Ireland correlate with climate change	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						body mass regulation; climate change; Paridae; predation risk; supplementary feeding; trade-off; wing length	NATURAL-SELECTION; GREAT; POPULATION; EVOLUTION	The optimum body mass of passerine birds typically represents a trade-off between starvation risk, which promotes fat gain, and predation pressure, which promotes fat loss to maintain maneuvrability. Changes in ecological factors that affect either of these variables will therefore change the optimum body masses of populations of passerine birds. This study sought to identify and quantify the effects of changing temperatures and predation pressures on the body masses and wing lengths of populations of passerine birds throughout Britain and Ireland over the last 50years. We analyzed over 900,000 individual measurements of body mass and wing length of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, coal tits Periparus ater, and great tits Parus major collected by licenced bird ringers throughout Britain and Ireland from 1965 to 2017 and correlated these with publicly available temperature data and published, UK-wide data on the abundance of a key predator, the sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus. We found highly significant, long-term, UK-wide decreases in winter body masses of adults and juveniles of all three species. We also found highly significant negative correlations between winter body mass and winter temperature, and between winter body mass and sparrowhawk abundance. Independent of these effects, body mass further correlated negatively with calendar year, suggesting that less well understood dynamic factors, such as supplementary feeding levels, may play a major role in determining population optimum body masses. Wing lengths of these birds also decreased, suggesting a hitherto unobserved large-scale evolutionary adjustment of wing loading to the lower body mass. These findings provide crucial evidence of the ways in which species are adapting to climate change and other anthropogenic factors throughout Britain and Ireland. Such processes are likely to have widespread implications as the equilibria controlling evolutionary optima in species worldwide are upset by rapid, anthropogenic ecological changes.

The integrative effects of behavior and morphology on amphibian movement	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						amphibian movement; behavioral variation; jump performance; life history; morphology; movement behavior	LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; ORGANISMAL PERFORMANCE; JUMPING PERFORMANCE; DISPERSAL BEHAVIOR; HABITAT SELECTION; CONNECTIVITY; POPULATION; DENSITY; POND; SIZE	Animal movement and dispersal are key factors in population dynamics and support complex ecosystem processes like cross-boundary subsidies. Juvenile dispersal is an important mechanism for many species and often involves navigation in unfamiliar habitats. For species that metamorphose, such as amphibians, this transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments involves the growth and use of new morphological traits (e.g., legs). These traits strongly impact the fundamental ability of an organism to move in novel landscapes, but innate behaviors can regulate choices that result in the realized movements expressed. By assessing the integrative role of morphology and behavior, we can improve our understanding of juvenile movement, particularly in understudied organisms like amphibians. We assessed the roles of morphological (snout-vent length and relative leg length) and performance (maximal jump distance) traits in shaping the free movement paths, measured through fluorescent powder tracking, in three anuran species, Pacific treefrog (Hyliola regilla), Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas), and Cascades frog (Rana cascadae). We standardized the measurement of these traits to compare the relative role of species' innate differences versus physical traits in shaping movement. Innate differences, captured by species identity, were the most significant factor influencing movement paths via total movement distance and path sinuosity. Relative leg length was an important contributor but significantly interacted with species identity. Maximal jump performance, which was significantly predicted by morphological traits, was not an important factor in movement behavior relative to species identity. The importance of species identity and associated behavioral differences in realized movement provide evidence for inherent species differences being central to the dispersal and movement of these species. This behavior may stem from niche partitioning of these sympatric species, yet it also calls into question assumptions generalizing anuran movement behavior. These species-level effects are important in framing differences as past research is applied in management planning.

Understanding the individual contribution of these two factors to the change of species distribution could be very important in order to effectively counteract the species range contraction, especially in mountains, where alpine species are strongly limited in finding new areas to be colonized at higher elevations. We proposed a method to disentangle the effects of the two drivers of range change for breeding birds in Italian Alps, in the case of co-occurring climate warming and shrub and forest encroachment. For each species, from 1982 to 2017, we related the estimated yearly elevational distribution of birds to the correspondent overall average of the daily minimum temperatures during the breeding season and the estimated amount of shrubs and forest cover. Using a hierarchical partitioning approach, we assessed the net contribution (i.e., without the shared effect) of each driver. Both temperature and shrub and forest cover showed a positive trend along the time series and resulted the most likely causes of the significant elevational displacement for 21 of the 29 investigated birds. While shrub and forest cover was found to be an important driver of the expansion of forest bird range toward higher elevations, the effect of temperature on favouring the colonization of previously climatically unsuitable forests at higher elevations was not negligible. Shrub and forest expansion resulted the main driver of the range contraction for edge and open habitat species, which suffered a distribution shrinkage at their lower elevational boundary. In light of climate warming, these results highlighted how the net range loss for edge and open habitat species, caused by shrub and forest encroachment consequent to land abandonment, should be counteracted by implementing proper conservation management strategies and promoting sustainable economic activities in rangeland areas.

However, the relative importance of these ecological drivers for multiple facets of diversity is still poorly understood in highland streams. Here, we examined the responses of three facets of stream macroinvertebrate alpha diversity to local environmental, landscape-climate and spatial factors in a near-pristine highland riverine ecosystem. Taxonomic (species richness, Shannon diversity, and evenness), functional (functional richness, evenness, divergence, and Rao's Quadratic entropy), and a proxy of phylogenetic alpha diversity (taxonomic distinctness and variation in taxonomic distinctness) were calculated for macroinvertebrate assemblages in 55 stream sites. Then Pearson correlation coefficient was used to explore congruence of indices within and across the three diversity facets. Finally, multiple linear regression models and variation partitioning were employed to identify the relative importance of different ecological drivers of biodiversity. We found most correlations between the diversity indices within the same facet, and between functional richness and species richness were relatively strong. The two phylogenetic diversity indices were quite independent from taxonomic diversity but correlated with functional diversity indices to some extent. Taxonomic and functional diversity were more strongly determined by environmental variables, while phylogenetic diversity was better explained by spatial factors. In terms of environmental variables, habitat-scale variables describing habitat complexity and water physical features played the primary role in determining the diversity patterns of all three facets, whereas landscape factors appeared less influential. Our findings indicated that both environmental and spatial factors are important ecological drivers for biodiversity patterns of macroinvertebrates in Tibetan streams, although their relative importance was contingent on different facets of diversity. Such findings verified the complementary roles of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, and highlighted the importance of comprehensively considering multiple ecological drivers for different facets of diversity in biodiversity assessment.

Phenotypic plasticity differs among species and traits and changes across environments. Here, we investigated phenotypic plasticity of the widespread grass Arrhenatherum elatius in response to winter warming and frost stress by comparing phenotypic plasticity of 11 geographically and environmentally distinct populations of this species to phenotypic plasticity of populations of different species originating from a single environment. The variation in phenotypic plasticity was similar for populations of a single species from different locations compared to populations of functionally and taxonomically diverse species from one environment for the studied traits (leaf biomass production and root integrity after frost) across three indices of phenotypic plasticity (RDPI, PIN, slope of reaction norm). Phenotypic plasticity was not associated with neutral genetic diversity but closely linked to the climate of the populations' origin. Populations originating from warmer and more variable climates showed higher phenotypic plasticity. This indicates that phenotypic plasticity can itself be considered as a trait subject to local adaptation to climate. Finally, our data emphasize that high phenotypic plasticity is not per se positive for adaptation to climate change, as differences in stress responses are resulting in high phenotypic plasticity as expressed by common plasticity indices, which is likely to be related to increased mortality under stress in more plastic populations.

Understanding of the dynamics of these forests for conservation is limited. We evaluated the long-term succession of wet-sclerophyll forest on World Heritage listed K'gari (Fraser Island)the world's largest sand island. We recorded the presence and growth of tree species in three 0.4 hectare plots that had been subjected to selective logging, fire, and cyclone disturbance over 65years, from 1952 to 2017. Irrespective of disturbance regimes, which varied between plots, rainforest trees recruited at much faster rates than the dominant wet-sclerophyll forest trees, narrowly endemic species Syncarpia hillii and more common Lophostemon confertus. Syncarpia hillii did not recruit at the plot with the least disturbance and recruited only in low numbers at plots with more prominent disturbance regimes in the 10cm at breast height size. Lophostemon confertus recruited at all plots but in much lower numbers than rainforest trees. Only five L.confertus were detected in the smallest size class (<10cm diameter) in the 2017 survey. Overall, we find evidence that more pronounced disturbance regimes than those that have occurred over the past 65years may be required to conserve this wet-sclerophyll forest, as without intervention, transition to rainforest is a likely trajectory. Fire and other management tools should therefore be explored, in collaboration with Indigenous landowners, to ensure conservation of this wet-sclerophyll forest.

However, experimental evidence from natural communities is still rare. Here, we tested the competition-dispersal trade-off hypothesis in an alpine grassland in the Tianshan Mountains, Xinjiang, China, by quantifying competitive and dispersal ability using a combination of 4 plant traits (seed mass, ramet mass, height, and dispersal mode). Our results show that the competition-dispersal trade-off exists in the alpine grassland community and that this pattern was primarily demonstrated by forbs. The results suggest that most forb species are constrained to be either good competitors or good dispersers but not both, while there was no significant trade-off between competitive and dispersal ability for most graminoids. This might occur because graminoids undergo clonal reproduction, which allows them to find more benign microenvironments, forage for nutrients across a large area and store resources in clonal structures, and they are thus not strictly limited by the particular resources at our study site. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the CD trade-off has been tested for plants across the whole life cycle in a natural multispecies plant community, and more comprehensive studies are still needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and the linkage between the CD trade-off and community composition.

Morphological diet analysis has been the primary method used to quantify the diets of predators, but emerging molecular techniques using genetic data can provide more accurate estimates of relative diet composition. This study used sequences from the 18S V9 rRNA barcoding region to identify prey items in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of predatory fishes. Predator GI samples were taken from the Black River, Cheboygan Co., MI, USA (n=367 samples, 12 predator species) during periods of high prey availability, including the larval stage of regionally threatened lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque 1817) in late May/early June of 2015 and of relatively lower prey availability in early July of 2015. DNA was extracted and sequenced from 355 samples (96.7%), and prey DNA was identified in 286 of the 355 samples (80.6%). Prey were grouped into 33 ecologically significant taxonomic groups based on the lowest taxonomic level sequences that could be identified using sequences available on GenBank. Changes in the makeup of diet composition, dietary overlap, and predator preference were analyzed comparing the periods of high and low prey abundance. Some predator species exhibited significant seasonal changes in diet composition. Dietary overlap was slightly but significantly higher during the period of high prey abundance; however, there was little change in predator preference. This suggests that change in prey availability was the driving factor in changing predator diet composition and dietary overlap. This study demonstrates the utility of molecular diet analysis and how temporal variability in community composition adds complexity to predator-prey interactions.

I tested this prediction in three polar seabird species characterized by different levels of predator specialization. In the Antarctic petrel, for which the only predator was highly specialized, hatching dates were highly synchronous and chicks that hatched close to the mean hatching date had a higher survival. In black-legged kittiwakes and Brunnich's guillemots, whose predators were generalists, breeding was less synchronous and there was no fitness advantage in hatching close to the mean. This study emphasizes the potential importance of the relative timing of reproduction for individual fitness and supports the hypothesis that the adaptive value of breeding synchrony depends on the predator functional response.

Additionally to reservoir operation, candidate models included a variety of parameters and processes that may influence grayling populations such as flow, temperature, density dependence, and bird predation. Population parameters analyzed included total densities, young of the year numbers, and larval densities. These analyses were supplemented by a characterization of sediments and sedimentation patterns in the reach. Investigations were carried out in six sites affected by flushing and in one control site. A total of thirteen flushing operations have been undertaken within the study period leading to considerable remobilization of fine sediments and gravel. Due to seasonal and hydrological restrictions, not every flood could be used for flushing. These limitations led to an interrupted management throughout the chain of reservoirs as well as to long time intervals between flushing events with possible effects on spawning habitat quality. None of the investigated population parameters was affected by flushing, and thus, the study generally supports the current reservoir management scheme. Our analyses revealed the magnitude and timing of high water events, temperature, and density-dependent effects, that is, population densities the year before, as the most influential variables for grayling population dynamics in the investigated stretch. The siltation of reservoirs is a significant problem for reservoir storage, flood protection, river deltas, and coastal zones. Its managementwhich is inevitable to safeguard river deltas and secure flood protectionposes also the challenge to safeguard riverine ecosystems below reservoirs. Based on our experience, we propose a periodic flushing regime in concordance with the hydrograph thereby mimicking the timing, magnitude, frequency, and duration of natural SSC pulses and gravel transport. This flushing regime minimizes adverse downstream environmental impacts and maximizes benefits.

Fruit production tends to be highly unequal among trees of the same species, which may be due to environmental factors. We observed fruit production for similar to 2,000 trees of 17 species across 3years in a wet tropical forest in Costa Rica. Fruit production was modeled as a function of tree size, nutrient availability, and neighborhood crowding. Following model selection, tree size and neighborhood crowding predicted both the probability of reproduction and the number of fruit produced. Nutrient availability only predicted only the probability of reproduction. In all species, larger trees were more likely to be reproductive and produce more fruit. In addition, number of fruit was strongly negatively related to presence of larger neighboring trees in 13 species; presence of all neighboring trees had a weak-to-moderate negative influence on reproductive status in 16 species. Among various metrics of soil nutrient availability, only sum of base cations was positively associated with reproductive status, and for only four species. Synthesis Overall, these results suggest that direct influences on fruit production tend to be mediated through tree size and crowding from neighboring trees, rather than soil nutrients. However, we found variation in the effects of neighbors and nutrients among species; mechanistic studies of allocation to fruit production are needed to explain these differences.

Here, we present the Univariate Community Assembly Analysis (UniCAA) and test its ability to address three hypotheses: species occurrences within communities are (a) limited by spatially restricted dispersal; (b) environmentally filtered; or (c) the outcome of stochasticityso that as community size decreasesspecies that are common outside a local community have a disproportionately higher probability of occurrence than rare species. The comparison with a null model allows assessing if the influence of each of the three processes differs from what one would expect under a purely stochastic distribution of species. We tested the framework by simulating empirical metacommunities under 15 scenarios that differed with respect to the strengths of spatially restricted dispersal (restricted vs. not restricted); habitat isolation (low, intermediate, and high immigration rates); and environmental filtering (strong, intermediate, and no filtering). Through these tests, we found that UniCAA rarely produced false positives for the influence of the three processes, yielding a type-I error rate 5%. The type-II error rate, that is, production of false negatives, was also acceptable and within the typical cutoff (20%). We demonstrate that the UniCAA provides a flexible framework for retrieving the processes behind community assembly and propose avenues for future developments of the framework.	[Sydenham, Markus A.

Ground-truthing ENMs provide important information about how these factors relate to species-specific requirements at a scale that is biologically relevant for the species. Chimpanzees are territorial and have a predominantly frugivorous diet. The spatial and temporal variation in fruit availability for different chimpanzee populations is thus crucial, but rarely depicted in ENMs. The genetic and geographic distinction within Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) populations represents a unique opportunity to understand fine scale species-relevant ecological variation in relation to ENMs. In Cameroon, P.t.ellioti is composed of two genetically distinct populations that occupy different niches: rainforests in western Cameroon and forest-woodland-savanna mosaic (ecotone) in central Cameroon. We investigated habitat variation at three representative sites using chimpanzee-relevant environmental variables, including fruit availability, to assess how these variables distinguish these niches from one another. Contrary to the assumption of most ENM studies that intact forest is essential for the survival of chimpanzees, we hypothesized that the ecotone and human-modified habitats in Cameroon have sufficient resources to sustain large chimpanzee populations. Rainfall, and the diversity, density, and size of trees were higher at the rainforest. The ecotone had a higher density of terrestrial herbs and lianas. Fruit availability was higher at Ganga (ecotone) than at Bekob and Njuma. Seasonal variation in fruit availability was highest at Ganga, and periods of fruit scarcity were longer than at the rainforest sites. Introduced and secondary forest species linked with anthropogenic modification were common at Bekob, which reduced seasonality in fruit availability. Our findings highlight the value of incorporating fine scale species-relevant ecological data to create more realistic models, which have implications for local conservation planning efforts.

We use three data sets on plant height over time and two validation methodsin-sample model fit and leave-one-species-out cross-validationto evaluate non-linear growth model predictive performance based on functional traits. In-sample measures of model fit differed substantially from out-of-sample model predictive performance; the best fitting models were rarely the best predictive models. Careful selection of predictor variables reduced the bias in parameter estimates, and there was no single best model across our three data sets. Testing and comparing multiple model forms is important. We developed an R package with a formula interface for straightforward fitting and validation of hierarchical, non-linear growth models. Our intent is to encourage thorough testing of multiple growth model forms and an increased emphasis on assessing model fit relative to a model's purpose.	[Thomas, Freya M.; Yen, Jian D.

The social spider mite, Stigmaeopsis miscanthi, does exhibit lethal male fights, and this male-male aggressiveness varies among populations. To understand the evolution of lethal fighting, we investigated aggressiveness in 42 populations and phylogenetic relationships in 47 populations along the Japanese archipelago. By analysis of the male weapon morph, a proxy for aggressiveness, we confirmed the existence of a mildly aggressive (ML) form, besides the low aggression (LW) and high aggression (HG) forms reported earlier. To evaluate demographic history of these three forms, we employed the approximate Bayesian computation approach using mtCOI sequences and taking into consideration the postlast glacial expansion history of the host plant, Miscanthus sinensis. As results, hierarchical split models are more likely to explain the observed genetic pattern than admixture models, and the ML form in the subtropical region was considered the ancestral group. The inferred demographic history was consistent with the one reconstructed for the host plant in a previous study. The LW form was split from the ML form during the last glacial period (20,000-40,000years BP), and subsequently, the HG form was split from the ML form at the end of or after the last glacial period (5,494-10,988years BP). The results also suggest that the mite invaded Japan more than once, resulting in the present parapatric distribution of LW and HG forms in eastern Japan.

Body mass as a supertrait linked to abundance and behavioral dominance in hummingbirds: A phylogenetic approach	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						ancestral states; body mass; morphological traits; phylogenetic signal	EVOLUTIONARY DISTINCTIVENESS; NICHE CONSERVATISM; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; SIZE; TRAITS; LIKELIHOOD; NETWORKS; SIGNAL; DIVERSIFICATION; SPECIALIZATION	Body mass has been considered one of the most critical organismal traits, and its role in many ecological processes has been widely studied. In hummingbirds, body mass has been linked to ecological features such as foraging performance, metabolic rates, and cost of flying, among others. We used an evolutionary approach to test whether body mass is a good predictor of two of the main ecological features of hummingbirds: their abundances and behavioral dominance. To determine whether a species was abundant and/or behaviorally dominant, we used information from the literature on 249 hummingbird species. For abundance, we classified a species as plentiful if it was described as the most abundant species in at least part of its geographic distribution, while we deemed a species to be behaviorally dominant when it was described as pugnacious (notably aggressive). We found that plentiful hummingbird species had intermediate body masses and were more phylogenetically related to each other than expected by chance. Conversely, behaviorally dominant species tended to have larger body masses and showed a random pattern of distribution in the phylogeny. Additionally, small-bodied hummingbird species were not considered plentiful by our definition and did not exhibit behavioral dominance. These results suggest a link between body mass, abundance, and behavioral dominance in hummingbirds. Our findings indicate the existence of a body mass range associated with the capacity of hummingbird species to be plentiful, behaviorally dominant, or to show both traits. The mechanisms behind these relationships are still unclear; however, our results provide support for the hypothesis that body mass is a supertrait that explains abundance and behavioral dominance in hummingbirds.

Environmental DNA metabarcoding of wild flowers reveals diverse communities of terrestrial arthropods	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						arthropods; eDNA; environmental DNA metabarcoding; flowers; grassland; insects; pollinators	MITOCHONDRIAL METAGENOMICS; BIODIVERSITY; DECLINES; INSECTS; PLANTS; EXTRACTION; RANGE; TOOL; PCR; KEY	Terrestrial arthropods comprise the most species-rich communities on Earth, and grassland flowers provide resources for hundreds of thousands of arthropod species. Diverse grassland ecosystems worldwide are threatened by various types of environmental change, which has led to decline in arthropod diversity. At the same time, monitoring grassland arthropod diversity is time-consuming and strictly dependent on declining taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of complex samples has demonstrated that information on species compositions can be efficiently and non-invasively obtained. Here, we test the potential of wild flowers as a novel source of arthropod eDNA. We performed eDNA metabarcoding of flowers from several different plant species using two sets of generic primers, targeting the mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA and COI. Our results show that terrestrial arthropod species leave traces of DNA on the flowers that they interact with. We obtained eDNA from at least 135 arthropod species in 67 families and 14 orders, together representing diverse ecological groups including pollinators, parasitoids, gall inducers, predators, and phytophagous species. Arthropod communities clustered together according to plant species. Our data also indicate that this experiment was not exhaustive, and that an even higher arthropod richness could be obtained using this eDNA approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain information on diverse communities of insects and other terrestrial arthropods from eDNA metabarcoding of wild flowers. This novel source of eDNA represents a vast potential for addressing fundamental research questions in ecology, obtaining data on cryptic and unknown species of plant-associated arthropods, as well as applied research on pest management or conservation of endangered species such as wild pollinators.

Allometric scaling laws have been used to overcome this problem. However, most existing models rely upon small sample sizes, geographically restricted sampling and have limited applicability for non-bee taxa. Allometric models that consider biogeography, phylogenetic relatedness, and intraspecific variation are urgently required to ensure greater accuracy. We measured body size as dry weight and intertegular distance (ITD) of 391 bee species (4,035 specimens) and 103 hoverfly species (399 specimens) across four biogeographic regions: Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. We updated existing models within a Bayesian mixed-model framework to test the power of ITD to predict interspecific variation in pollinator dry weight in interaction with different co-variates: phylogeny or taxonomy, sexual dimorphism, and biogeographic region. In addition, we used ordinary least squares regression to assess intraspecific dry weight ITD relationships for ten bees and five hoverfly species. Including co-variates led to more robust interspecific body size predictions for both bees and hoverflies relative to models with the ITD alone. In contrast, at the intraspecific level, our results demonstrate that the ITD is an inconsistent predictor of body size for bees and hoverflies. The use of allometric scaling laws to estimate body size is more suitable for interspecific comparative analyses than assessing intraspecific variation. Collectively, these models form the basis of the dynamic R package, pollimetry, which provides a comprehensive resource for allometric pollination research worldwide.

However, obtaining biological samples directly from wild individuals may represent a challenge, and thus, indirect passive sampling (without capturing bats) is sometimes used as an alternative. Currently, it is not known whether the bacterial community assessed using this approach provides an accurate representation of the bat microbiota. This study was designed to compare the use of direct sampling (based on bat capture and handling) and indirect sampling (collection of bat's excretions under bat colonies) in assessing bacterial communities in bats. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of urine and feces samples from Rousettus aegyptiacus, a cave-dwelling fruit bat species, we found evidence of niche specialization among different excreta samples, independent of the sampling approach. However, sampling approach influenced both the alpha- and beta-diversity of urinary and fecal microbiotas. In particular, increased alpha-diversity and more overlapping composition between urine and feces samples was seen when direct sampling was used, suggesting that cross-contamination may occur when collecting samples directly from bats in hand. In contrast, results from indirect sampling in the cave may be biased by environmental contamination. Our methodological comparison suggested some influence of the sampling approach on the bat-associated microbiota, but both approaches were able to capture differences among excreta samples. Assessment of these techniques opens an avenue to use more indirect sampling, in order to explore microbial community dynamics in bats.

However, there are some tree species that defy this expectation and grow in large clusters of conspecific juveniles and adults. We hypothesize that conspecifics living in clusters show higher and/or more variable defensive profiles than conspecifics with dispersed distributions. We evaluated our hypothesis by assessing the expression of physical leaf traits (thickness, and the resistance to punch, tear and shear) and leaf chemical defenses for six clustered and six non-clustered tree species in Yasuni National Park, Ecuadorian Amazon. We ask ourselves whether (a) clustered species have leaves with higher physical resistance to damage and more chemical defenses variability than non-clustered species; (b) saplings of clustered species may show higher physical resistance to damage and higher variation on chemical leaf defenses than their conspecific adults, and (c) saplings of non-clustered species show lower resistance to physical damage and lower variation in chemical defenses compared to conspecific adults. Overall, our study did not support any of our hypotheses. Remarkably, we found that soluble metabolites were significantly species-specific. Our study suggests that plants physical but not chemical leaf antiherbivore defenses may be a crucial strategy for explaining survivorship of clustered species. Trees in Yasuni may also fall along a suite of tolerance/escape/defense strategies based on limitations of each species physiological constraints for survival and establishment. We conclude that other mechanisms, such as those related to indirect defenses, soil nutrient exploitation efficiency, volatile organic compounds, delayed leaf-greening, and seed dispersal mechanisms, shall be evaluated to understand conspecific coexistence in this forest.

Differences in wetland management influence resource availability for ducks and mortality risk from duck hunting. The local distribution of the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is affected by this resource heterogeneity and variable risk from hunting. Regional conservation strategies primarily focus on how waterfowl distributions are affected by food resources during the nonbreeding season. To test if Mallard resource selection was related to the abundance of resources, risks, or a combination, we studied resource selection of adult female Mallards during autumn and winter. We developed a digital spatial layer for Lake St. Clair, Ontario, Canada, that classified resources important to Mallards and assigned these resources a risk level based on ownership type and presumed disturbance from hunting. We monitored 59 individuals with GPS back-pack transmitters prior to, during, and after the hunting season and used discrete choice modeling to generate diurnal and nocturnal resource selection estimates. The model that classified available resources and presumed risk best explained Mallard resource selection strategies. Resource selection varied within and among seasons. Ducks selected for federal, state and private managed wetland complexes that provided an intermediate or relatively greater amount of refuge and foraging options than public hunting areas. Across all diel periods and seasons, there was selection for federally managed marshes and private supplemental feeding refuges that prohibited hunting. Mallard resource selection demonstrated trade-offs related to the management of mortality risk, anthropogenic disturbances, and foraging opportunities. Understanding how waterfowl respond to heterogeneous landscapes of resources and risks can inform regional conservation strategies related to waterfowl distribution during the nonbreeding season.

We sought to quantify the characteristics and persistence of material legacies (e.g., biotic residuals of disturbance) that arise from variation in fire severity in an eastern ponderosa pine forest in North America. We compared forest stand structure and understory woody plant and bird community composition and species richness across unburned, low-, moderate-, and high-severity burn patches in a 27-year-old mixed-severity wildfire that had received minimal post-fire management. We identified distinct tree densities (high: 14.3 +/- 7.4 trees per ha, moderate: 22.3 +/- 12.6, low: 135.3 +/- 57.1, unburned: 907.9 +/- 246.2) and coarse woody debris cover (high: 8.5 +/- 1.6% cover per 30m transect, moderate: 4.3 +/- 0.7, low: 2.3 +/- 0.6, unburned: 1.0 +/- 0.4) among burn severities. Understory woody plant communities differed between high-severity patches, moderate- and low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p<0.05). Bird communities differed between high- and moderate-severity patches, low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p<0.05). Bird species richness varied across burn severities: low-severity patches had the highest (5.29 +/- 1.44) and high-severity patches had the lowest (2.87 +/- 0.72). Understory woody plant richness was highest in unburned (5.93 +/- 1.10) and high-severity (5.07 +/- 1.17) patches, and it was lower in moderate- (3.43 +/- 1.17) and low-severity (3.43 +/- 1.06) patches. We show material fire legacies persisted decades after the mixed-severity wildfire in eastern ponderosa forest, fostering distinct structures, communities, and species in burned versus unburned patches and across fire severities. At a patch scale, eastern and western ponderosa system responses to mixed-severity fires were consistent.

Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are thermokarst disturbances forming large open depressions on hillslopes through soil wasting and vegetation displacement. Tall (>0.5m) deciduous shrubs have been observed in RTS a decade after disturbance. RTS may provide conditions suitable for seedling recruitment, which may contribute to Arctic shrub expansion. We quantified in situ seedling abundance, and size and viability of soil seedbanks in greenhouse trials for two RTS chronosequences near lakes on Alaska's North Slope. We hypothesized recent RTS provide microsites for greater recruitment than mature RTS or undisturbed tundra. We also hypothesized soil seedbanks demonstrate quantity-quality trade-offs; younger seedbanks contain smaller numbers of mostly viable seed that decrease in viability as seed accumulates over time. We found five times as many seedlings in younger RTS as in older RTS, including birch and willow, and no seedlings in undisturbed tundra. Higher seedling counts were associated with bare soil, warmer soils, higher soil available nitrogen, and less plant cover. Seedbank viability was unrelated to size. Older seedbanks were larger at one chronosequence, with no difference in percent germination. At the other chronosequence, germination was lower from older seedbanks but seedbank size was not different. Seedbank germination was positively associated with in situ seedling abundance at one RTS chronosequence, suggesting postdisturbance revegetation from seedbanks. Thermal erosion may be important for recruitment in tundra by providing bare microsites that are warmer, more nutrient-rich, and less vegetated than in undisturbed ground. Differences between two chronosequences in seedbank size, viability, and species composition suggest disturbance interacts with local conditions to form seedbanks. RTS may act as seedling nurseries to benefit many Arctic species as climate changes, particularly those that do not produce persistent seed.

This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26ppt to 19ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting 10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.

We use Drosophila sechellia, a dietary specialist fruit fly that evolved to specialize on a single toxic host plant, Morinda citrifolia, as a model for adaptive phenotypic change and seek to determine the genetic basis of traits associated with host specialization in this species. The fruit of M.citrifolia is toxic to other drosophilids, primarily due to high levels of the defense chemical octanoic acid (OA), yet D.sechellia has evolved resistance to OA. Our prior work identified three Osiris family genes that reside in a fine-mapped QTL for OA resistance: Osiris 6 (Osi6), Osi7, and Osi8, which can alter OA resistance in adult D.melanogaster when knocked down with RNA interference suggesting they may contribute to OA resistance in D.sechellia. Genetic mapping identified overlapping genomic regions involved in larval and adult OA resistance in D.sechellia, yet it remains unknown whether Osiris genes contribute to resistance in both life stages. Furthermore, because multiple genomic regions contribute to OA resistance, we aim to identify other gene(s) involved in this adaptation. Here, we identify candidate larval OA resistance genes using RNA sequencing to measure genome-wide differential gene expression in D.sechellia larvae after exposure to OA and functionally test identified genes for a role in OA resistance. We then test the Osiris genes previously shown to alter adult OA resistance for effects on OA resistance in larvae. We found that Osi8 knockdown decreased OA resistance in D.melanogaster larvae. These data suggest that evolved changes in Osi8 could impact OA resistance in multiple life stages while Osi6 and Osi7 may only impact adult resistance to OA.

In this study, we analyzed host health and fitness responses to increasing ectoparasite burdens along with the presence/absence of hemoparasites of free-ranging insular rock iguanas (Cyclura cychlura) in The Bahamas. Using hematology, plasma biochemistry, as well as body condition and growth rate comparisons, we failed to find significant associations of tick burdens with annual growth rate, corticosterone, packed cell volume, total white blood cell, and heterophil, monocyte, eosinophil or hemoglobin measures. We did, however, find mixed and significant associations of tick burdens with lymphocyte and basophil counts, heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratios, and body condition indices. These associations varied by sex, size, and hemoparasite infection status suggesting that different life stages of iguanas may invest differently in immune responses, and impacts may be modulated based on size and sex of hosts, and coinfection status.

This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the phylogeography of the European stone crayfish (Austropotamobius torrentium) and includes samples from previously unstudied sites. Two mitochondrial markers were used to reveal evolutionary relationships among haplogroups throughout the species' distributional range and to estimate the divergence time by employing both substitution rates and geological calibration methods. Our haplotype network reconstruction and phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of a previously unknown haplogroup distributed in Romania's Apuseni Mountains. This haplogroup is closely related to others that are endemic in the Dinarides, despite their vast geographical separation (600km). The separation is best explained by the well-dated tectonic displacement of the Tisza-Dacia microplate, which started in the Miocene (16Ma) and possibly carried part of the A. torrentium population to the current location of the Apuseni Mountains. This population may thus have been isolated from the Dinarides for a period of ca. 11m.y. by marine and lacustrine phases of the Pannonian Basin. The inclusion of this geological event as a calibration point in divergence time analyses challenges currently accepted crayfish evolutionary time frames for the region, constraining the evolution of this area's crayfish to a much earlier date. We discuss why molecular clock calibrations previously employed to date European crayfish species divergences should therefore be reconsidered.

One hypothesized mechanism by which many exotic plants can become invasive is through the disruption of key plant-mycorrhizal mutualisms, yet few studies have investigated how these disruptions can lead to invader success. We present an individual-based model to examine how mutualism strengths between a native plant (Impatiens capensis) and mycorrhizal fungus can influence invasion success for a widespread plant invader, Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard). Two questions were investigated as follows: (a) How does the strength of the mutualism between the native I.capensis and a mycorrhizal fungus affect resistance (i.e., native plant maintaining >60% of final equilibrium plant density) to garlic mustard invasion? (b) Is there a non-linear relationship between initial garlic mustard density and invasiveness (i.e., garlic mustard representing >60% of final equilibrium plant density)? Our findings indicate that either low (i.e., facultative) or high (i.e., obligate) mutualism strengths between the native plant and mycorrhizal fungus were more likely to lead to garlic mustard invasiveness than intermediate levels, which resulted in higher resistance to garlic mustard invasion. Intermediate mutualism strengths allowed I.capensis to take advantage of increased fitness when the fungus was present but remained competitive enough to sustain high numbers without the fungus. Though strong mutualisms had the highest fitness without the invader, they proved most susceptible to invasion because the loss of the mycorrhizal fungus resulted in a reproductive output too low to compete with garlic mustard. Weak mutualisms were more competitive than strong mutualisms but still led to garlic mustard invasion. Furthermore, we found that under intermediate mutualism strengths, the initial density of garlic mustard (as a proxy for different levels of plant invasion) did not influence its invasion success, as high initial densities of garlic mustard did not lead to it becoming dominant. Our results indicate that plants that form weak or strong mutualisms with mycorrhizal fungi are most vulnerable to invasion, whereas intermediate mutualisms provide the highest resistance to an allelopathic invader.

Extensive secondary contact among three glacial lineages of Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) in Labrador and Newfoundland	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Arctic char; glacial refugia; introgression; mitochondrial DNA; North America; phylogeography; secondary contact	WHITEFISH COREGONUS-CLUPEAFORMIS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; NATURAL HYBRIDIZATION; EFFECTIVE POPULATION; S-FONTINALIS; HYBRID ZONES; GANDER LAKE; DIVERGENCE	AimThe Pleistocene glaciation event prompted the allopatric divergence of multiple glacial lineages of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), some of which have come into secondary contact upon their recolonization of the Holarctic. While three glacial lineages (Arctic, Atlantic, and Acadian) are known to have recolonized the western Atlantic, the degree of overlap of these three lineages is largely unknown. We sought to determine the distribution of these three glacial lineages in Labrador and Newfoundland at a fine spatial scale to assess their potential for introgression and their relative contribution to local fisheries. LocationLabrador and Newfoundland, Canada. MethodsWe sequenced a portion of the D-loop region in over 1,000 Arctic char (S.alpinus) samples from 67 locations across Labrador and Newfoundland. ResultsWithin Labrador, the Arctic and Atlantic lineages were widespread. Two locations (one landlocked and one with access to the sea) also contained individuals of the Acadian lineage, constituting the first record of this lineage in Labrador. Atlantic and Acadian lineage individuals were found in both eastern and western Newfoundland. Multiple sampling locations in Labrador and Newfoundland contained fish of two or more different glacial lineages, implying their introgression. Glacial lineage did not appear to dictate contemporary genetic divergence between the pale and dark morph of char present in Gander Lake, Newfoundland. Both were predominately of the Atlantic lineage, suggesting the potential for their divergence in sympatry. Main conclusionsOur study reveals Labrador and Newfoundland to be a unique junction of three glacial lineages which have likely hybridized extensively in this region.

The location of such hybrid zones can be influenced by environmental variables, and an ecological context can provide unique insights into the mechanisms by which species diverge and are maintained. Two ecologically differentiated species of small benthic fishes, the endemic and imperiled prairie chub, Macrhybopsis australis, and the shoal chub, Macrhybopsis hyostoma, are locally sympatric within the upper Red River Basin of Texas. We integrated population genomic data and environmental data to investigate species divergence and the maintenance of species boundaries in these two species. We found evidence of advanced-generation asymmetric hybridization and introgression, with shoal chub alleles introgressing more frequently into prairie chubs than the reciprocal. Using a Bayesian Genomic Cline framework, patterns of genomic introgression were revealed to be quite heterogeneous, yet shoal chub alleles were found to have likely selectively introgressed across species boundaries significantly more often than prairie chub alleles, potentially explaining some of the observed asymmetry in hybridization. These patterns were remarkably consistent across two sampled geographic regions of hybridization. Several environmental variables were found to significantly predict individual admixture, suggesting ecological isolation might maintain species boundaries.	[Sotola, V.

Toward reliable population density estimates of partially marked populations using spatially explicit mark-resight methods	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						camera trap; capture-recapture; fox; maximum likelihood; mesopredator; survey design; Vulpes vulpes	CAPTURE-RECAPTURE; CAMERA-TRAPS; MAMMALS; MODELS; RESPONSES	Camera traps are used increasingly to estimate population density for elusive and difficult to observe species. A standard practice for mammalian surveys is to place cameras on roads, trails, and paths to maximize detections and/or increase efficiency in the field. However, for many species it is unclear whether track-based camera surveys provide reliable estimates of population density. Understanding how the spatial arrangement of camera traps affects population density estimates is of key interest to contemporary conservationists and managers given the rapid increase in camera-based wildlife surveys. We evaluated the effect of camera-trap placement, using several survey designs, on density estimates of a widespread mesopredator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, over a two-year period in a semi-arid conservation reserve in south-eastern Australia. Further, we used the certainty in the identity and whereabouts of individuals (via GPS collars) to assess how resighting rates of marked foxes affect density estimates using maximum likelihood spatially explicit mark-resight methods. Fox detection rates were much higher at cameras placed on tracks compared with off-track cameras, yet in the majority of sessions, camera placement had relatively little effect on point estimates of density. However, for each survey design, the precision of density estimates varied considerably across sessions, influenced heavily by the absolute number of marked foxes detected, the number of times marked foxes was resighted, and the number of detection events of unmarked foxes. Our research demonstrates that the precision of population density estimates using spatially explicit mark-resight models is sensitive to resighting rates of identifiable individuals. Nonetheless, camera surveys based either on- or off-track can provide reliable estimates of population density using spatially explicit mark-resight models. This underscores the importance of incorporating information on the spatial behavior of the subject species when planning camera-trap surveys.

However, few studies have simultaneously compared the relative roles of these factors in shaping the mammal diversity patterns for different feeding groups, that is, herbivores, insectivores, and carnivores. In this study, we assessed the relations between mammal diversity and current climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation), altitudinal range as well as mammal's food diversity in Inner Mongolia. Our results showed that the species richness for the three feeding guilds of mammals consistently increased with their food diversity, that is, species richness of plants, insects, and rodents. Mammal diversity also significantly decreased with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Random Forest models indicated that climate and food diversity were always included in the combinations of variables most associated with mammal diversity. Our findings suggest that while climate is an important predictor of large scale distribution of mammal diversity, biotic interactions, that is, food diversity, could also play important roles.

Examining the beta diversity and its components could enhance the understanding of community assembly mechanism. We studied the beta diversity pattern of the soil enchytraeids along a distinct elevational gradient (705-2,280m) on the Changbai Mountain, the best-preserved mountain in northeastern China. The overall abundance-based community dissimilarity was relatively high (ca. 0.70), largely due to the balanced-variation component (85%). The overall dissimilarity and its balanced-variation (substitution) component were related to both local environmental heterogeneity and elevational distance, with the environmental relationships being stronger. In contrast, the abundance-gradient (subsets) component was not related to the two gradients. The same important spatial and environmental variables were detected in structuring overall dissimilarity and substitution component, different from that in subsets component. Variation partitioning analysis showed that environmental control played a more important role than spatial (vertical and horizontal) factors in structuring the patterns of overall beta diversity and its two components. The predictive power of multivariate analysis was higher for the substitution component (nearly 50%) and overall dissimilarity (35%), but much lower for subsets components (<4%). These findings implied that abundance-based beta diversity patterns of the soil enchytraeids were the results of different ecological processes (e.g., environmental sorting and dispersal limitation), operating in the two antithetic components. Our study showed the substitution and loss of individuals reflecting different ecological processes and highlights the importance of partitioning beta diversity in assessing biodiversity patterns and their causes.

However, the direction and magnitude of these effects, and how such patterns are altered with increasing temperature, are rarely studied. Through laboratory functional response experiments, we tested whether the per capita feeding efficiency of an invasive generalist herbivore, the golden apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, is dependent on the biogeographic origin and phylogenetic relatedness of host plants, and how increasing temperature alters these dependencies. The feeding efficiency of the herbivore was highest on plant species with which it had no shared evolutionary history, that is, novel plants. Further, among evolutionarily familiar plants, snail feeding efficiency was higher on those species more closely related to the novel plants. However, these biogeographic dependencies became less pronounced with increasing temperature, whereas the phylogenetic dependence was unaffected. Collectively, our findings indicate that the susceptibility of plants to this invasive herbivore is mediated by both biogeographic origin and phylogenetic relatedness.

We hypothesized that due to the lesser energy requirement of ammonium (NH4+)-use, in contrast to nitrate (NO3-)-use, more energy remains for other metabolic processes, especially under CO2-and phosphorus (Pi) limiting conditions. Therefore, we tested differences in cell characteristics of the green alga Chlamydomonas acidophila grown on NH4+ or NO3- under covariation of CO2 and Pi-supply in order to determine limitations, in a full-factorial design. As expected, results revealed higher carbon fixation rates for NH4+ grown cells compared to growth with NO3- under low CO2 conditions. NO3- -grown cells accumulated more of the nine analyzed amino acids, especially under Pi-limited conditions, compared to cells provided with NH4+. This is probably due to a slower protein synthesis in cells provided with NO3-. In contrast to our expectations, compared to NH4+ -grown cells NO3- -grown cells had higher photosynthetic efficiency under Pi-limitation. In conclusion, growth on the Ni-source NH4+ did not result in a clearly enhanced Ci-assimilation, as it was highly dependent on Pi and CO2 conditions (replete or limited). Results are potentially connected to the fact that C. acidophila is able to use only CO2 as its inorganic carbon (Ci) source.

Current studies, however, mainly focus on climatic and edaphic variables and rarely explore the effects of mineral protection in regulating soil organic carbon (SOC) stock over broad geographic scale. Particularly, the relative importance of mineral protection compared with other factors is unclear. Based on large-scale soil inventory, here we filled this knowledge gap by exploring the effects of Al/Fe-(hydr) oxides on SOC and three C fractions across Tibetan alpine grasslands via linear regression, partial correlation, and variance partitioning analyses, and also by comparing the degree of mineral protection in alpine grasslands with other ecosystems. Our results showed that SOC and C fractions across Tibetan alpine grasslands were regulated by Al/Fe-(hydr) oxides, with the incorporation of mineral variables increasing the explained variations by 10.1% for SOC content, 13.4% for coarse particulate organic matter, 12.6% for microaggregate associated C, and 21.9% for silt and clay associated C. Moreover, the contribution of mineral effects exceeded that of climatic and edaphic factors, particularly in the silt and clay associated C fraction. In addition, about 15.812.0% of SOC pools were associated with Fe, which was equal to or higher than those in temperate and tropical-subtropical ecosystems. Taken together, these results demonstrate the significant role of Al/Fe minerals in the stabilization of SOC across Tibetan alpine grasslands, highlighting the importance of incorporating C-mineral interactions into ESMs for better understanding the terrestrial C-climate feedback.

The Role of the Ecosystem Engineer, the Leaf-Cutter Ant Atta cephalotes, on Soil CO2 Dynamics in a Wet Tropical Rainforest	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						advective soil CO2 flux measurements; soil CO2 concentration and efflux; soil burrows ventilation; low-cost CO2 flux sensing device; carbon footprint; Free convection in ant nests	ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; WIND-INDUCED VENTILATION; CUTTING ANTS; HOT MOMENTS; LA-SELVA; EFFLUX; NESTS; TERRESTRIAL; GROWTH; VOLLENWEIDERI	Leaf-cutter ants are dominant herbivores that disturb the soil and create biogeochemical hot spots. We studied how leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes impacts soil CO2 dynamics in a wet Neotropical forest. We measured soil CO2 concentration monthly over 2.5years at multiple depths in nonnest and nest soils (some of which were abandoned during the study) and assessed CO2 production. We also measured nest and nonnest soil efflux, nest vent efflux, and vent concentration. Nest soils exhibited lower CO2 accumulation than nonnest soils for the same precipitation amounts. During wet periods, soil CO2 concentrations increased across all depths, but were significantly less in nest than in nonnest soils. Differences were nonsignificant during drier periods. Surface efflux was equal across nest and nonnest plots (5mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), while vent efflux was substantially (10(3) to 10(5) times) greater, a finding attributed to free convection and sporadic forced convection. Vent CO2 concentrations were less than in soil, suggesting CO2 efflux from the soil matrix into the nest. Legacy effects in abandoned nests were still observable after more than two years. These findings indicate that leaf-cutter ant nests provide alternative transport pathways to soil CO2 that increase total emissions and decrease soil CO2 concentrations, and have a lasting impact. Estimated total nest-soil CO2 emissions were 15 to 60% more than in nonnest soils, contributing 0.2 to 0.7% to ecosystem-scale soil emissions. The observed CO2 dynamics illuminate the significant carbon footprint of ecosystem engineer Atta cephalotes and have biogeochemical implications for rainforest ecosystems. Plain Language Summary Leaf-cutter ants modify their habitat to the extent that they are called ecosystem engineers. Living throughout the Americas, they construct massive nests to which they import the vegetation they harvest to feed a fungus they cultivate as their main food source. We studied the most common leaf-cutter ant in Costa Rica to assess the impact of its nests on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in surrounding soils and on soil CO2 emissions. In the Costa Rican rainforest, heavy rains easily clog the clayey soils, accumulating CO2 from microbial and root respiration. During wet periods, we observed lower CO2 concentrations in nest soils relative to nonnest soils. We attribute this difference to the nest structure, which provides ventilation for both nest CO2 and the CO2 originated in the surrounding soil. We also found that soil CO2 emissions were the same in nest and nonnest soils, but nest openings had emissions 100,000 times greater. Consequently, nests and their surrounding soils emit 15 to 60% more CO2 than the equivalent nonnest soil areas. This difference, together with the expanding range of leaf-cutter ants, favored by human activities and warmer climate, has implications with respect to the global carbon cycle.	[Fernandez-Bou, A.

Geophysical Monitoring of Hydrocarbon Biodegradation in Highly Conductive Environments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						SIP; bioremediation; oil spill; biogeophysics	SPECTRAL INDUCED POLARIZATION; LONG-TERM; COMPLEX CONDUCTIVITY; SIGNATURES; BACTERIA; SEDIMENT; SURFACE; NOV.	Natural attenuation is very often the remediation method of necessity, rather than choice, for beach environments impacted by offshore exploration/drilling accidents. Robust methods that can be efficiently utilized in difficult to access and ecologically sensitive areas are needed for the long-term monitoring of such degradation processes. A prime candidate for such a monitoring tool is the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method, a geophysical technique successfully used for characterization and monitoring of hydrocarbon degradation in freshwater environments. In this laboratory experiment the SIP method successfully monitored the natural degradation of beach sediments impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Using the SIP, we were able to differentiate between biotic (e.g., microbial driven) and abiotic (e.g., dilution) degradation processes and infer degradation rates. To our knowledge this is the first effort to use the SIP method as a monitoring aid in high salinity environments. Plain Language Summary Offshore drilling/exploration accidents can result in the contamination of remote and ecologically sensitive areas. In most cases the only realistic remediation choice is natural degradation. In this paper we discuss the use of a noninvasive geophysical method, termed spectral induced polarization, as a monitoring tool of oil contamination degradation in brackish environments. The presented laboratory works supports the suitability of the method for monitoring not only the progress of degradation but also any microbial related degradation processes.

Estimates of nutrient demand at the watershed scale are commonly inferred from reach-scale solute injections, which are typically reported as uptake velocities (v(f)). Multiple interacting processes control v(f), making it challenging to predict how v(f) responds to physical changes in the stream. In this study, we link v(f) to a continuous time random walk model to quantify how v(f) is controlled by in-stream (velocity, dispersion, and benthic reaction) and hyporheic processes (exchange rate, residence times, and hyporheic reaction). We fit the model to conservative (NaCl) and nitrate (NO3--N) pulse tracer injections in unshaded replicate streams at the Notre Dame Linked Experimental Ecosystem Facility, which differed only in substrate size and distribution. Experiments were conducted over the first 25days of biofilm colonization to examine how the interaction between substrate type and biofilm growth influenced modeled processes and v(f). Model fits of benthic reaction rates were approximate to 8x greater than hyporheic reaction rates for all experiments and did not vary with substrate type or over time. High benthic reactivity was associated with filamentous green algae coverage on the streambed, which dominated total algal biomass. Finally, v(f) was most sensitive to benthic reaction rate and stream velocity, and sensitivity varied with stream conditions due to its nonlinear dependence on all modeled processes. Together, these results demonstrate how reach-scale nutrient demand reflects the relative contributions of biotic and abiotic processes in the benthic layer and the hyporheic zone.

Nutrient Enrichment Alters Salt Marsh Fungal Communities and Promotes Putative Fungal Denitrifiers	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Salt marsh; Fungal ecology; Fungal denitrification; Nutrient enrichment; Decomposition	NITROUS-OXIDE; NITRATE REDUCTION; ORGANIC-MATTER; COASTAL EUTROPHICATION; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; DIVERSITY; CARBON; SOIL; FERTILIZATION; DECOMPOSITION	Enrichment of ecosystems with excess nutrients is occurring at an alarming rate and has fundamentally altered ecosystems worldwide. Salt marshes, which lie at the land-sea interface, are highly effective at removing anthropogenic nutrients through the action of macrophytes and through microbial processes in coastal sediments. The response of salt marsh bacteria to excess nitrogen has been documented; however, the role of fungi and their response to excess nitrogen in salt marsh sediments is not fully understood. Here, we document the response of salt marsh fungal communities to long-term excess nitrate in four distinct marsh habitats within a northern temperate marsh complex. We show that salt marsh fungal communities varied as a function of salt marsh habitat, with both fungal abundance and diversity increasing with carbon quantity. Nutrient enrichment altered fungal communities in all habitats through an increase in fungal abundance and the proliferation of putative fungal denitrifiers. Nutrient enrichment also altered marsh carbon quality in low marsh surface sediments where fungal response to nutrient enrichment was most dramatic, suggesting nutrient enrichment can alter organic matter quality in coastal sediments. Our results indicate that fungi, in addition to bacteria, likely play an important role in anaerobic decomposition of salt marsh sediment organic matter.

Among these associated bacteria, actinomycetes have received attention for their ubiquity and diverse roles in forest ecosystems. Here, to examine the association of actinomycetes with ectomycorrhizal root tips, we compared the bacterial and actinomycete communities on the surface and inside of root tips of coastal Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii) colonized by the fungus Cenococcum geophilum. Next-generation sequences of 16S rDNA of bacteria communities using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine showed that the number of bacterial classes in the surface of C. geophilum ECM roots was significantly higher than that in non-ECM roots. The bacterial community structure of surface, inside, and non-ECM roots was significantly discriminated each other. For an isolation method, a total of 762 and 335 actinomycete isolates were obtained from the surface and inside of the roots, respectively. In addition, the isolation ratio of actinomycetes in these root tips varied depending on the age of the tree and the season. Identification of the isolates based on partial 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the isolates belonged to nine genera of the order Actinomycetales. On the surface of the roots, most of the isolates belonged to genus Streptomyces (90.4%); inside of the roots, most of the isolates belonged to genus Actinoallomurus (40.0%), which is a relatively new taxon. Our results suggest that actinomycetes as well as bacteria are ubiquitously associated with C. geophilum ectomycorrhizal roots of P. thunbergii, although their communities can vary either surface or inside of individual root tips.

In this study, the effect of a subterranean rodent of the genus Ctenomys on soil properties and root endophytic fungal propagules in a shrub desert of northwest Argentina was examined. Our main goal was to include among root endophytic fungi not only arbuscular mycorrhiza but also the dark septate endophytes. We compared the abundance of fungal propagules as well as several microbiological and physicochemical parameters between soils from burrows and those from the surrounding landscape. Our results show that food haulage, the deposition of excretions, and soil mixing by rodents' burrowing promote soil patchiness by (1) the enrichment in both types of root endophytic fungal propagules; (2) the increase in organic matter and nutrients; and (3) changes in soil edaphic properties including moisture, field capacity, and texture. These patches may play a critical role as a source of soil heterogeneity in desert ecosystems, where burrows constructed in interpatches of bare soil can act, once abandoned, as islands of fertility, promoting the establishment of plants in an otherwise hostile environment.

However, how moisture and temperature regulate the function of niche- versus neutral-based processes during the assembly of these communities has not been examined considering both the total microbial community and the sole active portion with potential for growth in native subtropical grassland. We set up a well-controlled microcosm-based experiment to investigate the individual and combined effects of moisture and temperature on soil prokaryotic communities by simulating subtropical seasons in grassland. The prokaryotic populations with potential for growth and the total prokaryotic community were assessed by 16S rRNA transcript and 16S rRNA gene analyses, respectively. Moisture was the major factor influencing community diversity and structure, with a considerable effect of this factor on the total community. The prokaryotic populations with potential for growth and the total communities were influenced by the same assembly rules, with the niche-based mechanism being more influential in communities under dry condition. Our results provide new information regarding moisture and temperature in microbial communities of soil and elucidate how coexisting prokaryotic populations, under different physiological statuses, are shaped in native subtropical grassland soil.

We assessed heavy metal (cadmium, copper, manganese, lead and zinc) content in these organisms at nine study sites inside Loja city and three control sites in nearby forests. Concentrations of all studied heavy metals (i.e., cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn)) were highest in downtown Loja. Our study confirms that passive monitoring using lichens and/or bromeliads can be an efficient tool to evaluate heavy metal deposition related to urbanization (e.g., vehicle emissions).

The geometry hypothesis, as one proposed cause of the peninsula effect, attempts to predict this pattern by examining the peculiarities of peninsular geometry. As peninsulas are characterized by their isolated positions, it has been suggested that a decreased immigration-to-extinction rate is the cause of the decrease in species diversity from the base to the tip of a peninsula. We aimed to test the geometry hypothesis on tree species in the Florida peninsula by modeling the latitudinal abundance pattern using sample-based tree inventory data. We postulated that the current abundance distribution of a species is a ramification of past immigration-extinction dynamics in a peninsula, as well as an important indicator of such dynamics in the future. The latitudinal abundance patterns of 113 tree species in Florida in the southeastern United States were simulated with the Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) model using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database. Evidence species for the geometry hypothesis were then selected if the simulated latitudinal abundance pattern was asymmetric with its abundance maxima occurring within the Florida peninsula (i.e., approximately 31.5 degrees latitude or lower). Our HOF model results found that most species (87% of 113 species) did not experience any steep abundance decline along the Florida peninsula when compared with their general trend across the range, suggesting that the observed diversity pattern of tree species in Florida could merely be a continuation of latitudinal diversity gradients in the southeastern United States, independent of peninsular geometry.

Here, we compare changes in the taxonomic and functional composition, and associated traits, of herbivorous reef fish assemblages across a continental shelf, five years before and six months after two severe cyclones and a thermal bleaching event that resulted in substantial and widespread loss of live hard coral cover. Each shelf position maintained a distinct taxonomic assemblage of fishes after disturbances, but the assemblages shared fewer species among shelf positions. There was a substantial loss of species richness following disturbances within each shelf position. Total biomass of the herbivorous fish assemblage increased after disturbances on mid- and outer-shelf reefs, but not on inner-shelf reefs. Using trait-based analyses, we found there was a loss of trait richness at each shelf position, but trait specialisation and originality increased on inner-shelf reefs. This study highlights the pervasiveness of extreme environmental disturbances on ecological assemblages. Whilst distinct cross-shelf assemblages can remain following environmental disturbances, assemblages have reduced richness and are potentially more vulnerable to chronic localised stresses.

Cross-shelf marine systems exhibit pronounced and persistent gradients in environmental conditions; however, these gradients are not always reliable predictors of coral distribution or the degree of stress that corals are experiencing. This study used information from government, industry and scientific datasets spanning 1980-2017, to explore temporal trends in coral cover in the geographically complex system of the Dampier Archipelago, northwest Australia. Coral composition at 15 sites surveyed in 2017 was also modelled against environmental and spatial variables (including turbidity, degree heat weeks, wave exposure, and distance to land/mainland/isobath) to assess their relative importance in structuring coral assemblages. High spatial and temporal heterogeneity was observed in coral cover and recovery trajectories, with reefs located an intermediate distance from the shore maintaining high cover over the past 20 years. The abundance of some prominent genera in 2017 (Acropora, Porites, and Turbinaria spp.) decreased with the distance from the mainland, suggesting that inshore processes play an important role in dictating the distribution of these genera. The atypical distributions of these key reef-building corals and spatial heterogeneity of historical recovery trajectories highlight the risks in making assumptions regarding cross-shelf patterns in geographically complex systems.

Thus, there is little understanding of how associated fishes interact with deeper environments. We examined relationships between deep-reef fish communities and benthic habitat structure. We sampled 48 sites over a large depth gradient (54-260 m) in the central GBR using Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations and multibeam sonar. Fish community composition differed both among multiple shelf-break reefs and habitats within reefs. Epibenthic cover decreased with depth. Deep epibenthic cover included sponges, corals, and macro-algae, with macro-algae present to 194 m. Structural complexity decreased with depth, with more calcified reef, boulders, and bedrock in shallower depths. Deeper sites were flatter and more homogeneous with softer substratum. Habitats were variable within depth strata and were reflected in different fish assemblages among sites and among locations. Overall, fish trophic groups changed with depth and included generalist and benthic carnivores, piscivores, and planktivores while herbivores were rare below 50 m. While depth influenced where trophic groups occurred, site orientation and habitat morphology determined the composition of trophic groups within depths. Future conservation strategies will need to consider the vulnerability of taxa with narrow distributions and habitat requirements in unique shelf-break environments.

Previous management strategies, coupled with climate change, have led to widespread invasion by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis; bluegrass) in the Northern Great Plains, United States. Bluegrass invasions are expected to have detrimental impacts on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provided by rangelands. Yet none have investigated how bluegrass invasions influence pollinator populations, which are a prominent conservation concern and provide ecosystem services. We measured the impact of bluegrass invasion on mixed-grass prairie forb and butterfly communities. Obligate grassland butterflies, those that rely on grasslands, decreased as bluegrass cover increased, including the threatened 1 lesperia dacotae. Conversely, the abundance of facultative grassland butterflies, those found in grasslands but not fully dependent on them for their life history, increased as bluegrass increased. Moreover, plant species diversity and flowering forb species richness decreased as bluegrass cover increased. Overall, bluegrass invasion led to butterfly and plant community simplification, signaling a loss of biodiversity and potentially ecosystem services. Our research is the first to quantify how grassland butterflies and the floral resources they depend on are negatively impacted by bluegrass invasion. Resource managers should adopt management strategies that reduce bluegrass cover and improve nectar and host resources for obligate grassland butterflies. Management choices that removed disturbance regimes inherent to the Northern Great Plains (i.e., fire and grazing) led to bluegrass dominance in the region. Therefore, restoring disturbance regimes may be one way to reduce bluegrass and benefit pollinator populations. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mortality and Flowering of Great Basin Perennial Forbs After Experimental Burning: Implications for Wild Bees	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						oligolecty; pollinators; restoration; sagebrush steppe; wildfire; wildflowers	PRESCRIBED FIRES; SAGEBRUSH; STEPPE; PREFERENCES; HYMENOPTERA; LIMITATIONS; RESOURCES; PHENOLOGY; RECOVERY; SEASON	The fates of native bee communities in the Great Basin sagebrush steppe are linked with the susceptibilities of their floral hosts to increasingly frequent wildfires. Postfire survival and subsequent flowering of six prevalent perennial wildflowers representing five families were quantified across a range of realistic fire severities created using a calibrated propane burn barrel. Five burn prescriptions of varying intensity and duration were applied to cultivated rows of basalt milkvetch (Astrugalusfilipes Torr. ex A. Gray), Blue Mountain prairie clover (Daleaomuto Eaton & J. Wright). sulphur-flower buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum Torr.), fernleaf biscuitroot (Lomatium dissectum Nutt.), blue penstemon (Penstemon cyaneus Pennell), and gooseberryleaf globemallow (Sphaerakea grossularifolia Hook. & Am.). Overall differences in their fire sensitivities were maximal at peak fire severity, ranging from 80% survival (L dissectum) to complete mortality (E umbellatum and P. cyaneus). Although A. filipes survived well (85%), half of the 95 burn survivors then failed to flower the year after burning. The postfire fate of plant-pollinator interactions is a function of the bees' nesting habits, their floral host's sensitivity to a given burn intensity (both in terms of survival and flowering), and the reproductive interdependence of bee and floral host (taxonomic specialists vs. generalists).

Factors Affecting Nest Success and Predator Assemblage of Breeding Birds in Semiarid Grasslands	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						grassland birds; nest predation; nest success; rat snake; south Texas; woody encroachment	SITE SELECTION; LAND-USE; VEGETATION; HABITAT; FOREST; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; SURVIVAL; CLIMATE; VIREO	Woody encroachment has influenced wildlife distributions and, thus, predator-prey dynamics, for many taxa in North American grasslands. In 2015 and 2016, we examined how vegetative characteristics influenced avian nest predator assemblages and nest predation rates in semiarid grasslands of south Texas, where encroachment of woody plant species is common. We monitored 253 nests of 17 bird species and deployed infrared cameras at 107 nest sites within four vegetation types at our study sites. We also used data from a concurrent, multi species monitoring project within our study area to assess predator activity within these same vegetation types. We divided bird species into four nest types based on nest shape and size (i.e., small, medium, and large cup-shaped nests and exposed nests with little structure). We then used logistic regression to examine relationships between shrub cover, concealment, and distance to edge and the probability of nest success and predation by snakes. We observed a significant decrease in nest success of our medium-sized, cup-shaped nest type when shrub cover in- creased at the nest site, indicating small increases in shrub cover (approximate to 10%) could have substantial impacts on birds using this nest type. Snakes were our primary predator at camera-monitored nests (59%), and snake activity increased by 6.7% with every 10% increase in shrub cover at the nest site. Mesomammalian and large mammalian predators were most active in vegetation types predominated by herbaceous cover, small mammals were most active in vegetation types predominated by woody cover, and snake activity was highly variable. Predator activity did not reflect predator identity at camera-monitored nests, suggesting that potential nest predator activity may not accurately reflect the risk of nest predation. Results of our study will help inform management of bird species using semiarid grasslands affected by woody encroachment and offer recommendations for improved nest success.

Grassland Fire Effects on Steel Fence Posts	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						fencing; infrastructure; prescribed fire; range developments; T post; wildfire		Rangeland fire effects on flora, fauna, soils, and water have been studied widely. Fire effects information is limited on rangeland developments such as fencing. Fencing is an integral part of rangeland infrastructure and receives much attention when there is a wildfire or even discussion about conducting prescribed fires. Due to known fence age and fire history, we conducted a study on the Oklahoma State University Research Range located near Stillwater, Oklahoma. Five randomly selected individual metal T posts were sampled from a common fence line of known age and fire treatment. The T posts ranged from 4 to 35 yr since fence construction, with lire activity of 0, 1, 3, or 12 prescribed fires and 0, 1, or 2 wildfire occurrences. Each T post was tested in situ at 40 an, 80 cm, and 120 cm above ground level for hardness and paint adhesion as set forth by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International standards for hot wrought metal fence posts. Our results found no differences in post hardness, with all posts tested being higher than the ASTM minimum standard of 83 Rockwell B Hardness Scale. We also found that paint adhesion between burned and unburned T posts did not vary, with age of post being the only significant predictor variable for adhesion. Overall, our results provide evidence that T posts exposed to numerous fires and fire types did not suffer negative effects. This shows that concerns about wildfire and prescribed fires in grasslands having negative effects on metal T posts are unfounded. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management.

A few empirical studies included the effect of prey abundance when investigating simultaneously the effects of density-dependence and climate factors on marine top-predator population dynamics. Our aim was to unravel the mechanisms forcing population dynamics of an apex consumer seabird, the south polar skua, using long-term climatic and population time series of the consumer and its prey in Terre Adelie, Antarctica. Influences of density-dependence, climatic factors, and prey abundance with lag effects were tested on the breeding population dynamics with a Bayesian multi-model inference approach. We evidenced a negative trend in breeding population growth rate when density increased. Lagged effects of sea-ice concentration and air temperature in spring and a contemporary effect of prey resources were supported. Remarkably, results outline a reverse response of the south polar skua and one of its main preys to the same environmental factor (sea-ice concentration), suggesting a strong link between skua and penguin dynamics. The causal mechanisms may involve competition for food and space through territorial behavior as well as local climate and prey availability, which probably operate on breeding parameters (breeding propensity, breeding success, or recruitment) rather than on adult survival. Our results provide new insights on the relative importance of factors forcing the population dynamics of an apex consumer including density-dependence, local climate conditions, and direct and indirect effects of prey abundance.

Lethal and sublethal impacts of a micropredator on post-settlement Caribbean reef fishes	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Parasite; Competition; Gnathiid isopod; Mortality; Recruitment	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CAPTIVE BLACKEYE THICKLIP; GNATHIID ISOPODS; LIZARD ISLAND; BLOOD-VOLUME; ECTOPARASITE LOADS; PARASITE INFECTION; CORAL; RECRUITMENT; PREDATION	The transition from a planktonic larval stage to a benthic or demersal juvenile stage, recruitment, is a crucial event in the life history of coral reef fishes, and has a strong influence on population size. Predation by piscivorous fishes is thought to be the main determinant of recruitment success, and has received the most attention. However, recent studies suggest that recently settled reef fishes are also an important target of micropredation from blood-feeding ectoparasites which may have significant lethal and sublethal effects. In this study, we quantified the relationship between levels of infestation by gnathiid isopods and mortality rates among juveniles of three species of reef fishes as a function of body mass both within and among species. We found that a single gnathiid isopod larva could kill fish of all three species shortly after settlement, up to 0.116g [18mm fork length (FL)] in French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum), 0.027g (15mm FL) in masked goby (Coryphopterus personatus) and 0.01g (9mm FL) in beaugregory damselfish (Stegastes leucostictus). For juvenile S. leucostictus, we also compared the ability of fish to defend a territory when infested with a sublethal number of gnathiids versus uninfected individuals. Uninfected fish were significantly more likely to win-pairwise contests versus infected fish. These findings suggest that gnathiids can significantly impact juvenile coral reef fish survival, and affect population dynamics well past the settlement stage.

Cane toads (Rhinella marina) rely on water access, not drought tolerance, to invade xeric Australian environments	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Bufo marinus; Hydroregulation; Innate immunity; Invasive species; Osmolality	CHAUNUS BUFO MARINUS; LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; DISPERSAL BEHAVIOR; RAPID EVOLUTION; INVASION FRONT; WET-DRY; DEHYDRATION; IMMUNITY; DESICCATION; STRESS	The invasion of habitats with novel environmental challenges may require physiological tolerances not seen in conspecifics from the native range. We used a combination of field and laboratory-based experiments to assess physiological tolerance to limited water access at four sites distributed across the historical invasion path of cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia that, from east to west, alternated between mesic and seasonally xeric habitats. Toads from all locations were well hydrated at the time of capture. However, experimental dehydration caused greater mass loss, higher plasma osmolality, and inhibition of lytic ability in toads from xeric compared to mesic locations. These results suggest somewhat surprisingly that toads from xeric environments are physiologically more vulnerable to water loss. In contrast, bactericidal ability was not sensitive to hydric state and was greater in toads from eastern (long-colonized) areas. Similar patterns in lytic ability in hydrated toads and agglutination ability in wild toads suggest that toads along the invasion front face a tradeoff between enhanced dispersal ability and physiological responses to dehydration. The ability of this invasive species to spread into drier environments may be underpinned by a combination of phenotypic plasticity and evolved (heritable) traits.

For ectothermic animals, we need to disentangle the role of stage-specific thermal tolerances and developmental acclimation to predict the effects of climate change on spatial distributions. However, the interplay between these mechanisms has been poorly explored. Here we study whether developmental larval acclimation to rearing temperatures affects the thermal tolerance of subsequent terrestrial stages (metamorphs and juveniles) in common frogs (Rana temporaria). Our results show that larval acclimation to warm temperatures enhances larval heat tolerance, but not thermal tolerance in later metamorphic and juvenile stages, which does not support the developmental acclimation hypothesis. Further, metamorphic and juvenile individuals exhibit a decline in thermal tolerance, which would confer higher sensitivity to extreme temperatures. Because thermal tolerance is not enhanced by larval developmental acclimation, these risky' stages may be forced to compensate through behavioural thermoregulation and short-term acclimation to face eventual heat peaks in the coming decades.

The concept of neutral-based processes posits that network structure is a result of interactions between species based on their abundance. On the other hand, niche-based processes presume that network structure is shaped by constraints to interactions. Here, we evaluated the relative importance of neutral-based process, represented by species' abundance (A) and fruit production (F) models, and niche-based process, represented by spatial overlap (S), temporal overlap (T) and morphological barrier (M) models, in shaping the structure of a bird-seed dispersal network from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We evaluated the ability of each model, singly or in combination, to predict the general structure [represented by connectance, nestedness (NODF), weight nestedness (WNODF), interaction evenness and complementary specialization] and microstructure of the network (i.e., the frequency of pairwise interactions). Only nestedness (both NODF and WNODF) was predicted by at least one model. NODF and WNODF were predicted by a neutral-based process (A), by a combination of niche-based processes (ST and STM) and by both neutral- and niche-based processes (AM). NODF was also predicted by F and FM model. Regarding microstructure, temporal overlap (T) was the most parsimonious model able to predict it. Our findings reveal that a combination of neutral- and niche-based processes is a good predictor of the general structure (NODF and WNODF) of the bird-seed dispersal network and a niche-based process is the best predictor of the network's microstructure.

Combining bulk and amino acid stable isotope analyses to quantify trophic level and basal resources of detritivores: a case study on earthworms	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Soil food web; Microbivory; Decomposers; Methods comparison; Energy channels	SOIL FOOD-WEB; FEEDING ECOLOGY; NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; FAGUS-SYLVATICA; LEAF-LITTER; CARBON; NITROGEN; C-13; FRACTIONATION; DELTA-N-15	Quantification of the bacterial, fungal, and plant energy channels to the nutrition of detritivores is methodologically challenging. This is especially true for earthworms that ingest large amounts of litter and soil mixed with microorganisms. Novel methods such as compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of C and N of individual amino acids promise major progress in this field in comparison with bulk stable isotope analysis (bulk SIA). Here, we combine CSIA and bulk SIA of carbon and nitrogen to quantify the linkage of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species to different energy channels across boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The results showed pronounced flux of energy directly from plants to earthworms (33-50% of essential amino acids, EAA) refining the position of earthworms in soil food webs as both competitors and consumers of microorganisms. Epigeic earthworm species primarily relied on plant litter and endogeic species primarily relied on bacteria and soil organic matter. The linkage of both groups to plant or microbial energy channel was likely driven by the quality of detritus. Both bulk N-15 and C-13 enrichments were related to the trophic level of earthworms. Furthermore, N-15 enrichment was related to the proportions of bacterial and plant EAA in the diet. Strong negative correlation between trophic level (CSIA of nitrogen) and the proportion of plant EAA (CSIA of carbon) suggests that both novel methods can indicate the degree of microbivory in detritivores. CSIA of amino acids provide detailed and baseline-independent information on basal resources and trophic levels of detritivores.

Simulating eutrophication in a metacommunity landscape: an aquatic model ecosystem	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Interconnected patches; Diversity; Fragmentation; Nutrient addition; Microcosm experiment	BETA-DIVERSITY; NESTEDNESS COMPONENTS; GRAZING PRESSURE; FOOD-QUALITY; PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; DISSIMILARITY; STABILITY; TURNOVER	Aquatic habitats are often characterized by both high diversity and the threat of multiple anthropogenic stressors. Our research deals with temporal and spatial aspects of two of the main threats for biodiversity, namely eutrophication and fragmentation. It is known that pulsed nutrient addition creates temporal differences in environmental conditions, promoting higher diversity by preventing the best competitor from dominating. Furthermore, a metacommunity landscape with intermediate connectivity increases autotrophs' diversity and stability. However, it is yet unclear if these two factors are additive in increasing diversity and if the effects extend to the consumer level. With the goal of understanding how eutrophication impacts biodiversity in a metacommunity landscape, we hypothesized that pulsed nutrient addition will increase diversity among both autotrophs and heterotrophs, and this effect will be even greater in a metacommunity landscape. We simulated eutrophication and fragmentation in a microcosm experiment using phytoplankton as primary producers and microzooplankton as grazers. Four treatment combinations were tested including two different landscapes (metacommunity and isolated community) and two forms of nutrient supply (pulsed and continuous): metacommunity/continuous nutrient addition (MC); metacommunity/pulsed nutrient addition (MP); isolated community/continuous nutrient addition (IC); isolated community/pulsed nutrient addition (IP). As expected, pulsed nutrient addition had a persistent positive effect on phytoplankton diversity, with a weaker influence of landscape type. In contrast, the grazer community strongly benefited from a metacommunity landscape, with less significance of pulsed or continuous nutrient addition. Overall, the metacommunity landscape with pulsed nutrient supply supported higher diversity of primary producers and grazers.

Insights from spatial co-occurrence networks	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Coexistence; Formicidae; Interactions turnover; Interspecific interactions; Network structure	HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE; SPECIES COOCCURRENCE; RAIN-FOREST; COMPETITION; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; HIERARCHY; COEXISTENCE; GENERALIST; TRANSITION	The coexistence of several species involves a complex mix of positive and negative interactions that can be represented as networks. As much as other ecological features, patterns of multispecies co-occurrence are susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance. In ant communities, wildfires may enhance competitive interactions by benefiting active, aggressive species, and by increasing encounter probabilities through decreased space availability. We explored ant co-occurrence patterns by analysing the macro and microscopic structure of their interaction networks in burned and unburned habitats. We built co-occurrence networks using significant aggregations and segregations between species pairs as positive and negative interactions, respectively. We described aggregate network properties and microscopic structural changes by comparing species and interactions turnover between burned and unburned sites. We found no differences in the macroscopic structure of co-occurrence networks between different fire regimes. However, we detected changes in the composition of both species and negative interactions. Interaction turnover between networks of different habitats was mostly explained by rewiring of interactions between shared species rather than by species replacement. Our results reflected changes in ant communities in response to fire although there were no changes in global structural patterns. These changes in species and negative interactions suggest modifications in species roles translated into changes in the spatial distribution of ant species. The analysis of species co-occurrence networks is a useful tool to detect and visualize patterns in ant communities and to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of disturbance on biodiversity.

Habitat use of sympatric prey suggests divergent anti-predator responses to recolonizing gray wolves	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Canis lupus; Galloping; Mule deer; Non-consumptive effects; Odocoileus hemionus; O; virginianus; Predation risk; Stotting; White-tailed deer	WHITE-TAILED DEER; RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS; WOLF PREDATION RISK; TROPHIC CASCADES; MULE DEER; POPULATION-GROWTH; GROUP-SIZE; LANDSCAPE; BEHAVIOR; YELLOWSTONE	The non-consumptive effects of predators on prey are now widely recognized, but the need remains for studies identifying the factors that determine how particular prey species respond behaviorally when threatened with predation. We took advantage of ongoing gray wolf (Canis lupus) recolonization in eastern Washington, USA, to contrast habitat use of two sympatric prey speciesmule (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed (O. virginianus) deerat sites with and without established wolf packs. Under the hypothesis that the nature and scale of responses by these ungulates to wolf predation risk depend on their divergent flight tactics (i.e., modes of fleeing from an approaching predator), we predicted that (1) mule deer would respond to wolves with coarse-scale spatial shifts to rugged terrain favoring their stotting tactic; (2) white-tailed deer would manage wolf risk with fine-scale shifts toward gentle terrain facilitating their galloping tactic within their current home range. Resource selection functions based on 61 mule deer and 59 white-tailed deer equipped with GPS radio-collars from 2013 to 2016 revealed that habitat use for each species was altered by wolf presence, but in divergent ways that supported our predictions. Our findings add to a growing literature highlighting flight behavior as a viable predictor of prey responses to predation risk across multiple ecosystem types. Consequently, they suggest that predators could initiate multiple indirect non-consumptive effects in the same ecosystem that are transmitted by divergent responses of sympatric prey with different flight tactics.

One factor thought to be positively related to stand productivity is the degree of asymmetry, or the slope of the relationship between tree size and biomass growth. Steeper slopes indicate disproportionate productivity of big trees relative to small trees. Theoretically, big trees outcompete smaller trees during favorable growth conditions because they maintain better access to light. For this reason, high productivity forests are expected to have asymmetric growth. However, empirical studies do not consistently support this expectation, and those that do are limited in spatial or temporal scope. Here, we analyze size-growth relationships from 1970 to 2011 across a diverse network of forest sites in the eastern United States (n=16) to test whether asymmetry is consistently related to productivity. To investigate this relationship, we analyze asymmetry-productivity relationships between our 16 forests at non-overlapping annual, 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year sampling intervals and find that asymmetry is negatively related to productivity, but the strength depends on the specific interval considered. Within-site temporal variability in asymmetry and productivity are generally positively correlated over time, except at the 5-year remeasurement interval. Rather than confirming or failing to support a positive relationship between asymmetry and productivity, our findings suggest caution interpreting these metrics since the relationship varies across forest types and temporal scales.

Ongoing seasonally uneven climate warming leads to earlier autumn growth cessation in deciduous trees	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Global Change Ecology; Plant-climate interactions; Phenology; Climate change; Vegetation period; Leaf-out; Bud set; Senescence; Chlorophyll; Climate warming experiment	DORMANCY RELEASE; OUT PHENOLOGY; WOODY-PLANTS; BUD SET; TEMPERATE; TIMES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHOTOPERIOD; RESPONSES; CAPACITY	Ongoing global warming is causing phenological shifts that affect photosynthesis and growth rates in temperate woody species. However, the effects of seasonally uneven climate warmingas is occurring in much of Europe, where the winter/spring months are warming twice as fast than the summer/autumn monthson autumn growth cessation (completion of overwintering buds) and leaf senescence, and possible carry-over effects between phenophases, remain under-investigated. We conducted experiments in which we exposed saplings of canopy and understory species to 4 degrees C warming in winter/spring, summer/autumn, or all year to disentangle how the timing of bud break, bud set completion, and leaf senescence is affected by seasonally uneven warming. All-year warming led to significantly delayed leaf senescence, but advanced bud set completion; summer/autumn warming only delayed leaf senescence; and winter/spring warming advanced both bud set and senescence. The non-parallel effects of warming on bud completion and leaf senescence show that leaf senescence alone is an inadequate proxy for autumn growth cessation in trees and counterintuitively suggest that continued uneven seasonal warming will advance cessation of primary growth in autumn, even when leaf senescence is delayed. Phenological responses to warming treatments (earlier spring onset, later autumn senescence) were more than twice as high in understory species than in canopy species, which can partly be explained by the absence of carry-over effects among phenophases in the former group. This underscores the need to consider differences among plant functional types when forecasting the future behaviour of ecosystems.

Simultaneously, there is an interest in introducing species from dry habitats to cope with the increasing risks of drought under climate change. The general understanding is that the evolutionary adaptation to respective resource supplies in species' habitats affects their environmental tolerance. The physical performances of six frequently planted species, originating from two contrasting habitats, were tested in a drought experiment. We (1) investigated if species from drier habitats are more drought tolerant than species that have evolved in Central European woodlands under a temperate climate regime and (2) discussed the effect of tolerance on the cooling potential of these trees. Native species from mesic habitats maintained only 48% of their controls sap flux and of these species, Tilia cordata had the worst performance with premature leaf senescence. Species from drier habitats had less reduction in sap flux (60%) but lower stem growth, possibly favouring (fine) root development into deeper soil layers, as observed when comparing linden species. Higher stem water exploitation and stronger regulation of water use at high evaporative demand were further reaction patterns that likely helped species from dry habitats maintain good physiological functions. Therefore, even under sustained drought, we expect them to have a higher cooling capacity. As a conclusion, they should be favoured for planting in extreme urban environments. Systematic screening and testing of promising species from target habitats is recommended to diversify the choice of species.

I compared the temperature and relative humidity of active tree cavities that were occupied by nesting marsh tits Poecile palustris with the conditions in vacant tree cavities previously used for breeding by this species. I tested how presence of active nests modified initial cavity microclimate, and if this modification changed with nest progression or cavity insulation. In 2013-2014, mean daily internal-ambient temperature differences averaged 1.5-4.1 degrees C higher and relative humidity 8-10% lower, in active cavities relative to vacant sites, with greatest differences in the late nestling period. Compared to vacant cavities and relative to respective ambient values, the greatest daily minimum temperature increase was in active cavities located in the thinnest trees, which insulated least efficiently. As daily minimum temperatures were elevated to a similar level relative to outside within all active cavities, birds appeared to compensate for heat loss from cavities by warming the air within in a homeostatic manner. Similar to vacant cavities, the differences between daily maximum internal and ambient temperatures decreased with tree girth in active cavities, indicating that daily temperature maxima were systematically moderated in the thickest trees. The study demonstrates the modifying effect of birds' breeding activity on tree-cavity microclimate and highlights the role of a cavity's thermal properties in reducing the energy expenditure and risk of overheating for cavity users.

Herein, we examine the genetic consequences of range expansion over a 25-year period in a parasite (Geomydoecus aurei) that is in the process of expanding its geographic range via invasion of a novel host. By sampling the genetics of 1,935 G. aurei lice taken from 64 host individuals collected over this time period using 12 microsatellite markers, we test hypotheses concerning linear spatial expansion, genetic recovery time and allele surfing. We find evidence of decreasing allelic richness (AR) with increasing distance from the source population, supporting a linear, stepping stone model of spatial expansion that emphasizes the effects of repeated bottleneck events during colonization. We provide evidence of post-bottleneck genetic recovery, with average AR of infrapopulations increasing about 30% over the 225-generation span of time observed directly in this study. Our estimates of recovery rate suggest, however, that recovery has plateaued and that this population may not reach genetic diversity levels of the source population without further immigration from the source population. Finally, we employ a grid-based sampling scheme in the region of ongoing population expansion and provide empirical evidence for the power of allele surfing to impart genetic structure on a population, even under conditions of selective neutrality and in a place that lacks strong barriers to gene flow.

Here, we examine rDNA CNV using an in silico read depth approach for 91 fungal taxa with sequenced genomes and assess copy number conservation across phylogenetic scales and ecological lifestyles. rDNA copy number varied considerably across fungi, ranging from an estimated 14 to 1,442 copies (mean = 113, median = 82), and copy number similarity was inversely correlated with phylogenetic distance. No correlations were found between rDNA CNV and fungal trophic mode, ecological guild or genome size. Taken together, these results show that like other microorganisms, fungi exhibit substantial variation in rDNA copy number, which is linked to their phylogeny in a scale-dependent manner.

Although MHC often can be assessed through olfactory cues, the mechanism by which MHC genes influence odour remains largely unclear. MHC class IIB molecules, which enable recognition and elimination of extracellular bacteria, have been suggested to influence odour indirectly by shaping odour-producing microbiota, i.e. bacterial communities. However, there is little evidence of the predicted covariation between an animal's MHC genotype and its bacterial communities in scent-producing body surfaces. Here, using high-throughput sequencing, we tested the covariation between MHC class IIB genotypes and feather microbiota in the blue petrel (Halobaena caerulea), a seabird with highly developed olfaction that has been suggested to rely on oduor cues during an MHC-based mate choice. First, we show that individuals with similar MHC class IIB profiles also have similar bacterial assemblages in their feathers. Then, we show that individuals with high MHC diversity have less diverse feather microbiota and also a reduced abundance of a bacterium of the genus Arsenophonus, a genus in which some species are symbionts of avian ectoparasites. Our results, showing that feather microbiota covary with MHC, are consistent with the hypothesis that individual MHC genotype may shape the semiochemical-producing microbiota in birds.

The specificity of Burkholderia symbionts in the social amoeba farming symbiosis: Prevalence, species, genetic and phenotypic diversity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						amoeba; Burkholderia; Dictyostelium discoideum; phylogeny; symbiont specificity; symbiosis	BACTERIAL ENDOSYMBIONTS; HORIZONTAL TRANSFER; GUT SYMBIONT; EVOLUTION; ASSOCIATIONS; PHYLOGENIES; MUTUALISM; NETWORKS; FEATURES; ANCIENT	The establishment of symbioses between eukaryotic hosts and bacterial symbionts in nature is a dynamic process. The formation of such relationships depends on the life history of both partners. Bacterial symbionts of amoebae may have unique evolutionary trajectories to the symbiont lifestyle, because bacteria are typically ingested as prey. To persist after ingestion, bacteria must first survive phagocytosis. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, certain strains of Burkholderia bacteria are able to resist amoebal digestion and maintain a persistent relationship that includes carriage throughout the amoeba's social cycle that culminates in spore formation. Some Burkholderia strains allow their host to carry other bacteria, as food. This carried food is released in new environments in a trait called farming. To better understand the diversity and prevalence of Burkholderia symbionts and the traits they impart to their amoebae hosts, we first screened 700 natural isolates of D. discoideum and found 25% infected with Burkholderia. We next used a multilocus phylogenetic analysis and identified two independent transitions by Burkholderia to the symbiotic lifestyle. Finally, we tested the ability of 38 strains of Burkholderia from D. discoideum, as well as strains isolated from other sources, for traits relevant to symbiosis in D. discoideum. Only D. discoideum native isolates belonging to the Burkholderia agricolaris, B. hayleyella, and B. bonniea species were able to form persistent symbiotic associations with D. discoideum. The Burkholderia-Dictyostelium relationship provides a promising arena for further studies of the pathway to symbiosis in a unique system.

NOV.; FUNGUS; SEQUENCES	Acacia-ant mutualists in the genus Pseudomyrmex nest obligately in acacia plants and, as we show through stable isotope analysis, feed at a remarkably low trophic level. Insects with diets such as these sometimes depend on bacterial symbionts for nutritional enrichment. We, therefore, examine the bacterial communities associated with acacia-ants in order to determine whether they host bacterial partners likely to contribute to their nutrition. Despite large differences in trophic position, acacia-ants and related species with generalized diets do not host distinct bacterial taxa. However, we find that a small number of previously undescribed bacterial taxa do differ in relative abundance between acacia-ants and generalists, including several Acetobacteraceae and Nocardiaceae lineages related to common insect associates. Comparisons with an herbivorous generalist, a parasite that feeds on acacias and a mutualistic species with a generalized diet show that trophic level is likely responsible for these small differences in bacterial community structure. While we did not experimentally test for a nutritional benefit to hosts of these bacterial lineages, metagenomic analysis reveals a Bartonella relative with an intact nitrogen-recycling pathway widespread across Pseudomyrmex mutualists and generalists. This taxon may be contributing to nitrogen enrichment of its ant hosts through urease activity and, concordant with an obligately host-associated lifestyle, appears to be experiencing genomewide relaxed selection. The lack of distinctiveness in bacterial communities across trophic level in this group of ants shows a remarkable ability to adjust to varied diets, possibly with assistance from these diverse ant-specific bacterial lineages.

Because of their role as major components of Triassic terrestrial ecosystems and as the direct ancestors of mammals, cynodonts are an important group for understanding Mesozoic tetrapod diversity. We examine patterns of nonmammalian cynodont species richness and the quality of their fossil record. A supertree of cynodonts is constructed from recently published trees and time calibrated using a Bayesian approach. While this approach pushes the root of Cynodontia back to the earliest Guadalupian, the origins of Cynognathia and Probainognathia are close to their first appearance in the fossil record. Taxic, subsampled, and phylogenetic diversity estimates support a major cynodont radiation following the end-Permian mass extinction, but conflicting signals are observed at the end of the Triassic. The taxic diversity estimate shows high diversity in the Rhaetian and a drop across the Triassic/Jurassic boundary, while the phylogenetic diversity indicates an earlier extinction between the Norian and Rhaetian. The difference is attributed to the prevalence of taxa based solely on teeth in the Rhaetian, which are not included in the phylogenetic diversity estimate. Examining the completeness of cynodont specimens through geological time does not support a decrease in preservation potential; although the median completeness score decreases in the Late Triassic, the range of values remains consistent. Instead, the poor completeness scores are attributed to a shift in sampling and taxonomic practices: an increased prevalence in microvertebrate sampling and the naming of fragmentary material.

Tropical species may be more vulnerable than temperate species to current climate warming because of high tropical climate velocities and reduced seawater oxygen levels. To test whether rapid warming indeed preferentially increased the extinction risk of tropical fossil taxa, we combine a robust statistical assessment of latitudinal extinction selectivity (LES) with the dominant views on climate change occurring at ancient extinction crises. Using a global data set of marine fossil occurrences, we assess extinction rates for tropical and temperate genera, applying log ratios to assess effect size and Akaike weights for model support. Among the classical "big five" mass extinction episodes, the end-Permian mass extinction exhibits temperate preference of extinctions, whereas the Late Devonian and end-Triassic selectively hit tropical genera. Simple links between the inferred direction of climate change and LES are idiosyncratic, both during crisis and background intervals. More complex models, including sampling patterns and changes in the latitudinal distribution of continental shelf area, show tropical LES to be generally associated with raised tropical heat and temperate LES with global cold temperatures. With implications for the future, our paper demonstrates the consistency of high tropical temperatures, habitat loss, and the capacity of both to interact in generating geographic patterns in extinctions.

Results show that (1) orbital-scale faunal variability has been influenced by eustatic sea-level fluctuations and oxygen variability and (2) secular-scale faunal transitions are likely associated with the mid-Brunhes event (MBE,similar to 0.43 Ma) and the onset of the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC, similar to 1.7 Ma). Krithe, Robertsonites, and Acanthocythereis are the three most abundant genera throughout the core, accounting for 78.5% of total specimens. Multiple-regression tree analysis indicated that the TWC, the MBE, and oxygen content are the significant controlling factors of ostracod dominance. Changes in assemblages exhibit decline and recovery patterns corresponding to orbital-scale cyclicity of sea-level changes. In the Sea of Japan marginal ocean setting, this cyclicity shows a close relationship with bottom-water oxygen variability since the onset of the TWC influx. The MBE amplified the influence of the TWC and oxygen variability to the deep-sea ecosystem through larger sea-level fluctuations. Acanthocythereis dunelmensis, a circumpolar species, dominates before the TWC onset. After the TWC onset and during the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT, similar to 1.2-0.7 Ma) Krithe spp., known for their low-oxygen tolerance, substantially increase under moderate oxygen depletion. At the end of the MPT, Krithe dominance diminishes and is replaced by Robertsonites hanaii and Propontocypris spp. after the MBE. The post-MBE assemblage, characterized by R. hanaii, suggests a slightly warmer environment under the development of the TWC. In addition, the post-MBE high-amplitude climate system may have caused the increased abundance of active-swimming Propontocypris spp. due to their superior migration ability. Benthic ecosystems in marginal seas are sensitive and vulnerable to both short- and long-term climatic changes, and the MBE is suggested to be a global biotic event affecting benthic ecosystems substantially.

Quantifying successional change and ecological similarity among Cretaceous and modern cold-seep faunas	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							WESTERN INTERIOR SEAWAY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; METHANE SEEPS; HYDROCARBON SEEPS; TEPEE BUTTES; THEORETICAL ECOSPACE; AMMONITE HABITATS; CONVERGENT MARGIN; MASS EXTINCTION; BETA-DIVERSITY	Accurately recognizing analogues between fossil and modern ecosystems allows paleoecologists to more fully interpret fossil assemblages and modern ecologists to leverage the fossil record to address long-term ecological and environmental changes. However, this becomes increasingly difficult as taxonomic turnover increases the dissimilarity between ecosystems. Here we use a guild-based approach to compare the ecological similarity of Cretaceous cold-seep assemblages preserved in the Pierre Shale surrounding the Black Hills and modern cold-seep assemblages from five previously recognized biofacies. We modify modern assemblage data to include only those taxa with fossilizable hard parts greater than 5 mm in length to make these modern data sets more comparable to potential fossil analogues. We find that while the Black Hills assemblages are more similar in ecological guild composition to the modern thyasirid biofacies, subsets share similarities in ecological structure to the lucinid and mussel-bed biofacies. The fossil seep assemblages are also more similar to one another than are modern assemblages belonging to the same biofacies, despite greater geographic and temporal dissimilarity among the fossil samples. Furthermore, guild-level ordination analyses show a secondary faunal gradient that reflects community succession in the hard substrate-dominated modern assemblages and reveals a parallel faunal gradient in the soft sediment-dominated Cretaceous assemblages, consistent with a gradient in the influence of seep fluids on the faunas. Thus, while the Black Hills assemblages are quite homogeneous in their composition, they capture ecological variation similar to successional patterns in modern seep systems.

Paleocommunity mixing increases with marine transgression in Dinosaur Park Formation (Upper Cretaceous) vertebrate microfossil assemblages	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							JUDITH RIVER FORMATION; DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; STABLE-ISOTOPE; FOSSIL RECORD; SOUTHERN ALBERTA; TAPHONOMIC BIAS; PROVINCIAL PARK; TERRESTRIAL; COMMUNITY; FIDELITY	Vertebrate microfossil assemblages in a stratigraphic sequence often yield similar assortments of taxa but at different relative abundances, potentially indicative of marginal paleocommunity changes driven by paleoenvironmental change over time. For example, stratigraphically younger assemblages in the Dinosaur Park Formation (DPF) yield proportionally more aquatic taxa, consistent with marine transgression. However, individual deposits may have received specimens from multiple source paleocommunities over time, limiting our ability to confidently identify ecologically significant, paleocommunity differences through direct assemblage comparisons. We adapted a three-source, two-tracer Bayesian mixing model to quantify proportional contributions from different source habitats to DPF microfossil assemblages. Prior information about the compositions of separate, relatively unmixed terrestrial, freshwater, and marine assemblages from the Belly River Group allowed us to define expected taxon percent abundances for the end-member habitats likely contributing specimens to the mixed deposits. We compared the mixed assemblage and end-member distributions using 21 different combinations of vertebrate taxa. Chondrichthyan, dinosaur, and amphibian occurrence patterns ultimately allowed us to parse the contributions from the potential sources to 14 of the 15 mixed assemblages. The results confirmed a significant decline in terrestrial contributions at younger DPF sites, driven primarily by increased freshwater specimen inputs-not incursions from the adjacent marine paleocommunity. A rising base level likely increased lateral channel migration and the prevalence of freshwater habitats on the landscape, factors that contributed to increased paleocommunity mixing at younger channel deposit sites. Bayesian methods can account for source-mixing bias, which may be common in assemblages associated with major paleoenvironmental changes.	[Oreska, Matthew P.

The effects of skeletal asymmetry on interpreting biologic variation and taphonomy in the fossil record	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							TECTONICALLY DEFORMED FOSSILS; FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; DEVELOPMENTAL INSTABILITY; GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS; BILATERAL SYMMETRY; SHAPE; SELECTION; DEFORMATION; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR	Biologic asymmetry is present in all bilaterally symmetric organisms as a result of normal developmental instability. However, fossilized organisms, which have undergone distortion due to burial, may have additional asymmetry as a result of taphonomic processes. To investigate this issue, we evaluated the magnitude of shape variation resulting from taphonomy on vertebrate bone using a novel application of fluctuating asymmetry. We quantified the amount of total variance attributed to asymmetry in a taphonomically distorted fossil taxon and compared it with that of three extant taxa. The fossil taxon had an average of 27% higher asymmetry than the extant taxa. In spite of the high amount of taphonomic input, the major axes of shape variation were not greatly altered by removal of the asymmetric component of shape variation. This presents the possibility that either underlying biologic trends drive the principal directions of shape change irrespective of asymmetric taphonomic distortion or that the symmetric taphonomic component is large enough that removing only the asymmetric component is inadequate to restore fossil shape. Our study is the first to present quantitative data on the relative magnitude of taphonomic shape change and presents a new method to further explore how taphonomic processes impact our interpretation of the fossil record.

During the Pliocene and Pleistocene, Australia was dominated by a number of large to gigantic marsupial herbivore taxa. Many of these have been understudied quantitatively with regard to their ecology; and identifying the diet of these species will improve our understanding of not only their ecologies, but also of past environments. Recent research has found that cranial morphology among kangaroos and wallabies corresponds with foraging behaviors and mechanical properties of preferred plant tissues. Here we apply shape analysis and computational biomechanics to test the hypothesis: that feeding ecology is associated with craniofacial morphology across a taxonomically broad sample of diprotodont herbivores. Based on our results we predict the diet of an extinct short-faced kangaroo, Simosthenurus occidentalis. We find that biting behaviors are reflected in craniofacial morphology, but that these are more a reflection of the hardest bites required for their lifestyle, rather than diet composition alone. A combination of a very short face, robust musculoskeletal features, and dental arrangements predict that S. occidentalis was a browser, capable of consuming particularly resistant, bulky plant matter. These features were largely conserved among other short-faced kangaroos and may have offset the unpredictable availability of quality forage during the climatically variable Pleistocene epoch, contributing to their prolific diversification during this time.

The evolution of the dicynodont sacrum: constraint and innovation in the synapsid axial column	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							DEVELOPMENTAL CONSTRAINTS; APPENDICULAR SKELETON; GENE-EXPRESSION; SEGMENT NUMBER; HOX GENES; THERAPSIDA; MAMMALS; ANATOMY; ANOMODONTIA; ORIGIN	Constraint is a universal feature of morphological evolution. The vertebral column of synapsids (mammals and their close relatives) is a classic example of this phenotypic restriction, with greatly reduced variation in the number of vertebrae compared with the sauropsid lineage. Synapsids generally possess only three sacral vertebrae, which articulate with the ilium and play a key role in locomotion. Dicynodont anomodonts are the exception to this rule, possessing seven or more sacral vertebrae while reaching a range of body sizes rivaled among synapsids only by therian mammals. Here we explore the evolution of this unusual sacral morphology in dicynodonts by (1) hypothesizing homologies of the additional sacral vertebrae, (2) using ancestral state reconstruction and phylogenetic regressions (e.g., logistic regression, Poisson regression) to track the coevolution of sacral count and body size, and (3) proposing mechanisms by which additional sacral vertebrae were incorporated during dicynodont evolution. We find that sacral vertebral morphology covaries with sacral count in consistent ways across dicynodonts, implying that sacra with a given number of vertebrae are composed of homologous elements. There is a correlation between increased sacral count and larger body size, especially at the shift from four to five sacrals near the origin of Bidentalia. Based on position, morphology, and the consistent number of presacral vertebrae among dicynodonts, we hypothesize that the additional sacrals anterior to the plesiomorphic three are duplications of the first sacral, and that a single caudosacral was incorporated by a shift in the identity of the anteriormost caudal vertebra. Although changes in sacral count appear to be correlated with shifts in body size in dicynodonts, the evolution of general morphological conservativism in the synapsid sacrum remains to be further explored.

Assessing changes in groundwater chemistry in landscapes with more than 100 years of oil and gas development	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS			English	Article							DRINKING-WATER WELLS; METHANE CONCENTRATIONS; SHALLOW GROUNDWATER; CONTAMINATION; MARCELLUS; PENNSYLVANIA; EXCHANGE; IMPACTS; QUALITY	With recent improvements in high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF, known to the public as fracking), vast new reservoirs of natural gas and oil are now being tapped. As HVHF has expanded into the populous northeastern USA, some residents have become concerned about impacts on water quality. Scientists have addressed this concern by investigating individual case studies or by statistically assessing the rate of problems. In general, however, lack of access to new or historical water quality data hinders the latter assessments. We introduce a new statistical approach to assess water quality datasets - especially sets that differ in data volume and variance - and apply the technique to one region of intense shale gas development in northeastern Pennsylvania (PA) and one with fewer shale gas wells in northwestern PA. The new analysis for the intensely developed region corroborates an earlier analysis based on a different statistical test: in that area, changes in groundwater chemistry show no degradation despite that area's dense development of shale gas. In contrast, in the region with fewer shale gas wells, we observe slight but statistically significant increases in concentrations in some solutes in groundwaters. One potential explanation for the slight changes in groundwater chemistry in that area (northwestern PA) is that it is the regional focus of the earliest commercial development of conventional oil and gas (O&G) in the USA. Alternate explanations include the use of brines from conventional O&G wells as well as other salt mixtures on roads in that area for dust abatement or de-icing, respectively.

Predicting the sensitivity of marine populations to rising temperatures	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; THERMAL PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; VULNERABILITY; EVOLUTIONARY; IMPACTS; WORLDS; ADAPTATION; ECTOTHERMS; ECOSYSTEMS	Oceans are warming at rates faster than marine species have experienced over the previous 400,000 years. Our quantitative review across a wide range of marine taxa revealed that increases in temperature that occur above mean annual temperature (MAT) generally lower population survival and reproduction. Furthermore, these effects are likely to be increasingly detrimental, particularly for survival, as the magnitude of warming increases. Although we found evidence for considerable variation within and between populations in response to increasing temperatures, whether this existing variation will allow for evolutionary rescue is uncertain. Importantly, a simple metric (ie MAT) facilitates evaluation of the effects of increasing temperatures on the survivorship and reproduction of most populations, even those for which limited data on thermal sensitivity are available. This approach improves our understanding of population-level responses to climate change, which is critical for adaptation planning that aims to sustain and restore vulnerable populations.

PAHs are unique in their ability to absorb UV light, resulting in significant increases in acute toxicity. The objective of this study was to determine if mixtures of the phototoxic PAHs fluoranthene, pyrene, and anthracene conform to the additive model of toxicity. Median lethal concentrations (LC50) were calculated for mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia) and inland silverside (Menidia beryllina) exposed to individual, binary, and ternary mixtures of the selected PAHs. Mixtures were evaluated on a toxic unit basis to account for potency differences and toxicity data was analyzed using the concentration-addition and independent-action models. Data indicated that the model of additivity is sufficient in describing the toxicity of mixtures of phototoxic PAHs; therefore predictive models should consider an additivity model for assessing the toxicity of hydrocarbon mixtures.

Schimp. and Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt.] were repeatedly exposed to known concentrations of either nano-TiO2 or nano-ZnO suspensions. The interspecies differences were assessed by exposing both the species to 1gL(-1) nano-ZnO suspension, H. splendens samples were also exposed to either 0.1gL(-1) or 1gL(-1) suspension of nano TiO2. The exposed samples were analysed for Zn or Ti content using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. Both species showed a similar accumulation pattern, H. splendens being a slightly better accumulator. The washing suggests that Ti successfully penetrated the interior of the gametophyte. Since the relationship between the exposure and accumulation is linear, moss biomonitoring is, hereby, considered to be a viable, novel technique in nanoparticle pollution assessment.

The guanaco is the largest wild herbivore inhabiting the Patagonian steppes. Since the end of the 19th Century, it has suffered a progressive decline in numbers owing to poaching and unregulated hunting because of on an assumed competition with sheep. Unfortunately, there has never been a management program for guanaco populations in Argentine Patagonia. Consequently, the guanaco is still considered a pest species by ranchers and has never been considered profitable in the range management model implemented in Patagonia. Aims. The present article updates the distribution limits of guanaco and estimate its abundance across Chubut, a large province of Patagonia, Argentina. The relative effects of several environmental and anthropogenic factors on guanaco distribution are also assessed. Methods. Road surveys (7010 km) and species distribution modelling were used to build a habitat suitability model and a distribution map. A distance sampling method was used to estimate guanaco population densities and size. The survey effort required to monitor population trends in this region was also calculated. Key results. According to the best habitat suitability model, guanaco distribution decreased with altitude and primary productivity, as measured by Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and increased with the distance to the nearest urban centre and oil field. Guanaco distribution showed a clear geographical pattern in Chubut, with low to medium occurrence probability towards the west and higher values towards the east. Guanaco population size was estimated as 657 304 individuals (95% CI 457 437 to 944 059), with a mean density of 2.97 guanacos km(-2). Finally, through simulations of guanaco monitoring, it was estimated that an annual survey effort of 10 to thirty 30-km road transects is needed to detect with confidence a significant population decrease or increase over the next 6 or 10 years. Conclusions. The habitat suitability map presented herein highlights areas with high guanaco densities in Chubut, where it would be possible to identify ranches suitable for performing profitable herding and shearing experiences. Implications. The maps of guanaco distribution and density, as well as the survey effort required to monitor population trends, may be used to inform decisions concerning the sustainable use of this species.

Incorporating movement patterns to discern habitat selection: black bears as a case study	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						black bear movement; hidden Markov models; step-selection functions; step-length; Ursus americanus	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; RESOURCE SELECTION; URSUS-AMERICANUS; ANIMAL MOVEMENT; FEMALE FLORIDA; HOME RANGES; SPACE USE; POPULATION; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY	Context. Animals' use of space and habitat selection emerges from their movement patterns, which are, in turn, determined by their behavioural or physiological states and extrinsic factors. Aim. The aims of the present study were to investigate animal movement and incorporate the movement patterns into habitat selection analyses using Global Positioning System (GPS) location data from 16 black bears (Ursus americanus) in a fragmented area of Florida, USA. Methods. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were used to discern the movement patterns of the bears. These results were then used in step-selection functions (SSFs) to evaluate habitat selection patterns and the factors influencing these patterns. Key results. HMMs revealed that black bear movement patterns are best described by three behavioural states: (1) resting (very short step-lengths and large turning angles); (2) encamped (moderate step-lengths and large turning angles); and (3) exploratory (long step-lengths and small turning angles). Bears selected for forested wetlands and marsh wetlands more than any other land cover type, and generally avoided urban areas in all seasons and when in encamped and exploratory behavioural states. Bears also chose to move to locations farther away from major roads. Conclusions. Because habitat selection is influenced by how animals move within landscapes, it is essential to consider animals' movement patterns when making inferences about habitat selection. The present study achieves this goal by using HMMs to first discern black bear movement patterns and associated parameters, and by using these results in SSFs to investigate habitat selection patterns. Thus, the methodological framework developed in this study effectively incorporates state-specific movement patterns while making inferences regarding habitat selection. The unified methodological approach employed here will contribute to an improved understanding of animal ecology as well as informed management decisions. Implications. Conservation plans focused on preserving forested wetlands would benefit bears by not only providing habitat for resting and foraging, but also by providing connectivity through fragmented landscapes. Additionally, the framework could be applied to species that follow annual cycles and may provide a tool for investigating how animals are using dispersal corridors.

Contemporary abundance patterns of Cyclotella sensu lato diatom taxa in Lake Superior: Assessing responses to physical and chemical gradients and potential links to climate change	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Algae; Discostella; Light; Lindavia	RESOURCE COMPETITION; PLANKTONIC DIATOMS; WATER-QUALITY; GREAT-LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; ECOLOGY; AVAILABILITY; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; TEMPERATURE	Many studies attribute shifts in relative abundances of Cyclotella sensu lato diatom taxa in freshwater lakes over the past 150 years to climate change. Although abundances of several of these taxa have also changed in Lake Superior over the last century, the specific drivers are currently undear. This study used multiple linear regression to analyze long-term planktonic monitoring data to identify drivers of changing cell densities of six Cyclotella sensu lato species, four shown to be responsive to climate-driven change in smaller lakes and two species with similar morphology to two previously assessed taxa: Discostella stelligera and the morphologically similar D. pseudostelligera, Lindavia comensis and the morphologically similar L. delicatula, Lindavia ocellata, and Lindavia bodanica. Assessed variables associated with climate-driven physical change included surface water temperature and light availability, with turbidity and thermocline depth as indicators of the light environment. One to three variables explained 8-61% variation for each of 5 taxa from 2001 to 2011, significant predictive variables were not identified for D. stelligera. Multiple linear regression identified nutrients, including nitrate, phosphorus, and silica, as essential in explaining distributions of all the other assessed taxa. A physical variable associated with climate explained changes of one taxon: L. ocellata, which increased with lower water temperatures. Climate-driven species responses were not as apparent as in other systems; specifically, changes in the light environment of this clear lake did not explain abundance changes in any of the taxa. Multiple and complex environmental variables drive Cyclotella sensu lato abundance patterns in Lake Superior, possibly suggesting ecotype formation.

Spatial ecology of reintroduced walleye (Sander vitreus) in Hamilton Harbour of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Kernel density; Seasonal residency; Reintroduction; Restoration	HABITAT QUALITY; FISH; FISHERIES; ERIE; MOVEMENT; BAY; TEMPERATURE; MIGRATION; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY	Many coastal embayments in the Laurentian Great Lakes have been subjected to extensive human physical modification and pollution that has led to the loss of freshwater biodiversity. For example, Hamilton Harbour is a large coastal embayment situated at the western end of Lake Ontario, with a long history of industrial and urban development that has resulted in the loss and degradation of aquatic habitat and the extirpation of several fish species. To restore the fish community in Hamilton Harbour, several attempts have been made to increase apex predator biodiversity by reintroducing native walleye (Sander vitreus). To assess how reintroduced (i.e., stocked) walleye use Hamilton Harbour, we used acoustic telemetry to characterize the residency of individuals within the boundaries of the harbour as well as their seasonal space use, with a focused interest on the spring spawning period. During the 1 yr tracking period tagged walleye spent an average of 357 days (range 135-365 days) within the harbour. Most individuals (12/15) remained within the harbour during the entire spring spawning period, and over half of the tagged fish departed (n = 7) at the end of summer and beginning of fall. Core use areas appeared to gradually shift more easterly as the seasons progressed from winter to summer. Results from this study indicate that stocked fish are resident within Hamilton Harbour for most of the year, including the reproductive period, which suggests that stocking efforts to re-establish walleye populations may be an effective restoration strategy if recruitment is successful.

Phenology and species diversity in a Lake Huron ichthyoplankton community: Ecological implications of invasive species dominance	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Larval fish; Biodiversity; Habitat; Invasive species; Round goby; Alewife	GOBY NEOGOBIUS-MELANOSTOMUS; DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION; WALLEYE SANDER-VITREUS; EARLY-LIFE HISTORY; ST MARTIN BAY; ROUND GOBY; LARVAL FISH; MAIN BASIN; RAINBOW SMELT; GREAT-LAKES	Ichthyoplankton communities are dynamic and vary spatiotemporally based on factors such as wind, water currents, and phenology. Nonetheless, ichthyoplankton are an indicator of spawning success in fish populations and examining their community diversity and composition can serve to provide information on ecosystem integrity. Although some ichthyoplankton species may be transient, understanding their distribution in space and time provides information on species composition, abundance, and habitat use during critical early life stages. We sampled the spring-summer ichthyoplankton community during 2008 and 2009 in northern Lake Huron to determine species succession, abundance, and species diversity along physical and environmental gradients. Seasonal succession of species was similar during both years, indicating well-defined patterns in spawning by northern Lake Huron fish populations. Invasive alewife, rainbow smelt, and round goby were the dominant species during both years, with native stickleback species also abundant. Shannon Entropy (H') increased with increasing water temperature until late summer when H' declined. H' decreased with increasing bottom depth and distance to tributary mouth indicating the important ecological role of these habitat features during early life stages. Although ichthyoplankton diversity was comparable to or higher than that reported for other areas of the Great Lakes, the prominence of invasive species in our study is reflective of the disturbed state of the lake Huron fish community, despite large reductions in invasive planktivorous fish since 2004. Continued monitoring of ichthyoplankton communities will be important for measuring the impacts of species invasions or other ecosystem stressors on fish community structure in the Great Lakes.

The duration of these legacies and how they influence the structure of vegetation communities developing naturally in nutrient-poor ecosystems is not well understood. Here, we focus on the effects of increased nutrient availability from previous agricultural practices on multiple vegetation properties in a heathland where agriculture and domestic grazing ceased near 1870 and 1895, respectively. We compared diversity, compositional and functional properties of the vegetation responses to land-use legacies in the soil between areas with different agricultural histories (previously cultivated vs. uncultivated). Diversity measures were found to be higher in the previously cultivated soils. beta-diversity was mainly driven by changes in species relative cover and increased with increasing nutrient availability in the cultivated area. Furthermore, functional traits related to nutrient acquisition (SLA and Leaf Nitrogen content) and the changes in vegetation composition were directly linked to soil properties only in the previously cultivated part of the heathland. Together these results revealed a shift to a deterministic control of the plant community, where increased nutrient availability leads to stronger associations between soil and vegetation properties. This suggests that as nutrients become available, niche differentiation and competitive interactions become the predominant underlying mechanisms structuring the community. Our study shows that land-use legacies of moderate intensity can alter the assembly mechanisms and diversity patterns in unmanaged vegetation that can be maintained after more than a century since cessation of agricultural practice. Identifying land-use legacies and understanding how they structure heathland communities can thus lead to management decisions adapted to the specific assembly mechanisms and result in a more effective management.

On the identification of mortality hotspots in linear infrastructures	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian hierarchical model; False discovery rate correction; Familywise error rate correction; Hotspot; Spatial auto-correlation	MODELS; LOCATIONS; ACCIDENTS; SETS	One of the main tasks when dealing with the impacts of infrastructures on wildlife is to identify hotspots of high mortality so one can devise and implement mitigation measures. A common strategy to identify hotspots is to divide an infrastructure into several segments and determine when the number of collisions in a segment is above a given threshold, reflecting a desired significance level that is obtained assuming a probability distribution for the number of collisions, which is often the Poisson distribution. The problem with this approach, when applied to each segment individually, is that the probability of identifying false hotspots (Type I error) is potentially high. The way to solve this problem is to recognize that it requires multiple testing corrections or a Bayesian approach. Here, we apply three different methods that implement the required corrections to the identification of hotspots: (i) the familywise error rate correction, (ii) the false discovery rate, and (iii) a Bayesian hierarchical procedure. We illustrate the application of these methods with data on two bird species collected on a road in Brazil. The proposed methods provide practitioners with procedures that are reliable and simple to use in real situations and, in addition, can reflect a practitioner's concerns towards identifying false positive or missing true hotspots. Although one may argue that an overly cautionary approach (reducing the probability of type I error) may be beneficial from a biological conservation perspective, it may lead to a waste of resources and, probably worse, it may raise doubts about the methodology adopted and the credibility of those suggesting it.

Grazing as a conservation management tool: Responses of voles to grazer species and densities	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cattle; Common vole; Horse; Microtus arvails; Nature management; Salt marsh; Vole sign index; Large herbivore grazing	OWLS ASIO-FLAMMEUS; SMALL MAMMALS; SALT MARSHES; MICROTUS-ARVALIS; STOCKING DENSITY; LARGE HERBIVORES; POPULATIONS; LIVESTOCK; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACT	Grazing is a widely applied conservation management tool, but the optimal regime for biodiversity conservation is still unknown. The effects of grazers on small mammals are not yet fully understood and mostly restricted to studies which compare grazed with ungrazed areas. We determined the effect of different livestock grazers and densities and a rotation regime, on voles in a conservation area in The Netherlands. We used a 7-year grazing experiment with horse and cattle grazing at two densities namely 0.5 and 1 animal ha(-1) (equivalent to 0.4 and 0.8 LSU), including a rotation regime i.e. 1 year summer grazing with 1 cattle ha(-1) followed by 1 ungrazed year. We recorded vole activity signs as a measure for presence (i.e. presence of burrow entrances, droppings, runways and plant clippings) in circular 2 m(2) plots along transects. Low grazer densities, regardless of species, corresponded to higher vole presence. Vole presence tended to be greater with cattle grazing than with horse grazing, but the difference was not significant. The increase in vole presence was greater in the rotation regime than with low or high density cattle grazing. The different vole activity signs provided similar results to each other with the exception of burrow entrances, suggesting that this measure is less accurate in predicting vole presence. Hence, voles clearly responded to the different grazing regimes. Our results have high relevance for conservation, in particular in systems where small mammals contribute to important ecological processes (e.g. bioturbation, seed dispersal) and play a crucial role in the survival of (iconic) higher trophic level taxa such as raptors or mammalian predators. In such systems, conservation management may best implement low-density cattle or rotation grazing. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Lagendijk, D.

BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Coexistence; Intraspecific competition; Movement; Species interaction	INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; MYODES-GLAREOLUS; GROWTH-PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; NICHE; SIZE; INTERFERENCE; MODELS	Animal space use patterns can be affected by the intra- and interspecific density of individuals competing for resources, with home ranges generally decreasing with increasing population density. By applying spatially explicit capture-recapture models implemented in the R package secr, we study whether home ranges of co-occurring yellow-necked mice, Apodemus flavicollis, and bank voles, Myodes glareolus, are related to population density of (a) conspecifics (intraspecific density), (b) the other sympatric species, A. flavicollis or M. glareolus (interspecific density), or (c) total rodent density (A. flavicollis plus M. glareolus). Home ranges of both species were negatively related to intraspecific population density, and were not related to interspecific density or total rodent density. Given that rodents tend to reduce home ranges if resources are abundant, this pattern may merely result from the higher abundance of resources generally associated with high density populations, if the two species were responding to different subsets of resources. However, intraspecific density could directly reduce home ranges, because conspecifics are more likely to interfere with each other due to the overlapping of space use patterns. Therefore, results suggest complementary space or resource use patterns between species, with consequent weak competition and niche differentiation. Across several years and population densities, home ranges of the two co-occurring rodents thus appear to be affected by conspecifics only, suggesting that the two species may coexist in the study area owing to limited space or resource use overlap.

Tree retention in cattle ranching systems partially preserves dung beetle diversity and functional groups in the semideciduous Atlantic forest: The role of microclimate and soil conditions	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Livestock management; Silvopastoral; Exotic trees; Pinus	LAND-USE; COLEOPTERA SCARABAEINAE; TROPICAL FORESTS; ASSEMBLAGES; MACROFAUNA; LOWLANDS; RICHNESS; DISTANCE; EDGE	The disturbance of natural environments affects, among others, the diversity of dung beetle assemblages, which could have serious consequences for the ecological processes regulated by these insects. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare species diversity and functional groups of dung beetle assemblages both in the native forest and in three livestock systems that differed in their structure and composition of vegetation: a livestock system with native trees, a livestock system with exotic trees (Pinus taeda), and traditional open pastures, in the semideciduous Atlantic forest of Argentina, in an area previously covered by continuous forest and currently with a heterogeneous landscape of native forest and different land uses. Pitfall traps baited with cow dung were used in the natural forests and the livestock systems studied. A total of 2461 beetles belonging to 38 species were captured. Treed livestock systems showed the highest species richness (D-0) and diversity (D-1 and D-2). Twelve functional groups were identified. The native forest showed the highest functional group richness, while open pastures had the lowest. In general, livestock systems showed a low proportional abundance of telecoprid, diurnal and large beetles. Microclimate (average temperature and humidity) and soil conditions (soil composition: sandy or clayey) were closely associated with the species and functional group composition. Results confirm that cattle ranching with tree retention preserves dung beetle diversity, and suggest that cattle systems without canopy cover have higher impact (negative effects) than silvopastoral systems on both species and functional groups.

However, valuing this benefit is not straightforward since estimates of the increase in sunflower yield vary from 18% to 100%. Most estimates have, moreover, been performed at plant scale, a scale that is not relevant for farmers who calculate at the field scale. In this four-year study, we quantified the contribution of insect pollination to sunflower yield at field and plant scales in working farm fields distributed along a gradient of pollinator diversity and abundance. Pollinators were found to increase field yield up to 40% (i.e. 0.7 t/ha) and by 31.3% at plant scale; the magnitude of effect on yield being therefore similar at both scales. The pollinators increased the yield by increasing the number of fertilized seeds per plant with no significant effect on the unit mass of the seeds although there was a trade-off between number of seeds and unit mass. Among pollinators, honeybees were the main taxon impacting sunflower yield. Sunflower plant density was a strong determinant of yield, with higher numbers attracting increased numbers of honeybees. Using pollinator and wind exclusion, we finally quantified the relative contributions of self-pollination (similar to 40%), insect pollination (similar to 35%) and wind pollination (similar to 20%). Our results show, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of the key role of pollinators in sunflower production at field scale in real farming conditions, and underscore the need to maintain suitable conditions for pollinators in agricultural landscapes.

Pollinator visitation to mass-flowering courgette and co-flowering wild flowers: Implications for pollination and bee conservation on farms	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cucurbit; Pollination; Landscape; Bee conservation	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; FORAGING RANGES; APIS-MELLIFERA; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; SIZE; PERFORMANCE; COMPETITION	Managing the complex relationship between pollinators and their habitat requirements is of particular concern to growers of pollinator-dependent crop species, such as courgette (Cucurbita pepo). Naturally occurring wild flowers (i.e. agricultural weeds) offer a free, sustainable, and often underappreciated resource for pollinators, however, they may compete with crop flowers for visits. To understand the extent to which floral resources mediate pollinator visitation to courgette flowers and courgette fields, plant community and pollinator visitation data were collected at two spatial scales: field scale (in margins, and in the cropped area) and farm scale (500 m and 2000 m radii) for nine courgette fields across the UK. Apis mellifera (honeybees) and Bombus spp. (bumblebees) were the only pollinators observed to visit courgette flowers. Bumblebees were significantly more abundant on courgette flowers in fields with a greater species richness of wild flowers in the crop, whilst honeybees were significantly more abundant on courgette flowers in areas with less semi-natural habitat. For both honeybees and bumblebees, their abundance in field margins did not significantly reduce their abundance on courgette flowers, suggesting that wild flowers were not competing with courgette flowers for pollinator visitation. Although solitary bees were not observed to visit courgette flowers, their abundance and species richness in courgette fields were significantly greater with more semi-natural habitat and a greater species richness of wild flowers. Therefore, allowing uncultivated areas around the crop to be colonised by species-rich wild flowers is an effective way of boosting the abundance of bumblebees, which are important visitors to courgette flowers, as well as the abundance and species richness of solitary bees, thereby benefitting pollinator conservation.

Habitat characteristics from local to landscape scales combine to shape vertebrate scavenging communities	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Anthropogenic food; Carrion ecology; Diversity; Human-mediated carrion; Richness; Vegetation structure	VULTURE; DIVERSITY; BENEFITS; DECLINE; DRIVEN; SIZE	Abiotic and biotic factors modulate carcass consumption by scavengers, affecting ecosystem functioning. Habitat structure is arguably a key factor influencing scavenging, but its role remains poorly understood, particularly at small spatial scales. We examine how habitat characteristics at landscape (50-1000 m radius) and local (<= 10 m radius) scales around carrion affect the structure of vertebrate scavenging communities. We used remote cameras to monitor the consumption of 151 ungulate carcasses in one temperate (55 carcasses) and two Mediterranean (56 and 40 carcasses) study areas in Spain in 2011-2013. Our results showed complex habitat-scavenger relationships that mainly relied upon the spatial scale, the type of carcass and the study area. While the response of scavenger richness to habitat characteristics was consistent across study areas, the effects of diversity varied regionally at the landscape scale. Large and medium-sized carcasses in open landscapes had lower scavenger richness, likely because open habitats promote vulture dominance. At the local scale, shrub cover lowered scavenger richness and diversity, hindering carrion location by avian scavengers. Our results suggest that the structure of vertebrate scavenging assemblages at carcasses is driven by carcass and habitat characteristics operating as ecological filters at different scales (i.e. local, landscape, and biogeographical), which affect a species' ability to locate, access and dominate carrion.

Gene pool and connectivity patterns of Pinna nobilis in the Balearic Islands (Spain, Western Mediterranean Sea): Implications for its conservation through restocking	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Balearic Islands; biodiversity management; connectivity; current patterns; genetic assignments; larval dispersal; microsatellites; pen shell	SEAGRASS POSIDONIA-OCEANICA; PEN SHELL; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; MORTALITY EVENT; DIVERSITY; GROWTH; SOFTWARE; BIVALVE; SURFACE; MODEL	Pinna nobilis is an endemic bivalve of the Mediterranean Sea, and a vulnerable species registered as endangered and protected under the European Council Directive 92/43/EEC and Barcelona Convention. In early autumn 2016, a mass mortality event impacted P. nobilis populations in the south-western Mediterranean Sea, including the Balearic Islands. At the time of this study, P. nobilis still maintained high population densities along the Balearic coasts (Western Mediterranean). This study evaluated the connectivity of P. nobilis post-larvae and adults in seagrass habitats around the Balearic Islands and identified its source and sink populations. These objectives were reached through a multidisciplinary approach including population genetics (10 microsatellites) and hydrodynamic modelling. High genetic diversity was found and significant genetic differentiation (inferred by fixation index F-ST) was detected between post-larvae samples, but not between adult populations. Significant genic and genotypic differentiation was recorded for adults and post-larvae. This pattern was confirmed by correspondence analysis using allele frequencies. The genetic connectivity pattern was consistent with marine currents and dispersal models. This work not only improves knowledge of the P. nobilis gene pool in south-west Mediterranean populations and their connectivity patterns, but is also crucial to help evaluate the possibility of recovery from source populations and the possibility of restocking programmes, as well as provide a solid base to establish effective marine reserve networks.

Introgressive hybridization between native and non-local steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) of hatchery origin	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						hatchery effects; hybridization; introgression; microsatellite; non-native species; Oncorhynchus mykiss; steelhead	ADULT CHINOOK SALMON; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; WILD POPULATIONS; ATLANTIC SALMON; COHO SALMON; FITNESS; CONSERVATION; WILLAMETTE; SOFTWARE	The artificial propagation and release of individuals from non-local populations is a widespread practice that can threaten the genetic integrity of native, locally adapted populations, because of domestication effects from the artificial rearing environments and inter-breeding with the local populations. Introgressive hybridization was examined in a threatened population of anadromous Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792) (winter-run steelhead) in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. Non-local, hatchery-reared, summer-run steelhead are released annually into the basin as mitigation for the impact of numerous dams. Sixteen microsatellite loci were used to detect introgression in adult steelhead of natural origin migrating into the basin before spawning during 2013 and 2014. Bayesian clustering analysis (structure) was used to identify the level of admixture in the population and to assign individuals to clusters. The Bayesian clustering analysis indicated that there are most likely two populations (or clusters) in the study area: a native, coastal, winter-run steelhead population and a non-local, summer-run steelhead population that was derived from artificial crosses between summer-run coastal and interior redband populations. Introgressive hybridization was detected in 26.4% of the natural-origin adult steelhead. First-generation (F-1) hybrids were estimated as 4.9-10.1% of the natural-origin adult steelhead. Hybrids backcrossed to the native, coastal, winter-run steelhead were nine times more numerous than backcrosses to the hatchery, summer-run steelhead. The timing of upstream migration was significantly different between the native, winter steelhead and the F-1 hybrids. Low numbers of summer steelhead and back-cross summer-run hybrids were identified in the natural-origin population, consistent with the reduced fitness of hatchery-reared summer steelhead in natural environments. Conservation actions that protect native populations from hatchery fish include altering stocking practices (such as integrated management or sterility), and protecting the remaining intact populations by designating genetic preserves and preventing the release of hatchery-origin or hybrid steelhead into these areas.

Successful mechanical eradication of spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus (Rafinesque, 1819)) from a South African river	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						fish; mechanical removal; non-native species; recovery; restoration; stream	CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; NONNATIVE FISHES; BROOK TROUT; NATIVE FISH; REMOVAL; MANAGEMENT; CONFLICTS; THREATS	Following the discovery in 2007 of non-native spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus (Rafinesque, 1819)) in the Thee River, Olifants-Doring River system, Western Cape Province, South Africa, a mechanical removal project was initiated in 2010 to eradicate them to protect the unique native fish assemblage in the river. A temporary gabion barrier was constructed to halt spotted bass invasion into upstream reaches and a variety of mechanical removal techniques were used throughout the project. Three hundred and ninety-nine spotted bass were removed from the river during the project. Three hundred (75%) of these were captured by chasing them into gill nets or by catching them with hand nets. The remainder were removed using spearguns, seine nets and by back-pack electrofishing. Spotted bass had been depleted to below detection levels downstream of the temporary barrier in the second year of the project in 2013. A subsequent survey of the river in 2014 revealed a bass population in a reach above the temporary barrier that had previously been considered uninvaded. This population of spotted bass was removed in 2014. Subsequent annual surveys of the Thee River in 2015, 2016 and 2017 have not detected spotted bass and the population is considered to have been extirpated. Three years after the extirpation of spotted bass from below the temporary barrier, native fiery redfin (Pseudobarbus phlegethon (Barnard, 1938)) and Cape galaxias (Galaxias zebratus Castelnau, 1861) were observed in pools where they had been absent during the bass invasion.

The relative influence of environmental selection (i.e., abiotic conditions, biotic interactions) and stochastic-distance-dependent neutral processes (i.e., demography, dispersal) in shaping communities has been extensively studied for various organisms, but has rarely been explored across a large range of body sizes, in particular in soil environments. We built a detailed census of the whole soil biota in a 12-ha tropical forest plot using soil DNA metabarcoding. We show that the distribution of 19 taxonomic groups (ranging from microbes to mesofauna) is primarily stochastic, suggesting that neutral processes are prominent drivers of the assembly of these communities at this scale. We also identify aluminium, topography and plant species identity as weak, yet significant drivers of soil richness and community composition of bacteria, protists and to a lesser extent fungi. Finally, we show that body size, which determines the scale at which an organism perceives its environment, predicted the community assembly across taxonomic groups, with soil mesofauna assemblages being more stochastic than microbial ones. These results suggest that the relative contribution of neutral processes and environmental selection to community assembly directly depends on body size. Body size is hence an important determinant of community assembly rules at the scale of the ecological community in tropical soils and should be accounted for in spatial models of tropical soil food webs.

Introduction events provide opportunities to observe adaptation over known spatial and temporal scales, facilitating the identification of genes involved in adaptation. The pathogen causing avian malaria, Plasmodium relictum, was introduced to Hawai'i in the 1930s and elicited extinctions and precipitous population declines in native honeycreepers. After a sharp initial population decline, the Hawai'i 'amakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens) has evolved tolerance to the parasite at low elevations where P. relictum exists, and can sustain infection without major fitness consequences. High-elevation, unexposed populations of 'amakihi display little to no tolerance. To explore the genomic basis of adaptation to P. relictum in low-elevation 'amakihi, we genotyped 125 'amakihi from the island of Hawai'i via hybridization capture to 40,000 oligonucleotide baits containing SNPs and used the reference 'amakihi genome to identify genes potentially under selection from malaria. We tested for outlier loci between low- and high-elevation population pairs and identified loci with signatures of selection within low-elevation populations. In some cases, genes commonly involved in the immune response (e.g., major histocompatibility complex) were associated with malaria presence in the population. We also detected several novel candidate loci that may be implicated in surviving malaria infection (e.g., beta-defensin, glycoproteins and interleukin-related genes). Our results suggest that rapid adaptation to pathogens may occur through changes in different immune genes, but in the same classes of genes, across populations.

We know little about changes in genomic differentiation during the early stages of these processes, which can be mediated by anthropogenic perturbation. Here, we analyse three sympatric whitefish species (Coregonus spp) sampled across two neighbouring and connected Swiss pre-alpine lakes, which have been differentially affected by anthropogenic eutrophication. Our data set comprises 16,173 loci genotyped across 138 whitefish using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Our analysis suggests that in each of the two lakes, the population of a different, but ecologically similar, whitefish species declined following a recent period of eutrophication. Genomic signatures consistent with hybridization are more pronounced in the more severely impacted lake. Comparisons between sympatric pairs of whitefish species with contrasting ecology, where one is shallow benthic and the other one more profundal pelagic, reveal genomic differentiation that is largely correlated along the genome, while differentiation is uncorrelated between pairs of allopatric provenance with similar ecology. We identify four genomic loci that provide evidence of parallel divergent adaptation between the shallow benthic species and the two different more profundal species. Functional annotations available for two of those loci are consistent with divergent ecological adaptation. Our genomic analysis indicates the action of divergent natural selection between sympatric whitefish species in pre-alpine lakes and reveals the vulnerability of these species to anthropogenic alterations of the environment and associated adaptive landscape.

The fitness consequences of individual genetic diversity have often been investigated by testing for multilocus heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs), but few studies have been able to assess HFCs across life stages and in both sexes. Here, we test for HFCs using a 26-year longitudinal individual-based data set from a large population of a long-lived seabird (the common tern, Sterna hirundo), where 7,974 chicks and breeders of known age were genotyped at 15 microsatellite loci and sampled for life-history traits over the complete life cycle. Heterozygosity was not correlated with fledging or post-fledging prospecting probabilities, but was positively correlated with recruitment probability. For breeders, annual survival was not correlated with heterozygosity, but annual fledgling production was negatively correlated with heterozygosity in males and highest in intermediately heterozygous females. The contrasting HFCs among life stages and sexes indicate differential selective processes and emphasize the importance of assessing fitness consequences of traits over complete life histories.

Quantitative multi-locus metabarcoding and waggle dance interpretation reveal honey bee spring foraging patterns in Midwest agroecosystems	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						hierarchical classification; molecular palynology; pollinator nutrition; quantitative metabarcoding; waggle dance	TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; POLLEN; IDENTIFICATION; EFFICIENT; NUMBER	We explored the pollen foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies situated in the corn and soybean dominated agroecosystems of central Ohio over a month-long period using both pollen metabarcoding and waggle dance inference of spatial foraging patterns. For molecular pollen analysis, we developed simple and cost-effective laboratory and bioinformatics methods. Targeting four plant barcode loci (ITS2, rbcL, trnL and trnH), we implemented metabarcoding library preparation and dual-indexing protocols designed to minimize amplification biases and index mistagging events. We constructed comprehensive, curated reference databases for hierarchical taxonomic classification of metabarcoding data and used these databases to train the metaxa2 DNA sequence classifier. Comparisons between morphological and molecular palynology provide strong support for the quantitative potential of multi-locus metabarcoding. Results revealed consistent foraging habits between locations and show clear trends in the phenological progression of honey bee spring foraging in these agricultural areas. Our data suggest that three key taxa, woody Rosaceae such as pome fruits and hawthorns, Salix, and Trifolium provided the majority of pollen nutrition during the study. Spatially, these foraging patterns were associated with a significant preference for forests and tree lines relative to herbaceous land cover and nonflowering crop fields.

Factors influencing the introduction and spread of Harmonia axyridis in the Iberian Peninsula	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Harmonia axyridis; Species distribution model; Mahalanobis distance; Invasive alien species; Iberian Peninsula; Vineyards	ASIAN LADY BEETLE; COLEOPTERA-COCCINELLIDAE; HARLEQUIN LADYBIRD; LANDSCAPE; COMMUNITIES; POPULATION; PREDATION; EXPANSION; ABUNDANCE; PALLAS	Harmonia axyridis is a global invasive alien species and its ecological effects are well documented. However, in some regions where it was deliberately introduced, it never became fully established. Until recently, Southern Europe was one such region, although, recently several overwintering populations were found in northeast Spain, which may indicate that the species can potentially spread to the rest of the Iberian Peninsula. Besides the negative impacts for native coccinellid species, the establishment of H. axyridis in the Iberian Peninsula could have an important impact on the wine industry, which is very significant in this region. To predict if H. axyridis will be able to spread across western southern Europe, with an emphasis on vine-growing regions, we used the Mahalanobis distance presence-only species distribution model, which was constructed based on 16 bioclimatic and environmental variables to characterize the occupied niche and predict the distribution of this invasive alien species. Our model revealed that H. axyridis can find suitable conditions mostly in northern regions of the Iberian Peninsula, as well as in punctual locations, in coastal regions of this territory, including important vine-growing regions, which will constitute a challenge to producers. Until recently, the spread of H. axyridis was constrained by climatic factors such as high summer temperatures, however, the overwintering individuals found in Spain seem to be able to deal with such limitations, which apparently indicate the ability to adapt to these conditions. To prevent future negative impacts of H. axyridis in the Iberian Peninsula, we recommend the implementation of an active monitoring programme, together with local stakeholders (farmers and advisers) and citizens, to record and track the dispersion of seminal propagules, which could be more easily contained, with fewer resources.

To examine the role of temperature resilience on its invasion success, we conducted monthly field surveys for two years at Achziv (Israel) Marine Protected Area, and examined the survival of adult individuals from native (Red Sea) and invasive (Mediterranean) populations under different temperature treatments. In addition, temperature effects on fertilization and larval development were examined in controlled laboratory conditions. Results indicate that temperature has a significant effect on H. momus from its early life stages through adulthood. Field surveys revealed a significant decline in H. momus abundance in the Mediterranean with the decrease in seawater temperature. Low temperature inhibited development of early life stages, and individuals from both populations demonstrated low survivability under low temperature treatment. All the above may be derived from the tropical origin of H. momus, and may further limit its dispersal into colder areas. However, adult individuals from the invasive population demonstrated significantly higher survivability to the high temperature treatment in comparison to the native population from the Red Sea. Larvae development, metamorphosis and settlement were enhanced and with higher rates of success under the high temperature conditions. The high-temperature adaptation of the Mediterranean population of H. momus from fertilization to adulthood may thus contribute to its expanding distribution in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Length of cultivation determines native and non-native weed richness in crop fields worldwide	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Arable weeds; Archaeophyte; Agricultural intensification; Biogeography; Biological invasions; Crop production; Macroecology; Species richness	PLANT INVASIONS; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; LAND-USE; TILLAGE; ALIEN; GRADIENTS; IMPACT; FERTILIZATION; MANAGEMENT	Socio-economic factors often determine the extent to which different global regions have been invaded by non-native plant species, yet few studies examine whether such variables are similarly important for native species richness. In contrast to previous studies that have assembled regional floras for comparison, we examine global patterns of non-native and native plant species richness within a single, globally distributed ecosystem: cultivated wheat fields. Native species richness increased with the historic length of wheat cultivation, total wheat harvested area and arable land area in a country. In contrast, non-native weed species richness declined with increasing length of wheat cultivation, higher fertilizer inputs, and lower absolute latitude. The low percentage of native species in countries with a short history of wheat cultivation suggests that the invasion of crop fields by native plants takes longer than the migration of non-native weed species pre-adapted to crop fields in other parts of the world. Seed contaminants in grain imports are probably one of the main sources of non-native weeds, especially for regions with more recent wheat cultivation histories. To date there has been a tendency for research on agricultural weeds to be dissociated from that of plant invasions, yet we show how cultivation history has shaped the weed flora and why non-native weeds are perceived as such a problem in New World agriculture, as well as confirming at a global scale the role of crop husbandry and agricultural extent on weed floras.

Such efforts are constrained by our limited capacity to efficiently detect invasive species. Here, we present the case of Bythotrephes longimanus (spiny water flea) invasion into Wisconsin lakes. Detecting Bythotrephes has proven to be challenging due to its capacity to persist at low densities and its highly seasonal population dynamics. We use Bythotrephes to explore detection using three monitoring methods: zooplankton net tows, environmental DNA (eDNA), and sampling of Bythotrephes tail spine subfossils in sediments. Detection probabilities were highly seasonal for both the net tow and eDNA sampling methodsthough detections occurred one to two weeks earlier in net towsand seasonal targeting substantially improved detection by both methods. Conversely, Bythotrephes spine subfossils were found in all 10 lakes with confirmed Bythotrephes populations and in all five samples taken from each lake, except for a single lake where four of the five samples had subfossils. This method was insensitive to seasonally varying population densities as sediments integrate over variation in population densities. In this case, detection and abundance estimation were well covered by sediments and zooplankton nets, respectively, and eDNA provided little additional benefit to surveillance. Our work highlights the importance of choosing methods that address both species life history and monitoring objectives when designing surveillance programs.

Many plant species have evolved specialist associations with biotic vectors to facilitate dispersal. Such specialised interactions mean that these associations are potentially highly sensitive to disruption, e.g. from invasive species. However, despite this threat we still understand remarkably little about how such perturbations affect the dynamics and efficiency of the seed-dispersal process. In this study we quantify the impacts of an invasive ant across three key phases of the seed dispersal process: seed removal, distribution and placement, in order to determine the stages of seed dispersal most vulnerable to disruption by invaders. Using the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) as a model, we show that invaded sites exhibited a significant decrease in seed dispersal services across all three phases of the dispersal process, relative to non-invaded sites. Seeds dispersed in invaded sites were: (a) less likely to be transported; (b) potentially distributed over a smaller spatial area, and (c) less likely to be placed at soil depths favourable for germination and establishment compared to those dispersed in non-invaded sites. These results reveal that ant-mediated seed dispersal services are significantly reduced by an invasive species at multiple stages in the dispersal process. Reductions in the efficacy of seed dispersal, combined with shifts in the ecological and geographical patterns of dispersal, may lead to cascading impacts on plant species composition and community structure. This study shows how an invasive ant can affect seed dispersal at several stages in the dispersal process.	[Devenish, Adam J.

However, the early stages of biological invasions (introduction, establishment, and initial spread) are usually poorly documented, limiting our understanding of post-introduction dispersal and the role of humans in invasive spread. We aim to assess a new approach to retrospectively understand spatio-temporal patterns of introduction, establishment, dispersal, and spread in biological invasions, using the case study of an ongoing invasion of the Indian bullfrog (Hoplobatachus tigerinus) on the Andaman archipelago, Bay of Bengal. We sampled 91 villages on eight human inhabited islands of the Andaman archipelago from 2015 to 2016. We assessed the occurrence of the bullfrog using visual encounter surveys and recorded the invasion history (year of establishment, source site, and dispersal pathway) for each site by surveying 892 key informants (farmers, plantation workers, and aqua-culturists). We sought to corroborate the reconstructed invasion history with false positive occupancy modelling, using site specific covariates that corresponded to hypotheses on specific dispersal pathways. The bullfrog occurred in at least 62% of the sampled sites spread over six islands, a dramatic increase to the previously known invaded range. The bullfrog was most likely introduced in early 2000s, and its exponential expansion has occurred since 2009. Contaminants' of fish culture trade and intentional release' were reported to be the primary pathways of introduction and post-introduction dispersal, facilitating introductions from the Indian mainland and inter-island transfers. False-positive occupancy modelling confirmed that three sites on the archipelago influenced the invasion disproportionately by acting as dispersal hubs. The study elucidates the efficacy of using public surveys to identify dispersal pathways and hubs, and to understand invasive spread, when such information is typically unavailable otherwise. The proposed approach is scalable to other systems and species.

They are grown in a broad range of habitats such as home gardens, public spaces, belts along roads, floriculture plantations and specialized garden collections. Recently so-called mixed perennial beds are becoming increasingly popular as they need less maintenance compared to traditional plantings. Old perennial plantations with known initial composition, monitored for a long period of time, can provide useful insights into the naturalization and invasive potential of individual species. We studied survival and spread of ornamental plants by using data from flower beds established in 2006-2010, and resampled in 2016, and related these dynamics to the traits of the taxa (height, SLA, reproduction), taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. The height of plants and generative reproduction had a positive effect on survival. Taxa taller than 1m and with massive and regular generative reproduction survived best. In the majority of beds, one to three taxa increased their abundance at the expense of others. These dominants were mainly alien such as Aquilegia sp., Aster dumosus, Knautia macedonica and Silene coronaria, that were also able to spread into neighbouring flower beds where they have not been originally planted.

However, documentation of the spread of non-native crayfish species and their impact on native crayfishes could be improved, particularly over large spatial scales in stream ecosystems. We collected crayfish and quantified habitat at 461 stream sites throughout Michigan in 2014-2016 and compared our collections to a historical account of crayfish collections published in 1975. Our objectives were to: (1) quantify the change in non-native rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) and native species distributions from 1975 to 2014-2016; (2) quantify how rusty crayfish affect the habitat associations of native species in Michigan streams; and (3) determine the effectiveness of dipnets, our primary sampling method. We found all species in more watersheds compared to 1975, likely due in part to increased sampling. However, we found rusty crayfish in 22 more HUC-8 watersheds than in 1975, a larger increase than all other species. Habitat associations of native species also shift in the presence of rusty crayfish. In instances where native species co-occurred with rusty crayfish, most obligate aquatic native species were found in less-preferred habitat such as sand or macrophytes compared to cobble substrate when the species is in isolation. Our results indicate a broad range expansion by rusty crayfish over the last 40years, suggesting that surveys of crayfish diversity and habitat occupancy should be more routine to inform management of native crayfish species.

This study aims to examine to what extent socioeconomic consequences of disability contribute to poorer access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for Cameroonian with disabilities and how these outcomes vary with disabilities characteristics and gender. It uses data from a population-based survey conducted in 2015 in Yaounde, Cameroon. Mediation analysis was performed to determine how much of the total association between disability and the use, satisfaction and difficulties to access SRH services was mediated by education level, material wellbeing lifetime work participation and availability of social support. Overall, disability was associated with deprivation for all socioeconomic factors assessed though significant variation with the nature and severity of the functional limitations was observed. Lower education level and restricted lifetime work mediated a large part of the association between disability and lower use of HIV testing and of family planning. By contrast, while people with disabilities reported more difficulties to use a SRH service, no mediating was identified. In conclusion, Cameroonians with disabilities since childhood have restricted access to SRH services resulting from socioeconomic factors occurring early during the life-course.

Genetic Damage in Farmers Exposed to Pesticides	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						carcinogens; comet assay; micronucleus test; farmers	DNA-DAMAGE; COMET ASSAY; IN-VITRO; GENOTOXICITY; RISK	Modern agriculture, practiced after the green revolution worldwide, aims to maximize production in order to provide food for the growing world population. Thus, farmers are required to modernize their practices through the mechanization of land use and, above all, the use of chemical pesticides to control agricultural pests. However, in addition to combating the target pest, chemical pesticides indirectly affect a wide range of species, including humans, leading to health damage. Among the main problems caused by the use of pesticides is the genotoxicity caused by chronic exposure. The present study aims to verify the occurrence of genetic damage in farmers who are occupationally exposed to agrochemicals compared to people of other professions that do not use toxic substances (control group). The research was conducted with 36 male participants (18 farmers and 18 control group, ages 24-71 for the farmer group and 22-61 for the control group). The comet assay and micronucleus test results revealed a higher rate of genetic damage in the group of farmers than in the control group. A questionnaire answered by the farmers showed that the Personal Protect Equipment (PPE) is used incorrectly or not used. In summary, our results indicate that farmers are exposed to occupational hazards. To mitigate this risk, we conducted awareness campaigns to notify the farmers of the risks and highlight the importance of using PPE correctly. Intensive efforts and training are thus required to build an awareness of safety practices and change the attitudes of farm workers in the hope of preventing harmful environmental and anthropogenic effects.

This paper presents a hierarchical Bayesian spatially varying coefficient model to evaluate the effects demographic factors on intestinal parasites morbidities in Ghana. The modeling relied on morbidity data collected by the District Health Information Management Systems. We developed Poisson and Poisson-gamma spatially varying coefficient models. We used the demographic factors, unsafe drinking water, unsafe toilet, and unsafe liquid waste disposal as model covariates. The models were fitted using the integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA). The overall risk of intestinal parasites infection was estimated to be 10.9 per 100 people with a wide spatial variation in the district-specific posterior risk estimates. Substantial spatial variation of increasing multiplicative effects of unsafe drinking water, unsafe toilet, and unsafe liquid waste disposal occurs on the variation of intestinal parasites risk. The structured residual spatial variation widely dominates the unstructured component, suggesting that the unaccounted-for risk factors are spatially continuous in nature. The study concludes that both the spatial distribution of the posterior risk and the associated exceedance probability maps are essential for monitoring and control of intestinal parasites.

The Metapopulation Microcosm Plate: A modified 96-well plate for use in microbial metapopulation experiments	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						bacteria; corridors; dispersal; metapopulation; microbes; microcosm; microtitre plate	NETWORK STRUCTURE; DISPERSAL; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS	Researchers in many subfields of ecology and evolutionary biology test hypotheses relating to metapopulation dynamics and landscape spatial structure. Key aspects of these hypotheses are often (a) large numbers of subpopulations and dispersal corridors and (b) their positions relative to each other. Testing such spatial hypotheses using traditional laboratory equipment and methods can be impractical, unwieldy, expensive, or impossible. The Metapopulation Microcosm Plate (MMP) overcomes many of these difficulties. This device resembles a 96-well microtitre plate, but contains dispersal corridors between wells that can be modified in their spatial position to create various artificial landscapes, each with up to 96 habitat patches and hundreds of nonintersecting dispersal corridors of varying lengths. The device can be filled with nutrient broth and used to culture microbial metapopulations. Here, I describe how MMPs are designed, assembled, sterilized, and filled and demonstrate that MMPs can remain water tight and sterile with minimal evaporation for 5-7 days. Metapopulation Microcosm Plates (MMPs) can be used to test many spatial hypotheses that have previously been prohibitively difficult to test. Further, by allowing individual behavioural responses to within-patch conditions, MMPs can incorporate greater realism than directed pipetting or other artificial dispersal methods.

CityNet-Deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						acoustic indices; anthropogenic; biodiversity assessment; convolutional neural networks; ecoacoustics; machine learning; soundscapes; urban ecology	ACOUSTIC INDEXES; BIODIVERSITY; SOUNDSCAPE; IDENTIFICATION; LANDSCAPE	Cities support unique and valuable ecological communities, but understanding urban wildlife is limited due to the difficulties of assessing biodiversity. Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of assessing habitats, where biotic sound measured from audio recordings is used as a proxy for population abundance and/or activity. However, existing algorithms systematically over and underestimate measures of biotic activity in the presence of typical urban non-biotic sounds in recordings. We develop CityNet, a deep learning system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to measure audible biotic (CityBioNet) and anthropogenic (CityAnthroNet) acoustic activity in cities. The CNNs were trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. Using a held-out test dataset, we compare the precision and recall of CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet separately to the best available alternative algorithms: four Acoustic Indices: Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Bioacoustic Index, and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and a state-of-the-art bird call detection CNN (bulbul). We also compare the effect of non-biotic sounds on the predictions of CityBioNet and bulbul. Finally we apply CityNet to describe acoustic patterns of the urban soundscape in two sites along an urbanisation gradient. CityBioNet was the best performing algorithm for measuring biotic activity in terms of precision and recall, followed by bulbul, whereas the Acoustic Indices performed worst. CityAnthroNet outperformed the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, but by a smaller margin than CityBioNet achieved against the competing algorithms. The CityBioNet predictions were impacted by mechanical sounds, whereas air traffic and wind sounds influenced the bulbul predictions. Across an urbanisation gradient, we show that CityNet produced realistic daily patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity from real-world urban audio data. Using CityNet, it is possible to automatically measure biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in cities from audio recordings. If embedded within an autonomous sensing system, CityNet could produce environmental data for cites at large-scales and facilitate investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on wildlife. The algorithms, code and pretrained models are made freely available in combination with two expert-annotated urban audio datasets to facilitate automated environmental surveillance in cities.

Several different JSDMs have been proposed in the literature, but the use of different or conflicting nomenclature and statistical notation potentially obscures similarities and differences among them. Furthermore, new JSDM implementations have been illustrated with different case studies, preventing direct comparisons of computational and statistical performance. We aim to resolve these outstanding issues by (a) highlighting similarities among seven presence-absence JSDMs using a clearly defined, singular notation; and (b) evaluating the computational and statistical performance of each JSDM using six datasets that vary widely in numbers of sites, species, and environmental covariates considered. Our singular notation shows that many of the JSDMs are very similar, and in turn parameter estimates of different JSDMs are moderate to strongly, positively correlated. In contrast, the different JSDMs clearly differ in computational efficiency and memory limitations. Our framework will allow ecologists to make educated decisions about the JSDM that best suits their objective, and enable wider uptake of JSDM methods among the ecological community.

We present the r package blockCV, a new toolbox for cross-validation of species distribution modelling. Although it has been developed with species distribution modelling in mind, it can be used for any spatial modelling. The package can generate spatially or environmentally separated folds. It includes tools to measure spatial autocorrelation ranges in candidate covariates, providing the user with insights into the spatial structure in these data. It also offers interactive graphical capabilities for creating spatial blocks and exploring data folds. Package blockCV enables modellers to more easily implement a range of evaluation approaches. It will help the modelling community learn more about the impacts of evaluation approaches on our understanding of predictive performance of species distribution models.

A multistate dynamic occupancy model to estimate local colonization-extinction rates and patterns of co-occurrence between two or more interacting species	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Bayesian models; camera traps; co-occurrence; occupancy models; species interactions	HABITAT; SELECTION	Although ecology is rife with theory that explores how multiple species co-occur through space and time, the field lacks robust statistical models to parameterize this theory with empirical data, particularly when species are detected imperfectly and data are collected as a time-series. We address this need by developing an occupancy model that estimates local colonization and extinction rates for two or more interacting species when data are collected across multiple sampling occasions. This model estimates how community composition at a site may change across sampling occasions by assuming the latent occupancy state is a categorical random variable. We used a multinomial-logit model to parameterize species specific parameters and pairwise interactions between species, both of which can be made a function of covariates. These transition probabilities between community states can then be converted to occupancy or co-occurrence probabilities to determine how community composition varies along an environmental gradient or through time. As an example, we estimate patterns of co-occurrence between coyote Canis latrans, Virginia opossum Didelphis virginiana, and raccoon Procyon lotor in Chicago, Illinois, USA with data from a multiyear camera trapping study. Models with pairwise interactions between species greatly out performed models that assumed independence between species. Opossum and raccoon, for example, were far less likely to go extinct in habitat patches where coyotes were present. Community composition at a site depends on species interactions and the local environment. Our model can separate such effects by estimating the underlying processes that define species occurrence patterns. As a result, our model can more explicitly quantify a wide range of ecological dynamics and therefore be used to empirically test ecological theory, such as estimating priority effects at a site or turnover rates between species, both of which can be made to vary as a function of covariates.

Response of river water chemistry to changing atmospheric environment and sulfur dynamics in a forested catchment in central Japan	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Atmospheric deposition; Geology; Isotopic ratio; Recovery; Sulfur; Mixing model	EMISSION INVENTORY; ACID DEPOSITION; ISOTOPE RATIOS; ACIDIFICATION; BUDGETS; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; DIOXIDE; SULFATE; NITRATE; CHINA	Reduction of atmospheric sulfur (S) deposition and recovery of terrestrial ecosystems from acidification are matters of concerns in Asia. The Lake Ijira catchment (IJR) is located in the downwind region of the Chukyo Industrial Area in central Japan and has historically experienced large-scale deposition of S and nitrogen (N) from the atmosphere. Long-term monitoring data on the river water (RW) chemistry since 1988 were assessed with intensive-survey datasets on the input-output material budgets and S isotopic analysis (S-34). Previous studies have suggested that IJR was acidified and N-saturated, which was triggered by climatic anomalies (cold summer and drought summer) in the mid-1990s. Analysis shows that with a decline in NO3- concentrations, RW pH recovered to its original level in the early 2000s. Reductions in atmospheric deposition, diminished effects of climatic anomalies, and forest management practices, have all contributed to RW chemistry recovery. Although the SO42- concentration in the RW has declined continuously after the peak in 1994, the mean SO42- output significantly exceeded the input; the 5-year means from 2010 to 2014 are 2.5kmol(c)ha(-1)year(-1) and 0.86kmol(c)ha(-1)year(-1), respectively. The mean S-34 values of SO42- in rainwater and soil solution at 20cm depth were 4.3 parts per thousand and 3.5 parts per thousand, respectively, and that in the RW was -13.2 parts per thousand. The contributions of groundwater S to the RW S were estimated to range from 75 to 91%. Geological S with significantly low S-34 values largely contributed to the discrepancy of the input-output budget, while atmospheric S appeared to accumulate in soil as organic S. The tree-ring S-34 profile recorded historical changes in the atmospheric inputs in the region. With recovery of the RW, the relative contribution of atmospheric S became smaller. However, most of the atmospheric S is still retained in soil. Over the last few decades, RW chemistry has sensitively responded to changes in the atmospheric environment, including the atmospheric deposition of S and N and climatic anomalies, and as future changes are likely, long-term monitoring is essential.

The effect of network size and sampling completeness in depauperate networks	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						consumer-resource interactions; metric bias; network structure; subweb size; under-sampling	ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; SEED DISPERSAL; FOOD WEBS; HYMENOPTERA; BIODIVERSITY; SPECIALIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; POLLINATION; STABILITY; PATTERNS	The accurate estimation of interaction network structure is essential for understanding network stability and function. A growing number of studies evaluate under-sampling as the degree of sampling completeness (proportional richness observed). How the relationship between network structural metrics and sampling completeness varies across networks of different sizes remains unclear, but this relationship has implications for the within- and between-system comparability of network structure. Here, we test the combined effects of network size and sampling completeness on the structure of spatially distinct networks (i.e., subwebs) in a host-parasitoid model system to better understand the within-system variability in metric bias. Richness estimates were used to quantify a gradient of sampling completeness of species and interactions across randomly subsampled subwebs. The combined impacts of network size and sampling completeness on the estimated values of twelve unweighted and weighted network metrics were tested. The robustness of network metrics to under-sampling was strongly related to network size, and sampling completeness of interactions were generally a better predictor of metric bias than sampling completeness of species. Weighted metrics often performed better than unweighted metrics at low sampling completeness; however, this was mainly evident at large rather than small subweb size. These outcomes highlight the significance of under-sampling for the comparability of both unweighted and weighted network metrics when networks are small and vary in size. This has implications for within-system comparability of species-poor networks and, more generally, reveals problems with under-sampling ecological networks that may otherwise be difficult to detect in species-rich networks. To mitigate the impacts of under-sampling, more careful considerations of system-specific variation in metric bias are needed.

Intraspecific variation in lizard heat tolerance alters estimates of climate impact	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; critical thermal maxima; ectotherm; physiology; plasticity; thermal biology	THERMAL TRAIT VARIATION; THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR; LOCAL ADAPTATION; PHYSIOLOGY; ECTOTHERMS; PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; LIMITS; NICHE	Research addressing the effects of global warming on the distribution and persistence of species generally assumes that population variation in thermal tolerance is spatially constant or overridden by interspecific variation. Typically, this rationale is implicit in sourcing one critical thermal maximum (CTmax) population estimate per species to model spatiotemporal cross-taxa variation in heat tolerance. Theory suggests that such an approach could result in biased or imprecise estimates and forecasts of impact from climate warming, but limited empirical evidence in support of those expectations exists. We experimentally quantify the magnitude of intraspecific variation in CTmax among lizard populations, and the extent to which incorporating such variability can alter estimates of climate impact through a biophysical model. To do so, we measured CTmax from 59 populations of 15 Iberian lizard species (304 individuals). The overall median CTmax across all individuals from all species was 42.8 degrees C and ranged from 40.5 to 48.3 degrees C, with species medians decreasing through xeric, climate-generalist and mesic taxa. We found strong statistical support for intraspecific differentiation in CTmax by up to a median of 3 degrees C among populations. We show that annual restricted activity (operative temperature > CTmax) over the Iberian distribution of our study species differs by a median of >80 hr per 25-km(2) grid cell based on different population-level CTmax estimates. This discrepancy leads to predictions of spatial variation in annual restricted activity to change by more than 20 days for six of the study species. Considering that during restriction periods, reptiles should be unable to feed and reproduce, current projections of climate-change impacts on the fitness of ectotherm fauna could be under- or over-estimated depending on which population is chosen to represent the physiological spectra of the species in question. Mapping heat tolerance over the full geographical ranges of single species is thus critical to address cross-taxa patterns and drivers of heat tolerance in a biologically comprehensive way.

The role of competition in determining range limits and preventing invasions at biogeographic scales is more controversial, partly because of the complexity of processes involved in species colonization of novel habitats and the difficulties in performing appropriate manipulations and controls. We examined experimentally whether competition is likely to affect poleward range expansion hindering or facilitating the establishment of the limpet Scurria viridula along the south-eastern Pacific rocky shore (30 degrees S, Chile) in the region occupied by the congeneric S. zebrina. We also assessed whether competition with the "invader" or range-expanding species could reduce individual performance of the "native" S. zebrina and depress local populations Geographic field surveys were conducted to characterize the abundance and identity of limpets along the south-eastern Pacific coast from 18 degrees S to 41 degrees S, and the micro-scale (few cm) spatial distribution across the range overlap of the two species. Field-based competition experiments were conducted at the southern leading edge of the range of S. viridula (33 degrees S) and at the northern limit of S. zebrina (30 degrees S). Field surveys showed poleward range expansion of S. viridula of ca. 210 km since year 2000, with an expansion rate of 13.1 km/year. No range shift was detected for S. zebrina. The resident S. zebrina had significant negative effects on the growth rate of the invading juvenile S. viridula, while no effect of the latter was found on S. zebrina. Spatial segregation between species was found at the scale of cms. Our results provide novel evidence of an asymmetric competitive effect of a resident species on an invader, which may hamper further range expansion. No negative effect of the invader on the resident species was detected. This study highlights the complexities of evaluating the role of species interactions in setting range limits of species, but showed how interspecific competition might slow the advance of an invader by reducing individual performance and overall population size at the advancing front.

However, the usefulness of TPL exponents as an ecological metric has been questioned, largely due to its apparent ubiquity in various complex systems. The aim of this study was to test whether TPL exponents vary systematically with potential drivers of animal aggregation in time and space and therefore capture useful ecological information of the system of interest. We derived community TPL exponents from a long-term, standardised and spatially dense data series of abundance and body size data for a strongly size-structured fish community in the North Sea. We then compared TPL exponents between regions of contrasting environmental characteristics. We find that, in general, TPL exponents vary more than expected under random conditions in the North Sea for size-based populations compared to communities considered by species. Further, size-based temporal TPL exponents are systematically higher (implying more temporally aggregated distributions) along hydrographic boundaries. Time series of size-based spatial TPL exponents also differ between hydrographically distinct basins. These findings support the notion that TPL exponents contain ecological information, capturing community spatio-temporal dynamics as influenced by external drivers.	[Cobain, Matthew R.

Competitive asymmetry and local adaptation in Trinidadian guppies	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						density dependence; ecotypes; individual differences; interaction surface; intraspecific competition; size-dependent; somatic growth rate; trait variation	LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION; POECILIA-RETICULATA; INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; PARALLEL EVOLUTION; DENSITY REGULATION; ONTOGENIC NICHE; SIZE; PREDATION; POPULATIONS	The outcome of competition between individuals often depends on body size. These competitive asymmetries can drive variation in demographic rates, influencing the ecology and evolution of life histories. The magnitude and direction of such asymmetries differ among taxa, yet little is known empirically about how adaptation to resource limitation alters competitive asymmetries. Here, we investigate the relationship between size-dependent competitive ability and adaptation to resource limitation. We examined size-dependent competition in two ecotypes of Trinidadian guppy, adapted to high or low levels of resource competition. Using aquaria-based competition experiments, we describe how the size and ecotype of competitors influence somatic growth rate, whilst controlling for the confounding effect of niche differentiation. We replicated our study across two independent evolutionary origins of the "competitive" ecotype. The two "competitive" ecotypes differed markedly in size-dependent asymmetry, indicating that adaptation to resource limitation alone is insufficient to explain changes in size-dependent competitive asymmetry. For one origin, the ecotype adapted to resource limitation was a superior competitor over a wide range of size pairings. The equivalence of competitors varied over fivefold, dependent on size and ecotype; in three of four populations, larger individuals had a competitive advantage. Our results demonstrate that competitive asymmetry has strong effects on somatic growth. Because somatic growth contributes to demographic parameters, intraspecific trait variation is likely to play a key role in regulating demographic rates. Our findings imply that the evolution of size-dependent asymmetries under conditions of intense competition is likely to be constrained by niche availability, although further research is needed to verify this.

Central to this are bet-hedging strategies that maximize geometric mean fitness across generations, either by being conservative or diversifying phenotypes. Theoretical models have identified environmental variation across generations with multiplicative fitness effects as driving the evolution of bet-hedging. However, behavioral ecology has revealed adaptive responses to additive fitness effects of environmental variation within lifetimes, either through insurance or risk-sensitive strategies. Here, we explore whether the effects of adaptive insurance interact with the evolution of bet-hedging by varying the position and skew of both arithmetic and geometric mean fitness functions. We find that insurance causes the optimal phenotype to shift from the peak to down the less steeply decreasing side of the fitness function, and that conservative bet-hedging produces an additional shift on top of this, which decreases as adaptive phenotypic variation from diversifying bet-hedging increases. When diversifying bet-hedging is not an option, environmental canalization to reduce phenotypic variation is almost always favored, except where the tails of the fitness function are steeply convex and produce a novel risk-sensitive increase in phenotypic variance akin to diversifying bet-hedging. Importantly, using skewed fitness functions, we provide the first model that explicitly addresses how conservative and diversifying bet-hedging strategies might coexist.

Traditionally, researchers focus on the importance of female mate choice and male-male competition in maintaining or eroding species barriers. Although female-female competition is widespread, little is known about its role in the speciation process. Here, we investigate a case of interspecific female competition and its influence on patterns of phenotypic and genetic introgression between species. We examine a hybrid zone between sex-role reversed, Neotropical shorebird species, the northern jacana (Jacana spinosa) and wattled jacana (J. jacana), in which female-female competition is a major determinant of reproductive success. Previous work found that females of the more aggressive and larger species, J. spinosa, disproportionately mother hybrid offspring, potentially by monopolizing breeding territories in sympatry with J. jacana. We find a cline shift of female body mass relative to the genetic center of the hybrid zone, consistent with asymmetric introgression of this competitive trait. We suggest that divergence in sexual characteristics between sex-role reversed females can influence patterns of gene flow upon secondary contact, similar to males in systems with more typical sex roles.

To assess the possible role of sperm diversification in reproductive isolation, we studied sperm morphology in two closely related bird species, the common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and the thrush nightingale (Luscinia luscinia), that hybridize in a secondary contact zone spanning Central and Eastern Europe. We found: (1) striking divergence between the species in total sperm length, accompanied by a difference in the length of the mitochondrial sperm component; (2) greater divergence between species in sperm morphology in sympatry than in allopatry, with evidence for character displacement in sperm head length detected in L. megarhynchos; (3) interspecific hybrids showing sperm with a length intermediate between the parental species, but no evidence for decreased sperm quality (the proportion of abnormal spermatozoa in ejaculates). Our results demonstrate that divergence in sperm morphology between the two nightingale species does not result in intrinsic postzygotic isolation, but may contribute to postcopulatory prezygotic isolation. This isolation could be strengthened in sympatry by reinforcement.

Thus, understanding environmental adaptation requires investigating patterns of covariation across functionally related traits. The replicated adaptive radiations of Greater Antillean Anolis lizards are characterized by ecological and morphological convergence, thus, providing an opportunity to examine the role of multiple phenotypes in microhabitat adaptation. Here, we examine integrated claw and toepad morphological evolution in relation to habitat partitioning across the adaptive radiations of Greater Antillean anoles. Based on analysis of 428 specimens from 57 species, we found that different aspects of claw morphology were associated with different perch dimensions, with claw height positively associated with perch diameter and claw curvature positively associated with perch height. Patterns of integration also varied across claw and toepad traits, likely driven by correlative selection for performance on smoother and rougher substrates. Finally, rates of evolution differed between claw and toepad traits, with claw length evolving faster than all other traits despite having no predicted functional importance. Our results highlight the multivariate nature of phenotypic adaptation and suggest that phenotypic integration across Greater Antillean anoles is driven by fine-scale correlative selection based on structural habitat specialization.

Yet, comprehensive assessments of potential reproductive barriers, which are needed to make inferences on processes driving speciation, are only available for a limited number of systems. In this study, we estimated individual and cumulative strengths of seven prezygotic and six postzygotic reproductive barriers between the recently diverged taxa Silene dioica (L.) Clairv. and S. latifolia Poiret using both published and new data. A combination of multiple partial reproductive barriers resulted in near-complete reproductive isolation between S. dioica and S. latifolia, consistent with earlier estimates of gene flow between the taxa. Extrinsic barriers associated with adaptive ecological divergence were most important, while intrinsic postzygotic barriers had moderate individual strength but contributed only little to total reproductive isolation. These findings are in line with ecological divergence as driver of speciation. We further found extensive variation in extrinsic reproductive isolation, ranging from sites with very strong selection against migrants and hybrids to intermediate sites where substantial hybridization is possible. This situation may allow for, or even promote, heterogeneous genetic divergence.

Recent theory predicts that X-linked genes should disproportionately contribute to local adaptation relative to other genomic regions, yet this prediction remains to be tested. We carried out a multigeneration crossing scheme, using two cline-end populations of Drosophila melanogaster, to estimate the relative contributions of the X chromosome, autosomes, and mitochondrial genome to divergence in four traits involved in local adaptation (wing size, resistance to heat, desiccation, and starvation stresses). We found that the mitochondrial genome and autosomes contributed significantly to clinal divergence in three of the four traits. In contrast, the X made no significant contribution to divergence in these traits. Given the small size of the mitochondrial genome, our results indicate that it plays a surprisingly large role in clinal adaptation. In contrast, the X, which represents roughly 20% of the Drosophila genome, contributes negligiblya pattern that conflicts with theoretical predictions. These patterns reinforce recent work implying a central role of mitochondria in climatic adaptation, and suggest that different genomic regions may play fundamentally different roles in processes of divergence with gene flow.

Maternal effects can show marked proximate responses to nutrition, but whether they contribute to longer term dietary adaptation is unclear. Here, we tested the hypotheses that maternal effects: (i) contribute to dietary adaptation, (ii) diminish when dietary conditions are constant between generations, (iii) are trait-specific and (iv) interact with high- and low-quality food. We used experimental evolution regimes in the medfly (Ceratitis capitata) to test these predictions by subjecting an outbred laboratory-adapted population to replicated experimental evolution on either constant high calorie sugar (A') or low-calorie starch (S') larval diets, with a standard adult diet across both regimes. We measured the contribution of maternal effects by comparing developmental and adult phenotypes of individuals reared on their own diet with those swapped onto the opposite diet for either one or two generations (high and low maternal effect conditions, respectively), both at the start and after 30 generations of selection. Initially, there were strong maternal effects on female body mass and male mating success but not larval survival. Interestingly, the initial maternal effects observed in female body mass and male mating success showed sex-specific interactions when individuals from high calorie regimes were tested on low calorie diets. However, as populations responded to selection, the effects of maternal provisioning on all traits diminished. The results broadly supported the predictions. They show how the contribution of maternal effects to dietary responses evolves in a context-dependent manner, with significant variation across different fitness-related traits. We conclude that maternal effects can evolve during nutritional adaptation and hence may be an important life history trait to measure, rather than to routinely minimize.

Phenotypic plasticity facilitates initial colonization of a novel environment	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Adaptation; colonization; phenotypic plasticity	CRYPTIC GENETIC-VARIATION; RAPID ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; ALCOHOL-DEHYDROGENASE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOCAL ADAPTATION; POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; INVASIVE PLANTS; REACTION NORMS	Phenotypic plasticity can allow organisms to respond to environmental changes by producing better matching phenotypes without any genetic change. Because of this, plasticity is predicted to be a major mechanism by which a population can survive the initial stage of colonizing a novel environment. We tested this prediction by challenging wild Drosophila melanogaster with increasingly extreme larval environments and then examining expression of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and its relationship to larval survival in the first generation of encountering a novel environment. We found that most families responded in the adaptive direction of increased ADH activity in higher alcohol environments and families with higher plasticity were also more likely to survive in the highest alcohol environment. Thus, plasticity of ADH activity was positively selected in the most extreme environment and was a key trait influencing fitness. Furthermore, there was significant heritability of ADH plasticity that can allow plasticity to evolve in subsequent generations after initial colonization. The adaptive value of plasticity, however, was only evident in the most extreme environment and had little impact on fitness in less extreme environments. The results provide one of the first direct tests of the adaptive role of phenotypic plasticity in colonizing a novel environment.

Heterozygosity and asymmetry: Ectodysplasin as a form of genetic stress in marine threespine stickleback	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Adaptation; canalization; developmental instability; phenotypic plasticity	FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; DEVELOPMENTAL STABILITY; TOOL SET; EVOLUTION; ASSOCIATION; VARIABILITY; POPULATIONS; INSTABILITY; PHENOTYPES; PARASITISM	Genome-wide heterozygosity has long been hypothesized to play a role in buffering organisms against developmental perturbations, potentially resulting in increased symmetry. If true, this could in part explain the maintenance of standing genetic variation in wild populations. Marine threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were sampled across their eastern Pacific coastal distribution from Alaska to California and variations in asymmetry for both structural and nonstructural armor traits (lateral plates) were assessed. Structural plates consistently showed less asymmetry than nonstructural plates, but standardized measures of heterozygosity were not correlated with the extent of asymmetry expressed by a fish. Fish that were heterozygous for the major-effect gene controlling lateral plate variation (Ectodysplasin) had higher occurrences of asymmetry, even when the individuals were phenotypically fully plated. Collectively, this suggests that heterozygosity at a major-effect locus can have a greater impact on asymmetry than heterozygosity sampled across the genome.	[Morris, Matthew R.

Integration and modularity of teleostean pectoral fin shape and its role in the diversification of acanthomorph fishes	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Fin skeleton; lepidotrichia; macroevolution; morphological evolution; radials	MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION; CAUDAL FIN; EVOLUTION; PHYLOGENY; ORIGIN; DIVERSITY; DISPARITY; PATTERNS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; COVARIATION	Phenotypic integration and modularity describe the strength and pattern of interdependencies between traits. Integration and modularity have been proposed to influence the trajectory of evolution, either acting as constraints or facilitators. Here, we examine trends in the integration and modularity of pectoral fin morphology in teleost fishes using geometric morphometrics. We compare the fin shapes of the highly diverse radiation of acanthomorph fishes to lower teleosts. Integration and modularity are measured using two-block partial least squares analysis and the covariance ratio coefficient between the radial bones and lepidotrichia of the pectoral fins. We show that the fins of acanthomorph fishes are more tightly integrated but also more morphologically diverse and faster evolving compared to nonacanthomorph fishes. The main pattern of shape covariation in nonacanthomorphs is concordant with the main trajectory of evolution between nonacanthomorphs and acanthomorphs. Our findings support a facilitating role for integration during the acanthomorph diversification. Potential functional consequences and developmental mechanisms of fin integration are discussed.

Post-release breeding of translocated sharp-tailed grouse and an absence of artificial insemination effects	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						conservation ecology; conservation genetics; conservation management; management strategies; population management; radio telemetry; reproductive behaviour; threatened species; wildlife management	GREATER SAGE-GROUSE; COCKATIELS NYMPHICUS-HOLLANDICUS; CENTROCERCUS-UROPHASIANUS; SEMEN COLLECTION; PATERNITY; MICROSATELLITES; PROGRAM; STORAGE; CRYOPRESERVATION; CONSERVATION	Context. Translocation has become a widely used method to restore wildlife populations following extirpation. For some species, such as lekking grouse, which breed at traditional mating grounds, reproduction is linked to culturally established geographic locations. Cultural centres are lost upon extirpation, making restoration into otherwise rehabilitated habitats especially challenging. The process by which species with culturally dependent reproduction sometimes become re-established is poorly understood and merits investigation to improve conservation strategies. Historically, population restoration of North American lekking grouse (Tympanuchus spp. and Centrocercus spp.) via translocation has yielded poor results, in part because translocation sites lack leks, culturally determined breeding locations for which breeding adults form a high degree of philopatry. Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus; CSTG) occurs in <10% of its historic range, but the existence of rehabilitated historic habitat provides for the potential of population restoration via translocation. Aims. We reintroduced CSTG to vacant habitat in north-central Nevada, USA, from 2013 to 2017, with concordant goals of promoting females to nest and males to lek. We tested the utility of performing artificial insemination (AI) on females before translocation and we conducted paternity analyses to understand male reproduction. Methods. We monitored females for the effects of AI on nest initiation, nest survival and egg fertility. We used post-hatch extra-embryonic membranes and other tissues to evaluate paternity of chicks produced at the restoration site. Key results. Artificial insemination had no effect on female survival or nest initiation, and did not fertilise any eggs within nine sampled clutches (n = 102 eggs). Most paternity was attributable to male residents that had survived for >= 1 year at the restoration site before the arrival of translocated females. Conclusions. Artificial insemination neither aided nor harmed female reproduction. A small number of translocated, resident adult males sired reproduction following female release. Implications. The presence of resident males at restoration sites may be more likely to result in post-translocation reproduction than is pre-translocation AI. Restoring CSTG to vacant habitat should focus on translocating females into suitable nesting habitat while simultaneously ensuring that reproductively capable males are available within or adjacent to the nesting habitat.

Effective biodiversity conservation requires information about a species' ecology and its relationship with the geographical context. To achieve this efficiently, species distribution models can be developed, also taking into account species associations. Aims. I aimed to illustrate the habitat requirements of two threatened passerines of semi-open landscapes, i.e. the lesser grey shrike, Lanius minor, and the woodchat shrike, Lanius senator, in southern Italy. Further, I assessed whether there is heterospecific social attraction between them, by assessing how their habitat niches overlap. Methods. Data were collected by territory mapping during the 2009-13 breeding seasons. The habitat requirements of the species were investigated with the help of ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA). In addition, the areas of sympatry between the two species were defined by indicator kriging and the habitat niche overlap was analysed using the generalised linear model (GLM). Key results. The results showed that these two species inhabit open areas, with scattered vegetation such as shrubs and trees, while avoiding intensively cultivated permanent crops, such as vineyards and olive groves. Moreover, a little difference was observed in the percentage cover of shrublands, which were higher in the woodchat shrike territories than in the lesser grey ones. The strong overlap in their habitat niches suggests heterospecific social attraction between them, especially because of the species rarity. Conclusions. The lesser grey and the woodchat shrike were found to occur in very similar environments, by evidencing the overlap of their macrohabitat niches. This suggests the presence of heterospecific social attraction, corroborating the understudied hypothesis that this phenomenon is valid for migrant birds as well. The lesser grey shrike, in particular, may use occurrences of the woodchat shrike as a cue for assessing habitat quality and, thus, to establish its territory. Implications. Considering the high habitat niche overlap, habitat changes occurring in the landscape might affect them equally. Furthermore, the use of heterospecific social information in habitat selection potentially has many important conservation implications. Indeed, by reproducing the appropriate information, birds could be attracted to specific sites known to be high-quality habitat.

In each of the two regions, we sampled 8 sites (4 managed and 4 unmanaged sites) within each of which we established 4 circular plots (1000 m(2)) that were used to investigate woody species, while two micro-plots (1 mx1 m) were established in each 1000-m(2) plot to analyze herbaceous species. In each sample unit, we also extracted three soil samples (0-20 cm depth) for measuring soil properties. The results indicated that the interaction between region and conservational management significantly affected the percent of canopy cover of Persian oak (Quercus brantii Linddl), soil respiration, substrate-induced respiration, as well as beta and gamma diversities and turnover of plant species. The percent of oak canopy cover was positively correlated with soil silt, electrical conductivity, available potassium, and alpha diversity, whereas it was negatively correlated with plant turnover. In addition, plant turnover was positively related to available phosphorus, while nestedness of species was positively related to organic carbon and total nitrogen. According to these results, we concluded that physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of limited ecological niche generally influenced plant diversity. Also, this study demonstrated the major contribution of the beta diversity on gamma diversity, especially in semi-arid region, because of the higher heterogeneity of vegetation in this area.

Such change may alter soil microbial communities and the microbially mediated carbon and nitrogen dynamics. In this study, we experimentally repackaged precipitation patterns during the growing season (from June to September) of 2012 in a semi-arid temperate steppe of the Xilin River Basin in Inner Mongolia of China, based on the 60-year growing season precipitation data. Specifically, a total amount of 240 mm simulated precipitation was assigned to experimental plots by taking the following treatments: (1) P6 (6 extreme precipitation events, near the 1st percentile); (2) P10 (10 extreme precipitation events, near the 5(th) percentile); (3) P16 (16 moderate precipitation events, near the 50(th) percentile); and (4) P24 (24 events, 60-year average precipitation, near the 50(th) percentile). At the end of the growing season, we analyzed soil microbial community structure and biomass, bacterial abundance, fungal abundance and bacterial composition, by using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and 16S rRNA gene clone library methods. The extreme precipitation events did not change soil microbial community structure (represented by the ratio of PLFA concentration in fungi to PLFA concentration in bacteria, and the ratio of PLFA concentration in gram-positive bacterial biomass to PLFA concentration in gram-negative bacterial biomass). However, the extreme precipitation events significantly increased soil microbial activity (represented by soil microbial biomass nitrogen and soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers). Soil fungal community showed no significant response to precipitation events. According to the redundancy analysis, both soil microbial biomass nitrogen and soil ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) were found to be significant in shaping soil microbial community. Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in soil bacterial composition, and responded differently to the extreme precipitation events. Based on the results, we concluded that the extreme precipitation events altered the overall soil microbial activity, but did not impact how the processes would occur, since soil microbial community structure remained unchanged.

In particular, two wheat species (tetraploid, which is mostly used for pasta and hexaploid, which is primarily used for bread) account for about 20% of the whole calories consumed worldwide. In order to assess the mineral accumulation capability of some popular tetraploid wheat genotypes, a metabolomic (metallomic) approach was used in this study. The metallomic profile related to micro- (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni and Cr), macro- (Ca, Mg and K) and toxic trace elements (Cd and Pb) was obtained by ICP-AES analysis in a large set of tetraploid wheat genotypes (Triticum turgidum L.) that were grown in two different experimental fields. Correlations and multivariate statistical analyses were performed, grouping the samples under two wheat sets, comprising cultivated durum cultivars (T. turgidum subsp. durum) and wild accessions (T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum and subsp. dicoccoides). The site dependence ranking for the selected genotypes with the highest nutrient accumulation was obtained. The significantly higher content of Mg (among the macronutrients) and the highest levels of Mn, Fe and Zn (among the micronutrients) were found for wild accessions with respect to durum cultivars. Moreover, the former genotypes were also the ones with the lowest level of accumulation of the trace toxic elements, in particular Cd. According to the performed statistical analyses, the wild accessions appeared also to be less influenced by the different environmental conditions. This is in accord with literature data, indicating the superiority of old with respect to modern wheat cultivars for mineral content. Although further studies are required on a wider range of genotypes to confirm these findings, the obtained results could be used to better select the less demanding and better performing cultivars in specific target wheat growing environments.

However, guideline information can be difficult to distribute, and effectiveness difficult to measure. To increase the distribution and effectiveness of guideline information for the Detroit River, an educational campaign was launched in 2010, which included distribution of pamphlets with consumption information, posting of permanent signs at popular fishing locations, and hiring River Walkers to personally communicate with anglers. In 2013 and 2015, we conducted in-person surveys of active shoreline anglers to determine the effectiveness of education and outreach efforts. Results from the survey indicated that 55% of anglers were aware of the guidelines in 2013, and by 2015 36% had communicated the information to family or friends. However, anglers were often unwilling to reduce consumption of popular game species, despite high contaminant levels. Encouragingly, black anglers were most likely to supplement their diet with species lower in contaminants. Our results suggest that utilizing multiple educational strategies including reaching out directly to individual anglers may improve conscious consumption behavior among the targeted population, providing a template for educational campaigns to successfully target vulnerable populations.

Understanding the behavioral aspects of human activities can contribute to their effective management and control. We present a framework, based on statistical methods, for studying the spatio-temporal distribution of geolocated tweets as a proxy for where and when people carry out their activities. We have evaluated our proposal by analyzing the distribution of collected geolocated tweets over a two-week period in the summer of 2017 in Lisbon, London, and Manhattan. Our proposal considers a negative binomial regression analysis for the time series of counts of tweets as a first step. We further estimate a functional principal component analysis of second-order summary statistics of the hourly spatial point patterns formed by the locations of the tweets. Finally, we find groups of hours with a similar spatial arrangement of places where humans develop their activities through hierarchical clustering over the principal scores. Social media events are found to show strong temporal trends such as seasonal variation due to the hour of the day and the day of the week in addition to autoregressive schemas. We have also identified spatio-temporal patterns of clustering, i.e., groups of hours of the day that present a similar spatial distribution of human activities.

A better understanding of the sources, fate and transport of Cryptosporidium via rivers is important for effective management of waterborne transmission, especially in the developing world. We present GloWPa-Crypto C1, the first global, spatially explicit model that computes Cryptosporidium concentrations in rivers, implemented on a 0.5 x 0.5 degrees grid and monthly time step. To this end, we first modelled Cryptosporidium inputs to rivers from human faeces and animal manure. Next, we use modelled hydrology from a grid-based macroscale hydrological model (the Variable Infiltration Capacity model). Oocyst transport through the river network is modelled using a routing model, accounting for temperature- and solar radiation-dependent decay and sedimentation along the way. Monthly average oocyst concentrations are predicted to range from 10(-6) to 10(2) oocysts L-1 in most places. Critical regions ('hotspots') with high concentrations include densely populated areas in India, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh, Nigeria, Algeria and South Africa, Mexico, Venezuela and some coastal areas of Brazil, several countries in Western and Eastern Europe (incl. The UK, Belgium and Macedonia), and the Middle East. Point sources (human faeces) appears to be a more dominant source of pollution than diffuse sources (mainly animal manure) in most world regions. Validation shows that GloWPa-Crypto medians are mostly within the range of observed concentrations. The model generally produces concentrations that are 1.5-2 log10 higher than the observations. This is likely predominantly due to the absence of recovery efficiency of the observations, which are therefore likely too low. Goodness of fit statistics are reasonable. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model is most sensitive to changes in input oocyst loads. GloWPa-Crypto C1 paves the way for many new opportunities at the global scale, including scenario analysis to investigate the impact of global change and management options on oocysts concentrations in rivers, and risk analysis to investigate human health risk.

This wastewater often forms stable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. These emulsions require demulsification in order to effectively treat the water prior to release. Although biological demulsification of O/W emulsion has advantages over traditional approaches, its development is at a preliminary stage with few demulsifying bacteria reported and a need for effective screening methods for such bacteria. In this study, thirty-seven marine O/W emulsion demulsifying bacterial strains belonging to 5 genera and 15 species were reported. Cell hydrophobicity and interfacial activity played key roles in the emulsion breaking. One of the highly effective demulsifying bacteria, Halomonas venusta strain N3-2A was identified and characterized. Both its extracellular biosurfactant and cell surface contributed to demulsification resulting in breaking of 92.5% of the emulsion within 24 h. A high throughput and effective screening strategy targeting O/W emulsion breaking bacteria using oil spreading test coupled with cell hydrophobicity test was proposed. In addition, the 37 demulsifying bacteria showed a certain degree of species/genus specific patterns of surface activity and cell hydrophobicity. The reported bacteria and the screening strategy have promising potential for the biological demulsification of O/W emulsions and oily wastewater treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Theory of alternative stable states suggests that eutrophication has profound negative effects on the structure, function and stability of freshwater ecosystems. However, it is still unclear how eutrophication destabilizes ecosystems stoichiometrically before a tipping point is reached. The stoichiometric homeostasis (H), which links fine-scale process to broad-scale patterns, is a key parameter in ecological stoichiometry. Based on investigation of 97 shallow lakes on the Yangtze Plain, China, we measured nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations of the aboveground tissues of common submerged macrophyte species and their corresponding sediments. We found submerged macrophytes showed significant stoichiometric homeostasis for P (H-p) but not for N (H-N). Furthermore, H-p was positively correlated with dominance and stability at the species level, and community production and stability at the community level. Identifying where macrophyte community collapse is a fundamental way to quantify their resilience. Threshold detection showed that macrophyte community dominated by high-H-p species had a higher value of tipping point (0.08 vs. 0.06 mg P L-1 in lake water), indicating their strong resilience to eutrophication. In addition, macrophytes with high H-p were predominant in relative oligotrophic sediments and have higher ability in stabilizing the water environment compared to those low-H-p ones. Our results suggested that ecosystem dominated by homeostatic macrophyte communities was more productive, stable and resilient to eutrophication. Eutrophication-induced stoichiometric imbalance may destabilize the ecosystem by altering the community structure from high-to low-H-p species. Efforts should be focused on maintaining and restoration of high homeostatic communities to make ecosystem more resilient, which can significantly improve our understanding of the critical transition mechanisms.

The rapidity of their response to stressors and abrupt environmental changes implies that even fast and infrequent events can affect local transformations of organic matter and nutrients. Modern molecular techniques now allow for monitoring of microbial activities and functions in the environment through the analysis of genes and expressed genes contained in natural microbial assemblages. However, messenger RNA turnover in cells can be as short as 30 seconds and stability varies greatly between transcripts. Sampling of in situ communities involves an inevitable delay between the collection of seawater and the extraction of its RNA, leaving the bacterial communities plenty of time to alter their gene expression. The characteristics of microbial RNA turnover make time-series very difficult because samples need to be processed immediately to limit alterations to the metatranscriptomes. To address these challenges we designed an autonomous in situ fixation multi-sampler (AFISsys) for the reliable sampling of microbial metatranscriptomes at frequent intervals, for refined temporal resolution. To advance the development of this instrument, we examined the minimal seawater volume necessary for adequate coverage of community gene expression, and the suitability of phenol/ethanol fixation for immediate and long-term preservation of transcripts from a microbial community. We then evaluated the field eligibility of the instrument itself, with two case studies in a brackish system. AFISsys is able to collect, fix, and store water samples independently at a predefined temporal resolution. Phenol/ethanol fixation can conserve metatranscriptomes directly in the environment for up to a week, for later analysis in the laboratory. Thus, the AFISsys constitutes an invaluable tool for the integration of molecular functional analyses in environmental monitoring in brackish waters and in aquatic environments in general.

High-throughput sequencing has gained more and more attention in the last decade to describe this microbial diversity in water networks. However, there are few studies describing this approach on large drinking water distribution systems and for extended periods of time. To fill this gap and observe the potential subtle variation in microbiota of a water network through time and space, we aimed to apply high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene approach to characterize bacterial communities of the Paris' DWDS over a one-year period. In this study, the Paris network, composed of four different DWDSs, was sampled at 31 sites, each month for one year. The sampling campaign was one of the largest described so far (n = 368) and the importance of key spatio-temporal and physico-chemical parameters was investigated. Overall, 1321 taxa were identified within the Paris network, although only fifteen of them were found in high relative abundance (>1%) in all samples. Two genera, Phreatobacter and Hyphomicrobium were dominant. The whole bacterial diversity was not significantly affected between the four DWDSs (spatial parameter) and by physico-chemical parameters. However, the bacterial diversity was slightly modified over the one-year period (temporal parameter) as we were able to observe DWDS microbiome perturbations, presumably linked to a preceding flood event. Comparison of high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons vs. cultivation-based techniques showed that only 1.8% of bacterial diversity was recovered through cultivation. High throughput sequencing has made it possible to monitor DWDS more accurately than conventional methods by describing the whole diversity and detecting slight fluctuations in bacterial communities.

During an 8 year period, hot water in a large hospital building was sampled monthly in areas with suitable dimensioning and recirculation and in areas with dead legs and low-use taps. In the former areas, the percentage of Legioneffa-negative samples was 83.2% when the temperature was >= 55%, 64.9% when between 50.1 degrees C and 54.0 degrees C, and 51.6% when <= 50 degrees C (p for trend <0.001). In the highest temperature group, no samples with >= 10(3) cfu/L were observed. In poorly designed areas, only 44.7% of samples were negative, and 28.9% presented >= 10(3) cfu/L although reaching 55 degrees C. In these areas, multivariate analysis showed that if hot water supplies were not used daily, the risk of Legionella colonization was greater than two-fold (odds ratio: 2.84; 95% confidence interval: 1.26-6.41), and the risk of finding Legionella concentrations >= 10(3) cfu/L was more than three-fold (odds ratio: 3.18; 95% confidence interval: 1.36-7.46), regardless the temperature. These findings indicate that the effectiveness of maintaining sanitary hot water at a minimum temperature of 55 degrees C is significantly better than that at 50 degrees C for the environmental control of Legionella but only in installations with suitable dimensioning and recirculation. In installations that do not meet these conditions, high temperatures alone result in insufficient control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seasonal and spatial changes in sex hormone levels and oocyte development of bonefish (Albula vulpes)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Bonefish; Reproductive development; Sex hormone; Oocyte	OVARIAN DEVELOPMENT; STEROID-HORMONES; ATLANTIC SALMON; MATURATION; PLASMA; VITELLOGENIN; REPRODUCTION; GONADOTROPIN; INVOLVEMENT; OOGENESIS	Bonefish (Albula vulpes) support an economically important fishery, yet little is known regarding the reproductive biology of this species. Blood and oocyte samples were collected from wild female bonefish (Albula vulpes) during (February and April, 2017) and outside (September, 2017) the spawning season in Grand Bahama Island, The Bahamas. Fish reproductive state was evaluated using histological analysis of the oocytes and determination of sex hormone levels of 17-estradiol and testosterone in the plasma. The presence of three different cohorts of oocytes in bonefish females suggests group-synchronous ovarian development. Levels of 17-estradiol were low in individuals sampled outside of the spawning season relative to fish sampled during spawning months. Testosterone levels did not change as female bonefish entered the spawning season. Within the spawning season, bonefish are commonly found along shallow water flats, or in pre-spawn aggregations (PSA). The diameters of late vitellogenic oocytes collected from PSA fish were significantly larger than those from the flats fish. Levels of 17-estradiol did not differ between PSA and flats fish; however, testosterone levels were significantly higher in fish from the PSA. These results indicate that as bonefish are transitioning to the PSA from flats habitats, vitellogenesis is still occurring. However, when and where final maturation commences in reproductively active bonefish remains unclear.

Age, growth, and age at maturity of bonefish (Albula species) among Cuban habitats	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Bonefish; Albulidae; Otolith analysis; Age-size relationship; Age at maturity; Cuba	FISHERIES; FLORIDA; EVOLUTION; HISTORY; CONSEQUENCES; REPRODUCTION; MATURATION; RECOVERY; TRENDS; FISH	Bonefish (Albula spp.) are a prized sportfish among avid anglers worldwide. Two morphologically indistinguishable species of bonefish (Albula vulpes and Albula goreensis) occur in coastal areas of the tropical western Atlantic. Growth rates of A. vulpes, which supports an economically important sport fishery, differ among locations where they have been studied, but many locations have not yet been examined. To investigate bonefish growth in Cuba, specimens were obtained from fish markets at three sites around the periphery of the island from November 2016 to January 2017. Sagittal otoliths (for aging) and fin clips (for genetics) were collected from each fish, and sex was determined by examining gonads. A total of 218 bonefish were sampled, with size ranging from 187-530mm fork length (FL), genetic testing indicated that 134 were A. vulpes, 59 were A. goreensis, and seven were hybrids. The oldest fish collected were eight and nine years old for A. vulpes and A. goreensis respectively. A. vulpes females reached larger sizes than males. The overall von Bertalanffy growth model of the two-different species were significantly different. A. vulpes grew to larger sizes than A. goreensis. Almost all A. vulpes greater than 210 mm FL in Cuba were reproductively mature, while 50% size at maturity in Florida occurs at a mean size between 418 mm and 488 mm FL. The insight of different growth patterns between A. vulpes and A. goreensis allows for better management of the species, and further distinguishes differences in the biology of A. vulpes and A. goreensis.

Linking bonefish (Albula vulpes) populations to nearshore estuarine habitats using an otolith microchemistry approach	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Strontium; Ontogenetic habitat shifts; Florida; Cuba; Salinity environments	CORAL-REEF FISH; LIFE-HISTORY; FLORIDA BAY; SR-CA; BISCAYNE BAY; MARINE; CONNECTIVITY; SALINITY; JUVENILE; TRENDS	Identifying the relative importance of various nursery areas is critical for understanding the ecological roles of diverse juvenile habitats, as well as for the sustainable management of fisheries and coastal resources. Recent field collections suggest that a portion of the bonefish (Albula vulpes) population in South Florida may be using nearshore estuarine habitats as nurseries. Nearshore marine habitats are traditionally considered nursery habitat for bonefish. However, the prevalence of their reliance on lower salinity areas is not known. To address this, we used otolith microchemistry using laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry to examine variation in Strontium (Sr), a marker for salinity, and determine the connectivity between estuarine and marine habitats across the life of bonefish. Sr profiles from otoliths obtained in locations within South Florida (SFL, N=40) and Southwest Cuba (SCB, N=10) were compared using a juvenile-migration index (JMI), and change point models to assess the generality of a shift in salinity and thus habitats across life histories. Adult stages of bonefish otoliths collected in SFL and SCB locations showed Sr concentrations connected to marine, high-salinity environments. The JMI showed that a vast majority of individuals (68.4% and 70% in South Florida and Cuba, respectively) moved from low- to high-salinity environments between juvenile and adult stages. The change point models showed that these shifts to high salinity environments occurred suddenly (in 85% of those showing a low to high salinity change), and early in life (after 2 years in South Florida and after 4 years in Cuba) suggesting an ontogenetic habitat change. This study provided evidence that bonefish use low-salinity estuarine environments as juvenile habitats, perhaps more commonly than marine habitats. The reliance on low-salinity environments suggests the potential vulnerability of bonefish nearshore nursery habitats to disturbances associated with coastal freshwater discharges.	[Santos, R.

Combining data sources to elucidate spatial patterns in recreational catch and effort: fisheries-dependent data and local ecological knowledge applied to the South Florida bonefish fishery	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Recreational fisheries; Local ecological knowledge; Fisheries-dependent data; Spatial analysis	LIFE-HISTORY CALENDAR; BASE-LINE SYNDROME; SEAGRASS DIE-OFF; ALBULA-VULPES; NATIONAL-PARK; UNIT-EFFORT; ABUNDANCE; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; CONNECTIVITY	Spatial data are key to fishery management; however, most often the spatial distribution of marine populations and fishing dynamics are poorly documented, especially for recreational fish species. The combination of fisheries-dependent data (FDD) obtained from logbooks, and local ecological knowledge (LEK) gathered from key stakeholders could be a powerful approach to inform data gaps in data-limited fisheries. In this study, we used both FDD from guides' catch reports and LEK using an online survey and key-informant interviews to reconstruct the spatial changes in bonefish (Albula vulpes) catch and fishing effort throughout South Florida over the past 35-40years, and better understand the extent and spatial patterns of the bonefish decline described in previous studies. Although anglers perceived a decline of bonefish numbers across all fishing areas (26 to 53% drop across Biscayne Bay, the Florida Keys, and Florida Bay), the start of the bonefish decline in Florida Bay resulted in the highest drop in bonefish number (53%); thus, indicating both regional and localized decline events affecting bonefish abundance. Within Florida Bay, LEK and FDD concurred with an initial drop in bonefish at Inner Bay, followed by a greater magnitude of decline at Outer Bay. Metrics of effort derived from the survey and interviews depicted a shrinkage and aggregation in the spatial distribution of fishing and a shift of fishing activities toward the Lower Keys. In sum, the spatiotemporal patterns of catch and effort obtained from LEK and FDD allowed us to understand where, when and how this data-limited species declined in South Florida.	[Santos, R.

Movement and predation: a catch-and-release study on the acoustic tracking of bonefish in the Indian Ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Acoustic telemetry; Bonefish; Catch-and-release; Indian Ocean; Predation bias	HOME-RANGE SIZE; ALBULA-VULPES; SITE FIDELITY; NEGAPRION-BREVIROSTRIS; ULTRASONIC TELEMETRY; HABITAT UTILIZATION; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; LEMON SHARK; REEF SHARKS; PATTERNS	Tourism generated through bonefish (Albula spp.) fishing contributes to the economies of many isolated tropical islands and atolls. However, little research has been conducted on bonefish in the Indian Ocean. This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of bonefish ecology in the Indian Ocean by quantifying the spatial and temporal movements of Albula glossodonta at a near-pristine and predator-rich atoll in the Seychelles; however, to achieve this, an analysis to identify the occurrence of possible post-release predation bias was first necessary. An acoustic telemetry study was initiated at the remote St. Joseph Atoll, within an array of 88 automated data-logging acoustic receivers. Thirty bonefish were surgically implanted with Vemco V13 acoustic transmitters and tracked for one year. Only 10% of the tagged bonefish were detected for longer than two weeks. A comparison of the final 100h of movement data from fish detected for less than two weeks to the movement data of the fish detected for longer periods revealed distinct differences in area use and significant differences in the average daily distance moved, speed of movement and frequency of detections. This suggested that mortality in the form of post-release predation was at least 43% of tagged fish. The three surviving bonefish were tracked for 210 to 367days. These individuals remained in the atoll and showed high use of the marginal habitats between the shallow sand flats and the lagoon. A generalised linear mixed model identified that water temperature, diel cycle and tide were significant predictors of bonefish presence in the lagoon. The high post-release mortality highlights that catch-and-release is likely not as benign as previously believed and management and policy should be adjusted accordingly.

A key floral scent component (-trans-bergamotene) drives pollinator preferences independently of pollen rewards in seep monkeyflower	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus impatiens; floral rewards; floral scent; honest signal; inbreeding; Mimulus guttatus; pollination; sensory bias	SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; MIMULUS-GUTTATUS; POTENTIAL MALE; EVOLUTION; VOLATILES; ECOLOGY; FLOWERS; ATTRACTION; SELECTION; IDENTIFICATION	Floral odours play an important role in attracting insect pollinators. Because pollinators visit flowers to obtain pollen and nectar rewards, they should prefer floral odour profiles associated with the highest-rewarding flowers (honest signals). In previous work, bumblebees exhibited a preference for flowers from outbred over inbred Mimulus guttatus plants. Pollen is the only floral reward in M. guttatus, and pollen viability (a reliable indicator of protein content) is reduced in inbred plants. Yet, differences in pollen viability did not explain the observed preferences. In this study, we examined the floral volatile profiles of inbred and outbred M. guttatus to identify inbreeding effects and associations between volatile compounds and the number of viable pollen grains per flower, designated PRQ (pollen reward quality). We also conducted pairwise choice tests with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the ability of bees to discriminate between odours of rewarding and non-rewarding flowers and to determine whether bumblebee preferences are explained by differences in the floral odours of inbred and outbred plants. Inbred plants exhibited reduced emission of -trans-bergamotene, the second-most abundant compound in the volatile blend of outbred plants. Furthermore, pollen and fertile anthers emitted nonadecane. Six other compounds in the floral blend were positively correlated with PRQ. There was no overlap between compounds affected by inbreeding and compounds associated with PRQ. Even when given prior experience foraging on M. guttatus, bumblebees did not distinguish between the floral odours of rewarding and non-rewarding outbred plants. However, they preferred floral odours from non-rewarding outbred plants over rewarding inbred plants. Bumblebees without prior experience of flowers preferred volatile blends with higher versus lower amounts of -trans-bergamotene. Taken together, these results suggest that the volatile emissions of M. guttatus provide reliable indicators of pollen rewards (potential honest signals), but that the preference of bumblebees for outbred plants is not driven by these cues but rather by a sensory bias for -trans-bergamotene. This may represent a subtle form of deceit-pollination that allows plants to attract pollinators while minimizing investment in costly rewards.

Evaluating how frugivores structure plant communities via the nonproportional use of available fruit resources is critical to understand the functioning of ecosystems where fleshy-fruited plant species are dominant, such as tropical forests. We performed a seed-addition field experiment to investigate how frugivorous birds shape the composition and richness of forests during early stages of secondary succession in cleared areas in Puerto Rico. The experiment tested whether the bird-generated seed rain and the subsequent early successional plant communities were proportional representations of the fleshy-fruited species that dominated the surrounding community. Experimental treatments consisted of patches with (a) seed-additions by wild birds attracted to experimental patches with pole perches, (b) manual seed-additions proportional to fruit abundance at the local scale (50m from experimental plots) and (c) manual seed-additions proportional to fruit abundance at the landscape scale (entire study site). Birds' seed-additions differed in composition and abundance to expectations based on fruit availability at local and landscape scales. Treatments with seeds added by birds had the highest species richness in both the seed rain and the emergence stages despite how, on average, the monthly richness in the landscape-scale treatment was double that of birds and the local-scale treatment. This phenomenon was explained by the highest heterogeneity from the bird seed-addition treatment across months, and the lowest seed per capita emergence rates in landscape treatments. Rather than reflecting relative fruit abundance, birds biased seed rain and per capita emergence towards a non-random mixture of both small- and large-seeded species, resulting in richer and distinct plant communities. Because frugivory and seed dispersal patterns depart from random encounters between frugivores and plants in communities, successional forests are characterized by an overrepresentation of proportionally rare plant species, and decreases in the dominance of many common species. Thus, for regenerating tropical forests, frugivory can function as mechanism that promotes persistence of rare plant species and their coexistence with more abundant plants.

Here, we hypothesise that basal concentration of blood glucose (G(0)), a major source of energy circulating in blood, may constitute a key component of pace-of-life syndromes. To test this hypothesis, we measured G(0) in 30 passerine species and tested its covariation with body mass and other life-history traits. Importantly, body mass is a major life-history determinant and, when its effect is controlled for, there may be no single fast-slow life-history continuum in birds comprising both fecundity and life span. Hence, we used individual life-history traits, rather than principal component analysis, to characterise life-history variation in our analysis. In support of G(0)-life-history co-evolution, we found G(0) to be negatively correlated with body mass and positively with reproductive investment in a single clutch across 30passerine species. Higher G(0) in females suggests that the energy demands of clutch production and incubation may be an important selection force driving co-evolution of G(0) with reproductive output. In contrast, G(0) was not associated with maximum life span, suggesting that high G(0) may not constrain evolution of longevity. This implies that long-lived species can evolve physiological adaptations preventing harmful effects of high glucose concentrations, known to cause pathologies and accelerate ageing. In addition, G(0), but not basal metabolic rate (BMR), was negatively correlated with migration distance, attesting to evolutionary changes in energy metabolism in long-distance migrants. Our results further suggest that the links between body mass, reproduction and G(0) are not mediated by BMR and that G(0) is associated with fast-slow life-history variation more closely than available BMR data. A species life history is determined to a great extent by body mass. When this effect is controlled for, only those traits related to reproduction (but not life span) constitute the principal axis of life-history variation in birds. Hence, the co-evolution of G(0) with body mass and reproductive output evidenced in our study indicates that G(0) constitutes an important physiological component of pace-of-life syndromes.

This theory remains untested in the wild. We recently showed that increased workload in a small bird causally relates to maximum body temperature. Here, we have expanded this approach by experimentally facilitating sensible heat transfer rate in nestling-feeding blue titsa small bird with high resting- and work-induced body temperaturesthrough removal of ventral plumage. Feather-clipped parents did not increase work rate but sired larger, and sometimes heavier, nestlings while maintaining lower body temperature and losing less body mass than controls. Thus, when relieved of the demands to dissipate metabolic heat, parents could invest more into both current (nestling condition) and future (self-maintenance) reproduction. In accordance with the HDL theory, we conclude that constraints on heat dissipation rate could be a potent mediator of life-history trade-offs in wild animals.

Such conditions might promote the evolution of resource-acquisitive strategies. We asked whether crop plants show root traits typical of resource-acquisitive strategies and whether this strategy is primarily a result of their evolution under domestication or of the early selection of successful candidates for domestication. We studied a set of 30 crop species and their wild progenitors. We set up a greenhouse experiment to measure five root traits: root thickness, root tissue density, specific root length (SRL), root mass fraction (RMF) and root length ratio. In addition, we compiled data from other wild herbaceous species, growth in similar conditions to this experiment, to place the root traits of our crops in the context of wider botanical variation. Wild progenitors had thicker and less dense roots, with higher RMF and lower SRL, than other wild herbs. Thicker and less dense roots are indicative of fertile soils, which suggest that wild progenitors could have been adapted for success in agricultural conditions. Additionally, we found that domestication generally increased total plant dry mass, but none of the root traits evolved consistently towards a more resource-acquisitive strategy after domestication across all species. Root trait values differed between progenitors and crop species for most pairs surveyed, but this occurred in diverse directions depending on crop species. Such differences were independent of phylogeny, functional group or variability in the domestication processes, such as timing of the domestication event or organ under focal artificial selection. Our comparative study revealed that the root phenotype exhibited by wild progenitors (thick roots with low density and SRL), when compared with other wild herbs, was in accordance with plants typical of fertile habitats. However, none of the root traits reacted to domestication in accordance with evolution towards faster growth strategies. Thus, the adaptation of crop root phenotypes to the fertile conditions of agricultural fields might be largely determined by early choices of wild species, rather than by further evolution under domestication.

Moreover, plant temperature-sensing pathways are known to interact with competition-sensing pathways, yet there remains little experimental evidence for how genotypes varying in temperature responsiveness react to warming in realistic competitive settings. We compared flowering time and fitness responses to warming and competition for two near-isogenic lines (NILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana transgressively segregating temperature-sensitive and temperature-insensitive alleles for major-effect flowering time genes. We grew focal plants of each genotype in intraspecific and interspecific competition in four treatments contrasting daily temperature profiles in summer and fall under contemporary and warmed conditions. We measured phenology and fitness of focal plants to quantify plastic responses to season, temperature and competition and the dependence of these responses on flowering time genotype. The temperature-insensitive NIL was constitutively early flowering and less fit, except in a future-summer climate in which its fitness was higher than the later flowering, temperature-sensitive NIL in low competition. The late-flowering NIL showed accelerated flowering in response to intragenotypic competition and to increased temperature in the summer but delayed flowering in the fall. However, its fitness fell with rising temperatures in both seasons, and in the fall its marginal fitness gain from decreasing competition was diminished in the future. Functional alleles at temperature-responsive genes were necessary for plastic responses to season, warming and competition. However, the plastic genotype was not the most fit in every experimental condition, becoming less fit than the temperature-canalized genotype in the warm summer treatment. Climate change is often predicted to have deleterious effects on plant populations, and our results show how increased temperatures can act through genotype-dependent phenology to decrease fitness. Furthermore, plasticity is not necessarily adaptive in rapidly changing environments since a nonplastic genotype proved fitter than a plastic genotype in a warming climate treatment.

Roots release C into soil via exudation and turnover (i.e., root-derived C), but also by allocating C to mycorrhizal fungal mycelia, which exude C and undergo turnover (i.e., mycelia-derived C). Given that the relative contributions of root- and mycelia-derived C inputs are unknown, a key knowledge gap lies in understanding not only the relative contributions of root- versus mycelia-derived C inputs, but also the consequences of these fluxes on nutrient cycling. Using ingrowth cores and stable isotope analyses, we quantified root- and mycelia-derived C inputs into the soil and their relative contributions to nitrogen (N) cycling in two ectomycorrhizal alpine forests, a 70-year-old spruce plantation and a 200-year-old spruce-fir dominated forest, in western Sichuan, China. Across the two forests, extramatrical mycelia of ectomycorrhizal fungi accounted for up to two-thirds of the new root C inputs into soil and similar to 80% of the stimulated N mineralization. Moreover, flux-specific (per gram) mycelia-derived C inputs stimulated multiple indices of soil N cycling to a greater degree than the flux-specific root-derived C inputs, accounting for similar to 70% of the stimulated N mineralization in both forests. Collectively, our findings indicate that the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on soil C and N cycling may exceed those of roots in alpine coniferous forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi, highlighting the need to incorporate mycorrhizal fungal inputs into biogeochemical models for ecosystems.

Mountain forests are ecosystems that have been constantly threatened by both anthropogenic and climate disturbances, mainly over the Late Holocene. By using palaeoecological techniques with fossil pollen and geochemical elements as proxies, this study incorporates the relationship of trees, herbs and epiphytes with dry and humid climate events. High-temporal resolution in the chronologies allowed the assessment of vegetation changes (every similar to 30years) and soil geochemical elements in three forests located close (<8km) to each other. Our results showed that pine forest contracted along the dry periods of the Little Ice Age (AD 1350-1850), the Medieval Climate Anomaly (AD 800 to 1200) and the Late Classic Drought (AD 600 to 800). However, it expanded in the humid period (AD 1200 to 1350). Cloud forest was the most susceptible ecosystem to the above climate anomalies; trees contracted in periods of aridity and expanded in humid periods. The signature for the transitional forest was confounding: trees increased partially in both dry and humid periods with a well-correlated decrease in epiphytes. Soil losses were common in dry periods while fires increased along the last similar to 300years.

The sustainability of fuelwood harvesting from a semi-arid savanna ecosystem was investigated at a rural village where shortages have been predicted. Repeated sampling over a period of 7years revealed a stable supply of wood from harvesting areas. The number and thickness of stems harvested did not decline as expected, nor did the use of undesirable species. This is consistent with long-term changes in the structure of the woody layer of the harvesting area, where increases rather than decreases in plant density have occurred. The ability of local species to survive regular damage, coppice rapidly, and reproduce when still well below their adult sizes, together with social factors that limit the rate of harvesting, appears to have produced an ecologically sustainable harvesting system. However, the estimated biomass of fuelwood harvested was far below existing estimates of fuelwood consumption in the village, suggesting that fuelwood supply has not kept up with demand. Transformation of harvesting areas for housing and crop fields, rather than increasing demand, is the most likely cause of this.

Andrew			Dynamic N-mixture models with temporal variability in detection probability	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Count data; Dail and Madsen model; Connectivity; Demography; Metapopulation; N-mixture model; Observation error; Spatial models	ESTIMATING ABUNDANCE; POPULATION	In theory parameters of dynamic N-mixture models can be estimated with multiple years of data without the robust design under the assumption of constant detection probability. However, such an assumption can rarely be met in long-term studies, and the consequences of violating this assumption in the inferences of dynamic N-mixture models have not been assessed. In this study we used simulation studies to evaluate inferences of the original dynamic N-mixture model and two of its spatial extensions in the face of temporal variability in detection probability. We first evaluated the dynamic N-mixture models when detection probability that varied temporally was wrongly treated as a constant. We then evaluated if the robust design was necessary for dynamic N-mixture models to provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally. Our results showed that, when detection probability that varied temporally was wrongly treated as a constant, biases were introduced in the parameter estimates of dynamic N-mixture models. When detection probability was correctly assumed to vary temporally, the models could provide valid parameter estimates with the robust design. The model could also provide valid parameter estimates when detection probability was a random effect, even without the robust design. Based on our results, we strongly recommended considering temporal variability in detection probability when using dynamic N-mixture models to analyze long-term data and adopting the robust design in long-term surveys. Our work here is not only useful for data analysis but also important for research design, and thus are relevant to a wide range of studies.

Macquarie Island's northern giant petrels and the impacts of pest eradication on population abundance	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Macronectes halli; Non-target poisoning; Recovery time; Population response; Bayesian model	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH GEORGIA; MACRONECTES; MANAGEMENT; FISHERIES; DYNAMICS; STOCK; SEA; PATTERNS; SURVIVAL	Pest eradication conducted over the years 2010 to 2014 at Macquarie Island successfully eradicated introduced rabbits, rats and mice from this sub-Antarctic island. The initial aerial baiting phase in the winters of 2010 and 2011 resulted in significant mortality of several native seabird species through primary and secondary ingestion of brodifacoum bait. A species of key concern is the northern giant petrel (Macronectes halli), which, although relatively abundant and increasing on Macquarie Island, is listed as threatened under Australian legislation and was one of the species most affected by poisoning. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the total mortality and the response of the population to the poisoning event over the short- to medium-term. We then considered how population abundance might respond over the ensuing years. Projections of population trajectories suggest a greater than 50% probability of recovery to the pre-poisoning levels of 2009 breeding pairs by 2017. This modelling approach could be applied to future planned eradications to quantify the mortality and recovery of incidentally affected populations.

The purpose was to model the two selection forces simultaneously, in order to account for potential trait covariance in the estimation procedure when including multiple trait values. In addition, we identified those traits most important for selection forces, and the role of flooding duration. A Bayesian modelling approach was applied and fitted to plant species cover, including stochastic variable selection, to test the importance of individual traits on selection forces. We used pin-point data from wet grasslands of the French Atlantic Coast. Our results showed that trait selection forces are driven by direct selection and, to a minor extent, by selection mediated by interspecific interactions. Of the tested traits leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) seemed most important for selection forces. We found a significant effect of flooding on selection forces. Parameter covariance analysis revealed flooding to be most strongly correlated with direct selection forces. The method has less critical assumptions regarding the geographical limit of the ecological environment than a traditional filtering approach and allows weighting traits simultaneously and accounting for their covariance. Inference is easy to obtain from the posterior parameter distributions of the Bayesian estimation. Thus, the Bayesian method presented is very objective.

In the ocean, microplastics can be easily ingested by numerous marine organisms because of their small size (< 5 mm). The Northwest African upwelling system is an important fishery area, and the present study is the first one in the region to reveal the presence of microplastic particles in the digestive tract of Atlantic chub mackerel (Scomber colias). From the 120 examined fish gastrointestinal tracts, 78.3% contained some type of microplastics, 74.2% contained fibres, 17.5% plastic fragments, and 16.7% paint. More studies are needed on fish, but S. colias is a candidate for being a good indicator of microplastic contamination in the region.

Examining derelict pot impacts on harvest in a commercial blue crab Callinectes sapidus fishery	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Blue crab; Derelict fishing gear; Chesapeake Bay; Commercial fishery; Marine debris	TRAPS; PREDATION; DEBRIS; SCALE	Pot fisheries occur worldwide with a significant proportion of the gear becoming derelict. Derelict pots induce detrimental ecological and economic impacts, and more recently were found to reduce blue crab harvests in the Chesapeake Bay commercial fishery. We simulated the presence of derelict pots near actively fished pots in seasonal field experiments to quantify the effect derelict pots have on blue crab harvest. Derelict pots reduced harvests by 30% during the summer, but not during the fall. Female blue crab capture rates were consistently lower when derelict pots were present; while capture rates of the less abundant males were not negatively affected by derelict pots. Variable responses to derelict pots may be due to seasonal differences in female and male blue crab behavior and movements. The costly effect that derelict pots have on harvest should be investigated in other pot fisheries to recognize the magnitude and mechanisms behind these impacts.

When estimating potential biodegradation rates in the laboratory, high concentrations of inorganic nutrients are often added to prevent nutrient limitation. In this study, we tested the short term response of coastal microbes to fresh diluted bitumen under varying nutrient conditions in a cold water regime. Total hydrocarbon concentrations changed minimally over five days; however, oil composition changed over time and the abundance of microbes increased in all treatments. Addition of phosphate, with or without nitrogen, resulted in rapid changes in community composition, but after three days treatments no longer differed. Nutrients were never depleted in any treatment suggesting that, even at low inorganic nutrient concentrations, microbial communities can quickly respond to hydrocarbons following a spill.

In South Africa, plastic bag use is still widespread despite intervention efforts based on levying taxes. Using an online questionnaire, this study examines plastic bag use practices and factors influencing use in South Africa. The results show that the majority of respondents perceived there was a plastic bag use problem in the country but still highly used plastic bags because it was convenient to do so. Factors like, gender, age, education and environmental consciousness influenced people's willingness to pay for plastic bags but the relationships were generally weak.

Big data for a large clade: Bioregionalization and ancestral range estimation in the daisy family (Asteraceae)	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						ancestral ranges; Asteraceae; bioregions; Compositae; modularity analysis	FOUNDER-EVENT SPECIATION; CHLOROPLAST DNA EVIDENCE; LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; FOSSIL POLLEN GRAINS; EVOLUTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EOCENE; TOOL; DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY	Aim In recent years biogeography has been transformed by the increased availability of large-scale distributional data, phylogenies, and novel quantitative analysis methods and models. More case studies, however, are needed to test the performance of various approaches, in particular at global scales and in species-rich groups. In this study, we inferred bioregionalization and estimated ancestral areas for the largest plant family, the Asteraceae. Location Global. Methods We used the Global Compositae Checklist data to infer Asteraceae bioregions with cluster and modularity analysis. We reconstructed a phylogeny of genus-terminals for the Asteraceae family from a supermatrix of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast data. Combining areas based on the bioregions from modularity analysis and the phylogeny, we then estimated ancestral ranges across the Asteraceae phylogeny under 12 biogeographic models. Results Cluster analysis resulted in several small bioregions from areas with low taxon numbers and linear and disjunct bioregions between Eurasia and Africa. Modularity analysis produced larger and compact bioregions, and we based downstream analysis on its results. The favoured model for ancestral area estimation was BAYAREALIKE+j+x, demonstrating the importance of long distance dispersal in the biogeographic history of the Asteraceae and a strong distance-dependence of dispersal. Main conclusions Differences between cluster and modularity analysis suggest that the latter may be more robust to incomplete data and produces less disjunct and thus presumably biologically more realistic bioregions. With few exceptions, results of ancestral area estimation confirmed the results of previous studies, in particular South America as the ancestral area of the family, subsequent dispersal to and a secondary radiation from Africa, and the ancestral areas of individual tribes of the family.

Further, we focused on the relationship between species richness of insectivorous birds and the availability of their food resources. Location Elevational gradient (200-3,700 m) of Mt Wilhelm (4,509 m a.s.l.), Central Range, Papua New Guinea. Taxon Birds. Methods We collected data on bird communities at eight sites (500 m elevational increment) during three surveys encompassing both dry and wet seasons over a 2-year period. We used point counts, mist-netting, and random walks throughout a standardized area. We tested three predictors of diversity and all of their combinations, in conjunction with sensitivity analyses for spatial effects. Habitat complexity (foliage height diversity index) and temperature were locally measured; surface area available within 200 m elevational intervals was obtained using GIS software. We further locally surveyed insect biomass and related it to species richness of insectivorous birds. Results Birds displayed a monotonic decline in species richness (from 113 to 35 bird species) with increasing elevation, and a nested pattern of species loss. The observed patterns were best explained by habitat complexity for the insectivores, frugivore-insectivores, and total number of bird species. The available surface area was the best predictor for frugivorous birds. The mean temperature had a high correlation with species richness of all birds and gave the best fit of species richness for insectivore-nectarivores and pure nectarivores. The biomass of insectivorous birds correlated with the biomass of arthropods. We ruled out the possibility that the elevational pattern observed in birds could be driven by a single phylogenetic radiation. Main conclusions We observed species richness patterns correlate well with habitat complexity and mean temperature, but mean temperature was not ranked as high as expected. Our results thus challenge the generally expected high importance of temperature as a regulator of water availability, production, and biochemical process that influence species richness, and underscore the importance of vegetation structure and the food resources as the driver of observed species richness.

These forests have alternatively been viewed as centres of diversification ("cradles") or more recently, as the opposite ("museums"). Here, we use a comparative dataset of avian and mammalian species to examine genetic diversification patterns across these forests and use these results to explain observed patterns in light of Plio-Pleistocene climatic change and life-history. Location Africa. Methods We analysed patterns of diversification across the GCF using a dataset composed of 629 and 1,048 mitochondrial sequences from 60 avian and 36 mammalian species, respectively. Uncorrected pairwise genetic distances were compared at three distinct geographical levels: west versus east of the Dahomey Gap, among the three major forest blocks, and among seven historical refugial areas. The timing of diversification was assessed for passerines, Rodentia, and Chiroptera. Results We found substantial signatures of diversification in all three levels of our geographical comparisons. We recovered substantial disparity in the amount and depth of structure of diversification patterns between low dispersers (understorey birds and rodents) and more capable dispersers (other bird species and bats). Additionally, our chronogram recovered recent speciation and intraspecific diversification across songbird and mammalian lineages. Main conclusions The discrete, and often deep, structuring of genetic diversification for both birds and mammals across the GCF revealed strong correlations between historic landscape fragmentation and dispersal ability. Our results revealed a striking amount of unrecognized genetic diversity, which may be suggestive of cryptic species. Given the rate at which these forests are being negatively impacted by human intervention, our general lack of knowledge concerning vertebrate diversity across these forests may very well impact our ability to identify evolutionary processes underlying diversity and enact meaningful conservation efforts in the future.

(the Sudetes), located 350 km north of the previously acknowledged species limit, in the context of the whole species range; to discuss, based on this case study, the glacial history of the Central European mountain flora and importance of rare, relict populations for biogeographical inference and diversity conservation. Location European mountains: Sudetes, Alps, Pyrenees. Methods We sampled 90 individuals from 26 R. ferrugineum populations spanning the whole species' range. To infer genetic structure, diversity and relationships among populations and isolated parts of the geographical range, we applied genome-wide amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping and sequencing of four cpDNA fragments and nrDNA ITS region. Results Our AFLP analysis revealed four distinct genetic groups in R. ferrugineum, one formed by the northernmost population from (a) the Karkonosze Mts. (the Sudetes) and the other three comprising populations from the (b) Western Alps and Pyrenees, (c) South-Westernmost Alps and (d) Eastern Alps. Genetic isolation of the Karkonosze population was further corroborated by a repetitive pattern differentiation in plastid DNA sequences, otherwise almost monomorphic across the range. Population from the Karkonosze was most closely related to those from the Western Alps and not from the geographically closest Eastern Alps. Main conclusions We show that the population of R. ferrugineum in the Karkonosze Mts. is a glacial relict and not a recently established or introduced population. Its distinctiveness and high genetic diversity show that it represents a northern, previously undetected, genetic lineage of the species in Europe, which persisted through climatic changes in a small but stable microrefugium. Our case study highlights the importance of an adequate coverage of a species' range in phylogeographical studies and the significance of peripheral parts of the range to reveal biogeographical history of lineages. It also supports the Karkonosze Mountains as an important refugium for the Central European mountain flora.

Coastal biophysical processes and the biogeography of rocky intertidal species along the south-eastern Pacific	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biogeographic provinces; larval dispersal; MODIS; multiscale coherence; river outflows; rocky shore invertebrates	TURBID RIVER PLUMES; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; CENTRAL CHILE; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; PROPAGULE DISPERSAL; TRANSITION ZONE; CHLOROPHYLL-A; PATTERNS; RECRUITMENT; NORTHERN	Aim We assess the spatial distribution of a suite of coastal biophysical characteristics and how their variability is related to the distribution and geographic range of a diverse assemblage of coastal benthic species with different larval dispersal strategies. Location South-eastern Pacific (SEP) coast between 18 degrees 20 ' S and 42 degrees 35 ' S. Methods Biophysical variability was assessed using chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature and the signal of turbid river plumes derived from MODIS onboard the Aqua satellite. We established the dominant spatial components using wavelet and coherence analysis, and evaluated the biogeographic structure of 51 rocky intertidal species sampled over similar to 2,600 km along the SEP using multivariate classification and regression trees. Results Biogeographic breaks detected here were consistent with recent biogeographic classification schemes. Distribution breakpoints for species with lecithotrophic larvae clustered around 30 degrees S. We observed a previously unreported break in the distribution of species with planktotrophic larval dispersal strategies around 35 degrees S. These breaks are related to coherence in the spatial structure of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and river outflow over different temporal scales. Regions with similar biophysical characteristics, and the breaks the separate them, are in striking agreement with the biogeographic patterns revealed by the multivariate classification trees. Main conclusions Our results reconcile patterns of biogeographic structure reported for other groups of species along the SEP coast. We suggest that river outflow, a poorly studied coastal environmental forcing, may play an important role in determining the geographic distribution of rocky shore species, probably through its effects on larval dispersal patterns.

Evaluating ecological niche model accuracy in predicting biotic invasions using South Florida's exotic lizard community	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biological invasions; climate suitability; ecological niche model; lizards; Maxent; model validation; non-native species; thermal tolerance	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; FIELD VALIDATION; SAMPLE-SIZE; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSERVATION; PERFORMANCE; MAXENT; HETEROGENEITY; AMPHIBIANS; RESOLUTION	Aim Predicting environmentally suitable areas for non-native species is an important step in managing biotic invasions, and ecological niche models are commonly used to accomplish this task. Depending on these models to enact appropriate management plans assumes their accuracy, but most niche model studies do not provide validation for their model outputs. South Florida hosts the world's most globally diverse non-native lizard community, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive ability of niche models by comparing model predictions to observed patterns of distribution, abundance and physiology in established non-native populations. Location Florida, USA. Taxon Lizards. Methods Using Maxent, we developed niche models for all 29 non-native lizard species with established populations in Miami-Dade County, Florida, using native range data to predict habitat suitability in the invaded range. We then used independently collected field data on abundance, geographical spread and thermal tolerances of the non-native populations to evaluate Maxent's ability to make predictions in both geographical and environmental space in the non-native range. Results Maxent performed well in predicting across geographical space where these non-native lizards were most likely to occur, but within a given geographical extent was unable to predict which individual species would be the most abundant or widespread. Comparisons with physiological data also revealed an imperfect fit, but without any consistent biases. Main conclusions We performed one of the most extensive field validations of Maxent's ability to predict where invasions are likely to occur, and our results support its continued use in this role. However, the program was unable to predict the relative abundance and geographical spread of established species, indicating limited utility for identifying which invasive species will be the greatest management concern. These results underscore the importance of other factors, such as time since introduction, dispersal ability and biotic interactions in determining the relative success of non-native species post-establishment.

There is, however, little information available on their floristics and biogeography at the continental scale, despite the importance of such information for our understanding of the drivers of species diversity at various scales and for effective conservation and management. Here, we collated and analysed floristic data from across the continent in order to propose a biogeographical regionalization for African savannas. Location We collated floristic information (specifically woody species lists) for 298 samples of savanna vegetation across Africa, extending from 18 degrees N to 33 degrees S and from 17 degrees W to 48 degrees E. Taxa We focused on native woody species. Methods We used ordination and clustering to identify the floristic discontinuities and gradual transitions across African savannas. Floristic relationships, specificity and turnover, within and between floristic clusters, were analysed using a (dis-)similarity-based approach. Results We identified eight floristic clusters across African savannas which in turn were grouped into two larger macro-units. Ordinations at species and genus levels showed a clear differentiation in woody species composition between the North/West macro-unit and the South/East macro-unit. This floristic discontinuity matches to the High (i.e. N&W) and Low (S&E) division of Africa previously proposed by White () and which tracks climatic and topographical variation. In the N&W savannas, the floristic gradient determined by rainfall was partitioned into the Sudanian (drier) and Guinean (wetter) clusters. Within the highly heterogeneous S&E savannas and woodlands, six clusters were identified: Ugandan, Ethiopian, Mozambican, Zambezian, Namibian and South African. Main conclusions The proposed pan-African classification of savannas and woodlands might assist the development of coordinated management and conservation policies.

Assessment of global polar bear abundance and vulnerability	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						abundance; assessment; polar bear; population trends; status; Ursus maritimus; subpopulations; monitoring	SEA-ICE; URSUS-MARITIMUS; MARINE MAMMALS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BEAUFORT SEA; HABITAT LOSS; LONG-TERM; DEMOGRAPHY; SURVIVAL	Estimates of abundance and trend are central to assessing population status; yet, are often challenging to obtain or unavailable, suffer from wide confidence intervals and may be collected at irregular intervals. Polar bears Ursus maritimus have become an iconic species for climate change, yet information on abundance and status for significant parts of their range is unknown. We examine the existing information on subpopulation abundance of polar bears across their range to assess past monitoring. We model the relationship between subpopulation densities and ecological parameters including latitude, continental shelf habitat, prey diversity, sea ice extent and the length of the ice-free season. Of the 19 subpopulations across the circumpolar Arctic, 14 have estimates (range: 161-2826 bears). Excluding three subpopulations that were regularly monitored, the mean interval between consecutive estimates was 10.9 years (range: 1-36 years), with only six subpopulations having estimates <10 years old. Subpopulation density estimates ranged from 0.57 to 9.30 bears per km(2) with a mean of 2.36 bears per 1000 km(2) and a median of 1.71 bears per 1000 km(2). Our regression analysis found prey diversity as the only significant correlate with polar bear density. Based on this relationship, we estimate the global population at 23 315 bears (range: 15 972-31 212). An assessment of each subpopulation's vulnerability to climate change based on subpopulation size, amount of continental shelf habitat, prey diversity and changing ice conditions indicates that the Southern Beaufort Sea, Northern Beaufort Sea and Arctic Basin subpopulations are the most vulnerable followed by the Laptev Sea and Viscount Melville Sound subpopulations. With ongoing Arctic warming and the deleterious effects of sea ice loss on polar bears, we recommend that subpopulation assessments be conducted with greater frequency and in subpopulations lacking abundance estimates such that meaningful subpopulation monitoring can proceed.

Native fly parasites are the principal cause of nestling mortality in endangered Tasmanian pardalotes	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						forty-spotted pardalote; host-parasite relationship; myiasis; parasitic fly; Passeromyia longicornis; striated pardalote; nestling mortality; ectoparasites	BEHAVIOR; FINCH; HOSTS; TREECREEPERS; PREVALENCE; DEMOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS	Established host-parasite interactions at an evolutionary equilibrium are not predicted to result in host population decline. However, parasites may become a major threat to host species weakened by other factors such as habitat degradation or loss of genetic diversity in small populations. We investigate an unusually virulent Tasmanian ectoparasite, Passeromyia longicornis, in its long-term hosts, the endangered forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus) and striated pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) in southeastern Tasmania, Australia. We conducted a parasite elimination experiment to determine the net effect of parasites on forty-spotted pardalote nestling mortality, and monitored nestling parasite load and mortality in forty-spotted and striated pardalote nestlings during two breeding seasons (Aug-Jan, 2013-2015). Passeromyia longicornis larvae killed 81% of all forty-spotted pardalotes nestlings. Across 2 years, forty-spotted pardalotes fledged fewer nestlings (18%) than sympatric striated pardalotes (26%), and this difference was generated by a combination of higher parasite load and virulence in forty-spotted pardalote nests. These results show that native ectoparasites can cause substantial and potentially unsustainable mortality in their hosts.	[Edworthy, A. B.; Langmore, N.

Mutualists Stabilize the Coexistence of Congeneric Legumes	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						coexistence; mutualism; negative frequency dependence; plant-soil feedback; rhizobia	PLANT-SOIL FEEDBACK; FREQUENCY-DEPENDENCE; COMPETITION; COMMUNITY; NICHE; PATHOGENS; DYNAMICS; MAINTENANCE; POPULATION; DIVERSITY	Coexistence requires that stabilizing niche differences, which cause species to limit themselves more than others, outweigh relative fitness differences, which cause competitive exclusion. Interactions with shared mutualists, which can differentially affect host fitness and change in magnitude with host frequency, can satisfy these conditions for coexistence, yet empirical tests of mutualist effects on relative fitness and stabilizing niche differences are largely lacking within the framework of coexistence theory. Here, we show that N-fixing rhizobial mutualists mediate coexistence in four naturally co-occurring congeneric legume (Trifolium) species. Using experimental greenhouse communities, we quantified relative fitness and stabilizing niche differences for each species in the presence of rhizobia originating from conspecific or congeneric hosts. Rhizobia stabilized coexistence by increasing the self-limitation of Trifolium species grown with rhizobia isolated from conspecifics, thus allowing congeners to increase when rare. Greenhouse-measured invasion growth rates predicted natural, unmanipulated coexistence dynamics of Trifolium species over 2 years at our field sites. Our results demonstrate that interactions with shared mutualists can stabilize the coexistence of closely related species.

Yet little is known about how increased temperature will impact the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship. We tackled this subject theoretically and experimentally. We developed a BEF theory based on mechanistic population dynamic models, which allows the inclusion of the effect of temperature. Using experimentally established relationships between attack rate and temperature, the model predicts that temperature increase will intensify competition, and consequently the BEF relationship will flatten or even become negative. We conducted a laboratory experiment with natural microbial microcosms, and the results were in agreement with the model predictions. The experimental results also revealed that an increase in both temperature average and variation had a more intense effect than an increase in temperature average alone. Our results indicate that under climate change, high diversity may not guarantee high ecosystem functioning.

Queen Longevity and Fecundity Affect Conflict with Workers over Resource Inheritance in a Social Insect	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						bumblebee; kin selection; resource inheritance; social insect; worker reproduction	BUMBLEBEES BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; EVOLUTIONARY-THEORY; KIN SELECTION; SEX-RATIOS; REPRODUCTION; RELATEDNESS; HYMENOPTERA; STRATEGIES; NO	Resource inheritance is a major source of conflict in animal societies. However, the assumptions and predictions of models of conflict over resource inheritance have not been systematically tested within a single system. We developed an inclusive fitness model for annual eusocial Hymenoptera that predicts a zone of conflict in which future reproductive workers are selected to enforce nest inheritance before the queen is selected to cede the nest. We experimentally tested key elements of this model in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. In colonies from which queens were sequentially removed, queen tenure was significantly negatively associated with worker male production, confirming that workers gain direct fitness by usurping the queen. In unmanipulated colonies, queen fecundity decreased significantly over the latter part of the colony cycle, confirming that workers' indirect fitness from maintaining queens declines over time. Finally, in an experiment simulating loss of queen fecundity by removal of queens' eggs, worker-to-queen aggression increased significantly and aggressive workers were significantly more likely to become egg layers, consistent with workers monitoring queen fecundity to assess the net benefit of future reproduction. Overall, by upholding key assumptions and predictions of the model, our results provide novel empirical support for kin-selected conflict over resource inheritance.

Nestmate recognition occurs by phenotype matching, the comparison of the referent (colony) phenotype to the one of an encountered individual. Based on the level of dissimilarity between the two, the discriminator accepts or rejects the target. The tolerated degree of mismatch is predicted by the acceptance threshold model, which assumes adaptive threshold shifts depending on the costs of discrimination errors. Inherent in the model is that rejection (type I) and acceptance (type II) errors are reciprocally related: if one type decreases, the other increases. We studied whether alarm pheromones modulate the acceptance threshold. We exposed Camponotus aethiops ants to formic acid and subsequently measured aggression toward nestmates and nonnestmates. Formic acid induced both more nonnestmate rejection and more nestmate acceptance than a control treatment, thus uncovering an unexpected effect of an alarm pheromone on responses to nestmates. Nestmate discrimination accuracy was improved via a decrease in both types of errors, a result that cannot be explained by a shift in the acceptance threshold. We propose that formic acid increases the amount of information available to the ants, thus decreasing the perceived phenotypic overlap between nestmate and nonnestmate recognition cues. This mechanism for improved discrimination reveals a novel function of alarm pheromones in recognition processes and may have far-reaching implications in our understanding of the modus operandi of recognition systems in general.

Rarity of Size-Assortative Mating in Animals: Assessing the Evidence with Anuran Amphibians	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						mate choice; sexual selection; meta-analysis; assortative mating; disproportionate mating; amphibians	MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; MALE-MALE COMPETITION; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; MATE CHOICE LACKING; MALE BODY-SIZE; SEXUAL SELECTION; COMMON TOAD; BREEDING-BEHAVIOR; FEMALE CHOICE; TREE FROG	Assortative mating in animals can have substantial evolutionary impact. Numerous reports also make it appear to be pervasive in occurrence. In assortative mating, defined here in behavioral terms, animals select their mates according to a particular shared trait such that mated individuals phenotypically resemble each other more than expected by chance. Body size is a widely studied assortment trait. This is especially relevant for anuran amphibians (frogs and toads), among whom reproductive advantages may accrue to large individuals of both sexes. Anurans also exhibit discrete forms of male mating behavior. Sedentary calling behavior of "sitters" allows for female choice, whereas fighting for possession of mates by "scramblers" precludes female choice. Size-assortative mating in anurans should therefore be a property of sitters, not scramblers. I used meta-analysis to assess the occurrence of true size-assortative mating in relation to mating behavior and other variables in 282 studies of 68 species of anurans. I found publication bias against reporting nonsignificant results and analytical bias resulting from pooling of samples collected at different times or places (Simpson's paradox). Pooled samples significantly inflated the apparent occurrence and strength of size-assortative mating. Controlling for such biases left little credible evidence for size-assortative mating behavior in any anurans. Instead, large-male advantage among scramblers was associated with a secondary pattern of concomitant nonrandom mating. In this disproportionate mating, neither sex behaves according to mate choice rules that could lead to consistently strong assortment. It should thus have relatively little evolutionary impact compared to true assortative mating.

Testing Darwin's Hypothesis about the Wonderful Venus Flytrap: Marginal Spikes Form a "Horrid Prison" for Moderate-Sized Insect Prey	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						snap trap; carnivorous plant; prey capture performance; novelty; key innovation; exaptation	COST-BENEFIT MODEL; CARNIVOROUS PLANTS; EVOLUTION; TRAP; CAPTURE; ESCAPE; ORIGIN	Botanical carnivory is a novel feeding strategy associated with numerous physiological and morphological adaptations. However, the benefits of these novel carnivorous traits are rarely tested. We used field observations, lab experiments, and a seminatural experiment to test prey capture function of the marginal spikes on snap traps of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula). Our field and laboratory results suggested inefficient capture success: fewer than one in four prey encounters led to prey capture. Removing the marginal spikes decreased the rate of prey capture success for moderate-sized cricket prey by 90%, but this effect disappeared for larger prey. The nonlinear benefit of spikes suggests that they provide a better cage for capturing more abundant insects of moderate and small sizes, but they may also provide a foothold for rare large prey to escape. Our observations support Darwin's hypothesis that the marginal spikes form a "horrid prison" that increases prey capture success for moderate-sized prey, but the decreasing benefit for larger prey is unexpected and previously undocumented. Thus, we find surprising complexity in the adaptive landscape for one of the most wonderful evolutionary innovations among all plants. These findings enrich understanding of the evolution and diversification of novel trap morphology in carnivorous plants.

Such changes may be characterized by increased phytoplankton taxa variability, which can affect the effectiveness and time of lake recovery mechanisms. Lake Morat in Switzerland has undergone intense eutrophication in the twentieth century (phosphorous concentrations up to 150 mu g L-1) caused by excessive nutrient loadings from agricultural intensification and urbanization. Phosphorous reduction measures since 1986, such as the ban of phosphates in detergents and decreased use of fertilizers in agriculture, have resulted in total phosphorous concentrations up to 20 mu g L-1 today. Despite this drastic reduction of total phosphorous, total biomass production stays high. We investigate historical changes in the phytoplankton community during the eutrophication and re-oligotrophication periods by comparing historical limnological data with sediment pigment concentrations measured by HPLC and other geochemical proxies in a radiodated sediment core. For the last 90 years, we identified four major trophic state changes in Lake Morat. The first period (AD 1924-1937) is characterized by low pigment concentrations and nutrient inputs, with good oxygen conditions. This section represents trophic conditions before the intensive eutrophication phase. The second period (AD 1937-1970) revealed an abrupt increase in pigment concentrations with higher primary production, cyanobacteria dominance and reduced oxygen levels. Oscillaxanthin indicated a Planktothrix rubescens dominance (AD 1954-1970) with concentrations up to 800 nmol g(-1) OM. Their decline after AD 1970 suggests the initiation of an intense eutrophication phase (AD 1970-1983) associated with the dominance of other cyanobacteria species, higher total phosphorous inputs, and intense anoxia. In the restoration period (AD 1983-2014), there was a shift in the phototrophic community from cyanobacteria to green algae dominance, yet some cyanobacteria species remain present. Rapid phytoplankton community changes were identified in the studied period, yet overall primary production response was low. Limnological data revealed a delay of phosphorous reduction due to phosphorous recycling from the sediments. The observation of complex lake ecosystem reactions to prolonged eutrophication and subsequent re-oligotrophication, as shown by the paleolimnological and limnological data in this study, emphasize the importance of careful lake management to revert eutrophication back to historical reference biomass values.

A diatom-based paleolimnological survey of environmental changes since similar to 1850 in 18 shallow lakes of the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Alberta; Bitumen; Before-and-after environmental assessment; Aerial transport; Nutrient deposition; Climate change	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-COMPOUNDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALBERTA; DEPOSITION; SEDIMENTS; SHIFTS; RIVER; PATTERNS; ELEMENTS; ONTARIO	Aerially transported contaminants from the industrial development of the bituminous sands in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of western Canada may threaten the water quality and community structure of the region's lakes. This environmental threat is further compounded by the region's changing climate (i.e. increased temperatures and reduced moisture). Because environmental monitoring began 30 years after the initiation of the region's bitumen-based industry ( 1967), a paleolimnological approach is required to document pre-disturbance conditions and to determine how lakes have changed, if at all, in response to environmental stressors. Our bottom-top (before and after) study of dated sediment records compared pre-disturbance ( 1850) and modern subfossil diatom assemblages from 18 shallow, isolated lakes (which are typical of the region), located along a spatial gradient (up to 110 km) relative to the main area of local industry. Despite the region's substantial environmental stressors, the changes in mostly benthic-dominated diatom communities were minor at 15 of the 18 lakes. We conclude that the muted biological responses may be a consequence of naturally high nutrient concentrations and/or the typically subtle nature of changes in assemblages dominated by benthic generalist taxa. At all sites, including three lakes with marked changes, we found no evidence of a diatom assemblage response to airborne inputs of contaminants (i.e. dibenzothiophenes) and nutrients (i.e. bioavailable nitrogen) from the AOSR industry. Instead, it is likely that regional warming played a role in the modest diatom assemblage changes observed in these shallow lakes, with responses mediated by lake-specific characteristics.

Despite substantial impacts from anthropogenic activity, the region appears to be naturally eutrophic because of its geological setting. A passive continental ice sheet deposited fine-grained basal till that contributes to the naturally eutrophic status of the lakes. Detailed paleolimnological studies in the Iisalmi Route are few. Therefore, we studied the eutrophication histories of three contrasting Iisalmi Route lakes: (1) small headwater Lake Saarisjarvi, (2) larger, but very shallow headwater Lake Nalantojarvi, and (3) large central basin, Lake Porovesi. We compared the suitability of three diatom-total phosphorus transfer functions for application to fossil samples. A local transfer function, specifically targeted to the Iisalmi Route, was the most suitable for the headwater lakes. In contrast, two regional transfer functions, which have larger geographical coverage, performed equally well for the large central basin. All three lakes proved to have been naturally eutrophic for thousands of years. Highest natural variability occurred in the longest core, from shallow headwater Lake Nalantojarvi. This variability reflects the dynamic development of the basin and its catchment after deglaciation. Diatom assemblage changes in cores from Lakes Saarisjarvi and Porovesi suggest cultural eutrophication, most likely after the region was colonized in the sixteenth century, followed by salinization in more recent times. Our study deepens understanding of naturally eutrophic boreal lakes that are located on fine-grained tills and their sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic forcing. Our results also highlight the importance of selecting appropriate transfer functions and realistic restoration targets when dealing with naturally eutrophic lakes.

To assess long-term environmental change experienced by low-nutrient, dimictic New Brunswick lakes we use sedimentary remains of algal pigments and Cladocera in dated cores from impact (prone to late-summer algal blooms, Lac Unique) and reference (no observed algal blooms, First and States) lakes. Overall, all three lakes now exhibit greater bosminid abundance and fewer daphniids, lower Cladocera richness, and smaller average cladoceran body size, although some lake-specific differences in assemblage response exist that cannot be related solely to top-down or bottom-up forces. Zooplankton trends are most pronounced at Lac Unique and First Lake, where algal production is generally greater. Across all three lakes, the only significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) cladoceran bioindicator of the post-1990 period is the pelagic bosminid group, whereas prior to 1990, Daphnia longispina-complex and several littoral taxa were significant (IndVal: p < 0.05) bioindicators. These temporal shifts suggest that the smaller-bodied bosminid group may now be favored over its larger-bodied pelagic competitor Daphnia sp. in these lakes, irrespective of heterogeneous long-term algal patterns inferred from stable sedimentary pigments. We suggest that the indirect effects of climate change, principally during the spring and summer quarters in New Brunswick, may be associated with marked shifts in limnological structure, as evidenced by changes in dominant zooplankton of the pelagic zone. However, further research is needed to rule out whether or not size-selective predation, and its potential interactions with climate change and other stressors, are key mechanisms favoring increased bosminids in low-nutrient, dimictic lakes.

The majority of evidence on such effects is however based in arid and semiarid regions of the United States and Australia, with few studies relating to cool temperate climates such as Northwest Europe. In this study, "Quorer" resuspendable sediment samples were taken from riffle geomorphic units upstream (control) and at two points downstream (pressure and recovery) of cattle access points in headwater streams in agricultural catchments in Ireland to assess levels of deposited stream sediment. Samples were taken in April/May (2016) prior to the grazing season and in October (2016) at the end of the grazing season. Sites in good-high ecological status catchments and less than good ecological status catchments were included in the study. Higher levels of sediment were found downstream of cattle access points in both good-high status and less than good status catchments; however, the impacts of access points were spatially confined to, in most cases, the area immediately downstream of the point of access. There was a strong correlation between deposited sediment mass and organic matter (OM) mass, with levels of OM increasing linearly with deposited sediment mass. Levels of measured sediment were negatively correlated with riparian habitat health (measured using a qualitative habitat assessment). The results of this study highlight the need for measures to prevent cattle access to headwater streams where access points can be many in order to manage local habitat quality and downstream water quality issues.

Fish community response to habitat variables in two restored side channels of the lower Platte River, Nebraska	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fish community; floodplain; mitigation; restoration; side channel	THERMAL REFUGIA; MISSOURI RIVER; CONNECTIVITY; ECOSYSTEMS; CHANNELIZATION; RECRUITMENT; FLOODPLAINS	Anthropogenic alterations to large rivers ranging from impoundments to channelization and levees have caused many rivers to no longer access the floodplain in a meaningful capacity. Floodplain habitats are important to many riverine fishes to complete their life-history strategies. The fish community and species of fish that inhabit floodplain habitats are often dictated by the type of habitat and the conditions within that habitat (e.g., temperature, water velocity, depth, and discharge). As mitigation and restoration projects are undertaken, it is imperative that managers understand how various habitat components will affect the fish community in floodplain habitats. We collected fish and habitat data from two restored side channels with different structural designs on the lower Platte River, Nebraska, to determine how habitat variables predicted species diversity and individual species presence. We found a decrease in discharge in the main-stem river resulted in increased diversity in one of the side channels, with the greatest diversity values occurring during summer. No habitat variables performed well for predicting fish species diversity for an adjacent side channel with more uniform depth and velocity and no groundwater inputs. However, several native riverine fish species in this side channel were shown to be associated with high temperature, dissolved oxygen, main-stem discharge, and discharge variability. These results highlight the importance of considering the physical design of restored floodplain habitats when attempting to enhance fish communities.

The occurrence of these pesticides to the abundant adjacent wetlands can result in impacts on nontarget insects, and cascading effects through wetland ecosystems. In the current study, field-based mesocosms were used to investigate the effects of multiple pulses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the emergence and chironomid community composition, in an effort to simulate episodic rain events to Prairie Pothole Wetlands. Sediments from two local wetlands were placed into the mesocosm tanks and three imidacloprid pulses added, each 1week apart at nominal concentrations of 0.2, 2.0, and 20g/L. Overall, a significant decrease in the emergence of adult chironomids was observed within the 2.0g/L and greater concentrations, with the subfamilies Chironominae and Tanypodinae showing a greater sensitivity than the members of the subfamily Orthocladiinae. The chironomid community also had a dose-related response, followed by a recovery of the community composition near the end of the experiment. Our results provide additional evidence that repeated pulses of imidacloprid may have effects on chironomids and other sensitive aquatic insects living within Prairie Pothole Wetlands, resulting in reduced food availability. We stress the need for continued monitoring of US surface waters for neonicotinoid compounds and the continuation of additional experiments looking into the impacts on aquatic communities.

Optimization of portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry for the assessment of soil total copper concentrations: application at an ancient smelting site	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Archaeometallurgy; Pollution; pXRF; Soil; Spectrometry	HEAVY-METALS; CONTAMINATION; SEDIMENTS; PXRF; VALLEY	PurposeCopper (Cu) is the earliest anthropogenic metal pollutant, but knowledge of Cu soil concentrations at ancient metalworking sites is limited. The objective of this work was to examine the ability of portable X-ray fluorescence to quantify Cu in soils at such sites.Materials and methodsUsing a Bruker Tracer III-SD pXRF, we examine factory scan settings versus simple instrument parameter changes (a reduction in energy settings from 40 to 12kV) to target analysis for Cu. We apply these to a set of uncontaminated samples (n=18, <92mg Cu kg(-1)) from Central Thailand and compare results to standard wet chemistry analysis (aqua regia digestion and ICP-OES analysis). We then apply the optimized method to a set of highly contaminated samples (n=86, <14,200mg Cu kg(-1)) from a known ancient smelting site.Results and discussionWe demonstrate that simple changes to factory recommended scan settings can double the sensitivity of Cu determination via pXRF (optimized limit of determination of 19.3mgkg(-1) versus an initial value of 39.4mgkg(-1)) and dramatically improve the accuracy of analysis. Changes to other results for other elements are variable and depend on concentration ranges, soil matrix effects, and pXRF response for the individual element. We demonstrate that pXRF can accurately determine Cu across a wide concentration range and identify grossly contaminated soil samples.ConclusionsWe conclude that pXRF is a useful tool to rapidly screen and analyse samples at remote sites and can be applied to ancient metalworking sites. Simple optimization of the pXRF settings greatly improves accuracy and is essential in determining comparative background concentrations and unaffected areas. Application to other elements requires further element and matrix specific optimization.

From Paris to practice: sustainable implementation of renewable energy goals	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate change mitigation; land-use planning; natural land conversion; Paris climate agreement; renewable energy; sustainable development	LAND-USE; WIND; EMISSIONS	The signing of the Paris climate agreement and sustainable development goals demonstrated an international commitment to halting climate change, increasing energy access, and maintaining biodiversity. Successful implementation requires rapidly expanding renewable energy development, which has a large land footprint and can conflict with maintaining natural lands. To quantify the potential to mediate this land conflict, we converted emission reduction commitments submitted as part of the Paris agreement into actionable energy targets, and assessed whether they can be met by developing renewables on converted lands and waters of lower biodiversity and carbon value. The world has 19 times the required energy targets on converted lands, and most countries, including the top ten emitters, can meet the Paris agreement goals. Furthermore, regions (e.g. Africa) that will experience substantial population growth and that currently have limited energy infrastructure can meet their Paris agreement and future energy targets by developing renewable energy on already converted lands. Guiding renewable energy development to converted lands presents opportunities for sustainable development, but also requires incentives and proactive planning to ensure expansion does not exacerbate other environmental challenges.

Different herbivore responses to two co-occurring chemotypes of the wild crucifer Barbarea vulgaris	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Feeding preference; Oviposition preference; Defence compounds; Glucosinolates; Saponins	DIAMONDBACK MOTH; MOLLUSCICIDAL SAPONINS; FEEDING DETERRENT; TRAP CROP; PLANT; RESISTANCE; BRASSICACEAE; IDENTIFICATION; OVIPOSITION; LEPIDOPTERA	According to coevolution theory, plant chemical defences are continually evolving in response to selection by herbivores. Unique to the Brassicales, a few species in the Barbarea genus produce triterpenoid saponins that are highly deterrent to some specialist insect herbivores. One species, B. vulgaris, has diverged into two chemotypes, the G- and P-type, of which the P-type seems to have lost the saponin-based insect resistance by producing different saponin structures; it also produces different glucosinolates and other potential defence traits. Here, we examined the preference and performance of a larger set of specialist and generalist herbivores on the two plant types, including three generalist mollusc (Arion vulgaris, Deroceras sp., Cepaea sp.) as well as three specialist (Phaedon cochleariae, Athalia rosae, Pieris napi oleraceae) and two generalist (Mamestra brassicae, Myzus persicae) insect herbivores. Five out of six herbivore species preferred leaves of the P-type for feeding, and most of them also survived and/or grew better on the P-type, or preferred it for oviposition. In contrast, larvae of M. brassicae showed no preference and performed equally well on the two plant types; the leaf beetle P. cochleariae preferred the G-type for oviposition, which was, however, not reflecting larval performance. Overall, the defences of the P-type against herbivores seem not to be as effective as those of the G-type, which is surprising given its large geographical distribution, overlapping with that of the G-type in Scandinavia and Finland. This suggests that additional ecological interactions determine the success of the two chemotypes.

Here, we tested the effects of food plant species of the host Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on host searching behavior (i.e., flight responses to host-infested plant volatiles [HIPVs] and antennal responses to host feces or fecal extract) by the larval parasitoid Cotesia kariyai (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). In laboratory tests, female wasps responded differentially to HIPVs and feces produced from host caterpillars on different diets. Female wasps showed stronger responses to HIPVs from infested maize than to those from infested daikon. Similarly, wasps showed stronger contact responses to feces from caterpillars fed on maize or kidney bean than to those fed on daikon or an artificial diet. Previous studies demonstrated that maize-fed caterpillars are suitable hosts, whereas daikon-fed caterpillars are unsuitable hosts, for parasitism by C. kariyai. Therefore, our results indicate that female wasps show stronger responses to the chemicals related to suitable hosts than to those of unsuitable hosts.

Epichloe endophytes of Poa alsodes employ alternative mechanisms for host defense: insecticidal versus deterrence	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Endophytic alkaloids; Larval mortality; Larval performance; Feeding preference; N-acetylnorloline	FALL ARMYWORM LEPIDOPTERA; FUNGAL ENDOPHYTE; ACHNATHERUM-ROBUSTUM; ALKALOID VARIATION; INFECTED GRASSES; LOLINE ALKALOIDS; ERGOT ALKALOIDS; DIVERSITY; HYBRID; CONSEQUENCES	Some cool-season pooid grasses partner with symbiotic fungal endophytes in the EpichloA << genus for defense against insect herbivores via fungal alkaloids. Poa alsodes, North American woodland grass, independently hosts two species of EpichloA << that vary by produced alkaloids. E. alsodes produces insecticidal N-acetylnorloline. E. schardlii var. pennsylvanica (E. schardlii hereafter) has the gene for peramine, an insect-deterring alkaloid, production, but peramine was not detected. We tested the effects of the two endophytes on survival, feeding preference, and plant damage by the generalist herbivore, Spodoptera frugiperda. No larvae survived when feeding on plants harboring E. alsodes. In contrast, survival was only slightly reduced by plants harboring E. schardlii. However, larvae that fed on E. schardlii infected plants experienced delayed development and reduced pupal mass. Uninfected plants and plants infected with E. schardlii were damaged severely when single larvae fed upon them, whereas larvae fed negligibly on plants infected with E. alsodes. Preference did not match performance. Larvae strongly avoided feeding on E. schardlii but not E. alsodes-infected leaves where survival was zero. When E. schardlii was experimentally removed, larval leaf choices suggested that this endophyte is responsible for deterrence. High levels of N-acetylnorloline were detected from E. alsodes infected plants. Peramine was not detected in the experimental plants harboring E. schardlii, so it remains unclear what mechanisms caused avoidance and developmental delays. The two endophytes may protect their common host in different ways: E. alsodes by larval mortality and E. schardlii by deterring feeding and negative effects on development.

At adult emergency, fresh body weight of females and males was greater on seed heads of wheat and barley (range 59-77 mg) compared to adults reared on immature and mature seeds of black jack (36-51 mg). Survivorship of adults after 40 days post eclosion on wheat seed heads, on green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) pods, and on maize (Zea mays L.) seeds was > 80%, and was lower on barley seed heads (50%) and on soybean (Glycine max Merr.) pods (< 20%). For wild plants, on mature seeds and on black jack plant, the survivorship was higher than 50%. For reproduction, the most suitable diets were maize seeds, and wheat and barley seed heads (cultivated), and black jack (wild) plants. Twenty-eight days post eclosion, fresh body weight increased on all cultivated plants (26-62%), and less on the wild black jack plant (16%); on immature seeds and inflorescences of black jack, and on immature fruits of milkweed (Euphorbia heterophylla L.), adults lost weight (- 10, - 26, and - 17%, respectively).

However, issues remain regarding the composition of flower mixtures to effectively attract and support large communities of natural enemies. Trait-based approaches are promising for this purpose. In the present study, conducted in an agricultural field of Belgium in 2014 and 2015, 15 flower mixtures were considered to explore the relation between the abundance of trapped generalist predators (i.e. lacewings [Neuroptera: Chrysopidae], ladybeetles [Coleoptera: Coccinellidae] and hoverflies [Diptera: Syrphidae]) and the community-weighted means of seven flower traits. Through a redundancy analysis, it was found that the presence/absence of flower ultra-violet pattern and the morphology of the corolla (that determines the accessibility of floral resources) were the traits that significantly affected the abundance of the generalist predators in the flower mixtures. The ladybeetles Harmonia axyridis and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata as well as the lacewings Chrysoperla carnea were more abundant in mixtures with a high cover of flowers showing an ultra-violet pattern, while the opposite was observed for the ladybeetle Coccinella septempunctata. As for hoverflies, Episyrphus balteatus and Eupeodes corollae were more abundant in mixtures with a high cover of flowers with open nectar. These results bring new knowledge regarding how a range of natural enemy species reacts to flower cues in diversified plant communities and should help in elaborating flower mixtures that enhance conservation biological control.

The Influence of Abiotic Environment and Connectivity on the Distribution of Diversity in an Andean Fish Fluvial Network	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						tropics; freshwater; beta diversity; river connection; teleostei	BETA-DIVERSITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; MAGDALENA RIVER; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; ASSEMBLAGES; METACOMMUNITIES; NESTEDNESS; GRADIENTS; TURNOVER	The distribution of Andean freshwater fishes is the result of the interaction of historical and contemporary factors such as basin geomorphology and the physicochemical characteristics of water bodies. Dramatic changes along river networks due to waterfalls or dams generate abrupt changes in longitudinal slopes that function as ecological barriers to dispersal and thus have an effect on the composition and richness of fish assemblages. We expect the amount of variation in beta diversity along the elevation gradient (between 700 and 3,500m a.s.l.) of the eastern slope of the Cauca River basin to be explained by changes in the aquatic environment and connectivity among sites. We measured connectivity in terms of the distance along the stream channel between sampling sites considering changes in slope. We used a Generalized Dissimilarity Model (GDM) to evaluate the contribution of connectivity and other water mass characteristics (dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, temperature, and elevation) in predicting changes in beta diversity. The GDM models explained 33% of the total deviance in species turnover, suggesting that there are additional variables that have not been considered, such as available habitats along the rivers. Elevation was the variable with the largest relative importance in the model and connectivity explained only seven percent of the total variance when all sites were included. However, when only the sampling sites in the headwater streams were included (the most geographically isolated sites), the GDM models explained 51% of the total deviance and the contribution due to connectivity increased. Isolation of stream headwaters, in conjunction with extreme conditions present at high elevations may influence the fish assemblage turnover. Our results provide evidence that elevation has a strong influence on beta diversity of Andean fish assemblages. Species turnover upstream above 1,200m a.s.l. is strongly influenced by channel connectivity and there are additional environmental variables that need to be included in the models to improve their prediction power.

We examined associations between both residential and school greenspace and individual school grades in German adolescents. Methods: German and maths grades from the latest school certificate, residential and school greenspace, and covariates were available for 1351 10 and 15 years old Munich children and 1078 Wesel children from two German birth cohorts - GINIplus and LISA. Residential and school greenspace was assessed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), tree cover, and (in Munich only) proportion of agricultural land, forest, and urban green space in 500-m and 1000-m circular buffers. Longitudinal associations between each exposure-outcome pair were assessed by logistic mixed effects models with person and school as random intercepts and adjusted for potential confounders. Results: No associations were observed between any of the greenspace variables and grades in Wesel children. Several statistically significant associations were observed with German and maths grades in Munich children, however associations were inconsistent across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: There is no evidence of an association of higher greenspace at residence, school or combined with improved academic performance in German adolescents from the GINIplus and LISA longitudinal studies.

In fact, the inhibition of nitrification after application of urea or an ammonium-based fertilizer to agricultural soils has resulted in an efficient strategy to mitigate both N2O and NO in aerated agricultural soils. Therefore, the NO and N2O mitigation capacity of a novel nitrification inhibitor (NI), 2-(3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl) succinic acid isomeric mixture (DMPSA), has been studied in a winter wheat crop. A high temporal resolution of fluxes of NO and NO2, obtained by using automatic chambers for urea (U) and urea with DMPSA, allowed a better understanding of the temporal net emissions of these gases under field conditions. Seventy-five days after fertilization, the effective reduction of nitrification by DMPSA significantly decreased the production of NO with respect to the treatment without it, giving net consumption of NO in the soil (-61.72 g-N ha(-1)) for U DMPSA in comparison to net production (227.44 g-N ha(-1)) for U. The explanation of NO deposition after NI application, due to biotic and abiotic processes in the soil-plant system, supposes a challenge that needs to be studied in the future. In the case of N2O, the addition of DMPSA significantly mitigated the emissions of this gas by 71%, though the total N2O emissions in both fertilized treatments were significantly greater than those of the control (43.69 g-N ha(-1)). Regarding the fertilized treatments, no significant effect of DMPSA in comparison to urea alone was observed on grain yield nor bread-making wheat quality. To sum up, we got a significant reduction of N2O and NO with the addition of DMPSA, without a loss in yield and quality parameters in wheat. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While many species will be exposed to pesticides and warming both in the parental and offspring generations, transgenerational effects of pesticides under warming are still poorly studied, particularly for behaviour. We therefore studied the single and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and warming both within and across generations on antipredator behaviour of larvae of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens, Within each generation pesticide exposure and warming reduced the escape diving time, making the larvae more susceptible to predation. Pesticide exposure of the parents did not affect offspring anti predator behaviour. Yet, parental exposure to warming determined how warming and the pesticide interacted in the offspring generation. When parents were reared at 24 degrees C, warming no longer reduced offspring diving times in the solvent control, suggesting an adaptive transgenerational effect to prepare the offspring to better deal with a higher predation risk under warming. Related to this, the CPF-induced reduction in diving time was stronger at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, except in the offspring whose parents had been exposed to 24 degrees C. This dependency of the widespread interaction between warming and pesticide exposure on an adaptive transgenerational effect of warming is an important finding at the interface of global change ecology and ecotoxicology.

Here we used a citizen science approach where schoolchildren examined litter at riversides and identified possible sources at over 250 sampling spots along large and small rivers in Germany, during autumn 2016 and spring 2017. Litter densities have an overall median of 0.14, interquartile range 0-0.57 items m(-2) and an overall average (standard deviation) of 0.54 +/- 1.20 litter items m(-2). Litter quantities differed only little by sampling year. The principal litter types found were plastics and cigarette butts (31% and 20%, respectively), followed by glass, paper, and metal items, indicating recreational visitors as the principal litter source. At many sites (85%), accumulations of litter, consisting principally of cigarettes and food packaging, have been found. At almost all sampling sites (89%), litter potentially hazardous to human health has been observed, including broken glass, sharp metal objects, used personal hygiene articles and items containing chemicals. In the search for litter sources, the schoolchildren identified mainly people who use the rivers as recreational areas (in contrast to residents living in the vicinity, illegal dumping, or the river itself depositing litter from upstream sources). These results indicate the urgent need for better education and policy measures in order to protect riparian environments and reduce input of riverine litter to the marine environment (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of random forest regression and multiple linear regression for predicting indoor fine particulate matter concentrations in a highly polluted city	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article							LAND-USE REGRESSION; AIR-POLLUTION; PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS; BLACK SMOKE; OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS; PERSONAL EXPOSURE; ULAANBAATAR; CLASSIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; MORTALITY	Background: Indoor and outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are both leading risk factors for death and disease, but making indoor measurements is often infeasible for large study populations. Methods: We developed models to predict indoor PM2.5 concentrations for pregnant women who were part of a randomized controlled trial of portable air cleaners in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. We used multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest regression (RFR) to model indoor PM2.5 concentrations with 447 independent 7-day PM2.5 measurements and 87 potential predictor variables obtained from outdoor monitoring data, questionnaires, home assessments, and geographic data sets. We also developed blended models that combined the MLR and RFR approaches. All models were evaluated in a 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The predictors in the MLR model were season, outdoor PM2.5 concentration, the number of air cleaners deployed, and the density of gers (traditional felt-lined yurts) surrounding the apartments. MLR and RFR had similar performance in cross-validation (R-2 = 50.2%, R-2 = 48.9% respectively). The blended MLR model that included RFR predictions had the best performance (cross validation R-2 = 81.5%). Intervention status alone explained only 6.0% of the variation in indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Conclusions: We predicted a moderate amount of variation in indoor PM2.5 concentrations using easily obtained predictor variables and the models explained substantially more variation than intervention status alone. While RFR shows promise for modelling indoor concentrations, our results highlight the importance of out-of-sample validation when evaluating model performance. We also demonstrate the improved performance of blended MLR/RFR models in predicting indoor air pollution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, their effects on human microbiota at non-lethal concentrations remain poorly understood. In this study, the interactions among 1 mu g mL(-1) AgNPs, the intestinal microbiota, and the probiotic Bacillus subtilis (BS) were tested using in-vitro batch fermentation models inoculated with human fecal matter. Results from metagenomic investigations revealed that the core bacterial community was not affected by the exposure of AgNPs and BS at the later stage of fermentation, while the proportions of rare species changed drastically with the treatments. Furthermore, shifts in the Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes (F/B) ratios were observed after 24 h with an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes species and a decrease in Bacteroidetes in all fermentation cultures. The co-exposure to AgNPs and BS led to the lowest F/B ratio. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization analyses indicated that non-lethal concentration of AgNPs negatively affected the relative percentage of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectales taxa in the fermentation cultures after 24 h. However, exposure to single and combined treatments of AgNPs and BS did not change the overall diversity of the fecal microflora. Functional differences in cell motility, translation, transport. and xenobiotics degradation occurred in AgNPs-treated fermentation cultures but not in AgNPs+BS-treated samples. Compared to the control samples, treated fecal cultures showed no significant statistical differences in terms of short-chain fatty acids profiles, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on Caco-2 cell monolayers. Overall, AgNPs did not affect the composition and diversity of the core fecal microflora and its metabolic and toxic profiles. This work indicated a chemopreventive role of probiotic on fecal microflora against AgNPs, which were shown by the decrease of F/B ratio and the unaltered state of some key metabolic pathways.

Genotoxic effects of combined multiple stressors on Gammarus locusta haemocytes: Interactions between temperature, pCO(2) and the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Endocrine disruptors; Invertebrates; Aquatic animals; Comet assay; Climate change	COMET ASSAY; MULTILEVEL ASSESSMENT; ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS; POPULATION-LEVEL; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CHRONIC TOXICITY; DNA-DAMAGE; IN-VIVO; RESPONSES; TOOL	Climate change and pharmaceutical contamination are two priority research topics due to their impacts in the aquatic ecosystems and in the food chain structure. In the bottom of many food chains are the invertebrates, like the amphipods, which are important environmental and ecotoxicological models. In this study, we combined the increase of temperature [ambient and warming temperature], pCO(2) [normocapnia and hypercapnia] and the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel (LNG) [environmentally relevant concentration (10 ng L-1) and 100-fold higher (1000 ng L-1)] to evaluate the genotoxic effects on the amphipod Gammarus locusta haemocytes, using the comet assay technique. Additionally, the study examined protective/potentiating effects of the three tested factors against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced DNA damage in haemocytes after ex vivo exposure. Our data revealed no significant effects of any of the three stressors on DNA damage of G. locusta haemocytes or protection against H2O2-induced DNA damage after twenty-one days exposure. Only a significant effect of the solvent was visible, since it was able to induce higher DNA damage (i.e. strand breaks) on exposed individuals. On the other hand, LNG exposure seemed to induce a slight increase of DNA damage after H2O2 exposure. Our findings suggest that more short-term studies to conclude about the genotoxicity and/or protective effects of the stress factors in G. locusta should be made, attending to the fast turnover rate of repairing cells that could have masked impacts seen only after the end of the experiment.

By contrast, the role of recurrent pulse perturbations, such as extreme climatic events, has been largely neglected, hindering our understanding of how historical processes regulate the onset of a regime shift. We performed field manipulations to evaluate whether combinations of extreme events of temperature and sediment deposition that differed in their degree of temporal clustering generated alternative states in rocky intertidal epilithic microphytobenthos (biofilms) on rocky shores. The likelihood of biofilms to shift from a vegetated to a bare state depended on the degree of temporal clustering of events, with biofilm biomass showing both states under a regime of non-clustered (60 d apart) perturbations while collapsing in the clustered (15 d apart) scenario. Our results indicate that time since the last perturbation can be an important predictor of collapse in systems exhibiting alternative states and that consideration of historical effects in studies of regime shifts may largely improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics under climate change.

Non-circular home ranges and the estimation of population density	ECOLOGY			English	Article						anisotropic detection function; density estimation; home range; non-circularity; radiotelemetry; spatially explicit capture-recapture; study design; telemetry-scaled non-spatial estimator	INFORMATION; MODEL	Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models have emerged as one solution to the problem of estimating the population density of mobile and cryptic animals. Spatial models embody assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of individuals and the spatial detection process. The detection process is modeled in SECR as a radial decline in detection probability with distance from the activity center of each individual. This would seem to require that home ranges are circular. The robustness of SECR when home ranges are not circular has been the subject of conflicting statements. Ivan et al. previously compared the SECR density estimator to a telemetry-scaled non-spatial estimator. I suggest that the apparent non-robustness of SECR in their study was a simulation artefact. New simulations of elliptical home ranges establish that the SECR density estimator is largely robust to non-circularity when detectors are spread in two dimensions, but may be very biased if the detector array is linear and home ranges align with the array. Transformation to isotropy reduces bias from designs of intermediate dimension, such as hollow square arrays. Possible alignment of home ranges should be considered when designing detector arrays.

Semiarid ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation extremes: weak evidence for vegetation constraints	ECOLOGY			English	Article						aboveground net primary production; climate change; climate extremes; grasslands; semiarid ecosystems; soil respiration	NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; VARIABILITY; GRASSLAND; CARBON; EVENTS; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS; RAINFALL; LEGACIES; BIOMES	In semiarid regions, vegetation constraints on plant growth responses to precipitation (PPT) are hypothesized to place an upper limit on net primary productivity (NPP), leading to predictions of future shifts from currently defined linear to saturating NPP-PPT relationships as increases in both dry and wet PPT extremes occur. We experimentally tested this prediction by imposing a replicated gradient of growing season PPT (GSP, n = 11 levels, n = 4 replicates), ranging from the driest to wettest conditions in the 75-yr climate record, within a semiarid grassland. We focused on responses of two key ecosystem processes: aboveground NPP (ANPP) and soil respiration (R-s). ANPP and R-s both exhibited greater relative responses to wet vs. dry GSP extremes, with a linear relationship consistently best explaining the response of both processes to GSP. However, this responsiveness to GSP peaked at moderate levels of extremity for both processes, and declined at the most extreme GSP levels, suggesting that greater sensitivity of ANPP and R-s to wet vs. dry conditions may diminish under increased magnitudes of GSP extremes. Underlying these responses was rapid plant compositional change driven by increased forb production and cover as GSP transitioned to extreme wet conditions. This compositional shift increased the magnitude of ANPP responses to wet GSP extremes, as well as the slope and variability explained in the ANPP-GSP relationship. Our findings suggest that rapid plant compositional change may act as a mediator of semiarid ecosystem responses to predicted changes in GSP extremes.

Possible relationships between taxonomic diversity and magnitude and stability of ecosystem processes build upon species' functional characteristics, which determine both susceptibility to environmental change and contribution to ecosystem properties. The functional diversity within communities thus provides a potential buffer against environmental disturbance, especially for properties emerging from interactions among species. In complex plant-pollinator networks, distantly related taxa spanning a great trait diversity shape network architecture. Here, we address the question of whether network properties are maintained after habitat loss by complementary contributions of phylogenetically distant pollinator taxa. We quantified contributions of wild bees and hoverflies to network structure (connectance, network specialization, specialization asymmetry) in 32 calcareous grassland fragments varying in size. Although hoverflies are often regarded less susceptible to environmental change than wild bees, species richness of both taxa was similarly affected by habitat loss. The associated loss of 80% of interactions resulted in small and tightly connected networks, which was more strongly attributed to wild bee loss than hoverfly loss. Networks in small fragments were less specialized due to equivalent losses of species and interactions in both pollinators and plants. Because wild bee and hoverfly loss contributed similarly to declining network specialization, we conclude that trait diversity among distantly related pollinators does not necessarily provide insurance against functional homogenization during community disassembly following habitat loss.

Asymmetric interactions and their consequences for vital rates and dynamics: the smaller tea tortrix as a model system	ECOLOGY			English	Article						Adoxophyes honmai; asymmetric competition; cannibalism; distributed-delay stage-structured model; intraspecific; life history rates; population dynamics	INTER-COHORT COMPETITION; GENERATION SEPARATION; POPULATION-MODELS; LIFE-HISTORY; BODY-SIZE; CYCLES; INSECTS; DAPHNIA; GROWTH; FORMULATION	Asymmetric interactions among conspecifics can have diverse effects on population dynamics including stabilization, generation of cycles, and induction of chaotic fluctuations. A difficult challenge, however, is establishing the link between the impact of asymmetric interactions on life history and the consequences for population dynamics. The smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai, is a good example. Larval instars differ dramatically in size and have a tendency for cannibalism, which suggests the potential for strong asymmetric interactions among instars. Yet whether these asymmetries have any role in generating the distinct single-generation cycles observed in the field and laboratory is unclear. Here we report on the development of a new experimental approach to characterize the impact of asymmetric interactions on life history that can be directly embedded into stage-structured population models. The experiments use donor-replacement protocols in which focal individuals are challenged to complete their life cycles in competitive environments where the instar and density of the competitors are held constant. The experimentally derived interaction surface contains all the information about stage-specific interactions and provides a straightforward framework for evaluating alternative ways of abstracting the interactions into traditional models of asymmetric competition. Working with the smaller tea tortrix, we found strong evidence of asymmetric interactions and identified critical "tipping points" in the competitive environment that strongly affected survival but not development. We incorporated the experimentally derived interaction surface into a stage-structured population model and found that despite the strong impact that asymmetric interactions have on tea tortrix life history, they do not scale-up to impact the predicted asymptotic population dynamics. Comparing these dynamics with two abstracted models of stage-structured interactions revealed that while the quantitative details of the emergent dynamics depends on the shape of the interaction surface, the qualitative features, such as the emergence of single-generation cycles and rapid synchronization of development among individuals, are pleasingly robust.

The potential role of intrinsic processes in generating abrupt and quasi-synchronous tree declines during the Holocene	ECOLOGY			English	Article						abrupt change; frequency dependence; hemlock decline; intrinsic processes; self-reinforcing feedback; spatial synchrony	NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; CATASTROPHIC REGIME SHIFTS; MIDHOLOCENE TSUGA DECLINE; PRAIRIE-FOREST ECOTONE; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS; ECOLOGICAL CHANGE; HEMLOCK DECLINE; SEED DISPERSAL; NORTH-AMERICA	Multiple abrupt and sometimes near-synchronous declines in tree populations have been detected in the temperate forests of eastern North America and Europe during the Holocene. Traditional approaches to understanding these declines focus on searching for climatic or other broad-scale extrinsic drivers. These approaches include multi-proxy studies that match reconstructed changes in tree abundance to reconstructed changes in precipitation or temperature. Although these correlative approaches are informative, they neglect the potential role of intrinsic processes, such as competition and dispersal, in shaping tree community dynamics. We developed a simple process-based community model that includes competition among tree species, density-dependent survival, and dispersal to investigate how these processes might generate abrupt changes in tree abundances even when extrinsic climatic factors do not themselves change abruptly. Specifically, a self-reinforcing (i.e., positive) feedback between abundance and survival can produce abrupt changes in tree abundance in the absence of long-term climatic changes. Furthermore, spatially correlated, short-term environmental variation and seed dispersal can increase the synchrony of abrupt changes. Using the well-studied, late-Holocene crash of Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) populations as an empirical case study, we find that our model generates abrupt and quasi-synchronized crashes qualitatively similar to the observed hemlock patterns. Other tree taxa vary in the frequency and clustering of abrupt change and the proportion of increases and decreases. This complexity argues for caution in interpreting abrupt changes in species abundances as indicative of abrupt climatic changes. Nonetheless, some taxa show patterns that the model cannot produce: observed abrupt declines in hemlock abundance are more synchronized than abrupt increases, whereas the degree of synchronization is the same for abrupt decreases and increases in the model. Our results show that intrinsic processes can be significant contributing factors in abrupt tree population changes and highlight the diagnostic value of analyzing entire time series rather than single events when testing hypotheses about abrupt changes. Thus, intrinsic processes should be considered along with extrinsic drivers when seeking to explain rapid changes in community composition.	[Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Stegner, M.

Multiple drivers of contrasting diversity-invasibility relationships at fine spatial grains	ECOLOGY			English	Article						biotic resistance; diversity-invasibility hypothesis; invasibility metrics; invasion paradox; invasion susceptibility; meta-analysis; spatial scale; systematic review	SPECIES-RICHNESS; INVASION RESISTANCE; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; RECONCILING PATTERN; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; LINKING DIVERSITY; SCALE DEPENDENCE; PLANT INVASIONS; COMMUNITY; METAANALYSIS	The diversity-invasibility hypothesis and ecological theory predict that high-diversity communities should be less easily invaded than species-poor communities, but empirical evidence does not consistently support this prediction. While fine-scale experiments tend to yield the predicted negative association between diversity and invasibility, broad-scale observational surveys generally report a positive correlation. This conflicting pattern between experiments and observational studies is referred to as the invasion paradox and is thought to arise because different processes control species composition at different spatial scales. Here, we test empirically the extent to which the strength and direction of published diversity-invasibility relationships depend on spatial scale and on the metrics used to measure invasibility. Using a meta-analytic framework, we explicitly separate the two components of spatial scale: grain and extent, by focusing on fine-grain studies that vary in extent. We find evidence of multiple drivers of the paradox. When we consider only fine-grain studies, we still observe conflicting patterns between experiments and observational studies. In contrast, when we examine studies that are conducted at both a fine grain and fine extent, there is broad overlap in effect sizes between experiments and observation, suggesting that comparing studies with similar extents resolves the paradox at local scales. However, we uncover systematic differences in the metrics used to measure invasibility between experiments, which use predominantly invader performance, and observational studies, which use mainly invader richness. When we consider studies with the same metric (i.e., invader performance), the contrasting associations between study types also disappear. It is not possible, at present, to fully disentangle the effect of spatial extent and metric on the paradox because both variables are systematically associated in different directions with study type. There is therefore an urgent need to conduct experiments and observational studies that incorporate the full range of variability in spatial extent and invasibility metric.

Comparison of large-scale citizen science data and long-term study data for phenology modeling	ECOLOGY			English	Article						budburst; data integration; flowering; forecasting; Long Term Ecological Research; scale; USA National Phenology Network	PLANT PHENOLOGY; UNIFIED MODEL; BUDBURST; PREDICTION; RESPONSES	Large-scale observational data from citizen science efforts are becoming increasingly common in ecology, and researchers often choose between these and data from intensive local-scale studies for their analyses. This choice has potential trade-offs related to spatial scale, observer variance, and interannual variability. Here we explored this issue with phenology by comparing models built using data from the large-scale, citizen science USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) effort with models built using data from more intensive studies at Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites. We built statistical and process based phenology models for species common to each data set. From these models, we compared parameter estimates, estimates of phenological events, and out-of-sample errors between models derived from both USA-NPN and LTER data. We found that model parameter estimates for the same species were most similar between the two data sets when using simple models, but parameter estimates varied widely as model complexity increased. Despite this, estimates for the date of phenological events and out-of-sample errors were similar, regardless of the model chosen. Predictions for USA-NPN data had the lowest error when using models built from the USA-NPN data, while LTER predictions were best made using LTER-derived models, confirming that models perform best when applied at the same scale they were built. This difference in the cross-scale model comparison is likely due to variation in phenological requirements within species. Models using the USA-NPN data set can integrate parameters over a large spatial scale while those using an LTER data set can only estimate parameters for a single location. Accordingly, the choice of data set depends on the research question. Inferences about species-specific phenological requirements are best made with LTER data, and if USA-NPN or similar data are all that is available, then analyses should be limited to simple models. Large-scale predictive modeling is best done with the larger-scale USA-NPN data, which has high spatial representation and a large regional species pool. LTER data sets, on the other hand, have high site fidelity and thus characterize inter-annual variability extremely well. Future research aimed at forecasting phenology events for particular species over larger scales should develop models that integrate the strengths of both data sets.

Belowground plant parts are crucial for comprehensively estimating total plant richness in herbaceous and woody habitats	ECOLOGY			English	Article						454 sequencing; above- and belowground plant richness; next-generation sequencing; plant biomass; root identification; trnL (UAA) intron; vegetation surveys	SPECIES-RICHNESS; ROOT; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITY; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; SCALE; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Most studies consider aboveground plant species richness as a representative biodiversity measure. This approach inevitably assumes that the partitioning of total plant species richness into above- and belowground components is constant or at least consistent within and across vegetation types. However, with studies considering belowground plant richness still scarce and completely absent along vegetation gradients, this assumption lacks experimental support. Novel DNA sequencing techniques allow economical, high-throughput species identification of belowground environmental samples, enabling the measurement of the contributions of both above- and belowground plant components to total plant richness. We investigated above- and belowground plant species richness in four vegetation types (birch forest, heath, low alpine tundra, high alpine tundra) at the scale of herbaceous plant neighborhoods (dm) using 454 sequencing of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron to determine the plant species richness of environmental root samples and combined it with aboveground data from vegetation surveys to obtain total plant species richness. We correlated the measured plant species richness components with each other and with their respective plant biomass components within and across vegetation types. Total plant species richness exceeded aboveground richness twice on average and by as much as three times in low alpine tundra, indicating that a significant fraction of belowground plant richness cannot be recorded aboveground. More importantly, no consistent relationship among richness components (above- and belowground) was found within or across vegetation types, indicating that aboveground richness alone cannot predict total plant richness in contrasting vegetation types. Finally, no consistent relationship between plant richness and the corresponding biomass component was found. Our results clearly show that aboveground plant richness alone is a poor estimator of total plant species richness within and across different vegetation types. Consequently, it is crucial to account for belowground plant richness in future plant ecological studies in order to validate currently accepted plant richness patterns, as well as to measure potential changes in plant community composition in a changing environment.

The ability of individuals to adapt and manage their resilience in the face of these threats is key to understanding how social-ecological systems might respond to future disturbances. We report the results of a survey of farmer adaptability in the Iowa-Cedar River Basin in eastern Iowa that asked questions of farm characteristics, experiences with extreme events, risk perceptions, climate change beliefs, and the frequency of perturbations that might stimulate a response. We find that in general farmers' adoption of conservation practices and land use decisions are insensitive to climate-related perturbations. These individual adaptation decisions are affected by a wide array of constraints. Financial constraints and the stabilizing effect of crop insurance, in particular, reduce the self-reported likelihood that farmers will adapt to changes in system level drivers. An analysis of constraints and farmer perturbation sensitivity suggests that alternative economic and policy levers may be necessary to incentivize change on the agricultural landscape.

Historically, humans have benefited from the ecosystem services offered by nature at the same time that natural systems have increasingly changed because of anthropogenic activities. The lack of methods to unveil and understand such associations might hinder the integrated management of coastal marine areas. In our study, we applied a methodological framework used in terrestrial systems to identify and spatially locate the coastal marine social-ecological systems (CMSESs) on the southern Mediterranean Spanish coast. These CMSESs represent areas with similar human-nature associations that result from sharing similar socioeconomic and marine environmental characteristics. We applied several multivariate analyses to identify and characterize these CMSESs. We found the presence of twelve CMSESs that suggest a co-evolution of the social-ecological associations in these areas. Our results highlight the need for integrated coastal planning and management that consider the specific characteristics and conservation challenges of each CMSES. Our study provides evidence that a successful methodological framework to identify and characterize social-ecological systems can be applied in coastal areas and contribute to integrated management for the sustainability of these fragile systems.

The catchment experienced a rapid expansion of plantation forest in the late 1990s due to tax benefits for forestry Managed Investment Schemes. This paper assesses the landscape effect of incentive based policies by measuring the land use and land cover (LULC) response in the catchment, and forecasts LULC change. The paper applies a spatial modelling procedure that integrates Markov transition probabilities, multilayer perceptron neural network and cellular automata to provide an accurate forecast of LULC change over 35 years from 1979 to 2014. In the first stage, geospatial analysis determines the spatial drivers of LULC conversions. Second, Markov transition probability matrices are estimated, and the multilayer perceptron was trained to determine a model for every transition based on spatial drivers. Finally, a cellular automata model was applied to forecast spatially explicit changes in LULC to 2025 under the current policy regime. The predictive power of the model was validated with Kappa statistics, and vis-a-visa null model. The simulation forecasts an increase in the agricultural areas by 2025 compared to 2014; whereas harvested native forest areas were predicted to decrease, contributing to a slight increase of the native forest areas. Despite government efforts to increase the areas of plantations, the model predicts a decrease in this land use due to a progressive reduction in tax incentives provided to Managed Investment Schemes. These results will assist decision-makers in improving policy, by working through the long-term implications of policy incentives for forestry in terms of broader landscape objectives related to salinity and conservation.

Research on the implications of increased population densities often utilises community knowledge but without incorporating the view of local stakeholders. In this study, we applied a community centred approach to assess direct and indirect consequences of population growth in drylands of north-western Kenya. Combined social, agricultural and geo-spatial analyses allowed us to identify major system transitions, determine their linkage to population growth and deduce consequences for local livelihoods and community resilience. Community-members reported positive and negative consequences of fourfold population growth since 1974 but evaluated its overall effect as clearly beneficial. This overall positive effect was based on both, positive developments and the successful mitigation of potential system stressors. First, food security was maintained despite high growth rates because a shift from migratory pastoralism to a more labour-intensive agro-pastoralist system helped to increase agricultural productivity. Additionally, land-use changes were linked to land privatisation and improved erosion protection on private land, decoupling population growth from environmental degradation. We detected, however also early warning signs of reduced community resilience as households were unable to fully recover livestock densities after catastrophic events. A population-growth driven reduction in household land-sizes and the decreased monetary value of agricultural production were identified as drivers of this development. The extrapolation of our results to establish a general relationship between population densities, land-use and household resilience in Sub-Saharan drylands suggest that further system transformations will be required to ensure regional food-security.

As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures. Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.

Origins of abrupt change? Postfire subalpine conifer regeneration declines nonlinearly with warming and drying	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						alternative states; climate change; drought; ecological experiments; forest resilience; seedling establishment; seedling growth; succession; wildfire; Yellowstone National Park	YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; FOREST RESILIENCE; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; BOREAL FOREST; FIRE REGIMES; VEGETATION; DROUGHT	Robust tree regeneration following high-severity wildfire is key to the resilience of subalpine and boreal forests, and 21st century climate could initiate abrupt change in forests if postfire temperature and soil moisture become less suitable for tree seedling establishment. Using two widespread conifer species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), we conducted complementary experiments to ask (1) How will projected early- to mid-21st-century warming and drying affect postfire tree seedling establishment and mortality? (2) How does early seedling growth differ between species and vary with warming and drying? With a four-year in situ seed-planting experiment and a one growing season controlled-environment experiment, we explored effects of climate on tree seedling establishment, growth, and survival and identified nonlinear responses to temperature and soil moisture. In our field experiment, warmer and drier conditions, consistent with mid-21(st)-century projections, led to a 92% and 76% reduction in establishment of lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir. Within three years, all seedlings that established under warmer conditions died, as might be expected at lower elevations and lower latitudes of species' ranges. Seedling establishment and mortality also varied with aspect; approximately 1.7 times more seedlings established on mesic vs. xeric aspects, and fewer seedlings died. In the controlled-environment experiment, soil temperatures were 2.0 degrees-5.5 degrees C cooler than the field experiment, and warming led to increased tree seedling establishment, as might be expected at upper treeline or higher latitudes. Lodgepole pine grew taller than Douglas-fir and produced more needles with warming. Douglas-fir grew longer roots relative to shoots, compared with lodgepole pine, particularly in dry soils. Differences in early growth between species may mediate climate change effects on competitive interactions, successional trajectories, and species distributions. This study demonstrates that climate following high-severity fire exerts strong control over postfire tree regeneration in subalpine conifer forests. Climate change experiments, such as those reported here, hold great potential for identifying mechanisms that could underpin fundamental ecological change in 21st-century ecosystems.

Complex long-term dynamics of pollinator abundance in undisturbed Mediterranean montane habitats over two decades	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						annual variation; bee abundance; climate change; generalized linear mixed models; long-term variation; Mediterranean habitats; mountain habitats; planned missing data design; plant community; pollinator community; pollinator functional abundance; pollinator visitation probability	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; INSECT POLLINATORS; VISITATION RATES; SPATIAL MOSAICS; BEE DIVERSITY; SOLITARY BEES; BUMBLE-BEE; HONEY-BEES	Current notions of "pollinator decline" and "pollination crisis" mainly arose from studies on pollinators of economic value in anthropogenic ecosystems of mid-latitude temperate regions. Comprehensive long-term pollinator data from biologically diverse, undisturbed communities are needed to evaluate the actual extent of the so-called "global pollination crisis." This paper analyzes the long-term dynamics of pollinator abundance in undisturbed Mediterranean montane habitats using pollinator visitation data for 65 plant species collected over two decades. Objectives are (1) to elucidate patterns of long-term changes in pollinator abundance from the perspectives of individual plant species, major pollinator groups, and the whole plant community and (2) to propose a novel methodological implementation based on combining a planned missing data design with the analytical strength of mixed effects models, which allows one to draw community-wide inferences on long-term pollinator trends in species-rich natural habitats. Probabilistic measurements ("patch visitation probability" and "flower visitation probability" per time unit) were used to assess pollinator functional abundance for each plant species on two separate, randomly chosen years. A total of 13,054 pollinator censuses accounting for a total watching effort of 2,877,039 flower-min were carried out on 299 different dates. Supra-annual unstability in pollinator functional abundance was the rule, with visitation probability to flowering patches and/or individual flowers exhibiting significant heterogeneity between years in the majority of plant species (83%). At the plant-community level, there was a significant linear increase in pollinator functional abundance over the study period. Probability of pollinator visitation to flowering patches and individual flowers increased due to increasing visitation by small solitary bees and, to a lesser extent, small beetles. Visitation to different plant species exhibited contrasting changes, and insect orders and genera differed widely in sign and magnitude of linear abundance trends, thus exemplifying the complex dynamics of community-wide changes in pollinator functional abundance. Results of this investigation indicate that pollinator declines are not universal beyond anthropogenic ecosystems; stress the need for considering broader ecological scenarios and comprehensive samples of plants and pollinators; and illustrate the crucial importance of combining ambitious sampling designs with powerful analytical schemes to draw reliable inferences on pollinator trends at the plant community level.

Chemistry of floral rewards: intra- and interspecific variability of nectar and pollen secondary metabolites across taxa	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						cultivar variation; dynamic range boxes; floral chemistry; floral rewards; intraspecific variation; n-dimensional hypervolume; phenotypic integration; plant secondary metabolites; plant-microbe interactions; plant-pollinator interactions; site variation	FLOWER VISITORS; PLANT; POLLINATORS; DEFENSE; TRAITS; VOLATILE; FLAVONOIDS; IMPACTS; HONEY; CONSEQUENCES	Floral chemistry mediates plant interactions with pollinators, pathogens, and herbivores, with major consequences for fitness of both plants and flower visitors. The outcome of such interactions often depends on compound dose and chemical context. However, chemical diversity and intraspecific variation of nectar and pollen secondary chemistry are known for very few species, precluding general statements about their composition. We analyzed methanol extracts of flowers, nectar, and pollen from 31 cultivated and wild plant species, including multiple sites and cultivars, by liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. To depict the chemical niche of each tissue type, we analyzed differences in nectar and pollen chemical richness, absolute and proportional concentrations, and intraspecific variability. We hypothesized that pollen would have higher concentrations and more compounds than nectar, consistent with Optimal Defense Theory and pollen's importance as a male gamete. To investigate chemical correlations across and within tissues, which could reflect physiological constraints, we quantified chemical overlap between conspecific nectar and pollen, and phenotypic integration of individual compounds within tissue types. Nectar and pollen were chemically differentiated both across and within species. Of 102 compounds identified, most occurred in only one species. Machine-learning algorithms assigned samples to the correct species and tissue type with 98.6% accuracy. Consistent with our hypothesis, pollen had 23.8- to 235-fold higher secondary chemical concentrations and 63% higher chemical richness than nectar. The most common secondary compound classes were flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and phenolics (primarily phenylpropanoids including chlorogenic acid). The most common specific compound types were quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, known to mediate biotic and abiotic effects. Pollens were distinguished from nectar by high concentrations of hydroxycinnamoyl-spermidine conjugates, which affect plant development, abiotic stress tolerance, and herbivore resistance. Although chemistry was qualitatively consistent within species and tissue types, concentrations varied across cultivars and sites, which could influence pollination, herbivory, and disease in wild and agricultural plants. Analyses of multivariate trait space showed greater overlap across sites and cultivars in nectar than pollen chemistry; this overlap reflected greater within-site and within-cultivar variability of nectar. Our analyses suggest different ecological roles of nectar and pollen mediated by chemical concentration, composition, and variability.

Current paradigms implicate habitat complexity, predation, and primary productivity as major drivers of the distribution and abundance of herbivorous fish, yet little is known about the relative contribution of these factors. Here, we compare bottom-up and top-down drivers of notional herbivore assemblages across an environmental gradient of wave exposure in the Palau archipelago. We surveyed herbivore assemblages at reef slopes (6-9 m) across 18 sites, and quantified proxies of top-down control (predator biomass, habitat complexity) and bottom-up drivers (net primary production, nutrients) at each site. Despite substantial variability in herbivore biomass throughout the archipelago (6-65 g/m(2)), general additive models indicate that neither top-down nor bottom-up drivers significantly predicted biomass or density of herbivores among sites. In contrast to expectations, herbivore biomass was highest at sites with high predator biomass, low structural complexity, and low benthic productivity. Rather, the highest biomass of herbivores was associated with shallow, tidally emergent, productive reef flats located adjacent to steep vertical walls ("drop-offs"). The emergent nature of this neighboring habitat precluded occupation by territorial fishes and multiple species of herbivores were observed to make foraging runs into this habitat once tidally inundated. We hypothesize that this habitat configuration provides an important cross-habitat resource subsidy. Multivariate ordination and permutation of herbivore communities revealed strong evidence for biogeographic partitioning throughout the archipelago (western, southwestern, inner eastern, and outer eastern clusters), contributing to an emerging picture that the habitat heterogeneity of seascapes can overwhelm the effects of conventional top-down and bottom-up structuring of herbivory on coral reefs.

Understanding the spatial structure and interrelationships of benthic communities and their underlying environmental drivers, therefore, is of great importance. The benthic community off the sub-Arctic Lofoten-Vesteralen islands was studied on multiple spatial scales, using the MEM (Moran's eigenvector maps) framework to identify spatial structure in broadscale (hundreds of kilometers), mesoscale (20 km), and fine-scale (1.5 km) epifaunal and infaunal communities. A combination of eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and variation partitioning on multiple sets of explanatory variables was used to identify characteristic species and environmental drivers that have a high importance in structuring the communities. Community structure of both epifauna and infauna strongly reflected the boundary of warm Atlantic (>0.5 degrees C) and cold Arctic water masses (<0.5 degrees C), which coincides approximately with the 800-m isobath in this region. Apart from this dominant broadscale determinant, epifauna and infauna displayed different spatial patterns and drivers. Both components differ significantly across local marine landscapes; however, this characterization is not sufficient for infauna, where additional sediment characteristics play an important role in structuring the community across all spatial scales. Within marine landscapes (mesoscale), epifauna displays a spatial structure that, for the most part, could not be attributed to any of the included environmental drivers. The case of the Lofoten-Vesteralen region demonstrated that the used analysis is a valuable tool in spatial planning, as it allows for comparison of the relative importance of individual environmental drivers for the studied faunal components, without losing the information about spatial patterns associated with individual drivers.

Here, we analyzed long-term mortality data for two rapidly declining owls, Little Owl Athene noctua and Barn Owl Tyto alba, in the Czech Republic. We evaluated relative mortality rates with respect to owl age, month of carcass recovery, and two time periods (before and after year 2000). We examined 961 mortality records (199 Little Owls and 762 Barn Owls) derived from six distinct database sources totally spanning the period of years 1934-2017 and the entire Czech Republic. Natural causes, entrapment in vertical hollow objects and drowning in liquid reservoirs (entrapment), and collision with vehicles accounted for the highest proportion of mortality cases in Little Owl, while collision with vehicles and entrapment represented the most important mortality sources in Barn Owl. Relative mortality rates in Little Owl caused by entrapment, non-vehicle collision, electrocution at power lines and confinement in buildings increased after the year 2000. In turn, the relative mortality rate due to collision with vehicles increased after 2000 in Barn Owl. Persecution, collision with vehicles, and entrapment accounted for higher relative mortality rates in first-year than adult Little Owls. In Barn Owls, higher relative mortality rates due to collision with vehicles and entrapment were detected in adult compared to first-year birds. Finally, relative mortality rates differed between age classes according to the month of carcass recovery for both species. For Little Owl, the highest relative mortality rates in first-year individuals were detected during July and September, whereas adult Little Owls suffered the highest relative mortality rates during March, November and December. In Barn Owls, the relative mortality rates of first-year individuals peaked in November and December, whereas adult birds suffered the highest relative mortality rate during July, January and February. This study strongly suggests that reducing the risk of anthropogenic mortality may be crucial to halt the decline of Little Owl and Barn Owl populations.

In Britain, ash dieback Hymenoscyphus fraxineus (Baral et al.) has severe impacts on common ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) populations, and the emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) is likely to add to the impact in future. This will cause significant changes to the character and functioning of many ecosystems. However, the nature of these changes and the best approach for conserving ecosystems after ash loss are not clear. We present a method to locate those areas most ecologically vulnerable to loss of a major tree species (common ash) and identify the resultant damage to distinctive ecosystem properties. This method uses the functional traits of species and their distributions to map the potential degree of change in traits across space and recommend management approaches to reduce the change. An analytic hierarchy process is used to score traits according to ecological importance. Our results indicate that in some areas of Britain, provision of ash-associated traits could be reduced by over 50% if all ash is lost. Certain woodland types, and trees outside woodlands, may be especially vulnerable to ash loss. However, compensatory growth by other species could halve this impact in the longer term. We offer management guidance for reducing ecosystem vulnerability to ash loss, including recommending appropriate alternative tree species to encourage through planting or management in particular areas and woodland types. Synthesis and applications. The method described in this paper allows spatially explicit assessment of species traits to be used in the restoration of ecosystems for the first time. We offer practical recommendations for the ash dieback outbreak in Britain to help conserve functional traits in ecosystems affected by the loss of ash. This technique is widely applicable to a range of restoration and conservation scenarios and represents a step forward in the use of functional traits in conservation.

Performance of their colonies depends on pollen and nectar as food resources, but flowering plants are scarce in modern agricultural landscapes. It is well-known that semi-natural habitats can enhance floral resources and bumblebee abundance, but the impact of different crop types and their heterogeneity at the landscape scale remains unclear. We tested the effect of two different crop types (oilseed rape [OSR] and maize) and of configurational (field border density) and compositional heterogeneity (crop diversity) on weight gain of buff-tailed bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris) and the pollen diversity collected by them in 20 landscapes in Central Germany. We found that augmenting maize cover had a detrimental effect on pollen diversity collected by bumblebees, probably due to intensive management resulting in low plant diversity. This low pollen diversity translated into reduced colony growth, since colonies with high pollen diversity gained more weight than colonies with low pollen diversity. In contrast, OSR cover and configurational and compositional heterogeneity did neither affect colony growth nor pollen diversity. However, for OSR, the timing of the flowering period was important. When OSR fields had a high flower cover at the end of the OSR blooming period, colonies showed increased growth rates. Synthesis and applications. Our results complement previous laboratory studies by showing that high pollen diversity leads to better colony performance under field conditions. Therefore, the maintenance of floral diversity in agricultural landscapes is crucial to ensure that bumblebees can fulfil their nutritional needs. However, the heterogeneity of crops, at least under the currently very low levels of crop rotation, does not contribute to this aim. In contrast, crop identity and timing of mass-flowering crops turned out to be important factors, as maize reduced pollen resources, while late blooming oilseed rape (OSR) was beneficial to bumblebee colonies. Hence, maize cover per landscape should be reduced and strategies to enhance landscape wide flower diversity, especially towards and after the end of oilseed rape bloom, should be promoted to support bumblebee colonies that provide important pollination services.

Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances reduce the structural complexity of habitats, leading to homogenization. High abundances of common, generalist species in disturbed habitats may be driven by reduced competition from specialists in similar habitats. We quantified habitat availability for and utilization of three co-occurring arboreal geckos (Australian native house geckos [Gehyra dubia], northern velvet geckos [Oedura castelnaui] and eastern spiny-tailed geckos [Strophurus williamsi]) in four replicated grazing regimes in an experimental grazing trial in north-east Queensland, Australia. Native house geckos were most abundant in heavily grazed habitats, whereas the two other species rarely co-occurred (either with each other or with native house geckos). Geckos displayed resource partitioning of habitat features, such as tree species and structural characteristics. We found evidence of interspecific competition among gecko species, in which native house geckos shifted their habitat selection in the presence of velvet geckos. In the absence of other geckos, native house geckos preferred rough, peeling bark and dead trees, yet in the presence of velvet geckos, native house geckos shifted away from dead trees, and used more structurally complex trees, probably due to high niche overlap with velvet geckos. Native house geckos were more resistant to the negative effects of livestock grazing than either velvet or spiny-tailed geckos. In the absence of other species, native house geckos used a wider range of microhabitats. Synthesis and applications. Species assemblages are often the results of multiple or complex factors, including predation pressure, habitat availability or competitive interactions. The homogenizing effects on habitat structure caused by livestock grazing reduce diversity and suitability for microhabitat specialists. Reduced competition can therefore promote the abundance of microhabitat generalist species, such as Australian native house geckos, suggesting that livestock grazing leads to homogenization and simplification of habitat structure, which ultimately leads to changes in species composition through reduced competition. Understanding species' responses to disturbance, and more broadly, habitat complexity, is crucial for maintaining or increasing biological diversity in anthropogenically modified landscapes.

Soil aggregate stability (SAS) is widely used to infer rangeland health, partly because high SAS is thought to reduce run-off by increasing infiltration. We studied the sensitivity of SAS to grazing and other disturbances, the effects of SAS on infiltration, and the utility of alternative indicators of infiltration in the Northern Great Plains. To test grazing effects on SAS, we compared SAS between paired areas that were lightly to moderately grazed or excluded from grazing for 6 years. Additionally, we compared SAS between grazed and not-grazed plots of a 2-year controlled grazing experiment with moderate and severe grazing. We also applied herbicide, mowing, and fungicide treatments to test SAS responses to disturbances more generally, as well as effects of SAS and other factors on infiltration. To more generally test for a SAS-infiltration relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of our data combined with other data from the region. Grazing often reduced stability of small macroaggregates (0.25-1 mm) in the controlled grazing experiment but not the paired grazing area experiment. Grazing had no detectible effect on SAS of larger macroaggregates (1-2 mm). Herbicide tended to reduce SAS, and mowing sometimes increased SAS. Infiltration exhibited high plot-to-plot variation and was not significantly affected by treatments. Variation in infiltration was best explained by plant community composition variables and was not explained by either SAS or other soil properties. Our meta-analysis revealed no general SAS-infiltration relationship. Synthesis and applications. Our findings counter prevailing expectations that soil aggregate stability (SAS) is consistently sensitive to rangeland disturbance(s) and a leading indicator of soil water transport. Plant community composition properties were better predictors of infiltration. Our findings support the theory that excessive grazing increases the prevalence of a grazing tolerant species, which was associated with low levels of infiltration irrespective of SAS.

To be sustainable, this production should protect environmental quality and biodiversity. Fertilized mixed-species prairie can deliver substantial quantities of cellulosic ethanol per unit land area with minimal losses of NO3-N in drainage water, but the long-term maintenance of biodiversity in such systems has been uncertain. We report how nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer application, precipitation, and time affected the species composition and productivity of reconstructed prairie communities harvested annually as biofuel feedstocks over a 9-year period. Results indicated that both precipitation and fertilizer application drove above-ground biomass production, with the greatest response to fertilizer occurring in wetter than average years. Fertilization reduced species richness, but increased species evenness. Consequently, Simpson's diversity index did not differ between the fertilized and unfertilized communities, though it declined in both communities over time. A total of 59 plant species was recorded, with eight of them explaining most of the differences in vegetation cover between the fertilized and unfertilized treatments. After 9 years, the high fertility community was dominated by the C4 grass Andropogon gerardii, the C3 grass Elymus canadensis, and the non-leguminous forbs Heliopsis helianthoides, Helianthus maximiliani, and Monarda fistulosa, whereas the low fertility community was dominated by the C4 grasses A. gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, the C3 grass E. canadensis, and the non-leguminous forb M. fistulosa. Fertilization increased the abundance of flowering forbs available to pollinators in the early, middle and late portions of the growing season. Synthesis and applications. Results of our study suggest that maintenance of reasonably high levels of productivity and biodiversity are possible in fertilized prairie communities harvested annually for bioenergy, with plant cover more evenly distributed among different functional groups. In the future, if policy and markets favour biofuels and better delivery of ecosystem services from harvested land, prairie-based feedstocks could become part of a renewable energy portfolio that fosters biodiversity and contributes to the provision of floral resources for pollinators.

Optimizing carbon storage and biodiversity co-benefits in reforested riparian zones	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity conservation; bird community; carbon sequestration; habitat restoration; reforestation; riparian forest; stand density; understorey cover	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MULTIMODEL INFERENCE; HABITAT; RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEMS; FORESTS; VEGETATION; RESOURCES; PROVISION; RIVER	Climate change and biodiversity loss are two global challenges that can be addressed simultaneously through reforestation of previously cleared land. However, carbon markets can encourage reforestations that focus on maximizing carbon storage, potentially at the expense of biodiversity conservation. To identify opportunities to optimize reforestation design and management to meet both goals, we examined the forest stand features associated with carbon stocks in biomass and soil, as well as bird abundance and diversity, in remnant and restored riparian forest stands in central California, U.S.A. Within three decades of reforestation, both planted and naturally regenerating riparian forest stands provided significantly greater carbon storage and avian biodiversity benefits compared to baseline conditions. They were also similar to a remnant riparian forest stand. We identified a synergy between carbon storage and biodiversity benefits in their positive associations with understorey cover, but we also identified a trade-off in their relationships to forest stand density. Biomass carbon stocks were strongly positively related to stand density, while bird density and diversity suffered at the highest stand densities. The variability in understorey cover across forest stands indicates an opportunity for further enhancement of carbon and biodiversity benefits in areas where understorey cover is low, while the variability in stand density suggests an opportunity to re-examine reforestation goals and consider thinning to achieve those goals. Synthesis and applications. We identified synergies and trade-offs between carbon storage and biodiversity in their relationships to forest stand features, indicating opportunities to optimize reforestation design and management to achieve multiple goals. Our approach can be adapted to other reforestation efforts intended to simultaneously address the global challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.

However, the relationship between ungulate poaching, wild prey abundance and livestock depredation has rarely been empirically studied. We surveyed 18 sites across the Hyrcanian forest in northern Iran; a global biodiversity hotspot under pressure from illegal hunting of ungulates, prey depletion, livestock grazing and HCC. We conducted three field surveys across 1,204 km in 93 4 x 4 km cells to count signs of ungulate poaching as well as encounters with livestock and prey species of the Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor and the grey wolf Canis lupus. We documented sheep/goat and cattle depredation from interviews with 201 herders and analysed the effects of illegal hunting of ungulates, forest cover, IUCN categories of reserves, elevation, distance to villages, and wild prey and livestock encounter rates on carnivore depredation rates using generalized linear models. Illegal hunting of ungulates was the most influential depredation predictor. An increase in the illegal hunting of ungulates by one sign/km significantly increased depredation by up to four times. We also found significantly lower levels of ungulate poaching in national parks (IUCN category II) compared to protected areas (V), wildlife refuges (IV) and no-hunting areas, though poaching signs were frequently found in most cells (58%). Encounters with livestock was inversely linked to wild prey species, but positively coupled with signs of ungulate poaching. Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals that: (a) an increase in the intensity of illegal hunting of ungulates can intensify livestock depredation by carnivores; (b) future efforts in reducing human-carnivore conflict to acceptable levels require a combination of law enforcement, prey recovery approaches and mitigation measures; (c) it is essential to understand the root causes of poaching to help minimize human-carnivore conflict (HCC).
