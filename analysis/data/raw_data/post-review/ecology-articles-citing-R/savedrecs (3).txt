However, adapting monitoring designs to answer the objectives and allocating the sampling resources effectively are seldom practiced. Here, we present a practical solution how the sampling effort could be re-allocated without decreasing the precision and confidence of status class assignment. For demonstrating this, we used a large data set of 272 intensively monitored Finnish lake, coastal, and river waterbodies utilizing an existing framework for quantifying the uncertainties in the status class estimation. We estimated the temporal and spatial variance components, as well as the effect of sampling allocation to the precision and confidence of chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus. Our results suggest that almost 70% of the lake and coastal waterbodies, and 27% of the river waterbodies, were classified without sufficient confidence in these variables. On the other hand, many of the waterbodies produced unnecessary precise metric means. Thus, reallocation of sampling effort is needed. Our results show that, even though the studied variables are among the most monitored status metrics, the unexplained variation is still high. Combining multiple data sets and using fixed covariates would improve the modeling performance. Our study highlights that ongoing monitoring programs should be evaluated more systematically, and the information from the statistical uncertainty analysis should be brought concretely to the decision-making process.

Concerning downstream migration of juvenile salmon (smolts), understanding their behaviour is a key to improving the efficiency of bypass systems. Among devices to improve efficiency, artificial lighting has proved effective in certain situations. Based on (1) recent observations of early migrating smolts where migration was delayed in the Poutes dam reservoir (Allier River, France) and (2) the fact that the implementation of bypass lighting devices was based on experiments involving later-season migrants, the present study assessed the effect of a lighting device on wild early-migrating smolts. One hundred wild smolts were tagged with acoustic transmitters and their behaviour near the bypass entrance under lit or dark conditions was assessed using 2D acoustic telemetry. A very abrupt change in behaviour around mid-April was observed, which directly affected their response to light. In the first phase of the downstream migration season (before mid-April), lighting significantly reduced the attractiveness of the bypass, while this surprisingly seemed to favour passage: smolts less frequently approached the bypass entry zone but passed through it more frequently. However, in the second phase (after mid-April), lighting attracted and kept the smolts close to the bypass entrance and significantly increased passage, corroborating previous experiments. The present study demonstrated an interaction between the development of migratory fish and their behaviour under lit or dark conditions. It also highlighted the importance of taking account of such behavioural change during the migration season when designing fish passage systems.

Meanwhile, assessments of the effects of boating on vegetation, and potential effects on associated fish assemblages are rare. Here, we analysed (i) the effect of small-boat marinas on vegetation structure, and (ii) juvenile fish abundance in relation to vegetation cover in shallow wave-sheltered coastal inlets. We found marinas to have lower vegetation cover and height, and a different species composition, compared to control inlets. This effect became stronger with increasing berth density. Moreover, there was a clear positive relationship between vegetation cover and fish abundance. We conclude that recreational boating and related moorings are associated with reduced cover of aquatic vegetation constituting important habitats for juvenile fish. We therefore recommend that coastal constructions and associated boating should be allocated to more disturbance tolerant environments (e.g. naturally wave-exposed shores), thereby minimizing negative environmental impacts.

Ecological studies of urban wetlands have typically focused on large metropolitan areas, but non-traditional urbanizing areas such as the towns of the Great Plains of North America are projected to experience land-use and climate changes that will alter connectivity among the freshwater wetlands along a continental-scale migratory wildlife corridor. We used seven graph theory metrics to quantify connectivity among 89,798 of these wetlands under landscape-change forecasts from two models built for three climate change and development scenarios, projected to the year 2050. We compared outcomes from models that differed in focal variable (impervious surface or developed land use). Overall, models with impervious surface projections resulted in the most wetlands affected, whereas models featuring developed land use projections resulted in the largest spatial distribution of effect. There were differences in how many and which wetlands were forecast to become urbanized by model and scenario, resulting in different wetland network topologies and differences in the connectivity roles of individual wetlands. A consensus network was therefore developed based on the wetlands that were projected to increase in impervious surface and exist within developed land use by 2050. These 126 wetlands can be prioritized for urban ecological studies or management because they are highly likely to be affected regardless of model or scenario. Lastly, our study highlights the utility of considering a range of developmental futures when planning urban wetland management in non-traditional urbanizing areas.

Moreover, agencies and organizations are increasingly looking to private lands as places for new protected lands establishment. However, the effectiveness of protected lands in guarding against the loss of species or services can vary based on their coverage of habitat and species, management strategy, and their size and configuration across the landscape. We compare protected lands patches between two adjacent ecoregions, the public lands centric Blue Ridge and the private land dominated Piedmont, using estimates of land cover, management practices, and landscape configuration as a proxy for their relative contribution towards the long-term conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We conducted a hotspot analysis to evaluate geographic changes in spatial clustering of protected lands establishment between the years 1985 and 2015. In addition, we evaluated climate resiliency of protected lands patches using metrics developed by Anderson et al. (2016). We found that, compared to public lands, private protected lands contain larger amounts of agriculture than forest, allow for more utilitarian use than public lands, and are less resilient to climatic change. Furthermore, although total area of private protected lands increased since 1985, they are smaller and more disconnected, contributing less to overall connectivity of the protected lands network. To improve upon past efforts, we must improve management accounting and practice and prioritize land for protection that improves coverage, network connectivity, and climate resilience.

There are concerns that large-scale culls of mountain hares on grouse moors are contributing to population declines of mountain hares in Scotland. We use hare data collected during red grouse counts in Scotland, to consider spatial and temporal variation in annual mountain hare indices of spring abundance in relation to different grouse management intensities, classified as either 'Driven' (driven grouse shooting), 'Walked-up' (walked-up shooting) or 'Not-shot' (where there was no grouse shooting interest). Trends in mountain hare abundance indices varied with region and grouse management intensity. Hare indices were higher and relatively stable on moors where driven grouse shooting was practised relative to lower indices and declines on moors where grouse were either walked-up or not shot. Abundance indices fluctuated over time in a quasi-cyclical manner, fluctuations being more pronounced where hares were more abundant, i.e. on driven grouse moors. Density-dependent processes such as resource competition and parasitism could explain greater fluctuations in areas where hare abundance indices were higher, whilst reductions in indices over time probably reflect sampling at decline phases of the cycle, particularly on driven moors, rather than being part of true long-term declines. Given our understanding of grouse moor management and mountain hare ecology, enhanced habitat management and control of generalist predators seem to be the most parsimonious explanation for higher abundances indices of mountain hare on driven grouse moors.

The results showed the molecular weight distribution of organic matter extracted by centrifugation, heating and cation exchange resin (CER) was similar, while the EPS extracted by centrifugation (Control) and CER had similar fluorescent organic matter. The protein secondary structures of extracted EPS by the four methods were different. The similarities of protein secondary structures between the EPS extracted by CER with the Control were the highest among the four extracted EPS. Although the EPS yield extracted by formaldehyde + NaOH method were the highest, its protein secondary structures had the lowest similarity with those extracted by the Control. Additionally, the effects of centrifugation and CER extraction on the secondary structures of bovine serum albumin were also lower than that of other extraction processes. CER enables the second maximum extraction of EPS and maximum retention of the original secondary structure of proteins.

Environmental factors influencing road use in a nocturnal insectivorous bird	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Abiotic factors; Context dependence; Habitat selection; Red-necked nightjar; Road; Seasonality	WIND-SPEED; MORTALITY; THERMOREGULATION; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; NIGHTJARS; PHENOLOGY; RESPONSES; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS	Many animals avoid roads due to traffic disturbance, but there are also some species that use roads in their everyday life and even obtain resources from them. Understanding the factors that influence the intensity of road use by these species can help understand temporal patterns of road mortality and thereby maximise the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures. Here, we use road transect counts conducted once a week for 9 consecutive years (2009-2017) to investigate environmental factors influencing road use in the red-necked nightjar (Caprimulgus ruficollis), a nocturnal insectivorous bird that frequents roads to forage and thermoregulate. We found that the intensity of road use by nightjars was affected by ambient temperature, amount of moonlight and wind conditionsall factors known to influence their foraging efficiency and thermoregulatory requirements. Specifically, the highest numbers of nightjars on roads occurred during no-wind conditions and on either dark-cold or bright-warm nights, suggesting that they preferentially use roads for thermoregulation under unfavourable weather conditions or to maximise food intake during periods of increased insect abundance (i.e. warm nights) and improved conditions for visual prey detection (i.e. full moon). Our results illustrate the role of environmental conditions as drivers of rapid changes in the use of roads by animals. Furthermore, this work suggests that analogous studies can be used to inform mitigation measures, so that mitigation efforts to prevent roadkills can be concentrated during periods of expected peaks in animal use of roads.

One non-lethal method to reduce predation is conditioned food aversion (CFA), in which animals learn to avoid a food due to the illness after ingestion, caused by the addition of an undetected chemical compound. CFA can be enhanced by adding an artificial odour cue, in a process known as taste-potentiated odour aversion (TPOA). We tested CFA and TPOA with three experimental groups of penned dogs. Food was offered with a combination of microencapsulated levamisole + vanilla odour (ODO), microencapsulated levamisole (LEV), or plain food as a control. The aims were (a) to test whether dogs detected the microencapsulated levamisole, (b) to analyse the strength and extinction time of CFA induced by microencapsulated levamisole, and (c) to analyse the strength and extinction time of TPOA. Two-choice tests were carried out during 11 post-conditioning months, and two reinforcements with microencapsulated levamisole were performed during the first post-conditioningmonth. In the first post-conditioning test, ODO and LEV groups ate significantly less untreated food than control group. After reinforcement, the dogs in LEV group resumed eating the food. Three of four dogs in ODO group showed long-lasting CFA until the 11th month. These results show that TPOA could be used to induce odour aversion on canids and that the odour cue overshadows the slight bitter taste of microencapsulated levamisole. These results show TPOA as a promising tool to reduce predation by wild canids.

In this work, the relevance of the ecological groups that macrofaunal molluscs are assigned according to their sensitivity or tolerance to environmental disturbance was examined under the scope of the RCP 8.5 severe emissions scenario. The effects of climate change were more profound on species that are indicative of a specific suite of climatic conditions regarding temperature and salinity. Significant loss of habitat suitability was observed for the tolerant species Corbula gibba and Abra prismatica whereas the sensitive species Moerella donacina was least affected. In contrast, an overall expansion of the distributional potential was observed for the sensitive species Flexopecten hyaline's as newly suitable habitats are formed. As hypothesised, the current ecological grouping that depicts the sensitivity of a benthic spades to an environmental stressor is irrelevant when assessing the effects of climate change. We propose a new standpoint of using benthic species as biotic tools based on their ecological niche requirements. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Biogenic habitat shifts under long-term ocean acidification show nonlinear community responses and unbalanced functions of associated invertebrates	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Carbon dioxide; Ocean acidification; Phase shift; Transplant; CO2 vents; Vermetid reef	CO2 VENTS; CORAL; ENVIRONMENTS; IMPACTS; REEFS; SEA	Experiments have shown that increasing dissolved CO2 concentrations (i.e. Ocean Acidification, OA) in marine ecosystems may act as nutrient for primary producers (e.g. fleshy algae) or a stressor for calcifying species (e.g., coralline algae, corals, molluscs). For the first time, rapid habitat dominance shifts and altered competitive replacement from a reef-forming to a non-reef-forming biogenic habitat were documented over one-year exposure to low pH/high CO2 through a transplant experiment off Vulcano Island CO2 seeps (NE Sicily, Italy). Ocean acidification decreased vermetid reefs complexity via a reduction in the reef-building species density, boosted canopy macroalgae and led to changes in composition, structure and functional diversity of the associated benthic assemblages. OA effects on invertebrate richness and abundance were nonlinear, being maximal at intermediate complexity levels of vermetid reefs and canopy forming algae. Abundance of higher order consumers (e.g. carnivores, suspension feeders) decreased under elevated CO2 levels. Herbivores were non-linearly related to OA conditions, with increasing competitive release only of minor intertidal grazers (e.g. amphipods) under elevated CO2 levels. Our results support the dual role of CO2 (as a stressor and as a resource) in disrupting the state of rocky shore communities, and raise specific concerns about the future of intertidal reef ecosystem under increasing CO2 emissions. We contribute to inform predictions of the complex and nonlinear community effects of OA on biogenic habitats, but at the same time encourage the use of multiple natural CO2 gradients in providing quantitative data on changing community responses to long-term CO2 exposure.

Size and shape matter: A preliminary analysis of microplastic sampling technique in seawater studies with implications for ecological risk assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aquaculture; Discrete; Filtration; Mesh; Methodology; Microplastics	SEA; POLLUTION; WATER; MICROFIBERS; CONTAMINATION; RETENTION; SEDIMENTS; IDENTIFICATION; EXPOSURE; FIBERS	Microplastic particles (MPs) are widely distributed in seawater. Fibrous MPs (microfibres) are often reported as the most commonly encountered shape of particle. To estimate MP concentrations in seawater, samples are often collected using towed nets (generally 300-350-mu m mesh) and may underestimate the amount of microfibres present, which may pass through the mesh due to their narrow width. We compared the potential microplastic particle (PMP) concentration estimates provided by two different seawater sampling methods conducted at three commercial shellfish farms and three unfarmed sites in Baynes Sound, British Columbia, Canada. The methods were: 10-L bucket samples sieved through 63-mu m mesh in situ and subsequently filtered through an 8-mu m polycarbonate membrane; and 1-L bulk samples collected in jars and subsequently filtered to 8 mu m. The jar samples yielded PMP concentrations averaging approximately 8.5 times higher than the bucket samples per L of water (at the site level), largely driven by differences in the number of microfibres. There was no significant difference in PNP concentration between shellfish farms and unfarmed sites. An analysis of MP concentrations and mesh sizes reported in the literature suggests that using a 300-350-mu m mesh may underestimate total MP concentrations by one to four orders of magnitude compared with samples that are filtered through much smaller mesh sizes (e.g. <100 mu m), despite the effect of sample volume. Particles <300 mu m in diameter make up a large component of MPs commonly found in fish and invertebrates. As such, common sampling practices fail to adequately measure a biologically relevant class of MPs, thereby undermining the ability to quantify ecological risk. We suggest that seawater sampling methods be designed to filter to <10 mu m (the approximate width of many microfibres), either using pressurized pumps for large-volume samples, or by using sufficient replication of small-volume discrete samples.

Lowland peat soils can also be very productive for agriculture, but their cultivation requires drainage as most crops are intolerant of root-zone anoxia. This leads to the creation of oxic conditions in which organic matter becomes vulnerable to mineralisation. Given the demand for high quality agricultural land. 40% of the UK's peatlands have been drained for agricultural use. In this study we present the outcomes of a controlled environment experiment conducted on agricultural fen peat to examine possible trade-offs between celery growth (an economically important crop on the agricultural peatlands of eastern England) and emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) at different temperatures (ambient and ambient +5 degrees C), water table levels (-30 cm, and -50 cm below the surface), and fertiliser use. Raising the water table from -50 cm to -30 cm depressed yields of celery, and at the same time decreased the entire ecosystem CO2 loss by 31%. A 5 degrees C temperature increase enhanced ecosystem emissions of CO2 by 25% and increased celery dry shoot weight by 23% while not affecting the shoot fresh weight. Fertiliser addition increased both celery yields and soil respiration by 22%. Methane emissions were generally very low and not significantly different from zero. Our results suggest that increasing the water table can lower emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce the rate of peat wastage, but reduces the productivity of celery. If possible, the water table should be raised to -30 cm before and after cultivation, and only decreased during the growing season, as this would reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and peat loss, potentially not affecting the production of vegetable crops.

Does trophic level drive organic and metallic contamination in coral reef organisms?

Pesticides, PCBs and trace elements were measured on coral reef communities of three Pacific islands (Moorea. Wallis and New Caledonia) in relation with delta N-15 values, a proxy of trophic level. Several potential sources of organic matter, benthic invertebrates and fish belonging to various trophic strategies were sampled at each island. Wallis and New Caledonia displayed, respectively, the highest concentrations of pesticides and trace elements. In the three islands, most trace element concentrations (Cd, Co. Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb. and V) decreased when delta N-15 was rising (i.e. bioreduction), whereas Hg and Se biomagnified with increasing delta N-15 values. Only few trace elements in some islands did not show any significant trend in relation with ON (i.e., Ag in New Caledonia, Zn in Wallis and As plus Zn in Moorea). PCBs concentrations showed a significant bioreduction in New Caledonia and in Moorea, but a significant biomagnification in Wallis. Aldrin and heptachlor were the only pesticides to show a similar significant bioreduction in the three islands. Other pesticides, such as chlordecone, diazinon, endosulfan I and II, heptachlor-epoxide A and B, lindane and pp'-DDE displayed contrasted patterns (e.g. chlordecone significantly biomagnified in New Caledonia, significantly bioreduced in Wallis and did not displayed any significant trend in Moorea). Finally, for unclear reasons, Moorea displayed only negative significant correlations between delta N-15 and all pesticides (except pp'-DDT). Our results highlight that trophic level, here assessed through delta N-15 values, is a good predictor of metallic trace elements biomagnification or bioreduction in coral reef organisms. However, at large spatial scale, trophic level relevance to predict pesticides and PCBs biomagnification or bioreduction should be considered with caution and studied in dose relation with local characteristics.

In each sampling, two points of the river were analyzed, one upstream of the accumulation dam and the water catchment point for water supply of the Porto Belo WTS (P1), and another downstream (P2) with water, sediment, and fish sampling. Biotransforrnation, oxidative stress, histopathological and genotoxic biomarkers were analyzed in different tissues. The presence of glyphosate was detected in the sediment (11.7 mu g.kg(-1)) from the upstream point of the water catchment site (P1) in spring. The lower activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as the increased damage to renal DNA and hepatic tissue, coincided with the lower muscular and cerebral acetylcholinesterase activities (AChE) at P1, in relation to P2 in the spring season, with a lower rainfall index (81.8 m m(3)). A seasonal variation was also observed between the spring and fall seasons, in fish responses to biomarkers. Reduction of muscle AChE activity and biotransformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and glutathione S-transferase and antioxidant enzymes such as, SOD and glutathione peroxidase, as well as increased brain DNA damage, coincided with the highest number of tissue lesions in the liver and gills in the spring, regardless of the sampling point. The results suggested that the Pereque River is contaminated by xenobiotics and probably herbicides from irrigated rice plantations, indicating damages to the biota and a potential public health risk.

Nutrients mediate the effects of temperature on methylmercury concentrations in freshwater zooplankton	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Methylmercury; Eutrophication; Climate change; Zooplankton; Reservoir; Mesocosm; Phytoplankton	METHYL MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS; ESSENTIAL FATTY-ACIDS; FOOD WEBS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALGAL BLOOMS; BODY-SIZE; BIOACCUMULATION; PATTERNS; EUTROPHICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON	Methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulation in freshwater aquatic systems is impacted by anthropogenic stressors, including climate change and nutrient enrichment. The goal of this study was to determine how warmer water temperatures and excess nutrients would alter zooplankton communities and phytoplankton concentrations, and whether those changes would in turn increase or decrease MeHg concentrations in freshwater zooplankton. To test this, we employed a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design with nutrient and temperature treatments. Mesocosms were filled with ambient water and plankton from Cottage Grove Reservoir, Oregon, U.S.A., a waterbody that has experienced decades of elevated MeHg concentrations and corresponding fish consumption advisories due to run-off from Black Butte Mine tailings, located within the watershed. Treatment combinations of warmer temperature (increased by 0.7 degrees C), nutrient addition (a single pulse of 10x ambient concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous), control, and a combination of temperature and nutrients were applied to mesocosms. The individual treatments altered phytoplankton densities and community structure, but alone the effects on MeHg concentrations were muted. Importantly, we found a significant interactive effect of nutrients and temperature: the nutrient addition appeared to buffer against increased MeHg concentrations associated with elevated temperature. However, there was variability in this response, which seems to be related to the abundance of Daphnia and edible phytoplankton. Nutrients at low temperature were associated with marginal increases (1.1x) in zooplankton MeHg. Our findings suggest that global change drivers that influence community composition and ecosystem energetics of both zooplankton and phytoplankton can alter MeHg path- ways through food webs.

Snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivealis) as bio-indicators for exposure differences to legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants from the Arctic terrestrial environment on Svalbard	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Persistent organic pollutants; Birds; Terrestrial exposure	MOTHER-CUB PAIRS; POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; TEMPORAL TRENDS; PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS; PLASMA-LEVELS; POLAR BEARS; CONTAMINANTS; EGGS; ORGANOCHLORINES	Eggs of snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivealis) were applied as a bio-indicator to examine differences in exposure to legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and perflouroalkyl subtances (PFAS) from the terrestrial environment surrounding the settlements of Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Pyramiden on Svalbard, Norway. Significantly higher concentrations of summed polychlorinated biphenyls (sumPCB7) in eggs collected from Barentsburg (2980 ng/g lipid weight (1w)) and Pyramiden (3860 ng/g lw) compared to Longyearbyen (96 ng/g 1w) are attributed to local sources of PCBs within these settlements. Similar findings were observed for p,p'-didilorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) where higher median concentrations observed in Pyramiden (173 ng/g lw) and Barentsburg (75 ng/g lw) compared to Longyearbyen (48 ng/g 1w) may be influenced by guano inputs from breeding seabird populations. although other point sources cannot be ruled out Concentrations of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PROS) and several perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in snow bunting eggs were found to be statistically higher in the populated settlements of Longyearbyen and Barentsburg compared to the abandoned Pyramiden. Narrow foraging ranges of snow buntings during breeding season was useful in assessing point sources of exposure for PCBs and PFAS at particular sites with extreme differences observed between nest locations. SumPCB7 concentrations ranged fMrn 2 mu g/g ww to below detection limits between nest sites located less than a kilometer from each other in Pyramiden. Similar findings were observed in Longyearbyen, where several PFCAs ranged from 2 to 55 times higher between nest sites with similar spatial distances. These findings indicate that snow buntings can be a useful bio-indicator offering high spatial resolution for contaminant source apportionment in terrestrial environments on Svalbard.

However, the effects of this N loading on carbon gas emissions from freshwater-oligohaline tidal marshes are unknown. In this paper, we report on our evaluation of the effects of a N gradient (0, 24, 48 and 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2) y(-1)) on the methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes in the Min River estuary, southeast China. On an annual scale, the oligohaline marsh has significantly higher CO2 emissions, while it has slightly lower CH4 emissions relative to freshwater marsh. The addition of N increased CH4 emission from the freshwater marsh and decreased CH4 emission from the oligohaline marsh, although there was no statistically significant difference in CH4 emission between either of the two marshes and the control. The addition of 96 g NH4NO3-N m(-2 )y(-1) significantly increased CO2 emission from the freshwater marsh, while it did not significantly influence CO2 emission from the oligohaline marsh. CH4 and CO2 emission levels were positively correlated with soil temperature under all conditions. The CH4 flux resulting from both the control and the addition of N was negatively correlated with porewater SO42- and Cl- concentrations and soil EC in the oligohaline marsh. Overall, N addition significantly increased carbon gas emissions under freshwater conditions while slightly inhibiting carbon gas emissions from the oligohaline marsh. Our findings suggested that even under low salinity conditions, the effects of N loading on CH4 and CO2 emissions from freshwater and oligohaline tidal marshes can vary. We propose that the addition of N to estuarine tidal marshes has a significant effect on the carbon cycle and promotes soil carbon loss, phenomena which may be influenced by salinity.

Culture-independent analyses have revealed diverse microbial communities in weathered shale environments, yet few studies have attempted to discern the functional ecology of such communities in relation to their rock weathering capabilities. In this study, phenotypic plate assays were used to determine the abundance of microbes with different rock weathering phenotypic traits in weathered shale environments. A physicochemical parameter (pH) is shown to influence the abundance of aerobic rock weathering microbes in weathered shale. Iron and manganese oxidizers were restricted to acidic environments while siderophore producing and alkaline phosphatase producing microbes were largely confined to pH neutral environments. Furthermore, a clear separation in the spatial distribution of aerobic-iron oxidizing and siderophore-producing microbes, as defined by a pH gradient across the sites sampled, was demonstrated. Phylogenetic analysis of isolates revealed that siderophore-producing and alkaline phosphatase producing bacteria belonged to commonly identified rock weathering genera including Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces. These results enhance our understanding of how physicochemical parameters can define the composition and rock weathering potential of microbial communities.	[Samuels, T.; Cockell, C.

Determining Millimeter-Scale Maps of Cation Exchange Capacity at Macropore Surfaces in Bt Horizons	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							ORGANIC-MATTER COMPOSITION; STRUCTURED SOILS; FLOW; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSPORT	During preferential flow in structured soils, solute transport is largely restricted to a complex network of macropores. Clay-organic coatings of macropore surfaces determine soil physicochemical properties relevant for mass transport and carbon and nutrient turnover, such as the cation exchange capacity (CEC). However, due to the lack of an appropriate measurement approach, the small-scale spatial distributions of the CEC and its quantities are unknown to date. The objective of this work was to develop a method for predicting the millimeter- to centimeter-scale, two-dimensional spatial distribution of the CEC at intact macropore surfaces. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was used to analyze bulk soil and separated coating material and for intact macropore surfaces as DRIFT mapping. To determine effective CEC (CECeff), a reduction of soil mass down to 0.5 g for use in the standard barium chloride batch method was tested to account for the limited amount of soil material that can be separated from thin macropore coatings. Linear and partial least squares regression analyses were applied to predict the CECeff distribution at intact macropore surfaces for samples from Luvisol Bt horizons from loess (L) and glacial till (T) using DRIFT spectral data. The highest CECeff values were found for coatings and pinhole fillings rich of clay-organic material (L: 38 cmol kg(-1); T: 29 cmol kg(-1)) compared with low CECeff values of uncoated cracks and earthworm burrows that were similar to those of bulk soil (L: 21 cmol kg(-1); T: 14 cmol kg(-1)). The location of millimeter- to centimeter-sized regions with increased CECeff levels at intact macropore surfaces corresponded with the location of clay-organic coatings. The proposed method allows determining the CEC at macropore surfaces to quantify their effect on nutrient transport by preferential flow as well as on plant nutrient supply in macropores that may serve as preferential growth paths for plant roots.

To investigate how free-ranging straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) fly with changing wind support, we use data collected from bats fit with GPS loggers and an integrated triaxial accelerometer and measure flight speeds, wingbeat frequency, and overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as an estimate for energetic expenditure. We predicted that if ODBA reflects energetic expenditure, then we should find a curvilinear relationship between ODBA and airspeed consistent with aerodynamic theory. We expected that bats would lower their airspeed with tailwind support and that ODBA will decrease with increasing tailwinds and increase with wingbeat frequency. We found that wingbeat frequency has the strongest positive relationship with ODBA. There was a small, but negative, relationship between airspeed and ODBA, and bats decreased ODBA with increasing tailwind. Bats flew at ground speeds of 9.6 +/- 2.4 ms(-1) (Mean +/- SD, range: 4.3-23.9 ms(-1)) and airspeeds of 10.2 +/- 2.5 ms(-1), and did not modify their wingbeat frequency with speed. Free-ranging straw-colored fruit bats therefore exerted more total ODBA in headwinds but not when they changed their airspeed. It is possible that the flexibility in wingbeat kinematics may make flight of free-ranging bats less costly than currently predicted or alternatively that the combination of ODBA and airspeed at our scales of measurement does not reflect this relationship in straw-colored fruit bats. Further work is needed to understand the full potential of free-ranging bat flight and how well bio-logging techniques reflect the costs of bat flight.	[O'Mara, M.

However, these methods mainly study seagrass meadows on a single spatial scale and monitor a single driver of heterogeneity. Additionally, few assess the seascape's structural evolution. This creates gaps between the scientific data provided and those required by environmental managers and stakeholders in charge of seagrass meadow conservation. To meet their expectations, in this paper we developed a new multidisciplinary approach based on the coupling of mapping techniques, particle flux, and biometric investigations in a Mediterranean Bay, the Calvi Bay (Corsica, France), to assess the structural changes of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadows subject to disturbances. We focused our investigations on the structural characteristics, the spatial dynamics, and the particle fluxes of natural sand areas generated by bottom currents and dead matte patches which ensued from anchoring damages at 10, 15, and 20 m depth. Natural sand patches and anchoring patches differed in size, the first the largest. They also displayed different erosion-colonization dynamics. Natural sand patches were eroded at a mean speed of 12 cm.a(-1) and colonized at a rate of 7 cm.a(-1). Anchoring patches showed a mean erosion speed of 3.5 cm.a(-1) and a colonization rate of 6.5 cm.a(-1). Regarding particle fluxes, continuous meadow, and natural patch sedimentation and resuspension rates were 3.7 gDw.m(-2).d(-1) and 4.1 gDw.m(-2).d(-1) in average, respectively. In contrast, anchoring patches at 20m depth acted as sediment traps (112.60 gDw.m(-2).d(-1) in winter) and showed a higher particle resuspension rate. Our results highlighted the dichotomous dynamics of seagrass seascapes influenced by natural and anthropogenic factors. Thus, the smallest anchoring patch will take about 27 years to be recolonized while the biggest requires 60 years to be covered by the plant. With an upscaling approach, together with the newest mapping tools of marine habitats, we suggest a new method to study the evolution of seagrass meadows at a large spatial scale.

Design Implications for Surveys to Monitor Monarch Butterfly Population Trends	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						density; Iowa; monarch; transect; survey; butterfly	DANAUS-PLEXIPPUS; SITE OCCUPANCY; DYNAMICS; DISPERSAL; COLONIES; DECLINES; MEXICO; CYCLE; 4TH	The Iowa Multiple Species Inventory and Monitoring (MSIM) Program includes a protocol for monitoring butterfly density on conservation lands using transects. Most data are collected from sites chosen randomly; additional sites are chosen non-randomly for other reasons. We analyzed a 12-year dataset for monarchs to address how density (per 50 m(2) transect section) responded to site selection (random vs. non-random), latitude, and measures of the amount of milkweed and canopy cover on survey transects. Between 2006 and 2017, we conducted 2,328 surveys on 420 sites and detected a total of 2,757 adult monarchs. Monarch densities peaked in 2010 for random sites and 2012 for non-random sites, but densities were lowest in 2013 for both site types. The density of monarchs at non-random transects (0.047, 95% CI = 0.031, 0.062) was higher than that at random transects (0.029, 95% CI = 0.019, 0.044) and the temporal trends of density for random and non-random sites were significantly different. Monarch density was positively correlated with UTM northing, suggesting that monarch density increases from south to north in Iowa. The percent of plots containing milkweed was positively correlated with monarch density whereas percent tree canopy cover was negatively correlated with monarch density. Our results show that non-random transects had more monarchs, which may be a concern when interpreting findings from some citizen science efforts that used non-probabilistic sampling designs. Collectively, the MSIM program data provide a comprehensive assessment of monarch densities statewide as well as the first empirically-derived density estimates for monarchs on the breeding grounds and may prove helpful when refining future monitoring efforts.

Seamounts, however, host vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), which means that spatial management is needed to address potential conflicts between mineral extraction and the conservation of deep-sea biodiversity. Exploration of the Tropic Seamount, located in an Area Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) in the subtropical North Atlantic, revealed large amounts of rare earth elements, as well as numerous VMEs, including high-density octocoral gardens, Solenosmilia variabilis patch reefs, xenophyophores, crinoid fields and deep-sea sponge grounds. This study focuses on the extensive monospecific grounds of the hexactinellid sponge Poliopogon amadou (Thomson, 1878). Deep-sea sponge grounds provide structurally complex habitat, augmenting local biodiversity. To understand the potential extent of these sponge grounds and inform spatial management, we produced the first ensemble species distribution model and local habitat suitability maps for P. amadou in the Atlantic employing Maximum Entropy (Maxent), General Additive Models (GAMs), and Random Forest (RE). The main factors driving the distribution of the sponge were depth and maximum current speed. The sponge grounds occurred in a marked bathymetric belt (2,500 - 3,000 m) within the upper North Atlantic Deep Water mass (2.5 degrees C, 34.7 psu, O-2 6.7-7 mg ml(-1)), with a preference for areas bathed by moderately strong currents (0.2 - 0.4 ms(-1)). GAMs, Maxent and RF showed similar performance in terms of evaluation statistics but a different prediction, with RF showing the highest differences. This algorithm only retained depth and maximum currents whereas GAM and Maxent included bathymetric position index, slope, aspect and backscatter. In these latter two models, P. amadou showed a preference for high backscatter values and areas slightly elevated, flat or with gentle slopes and with a NE orientation. The lack of significant differences in model performance permitted to merge all predictions using an ensemble model approach. Our results contribute toward understanding the environmental drivers and biogeography of the species in the Atlantic. Furthermore, we present a case toward designating the Tropic Seamount as an Ecologically or Biologically Significant marine Area (EBSA) as a contribution to address biodiversity conservation in ABNJs.

Here we use a novel visual method to investigate the perception of a charismatic IAS, the rose-ringed parakeet, across different stakeholders in Seville, Spain. Respondents were asked to select images of 10 bird species they would like to have present in their surroundings, out of 20 available images, including the parakeet and three other non-natives. This makes the survey easy, fast to take and attractive to potential participants, while prior and potentially biasing information of survey goals is minimised. Although more than 95% of the respondents recognised the parakeet, at least up to family level, only 34.8% selected it. Selection rates were even lower for three other IAS and even more so when the status of non-native species was indicated next to the images, suggesting that a social norm against IAS may be established. To validate our novel visual approach, we also assessed perception via a traditional questionnaire and the results of the two survey methods coincided. Finally parakeet selection differed importantly amongst pre-defined sectors of the public and people who had prior experience with the parakeet selected it less frequently (e.g. farmers, park managers). These results highlight the importance of studying different stakeholders to get the full picture when considering IAS management programmes. Our new visual survey method can thus serve as an excellent and user-friendly tool to study people's perceptions regarding charismatic IAS and facilitate well-informed and sensible decision-making.

In this study, we compared the success of three restoration measures, spontaneous recovery, perennial-crop-mediated restoration, and sowing native grasses, by using a unique combination of species-based and trait-based approaches. We sampled 373 4-m(2) plots in nearly 1,000 ha of 20-year-old-restored grasslands and 72 4-m(2) plots in three neighbouring ancient grasslands. Species richness and target species cover were higher in spontaneously recovered sites than in other restored sites, but reference sites had higher scores than all restored sites. Spontaneous sites had higher functional diversity than the other restored sites. Spontaneous and reference sites showed little difference in their functional diversity and in the community-weighted means of relevant traits. Our findings indicate that the establishment limitation effect of the initial application of perennial crops or sowing competitive grasses can last for decades, hindering the recolonization of target species and the recovery of functional diversity; thus, they should be applied in landscapes with high cover of natural habitats only when inhibiting undesirable species is of paramount importance. The similar levels of functional niche saturation in spontaneous and reference sites may also indicate a self-developed establishment-limited situation after 20 years of succession. In combination with this, the lagging recovery of species richness entails lower functional redundancy in spontaneous sites. Our results underline the necessity of postrestorative management methods that reduce establishment limitation and contribute to the recolonization and subsequent coexistence of functionally similar species.

This is particularly true for open-cup forest passerines breeding at high latitudes (> 42 degrees). To better understand the ecology of these species, in this study we described and compared the breeding strategies (i.e., nest dimensions, nest height from the ground, egg laying rhythm, clutch size, length of the developmental periods, breeding phenology, and diversity of nesting substrate) of five passerine birds that inhabit sub-Antarctic ecosystems. Methods: During three breeding seasons (2014-2017), we monitored 103 nests of the five most abundant open-cup forest-dwelling passerines (Phrygilus patagonicus, Anairetes parulus, Turdus falcklandii, Elaenia albiceps, and Zonotrichia capensis) on Navarino Island (55 degrees S), Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, southern Chile. Additionally, we compared the breeding strategies of T. falcklandii to another population breeding at lower latitude (39 degrees S). Results: Most of the species started laying eggs the last week of September; only E. albiceps started 2 months later. During the breeding season of 2016-2017 both E. albiceps and Z. capensis started laying eggs earlier than the previous year. Anairetes parulus and Z. capensis were the most specialized in terms of nesting substrate. Turdus falcklandii had larger clutch sizes and nested closer to the ground on Navarino Island compared to the northern population, which might put this and other ground nesting species of this island at a higher risk of predation by the recently introduced American mink (Neovison vison). Conclusions; Our five study species breed exclusively in open-cups (not in cavities) in sub-Antarctic forests, and some of them built their nests closer to the ground compared to populations breeding at lower latitudes.

Microbial community structure and relationship with physicochemical properties of soil stockpiles in selected South African opencast coal mines	SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article; Early Access						Coal mining; enzyme activities; bacteria; fungi; soil microorganism; stockpiling	GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS ANALYSIS; ORGANIC-MATTER; QUALITY INDICATORS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; PLANT DIVERSITY; POTENTIAL ROLES; PHOMA-HERBARUM; LEAF-BLIGHT; SOY-DADDAWA; 1ST REPORT	At present, there is no comprehensive soil quality assessment practice for soil stockpiles in the South African coal mining industry. Soil microorganisms and enzymes are suitable indicators for soil quality monitoring. Therefore, this study investigated the microbial community and enzyme (beta-glucosidase and urease) activities in soil stockpiles of opencast coal mines in the coal-rich region of South Africa. Soil stockpiles of three opencast coal mines were sampled at depths of 0-20 cm ('topsoil') and >20 cm ('subsoil') across three seasons. Beta-glucosidase and urease activities were mostly higher in soil stockpiles than in unmined soils and were significantly influenced (P < 0.05) by the interaction of site and seasonal factors. However, analyses of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) profiles of partial 16S rRNA gene and internally transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences revealed higher microbial diversity in unmined (reference) soils compared to soil stockpiles across all seasons. Redundancy analysis further revealed that microbial communities of topsoil were not significantly (P > 0.05) influenced by soil properties, whereas microbial communities of subsoils were significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Furthermore, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to genera of known phytobeneficial species such as Azomonas, Aureobasidium, Phialocephala, Phoma and Sordariomycetes were detected in these soils. Overall, results suggest that the microbial community structure and diversity observed in stockpiles is impaired (compared to the unmined site), although variations in the microbial community structure of soil stockpiles across seasons are site-specific. The impaired microbial community of stockpiles may have negative implications on soil biological processes driven by microbes; especially those that are critical for nutrient cycling and ecosystem sustainability. More importantly, such alteration in soil biodiversity may impair post-mining land use capability of stockpile soils.

The Parasitic Wasp, Cotesia congregata (Say), Consists of Two Incipient Species Isolated by Asymmetric Reproductive Incompatibility and Hybrid Inability to Overcome Host Defenses	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						polydnavirus; bracovirus; hybrid dysgenesis; host expression; host-associated differentiation; reproductive isolation; speciation; virulence	FOODPLANT COMPLEX SOURCES; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENT; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; HYMENOPTERA-BRACONIDAE; ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; HEMOCYTE INACTIVATION; SESAMIAE HYMENOPTERA; POLYDNAVIRUS GENE; BUSSEOLA-FUSCA; DYSGENESIS	Parasitic wasps are highly diverse and play a major role in suppression of herbivorous insect pest populations. Several previously identified species of parasitic wasps have been found to be complexes of cryptic species resulting from adaptations to specific hosts or host foodplants. Cotesia congregata (Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), which has long served as a model system for host-parasitoid interactions, can be used for investigating the process of diversification among sympatric populations that differ in host and host foodplant usage. Two incipient species of C. congregata have been identified in the USA mid-Atlantic region, "MsT wasps" originate from Manduca sexta (L.) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on tobacco and "CcC wasps" originate from Ceratomia catalpae (Boisduval) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) on catalpa. Both wasp sources can develop in either host species. Hybrids resulting from MsT male xCcC female crosses are fertile, whereas hybrids from CcC male xMsT female crosses are typically sterile. In this study, we compared relative expression in vivo of seven C. congregata bracovirus (CcBV) genes among MsT and CcC parental and hybrid crosses. Also, we established hybrid crosses between MsT and CcC wasps and four additional host foodplant sources of C. congregata. Patterns of relative expression in vivo of MsT and CcC CcBV genes differed; a few were not expressed in hosts parasitized by CcC wasps. Overall, relative expression of CcBV genes from MsT and CcC wasps did not differ with respect to the host species parasitized. Low or absent expression of CcBV genes was found in hosts parasitized by sterile hybrids. For the most part, the other four host-foodplant wasp sources were reproductively compatible with either MsT or CcC wasps and hybrid crosses with the alternative wasp source were asymmetrically sterile. Crosses involving CcC males or MsT females produced sterile hybrids that lacked mature ovaries. Cumulatively, results indicate that C. congregata is composed of two sympatric incipient species that can utilize multiple host species rather than several host-associated races or cryptic species.

Assessing the Minimum Sampling Effort Required to Reliably Monitor Wild Meat Trade in Urban Markets	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						bushmeat; wildlife trade; sampling effort; accuracy; amazon	BUSHMEAT	The trade of wild meat generates great economic returns for local communities but at a cost of increasing harvest rates of game species. Monitoring wild meat trade in urban markets is a low-cost method that can be employed to assess impacts of hunting on game populations. Nevertheless, wild meat markets are complex systems to monitor since they often vary over time, are illegal in some countries, and often vendors distrust researchers. We investigated the wild meat trade in the Beier) market in Iquitos, Peru, the largest wild meat market in the Amazon, to estimate the minimum sampling effort required to obtain reliable estimates of the amounts and prices of wild meat sold. During two 12-month surveys (Sept. 2006-Aug. 2007, Sept. 2017-Aug. 2018), we conducted a total of 4,524 vendor interviews in 320 sample days. By modeling 10 possible scenarios in which sampling size and amount of meat traded varied, we calculated the accuracy and precision of different survey protocols. We found that in scenarios where the daily amount of wild meat on sale was between 40 and 650 kg, a sampling effort equal to or >2 sampling days per month provided good accuracy (>90%) and precision (>85%). However, in scenarios where wild meat traded was less frequent, or for rarer species, an effort of at least one interview per week is required. Vendor declaration of the daily amounts of meat sold was similar to the quantity on sale (accuracy = 98%), suggesting that sellers are aware of the volume of wild meat brought to market. To accurately monitor the trade of wild meat in urban markets, we recommend a minimum sampling effort, ranging from two interviews per week to two interviews per month, depending on the amount of wild meat traded; in other occasions, a punctual interview on meat sellers' perception may also be useful.

However, reconciling variability of K-C over space and time to produce robust algorithms remains challenging, given the large number of factors that influence K-C. We have previously shown that light appears to be a proximal driver of Kc in several ocean regions and we therefore examined whether and how light similarly regulated K-C variability in the Arctic Ocean, during a summer cruise in 2016. Sampling transited ice-free and ice-covered waters, with temperature, salinity and Chl-a concentrations all higher for the ice-free than ice covered surface waters. Micro- and pico-phytoplankton generally dominated the ice-free and ice-covered waters, respectively. Values of K-C, determined from parallel measures of daily integrated electron transport rates and C-14-uptake, were overall lower for the ice-covered vs. ice-free stations. As in our previous studies, K-C was strongly linearly correlated to daily PAR (r = 0.68, n = 46, p < 0.001) and this relationship could be further improved (r = 0.84, n = 46, p < 0.001) by separating samples into ice-free (micro-phytoplankton dominated) vs. ice-covered (Nano- and Pico-phytoplankton dominated water. We subsequently contrasted the PAR-K-C relationship form the Arctic waters with the previous relationships from the Ariake Bay and East China Sea and revealed that these various PAR-K-C relationships can be systematically explained across regions by phytoplankton community size structures. Specifically, the value of the linear slope describing PAR-K-C decreases as water bodies have an increasing fraction of larger phytoplankton. We propose that this synoptic trend reflects how phytoplankton community structure integrates past and immediate environmental histories and hence may be a better broad-scale predictor of K-C than specific environmental factors such as temperature and nutrients. We provide a novel algorithm that may enable broad-scale retrieval of CO2 uptake from FRRf with knowledge of light and phytoplankton community size information.

Fuel dynamics after reintroduced fire in an old-growth Sierra Nevada mixed- conifer forest	FIRE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Abies concolor; coarse woody debris; FOFEM; fuel consumption; fuel heterogeneity; Pinus lambertiana; Rim Fire; sample size; Smithsonian ForestGEO; Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot	YOSEMITE-NATIONAL-PARK; COARSE WOODY DEBRIS; PRESCRIBED-FIRE; TREE MORTALITY; MOISTURE DYNAMICS; PINE; CALIFORNIA; CONSUMPTION; CALIBRATION; COMBUSTION	Background: Surface fuel loadings are some of the most important factors contributing to fire intensity and fire spread. In old-growth forests where fire has been long excluded, surface fuel loadings can be high and can include woody debris >= 100 cm in diameter. We assessed surface fuel loadings in a long-unburned old-growth mixed-conifer forest in Yosemite National Park, California, USA, and assessed fuel consumption from a management-ignited fire set to control the progression of the 2013 Rim Fire. Specifically, we characterized the distribution and heterogeneity of pre-fire fuel loadings, both along transects and contained in duff mounds around large trees. We compared surface fuel consumption to that predicted by the standard First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM) based on pre-fire fuel loadings and fuel moistures. We also assessed the relationship between tree basal area-calculated for two different spatial neighborhood scales-and pre-fire fuel loadings. Results: Pre-fire total surface fuel loading averaged 192 Mg ha(-1) and was reduced by 79% by the fire to 41 Mg ha(-1) immediately after fire. Most fuel components were reduced by 87% to 90% by the fire, with the exception of coarse woody debris (CWD), which was reduced by 60%. Litter depth in duff mounds were within 1 SD of plot means, but duff biomass for the largest trees (>150 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]) exceeded plot background levels. Overstory basal area generally had significant positive relationships with pre-fire fuel loadings of litter, duff, 1-hour, and 10 hour fuels, but the strength of the relationships differed between overstory components (live, dead, all [live and dead], species), and negative relationships were observed between live Pinus lambertiana Douglas basal area and CWD. FOFEM over-predicted rotten CWD consumption and under-predicted duff consumption. Conclusions: Surface fuel loadings were characterized by heterogeneity and the presence of large pieces. This heterogeneity likely contributed to differential fire behavior at small scales and heterogeneity in the post-fire environment. The reductions in fuel loadings at our research site were in line with ecological restoration objectives; thus, ecologically restorative burning during fire suppression is possible.	[Cansler, C.

More particularly, little attention has been paid to exploring and estimating the relative contribution of multiple acquisition parameters on the model resolution (distance between neighbor vertices), accuracy (closeness to true positions/measures) and precision (variability of positions/measures). On the other hand, some studies used expensive or cumbersome camera systems that can restrict the number of users of this technology for the monitoring of marine habitats. This study aimed at developing a simple and cost-effective protocol able to produce accurate and reproducible high-resolution models. Precisely, the effect of the camera system, flying elevation, camera orientation and number of images on the resolution and accuracy of marine habitat reconstructions was tested through two experiments. A first experiment allowed for testing all combinations of acquisition parameters through the building of 192 models of the same 36 m(2) study site. The flying elevation and camera system strongly affected the model resolution, while the photo density mostly affected bundle adjustment accuracy and total processing time. The camera orientation, in turn, mostly affected the reprojection error. The best combination of parameters was used in a second experiment to assess the accuracy and precision of the resulting reconstructions. The average model resolution was 3.4 mm, and despite a decreasing precision in the positioning of markers with distance to the model center (0.33, 0.27, and 1.2 mm/m Standard Deviation (SD) in X, Y, Z, respectively), the measures were very accurate and precise: 0.08% error +/- 0.06 SD for bar lengths, 0.36% +/- 0.51 SD for a rock model area and 0.92% +/- 0.54 SD for its volume.

Interestingly, the contemporary persistence of anachronistic plant species might be possible thanks to surrogate dispersers or seed dispersal "rescuers". We know very little on how these relevant functional replacements are contributing to the performance of present-day plant-frugivore networks. The dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis L. is a Mediterranean endemism with fleshy fruits and typically dispersed by mammals. Despite its ecological importance and wide distribution in some of the Mediterranean islands, no information exists about its seed dispersal on these depauperated-fauna systems. In this study, we aim at identifying and quantifying the relative importance of introduced frugivores on the island of Mallorca (Balearic Islands), where no native terrestrial mammals exist. Specifically, we assess for the first time the seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) for C. humilis on islands; we evaluate the quantitative component by fecal and regurgitation sampling surveys, and the qualitative component by means of seed germination experiments and seedling growth measures. Introduced goats (Capra hircus L.) and pine martens (Martes martes L.) were the local mammal fruit consumers of C. humilis identified in our study sites. Results suggest that goats are much more important quantitatively than pine martens, due to the high number of fruits handled in each foraging bout and their extremely high abundance on the island. However, pine marten-ingested seeds showed the highest final seedling emergence success and seedling growth, thus its qualitative contribution on C. humilis seed dispersal is higher than that of goats. Overall, SDE was almost 9-fold higher for goats than for pine martens. We conclude that these two non-native mammal species are effective seed dispersers of C. humilis in this and probably other Mediterranean islands, where humans led to the extinction of its native seed dispersers, as it was probably the case of the goat-like Myotragus balearicus in the Balearic Islands.

Here, we analyze concentration patterns, source regions, and seasonal and annual Hg deposition loadings across these five sites in Alaska, along with auxiliary trace metals including Cr, Ni, As, and Pb. We found that Hg concentrations in precipitation at the two northernmost stations, Nome (64.5 degrees N) along the coast of the Bering Sea and the inland site of Gates of the Arctic (66.9 degrees N), were statistically higher (average of 5.3 and 5.5 ng L-1, respectively) than those at the two lowest-latitude sites, Kodiak Island (57.7 degrees N, 2.7 ng degrees N) and Glacier Bay (58.5 degrees N, 2.6 ng L-1) . These differences were largely explained by different precipitation regimes, with higher precipitation at the lower- latitude stations leading to dilution effects. The highest annual Hg deposition loads were consistently observed at Kodiak Island (4.80 +/- 1.04 mu g m(-2)), while the lowest annual deposition was at Gates of the Arctic (2.11 +/- 0.67 mu g m(-2)). Across all stations and collection years, annual precipitation strongly controlled annual Hg deposition, explaining 73% of the variability in observed annual Hg deposition. The data further showed that annual Hg deposition loads across all five Alaska sites were consistently among the lowest in the United States, ranking in the lowest 1% to 5% of over 99 monitoring stations. Detailed back-trajectory analyses showed diffuse source regions for most Hg deposition sites suggesting largely global or regional Hg sources. One notable exception was Nome, where we found increased Hg contributions from the western Pacific Ocean downwind of East Asia. Analysis of other trace elements (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn) from Dutch Harbor, Nome, and Kodiak Island showed generally higher trace metal concentrations at the northern station Nome compared to Kodiak Island further to the south, with concentrations at Dutch Harbor falling in between. Across all sites, we find two distinct groups of correlating elements: Cr and Ni and As and Pb. We attribute these associations to possibly different source origins, whereby sources of Ni and Cr may be derived from crustal (e.g., dust) sources while As and Pb may include long-range transport of anthropogenic pollution. Hg was not strongly associated with either of these two groups.

Social group signatures in hummingbird displays provide evidence of co-occurrence of vocal and visual learning	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						visual displays; geographical variation; vocal learning; hummingbirds; lek mating system; motor theory for vocal learning	HABITAT STRUCTURE; EVOLUTION; SONG; DIALECTS; EXPRESSION; COMMUNICATION; REPERTOIRE; INSIGHTS; CALLS	Vocal learning, in which animals modify their vocalizations based on social experience, has evolved in several lineages of mammals and birds, including humans. Despite much attention, the question of how this key cognitive trait has evolved remains unanswered. The motor theory for the origin of vocal learning posits that neural centres specialized for vocal learning arose from adjacent areas in the brain devoted to general motor learning. One prediction of this hypothesis is that visual displays that rely on complex motor patterns may also be learned in taxa with vocal learning. While learning of both spoken and gestural languages is well documented in humans, the occurrence of learned visual displays has rarely been examined in non-human animals. We tested for geographical variation consistent with learning of visual displays in long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris), a lek-mating hummingbird that, like humans, has both learned vocalizations and elaborate visual displays. We found lek-level signatures in both vocal parameters and visual display features, including display element proportions, sequence syntax and fine-scale parameters of elements. This variation was not associated with genetic differentiation between leks. In the absence of genetic differences, geographical variation in vocal signals at small scales is most parsimoniously attributed to learning, suggesting a significant role of social learning in visual display ontogeny. The co-occurrence of learning in vocal and visual displays would be consistent with a parallel evolution of these two signal modalities in this species.

Swimbladder morphology masks Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish biomass	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						ecosystem; myctophid; mesopelagic fish; acoustics; biomass; Southern Ocean	SCOTIA SEA; MYCTOPHID FISHES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCATTERING; SCALE; PATTERNS; KRILL; COMMUNITIES; TEMPERATURE; SHIFTS	Within the twilight of the oceanic mesopelagic realm, 200-1000 m below sea level, are potentially vast resources of fish. Collectively, these mesopelagic fishes are the most abundant vertebrates on Earth, and this global fish community plays a vital role in the function of oceanic ecosystems. The biomass of these fishes has recently been estimated using acoustic survey methods, which rely on echosounder-generated signals being reflected from gas-filled swimbladders and detected by transducers on vessels. Here, we use X-ray computed tomography scans to demonstrate that several of the most abundant species of mesopelagic fish in the Southern Ocean lack gas-filled swimbladders. We also show using catch data from survey trawls that the fish community switches from fish possessing gas-filled swimbladders to those lacking swimbladders as latitude increases towards the Antarctic continent. Thus, the acoustic surveys that repeatedly show a decrease in mesopelagic fish biomass towards polar environments systematically overlook a large proportion of fish species that dominate polar seas. Importantly, this includes lanternfish species that are key prey items for top predators in the region, including king penguins and elephant seals. This latitudinal community switch, from gas to non-gas dominance, has considerable implications for acoustic biomass estimation, ecosystem modelling and long-term monitoring of species at risk from climate change and potential exploitation.

Bee pathogen transmission dynamics: deposition, persistence and acquisition on flowers	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Bombus impatiens; Crithidia bombi; pollinator health; disease spread; floral morphology	HORIZONTAL TRANSMISSION; GLOBAL TRENDS; DISEASE; POLLINATION; BUMBLEBEES; ABUNDANCE; PARASITES; ABILITY; BOMBI	Infectious diseases are a primary driver of bee decline worldwide, but limited understanding of how pathogens are transmitted hampers effective management. Flowers have been implicated as hubs of bee disease transmission, but we know little about how interspecific floral variation affects transmission dynamics. Using bumblebees (Bombus impatiens), a trypanosomatid pathogen (Crithidia bombi) and three plant species varying in floral morphology, we assessed how host infection and plant species affect pathogen deposition on flowers, and plant species and flower parts impact pathogen survival and acquisition at flowers. We found that host infection with Crithidia increased defaecation rates on flowers, and that bees deposited faeces onto bracts of Lobelia siphilitica and Lythrum salicaria more frequently than onto Monarda didyma bracts. Among flower parts, bracts were associated with the lowest pathogen survival but highest resulting infection intensity in bee hosts. Additionally, we found that Crithidia survival across flower parts was reduced with sun exposure. These results suggest that efficiency of pathogen transmission depends on where deposition occurs and the timing and place of acquisition, which varies among plant species and environmental conditions. This information could be used for development of wildflower mixes that maximize forage while minimizing disease spread.

These structural colours (wing interference patterns: WIPs) may be involved in species recognition and mate choice, yet little is known about the evolutionary processes that shape them. Furthermore, to date investigations of WIPs have not fully considered how they are actually perceived by the viewers' colour vision. Here, we use multispectral digital imaging and a model of Drosophila vision to compare WIPs of male and female Drosophila simulans from replicate populations forced to evolve with or without sexual selection for 68 generations. We show that WIPs modelled in Drosophila vision evolve in response to sexual selection and provide evidence that WIPs correlate with male sexual attractiveness. These findings add a new element to the otherwise well-described Drosophila courtship display and confirm that wing colours evolve through sexual selection.	[Hawkes, M.

Population spatial synchrony enhanced by periodicity and low detuning with environmental forcing	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						population cycles; frequency detuning; Moran effect; phase locking; spatial synchrony; timescale	GYPSY-MOTH LEPIDOPTERA; PHASE-LOCKING; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; TIME-SERIES; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; DEFOLIATION; PREDATORS; OUTBREAKS; CYCLES	Explaining why fluctuations in abundances of spatially disjunct populations often are correlated through time is a major goal of population ecologists. We address two hypotheses receiving little to no testing in wild populations: (i) that population cycling facilitates synchronization given weak coupling among populations, and (ii) that the ability of periodic external forces to synchronize oscillating populations is a function of the mismatch in timescales (detuning) between the force and the population. Here, we apply new analytical methods to field survey data on gypsy moth outbreaks. We report that at timescales associated with gypsy moth outbreaks, spatial synchrony increased with population periodicity via phase locking. The extent to which synchrony in temperature and precipitation influenced population synchrony was associated with the degree of mismatch in dominant timescales of oscillation. Our study provides new empirical methods and rare empirical evidence that population cycling and low detuning can promote population spatial synchrony.

Fine-scale behavioural adjustments of prey on a continuum of risk	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						predator-prey interactions; collective behaviour; risk sensitivity; attack cone; fountain effect	PREDATOR INSPECTION BEHAVIOR; ATTACK CONE AVOIDANCE; CHARACIN FISH; ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR; FACE RECOGNITION; HIDING BEHAVIOR; SELFISH HERD; VISUAL CUES; SHOAL SIZE; DIET CUES	In the wild, prey species often live in the vicinity of predators, rendering the ability to assess risk on a moment-to-moment basis crucial to survival. Visual cues are important as they allow prey to assess predator species, size, proximity and behaviour. However, few studies have explicitly examined prey's ability to assess risk based on predator behaviour and orientation. Using mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, and their predator, jade perch, Scortum barcoo, under controlled conditions, we provide some of the first fine-scale characterization of how prey adapt their behaviour according to their continuous assessment of risk based on both predator behaviour and angular distance to the predator's mouth. When these predators were inactive and posed less of an immediate threat, prey within the attack cone of the predator showed reductions in speed and acceleration characteristic of predator-inspection behaviour. However, when predators became active, prey swam faster with greater acceleration and were closer together within the attack cone of predators. Most importantly, this study provides evidence that prey do not adopt a uniform response to the presence of a predator. Instead, we demonstrate that prey are capable of rapidly and dynamically updating their assessment of risk and showing fine-scale adjustments to their behaviour.	[Kent, Maud I. A.; Ward, Ashley J.

Prior to long-distance flights, red knots (Calidris canutus islandica) reduce gizzard mass while increasing body mass and pectoral muscle mass. Although body mass and pectoral muscle mass are functionally linked via their joint effects on flight performance, gizzard and pectoral muscle mass are thought to be independently regulated. Current hypotheses for observed negative within-individual covariation between gizzard and pectoral muscle mass in free-living knots are based on a common factor (e.g. migration) simultaneously affecting both traits, and/or protein limitation forcing allocation decisions. We used diet manipulations to generate within-individual variation in gizzard mass and test for independence between gizzard and pectoral muscle mass within individuals outside the period of migration and under conditions of high protein availability. Contrary to our prediction, we observed a negative within-individual covariation between gizzard and pectoral muscle mass. We discuss this result as a potential outcome of an evolved mechanism underlying body remodelling associated with migration. Although our proposed mechanism requires empirical testing, this study echoes earlier calls for greater integration of studies of function and mechanism, and in particular, the need for more explicit consideration of the evolution of mechanisms underlying phenotypic design.

One such mechanism is categorical perception, in which (1) continuously varying stimuli are labelled as belonging to a discrete number of categories and (2) there is enhanced discrimination between stimuli from different categories as compared with equally different stimuli from within the same category. We have shown previously that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) categorically perceive colours along an orange-red continuum that aligns with the carotenoid-based coloration of male beaks, a trait that serves as an assessment signal in female mate choice. Here, we demonstrate that categorical perception occurs along a blue-green continuum as well, suggesting that categorical colour perception may be a general feature of zebra finch vision. Although we identified two categories in both the blue-green and the orange-red ranges, we also found that individuals could better differentiate colours from within the same category in the blue-green as compared with the orange-red range, indicative of less clear categorization in the blue-green range. We discuss reasons why categorical perception may vary across the visible spectrum, including the possibility that such differences are linked to the behavioural or ecological function of different colour ranges.

Post-collection changes by evaporation or sublimation can be severe, and may be minimized, but not eliminated, by emptying collection gauges immediately after snowfall. Snow gauge undercatch caused two main effects: a small direct effect caused by preferential separation of snow particles during snowfall, and a much larger effect on the measured stable isotopic compositions of average annual precipitation as a result of under representation of winter precipitation. Despite these effects, however, we found little change to calculated local meteoric water lines (LMWL) for Saskatoon, SK, Canada. A comprehensive 27-year LMWL for Saskatoon which incorporates these effects can be described by delta H-2 = 7.69 +/- 0.096 x delta O-18 - 2.22 +/- 1.72 (r(2) = 0.97, n = 208).

In the Australian environment, however, freshwater lakes are limited, restricting the region for which depositional archives of Hg can be derived. In this study we show that dendrochemistry can provide a record of atmospheric concentrations at very high resolution. We measured Hg concentrations in growth rings of two tree species from a site in western in Tasmania-Huon Pine (Lagarostrobus franklinii) and Celery Top Pine (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius). This region has been heavily mined over the past 150 years. Although much previous work has linked atmospheric Hg to gold mining, the evidence in this study suggests that copper smelters in Queenstown and Zeehan, not gold mining activities, were the main sources of Hg emissions to the atmosphere in this location. Huon Pine had significantly higher background Hg concentrations ((x) over bar = 5.62 ng/g) than Celery Top Pine ((x) over bar = 2.95 ng/g). No significant increase in Hg concentration during the peak copper smelting phase (1896 to 1935) was observed in Celery Top Pine, while a significant 1.4 fold-increase was observed in Huon Pine. Our results show that of species examined across the globe, Huon Pine is one of the most efficient bioaccumulators of Hg, making it a good proxy for tracking historical Hg emissions in western Tasmania. This ability to measure Hg in the environment is essential if Australia ratifies the Minamata Convention.

We enrolled 1081 men whose partners underwent assisted reproductive technology procedures in Wuhan, China in 2014-2015, and examined their semen quality. Daily average concentrations of PM2.5 constituents including 10 metals/metalloid elements and 4 water-soluble ions were continuously determined for 1 week per month at 2 fixed monitoring stations. Linear mixed models were used to examine the associations of exposures to PM2.5 and its constituents with semen quality. Each interquartile range (36.5 mu g/m(3)) increase in PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with 8.5% (95% CI: 2.3%, 14.4%) and 8.1% (95% CI: 0.7%, 15.0%) decrease in sperm concentration and total sperm number, respectively. Antimony, cadmium, lead, manganese, and nickel exposures were significantly associated with decreased sperm concentration, whereas manganese exposure was also significantly associated with decreased total motility. Nonsmokers were more susceptible to PM2.5 constituent exposures, especially for antimony and cadmium (all P for effect modification <0.05). These findings suggest that PM2.5 and certain constituents may adversely affect semen quality, especially sperm concentration, and provide new evidence to formulate pollution abatement strategies for male reproductive health.

Oxidative stress is often claimed as a main proximate factor contributing to telomere attrition, although the importance of this factor in vivo has recently been challenged. Early development represents an ideal scenario to address this hypothesis because it is characterized by the highest rates of telomere attrition of the life and by an arguably high susceptibility to oxidative stress. We tested the effect of oxidative stress on telomere dynamics during early development by exposing pied flycatcher nestlings (Ficedula hypoleuca) to either an oxidative challenge (diquat injections), an antioxidant (vitamin E) or control treatments (PBS injections and supplementation with vehicle substance). We found no effects of treatments on average telomere change during the nestling period. However, vitamin E supplementation, which increased growth, removed the association between initial telomere length and telomere attrition. Diquat-treated nestlings, by contrast, showed no differences in growth or telomere dynamics with respect to controls. These results do not support the hypothesis that oxidative stress is the main direct mechanism explaining telomere attrition in vivo, and highlight the importance of micronutrient intake during early development on telomere dynamics. Studies addressing alternative action pathways of vitamins on growth and telomere dynamics, perhaps via restoration mechanisms, would provide important insights on the proximate factors affecting telomere attrition during this critical phase of life.

In sessile foundation fauna that reproduce asexually via fragmentation of existing colonies, the number of colonies does not reflect the number of genets and thus can obscure genotypic diversity. Colonies that are the product of fragmentation are not visually distinguishable from colonies that stem from sexual recruits. For this reason, molecular markers are necessary to assess genotypic variation and population structure in clonal organisms such as reef-building corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. For the rare Caribbean pillar coral, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and its endosymbiotic dinoflagellate, Breviolum dendrogyrum, we use de novo microsatellite markers to infer past demographic changes, describe modern population structure, and quantify the frequency of asexual reproduction. Our analyses show that D. cylindrus comprises three distinct populations across the Greater Caribbean whereas the symbiont could be differentiated into four populations, indicating barriers to gene flow differ between host and symbiont. In Florida, host and symbiont populations reproduced mainly asexually, yielding lower genotypic diversity than predicted from census size. When multiple coral ramets were present, they often associated with the same clonal strain of B. dendrogyrum, pointing to the high fidelity of this relationship. Models of past demographic events revealed no evidence for historical changes in population sizes, consistent with the paleontological record of D. cylindrus indicating it has been rare for hundreds of thousands of years. The most recent global thermal stress event likely triggered a severe disease outbreak among D. cylindrus in Florida, resulting in a severe population decline. Projections indicate a high likelihood that this species will become extinct in the Northern Greater Caribbean within a few decades.

Recent surveys in Bermuda have revealed dense aggregations of lionfish on mesophotic reefs (60 m depth), yet these densities are not pervasive across reefs at this depth. Using diver-led visual surveys of mesophotic reef sites, this study examines how variations in potential ecological drivers may affect lionfish distribution. Significant correlations of lionfish densities were found with prey fish density and prey fish biomass, where sites with higher abundances of prey fishes have greater densities of lionfish. Furthermore, higher densities of lionfish also correlated significantly with higher juvenile Paranthias furcifer biomass, a preferred prey type for lionfish. Prey fish diversity, on the other hand, was not related to lionfish density, nor did prey fish community composition differ in a way that reflected lionfish distributions. The influence of seawater temperature was found to have the strongest effect on lionfish distribution, where higher lionfish densities were found at sites with lower bottom temperature. However, temperature co-varied with prey fish density, prey fish biomass, and P. furcifer biomass, implying that physical parameters of the environment (i.e., temperature) likely influence ecological parameters (i.e., prey fish abundance), contributing to the structuring of lionfish distributions. We suggest, therefore, that cold-water upwelling currents may be fueling the food chain in certain locations, resulting in high abundances of prey fishes and thus lionfish. Understanding the factors that influence lionfish distributions will ultimately increase the efficacy of management strategies, which, as the data presented here suggest, must incorporate mesophotic lionfish populations.

Trophic Interactions, Management Trade-Offs and Climate Change: The Need for Adaptive Thresholds to Operationalize Ecosystem Indicators	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						zooplankton; forage fish; networks; coupled Generalized Additive Models; Baltic Sea; Marine Strategy Framework Directive	FOOD-WEB INDICATORS; MARINE ECOSYSTEM; TOP-DOWN; CASCADES; CONSERVATION; FRAMEWORK; SHIFTS	Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is commonly applied to achieve sustainable use of marine resources. For EBM, regular ecosystem-wide assessments of changes in environmental or ecological status are essential components, as well as assessments of the effects of management measures. Assessments are typically carried out using indicators. A major challenge for the usage of indicators in EBM is trophic interactions as these may influence indicator responses. Trophic interactions can also shape trade-offs between management targets, because they modify and mediate the effects of pressures on ecosystems. Characterization of such interactions is in turn a challenge when testing the usability of indicators. Climate variability and climate change may also impact indicators directly, as well as indirectly through trophic interactions. Together, these effects may alter interpretation of indicators in assessments and evaluation of management measures. We developed indicator networks - statistical models of coupled indicators - to identify links representing trophic interactions between proposed food-web indicators, under multiple anthropogenic pressures and climate variables, using two basins in the Baltic Sea as a case study. We used the networks to simulate future indicator responses under different fishing, eutrophication and climate change scenarios. Responsiveness to fishing and eutrophication differed between indicators and across basins. Almost all indicators were highly dependent on climatic conditions, and differences in indicator trajectories > 10% were found only in comparisons of future climates. In some cases, effects of nutrient load and climate scenarios counteracted each other, altering how management measures manifested in the indicators. Incorporating climate change, or other regionally non-manageable drivers, is thus necessary for an accurate interpretation of indicators and thereby of EBM measure effects. Quantification of linkages between indicators across trophic levels is similarly a prerequisite for tracking effects propagating through the food web, and, consequently, for indicator interpretation. Developing meaningful indicators under climate change calls for iterative indicator validations, accounting for natural processes such as trophic interactions and for trade-offs between management objectives, to enable learning as well as setting target levels or thresholds triggering actions in an adaptive manner. Such flexible strategies make a set of indicators operational over the long-term and facilitate success of EBM.

Studies were conducted to estimate the possibility of using quick and non- destructive methods to investigate Chenopodium album L. and Abutilon theophrasti Medik. response to mesotrione. The studies were conducted in a controlled environment to determine the response of C. album and A. theophrasti to mesotrione using dose-response curves created based on plant dry weight, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and chlorophyll content. The obtained effective dose values showed that the studied weeds were susceptible to reduced doses of mesotrione. ED95 values estimated for both species for dry weight and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were lower than the recommended dose rate (120 g a.i. ha(-1)), with less than 85 g a.i. ha(-1) needed to achieve a reduction of 95%, compared with untreated plants, while ED95 value (A. theophrasti: 182 g a.i. ha(-1) and C. album: 180 g a.i. ha(-1)) for chlorophyll content for both species was above the recommended dose rates. Consequently, dry weight and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are suitable for estimating the plant response to mesotrione, while chlorophyll content is not.

In these soils, the residual effects can represent a neglected phenomenon, since silvicultural management experiences a longer crop rotation cycle compared to most common agricultural cycles. Consequently, under forestry management, sewage sludge applications can represent an event occurring just once over cycles of several years. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of residual sewage sludge application in infertile tropical soils under Eucalyptus plantations in terms of both the main chemical features (pH, soil organic matter, N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, and cation-exchange capacity) and the potentially toxic elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) concentrations/behaviors of soil. Residual effects were evaluated in four areas (Sao Paulo State, Brazil) after 10.0, 12.2, 12.4, and 17.2 years from the first and only application, respectively. Differences in terms of treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance: correlations and similarity analyzed by principal component and cluster analysis, respectively. The results showed that soil organic matter, main macronutrients (N and P), and cation-exchange capacity contents were generally higher in sewage sludge-treated soils while potentially toxic element contents tended to increase at increasing sewage sludge doses. In most of the investigated treatments, the potentially toxic element concentrations were usually below both the soil natural background concentrations and quality reference values. Principal component and cluster analysis revealed that differences among areas were primary due to differences in applied sewage sludge type and amount. The effects of residual sewage sludge application on soil, in terms of both the pros and cons, can be detected even many years after the first and only application. Studies on the long-term effects of sewage sludge should be mandatory for both monitoring the pedoenvironment and for guiding policymakers and producers on the best practices for their reuse and management.

This study aimed to quantify the attributable fractions of injury claims and subsequent insurance payouts using data from work-related injury insurance system in Guangzhou, China. Methods: Individual workers' injury claims data were collected for the period of 2011-2012, including demographic characteristics and work-related information. Daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT, degrees C) was calculated from meteorological data. To examine the association between WBGT index and work-related injury, we fit a quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model. Then we calculated the numbers of injury claims and costs of insurance compensations attributable to clays with WBGT above the heat stress limit according to the national occupational health standards. Results: There were 9550 work-related injury claims, resulting in an insurance payout of 282.3 million Chinese Yuan. The risks of injury claims increased with rising WBGT. 43% (95% eCI: 2.9%-6.9%) of work-related injuries and 4.1% (95% eCI: 0.2%-7.7%) of work-related injury insurance payouts were attributed to heat exposure for WBGT threshold above the heat stress limit. Male workers, those in small enterprises and with low educational attainment were especially sensitive to the effects of heat exposure. Conclusions: Heat stress can contribute to higher risk of work-related injury and substantial economic costs. Quantified the impacts of injuries and related economic costs should be considered to develop targeted preventive measures in the context of climate change. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The launch of the 4 per 1000 initiative has resulted in an increased interest in developing methods to quantity the additional SOC that can be stored in soil under different management options. In this work, we have made a first attempt to estimate SOC storage potential of arable soils using a data driven approach based on the French National Soil Monitoring Network. The data-driven approach was used to determine the maximum SOC stocks of arable soils for France. We first defined different carbon-landscape zones (CLZs) using clustering analysis. We then computed estimates of the highest possible values using percentile of 0.8, 0.85, 0.9 and 0.95 of the measured SOC stocks within these Clis. The SOC storage potential was calculated as the difference between the maximum SOC stocks and current SOC stocks for topsoil and subsoil. The percentile used to determine highest possible SOC had a large influence on the estimates of French national SOC storage potential. When the percentile increased from 0.8 to 0.95, the national SOC storage potential increased by two to three-fold, from 336 to 1020 Mt for topsoil and from 165 to 433 Mt for subsoil, suggesting a high sensitivity of this approach to the selected percentile. Nevertheless, we argue that this approach can offer advantages from an operational point of view, as it enables to set targets of SOC storage taking into account both policy makers' and farmers' considerations about their feasibility. Robustness of the estimates should be further assessed using complementary approaches such as mechanistic modelling. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigated the prevalence of AR exposure in seven predator species in the rapidly developing Greater Cape Town region of South Africa - a mosaic of natural, urban, and agricultural areas within a global biodiversity hotspot. We focused sampling on caracals (Caracal caracal, n = 28) as part of a larger caracal ecology study, but also opportunistically sampled Cape Clawless otters (Aonyx capensis, n = 9), large spotted genets (Genetta tigrina, n = 4), honey badger (Mellivora capensis, n = 1), water mongoose (Atilax paludinosus, n = 1), small gray mongoose (Galerella pulverulenta, n = 1), and Cape Eagle owl (Bubo capensis, n 1). We tested livers from all species, and blood from ten caracals, for eight AR compounds to assess prevalence and amount of exposure for each compound. We used generalized linear models to test spatial, demographic, and seasonal risk factors for ten measures of AR exposure in caracals. We detected at least one of the four most toxic AR compounds in six species. Exposure was high for caracals (92%) and all species combined (81%). For caracals, proximity to vineyards was the most important AR exposure risk factor. Vineyards in Cape Town do not use ARs to protect their vines but do host commercial hospitality structures where ARs are used. Vineyards may thus link caracals that forage within vineyards to the rat poisons used in and around their commercial structures. Residue levels were unexpected in large-spotted genets and Cape Clawless otters, suggesting invertebrate vectors. ARs may present a cryptic threat to populations already vulnerable to increasing habitat loss, vehicle collisions, poachers and fire. Targeted mitigation should include a mix of environmentally responsible policies that reduce AR use, particularly in areas near wildlife habitat. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Citizens are especially vulnerable to climate change, because heat island and impervious exacerbates extreme climate events. Urban trees are important tools for mitigation and adaptation of cities to climate change because they provide ecosystem services that increase while trees grow. Nonetheless, the growth of trees may be affected by the harsher conditions found in the urban environment. We assessed the impact of air pollution and climate on the spatial/temporal variability of tree growth in Sao Paulo, Brazil, one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world. For this purpose, we sampled 41 trees of the Tipuana tipu species in a region that includes industrial areas. We built a tree-ring chronology using standard dendrochronological methods. Spatial analyses show that trees grow faster in the warmer parts of the city and under higher concentrations of airborne P, whereas growth is reduced under higher concentrations of Al, Ba, Zn. Particulate matter (PM10) from the industrial cluster also reduce average growth rate of trees, up to 37% in all diameter classes. Similar results were obtained via temporal analyses, suggesting that the annual growth rate is positively associated with temperature, which explain 16% of interannual growth variability. Precipitation, on the other hand, has no association with tree growth. The average concentration of PM10 explains 41% of interannual growth variability, and higher concentrations during the driest months reduce growth rate. Despite heat island effect and water limitation in the soil of the city, this species takes advantage of warmer conditions and it is not limited by water availability as measured by precipitation. On the other hand, air pollution directly impacts the growth of these trees being a major limiting growth factor. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Though previous epidemiological studies of RESD and CCD generally applied a linear relationship of the acute PM effects, it is unclear whether this linear exposure-response relationship holds in high pollution area. In this study, a Lime-series study during 2013 through 2016 was conducted to investigate 245,442 and 430,486 hospital visits for RESD and CCD respectively from Nanjing city, China. A combination of logistic generalized additive model (GAM) was used to evaluate the exposure-response associations. The results disclosed that a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration on the current day of exposure (lag 0) was associated with 036% (95% CI: -0.02%-0.73%) and 033% (0.07%-0.60%) increase in RESD; and 042% (0.00%-0.85%) and 0.37% (0.08%-0.67%) increase in CCD. The exposure-response association was approximately linear within 0-150 mu g/m(3) of PM concentration and non-linear across the full range of exposures. The effects of PM on RESD and CCD were sensitive to additional adjustment for co-pollutants, indicating the health effects of air pollution mixture in Nanjing city. There was no evidence of potential effect modification of RESD and CCD by season (cold and warm), age (5-64, 65-74, >= 75 years) and sex (male and female) groups. Though not statistically significant, the estimated risks in warm season were higher than those in cold season, suggesting potential synergistic effects of ambient PM pollution and temperature on triggering RESD and CCD.

However, performance of the method at a field scale remains unknown. This study compared the method in two case studies of soil Pb pollution with two other commonly used methods for outlier identification, including box-plot and standardized kriging prediction error (SKPE), and with two classical geostatistical approaches for spatial prediction, including kriging with and without outliers. One case was based on data with 359 samples collected in an area of 14.5 km(2) in Jura, Swiss. The other was based on data with 242 samples collected in an area of 2.8 km(2) in Zhuzhou, China. Results showed that the method identified both global and local outliers, while the method did not identify all global outliers based on the box-plot. For the Jura data which were more seriously affected by outliers than the Zhuzhou data, the method identified 49 outliers, sharing 39 with SKPE which identified a total of 46 outliers. For the Zhuzhou data, the method found just three outliers, much fewer than the 12 outliers identified by SKPE. In the case of Jura, kriging prediction with outliers winsorizecl by the method was negligibly more accurate than prediction without outliers identified by SKPE, e.g., 0.15% in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). However, in the case of Zhuzhou, the former prediction was slightly less accurate than the latter, e.g., 2.39% in terms of RMSE. This study suggested that the method performed well for data which were seriously affected by outliers, but not so well for data slightly affected by outliers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, limited effort has been conducted to develop spatiotemporal models aiming at improving pre-positioning and deployment of fire-fighting brigades on the first dispatch. To this end, we calibrated a model to assess the probability of containment of fire by IA in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). The model was trained using machine learning algorithms from georeferenced historical fire ignition locations, fire response and weather conditions. Our results indicated that early detection, ground accessibility, and aerial support governed the broad spatial pattern of fire containment probability, with strong gradients that ranged from lowest chances of containment in northwestern mountains to highest in the coastal belt. In turn, weather conditions and fire simultaneity were crucial to explain the differences during wildfire season. We found that fires igniting above the 85th percentile of temperature and wind speed, during simultaneous fire episodes (n > 10), and 12.5 km away from the nearest fire station will probably escape IA, and grow into large events. These hazardous fire danger conditions were met 13 days per year on average during the period 1998-2015, with 5 fire simultaneous episodes escaping IA that burned 1546 ha in total. Results were provided as a set of high-resolution raster grids (100 m), which replicated the most typical weather and fire occurrence scenarios that first responders arc likely to face during the wildfire season. This study reveals existing limitations in the dominant fire exclusion policy of Mediterranean areas and advocates for a comprehensive long-term wildfire management solution. Our model may help inform science-based decision-making on IA and general fire response planning in the study area. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wetland drying linked to variations in snowmelt runoff across Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Wetlands; Water balance; Monitoring; Runoff; National parks; Climate	CLIMATE-CHANGE; LONG-TERM; SURFACE-WATER; MIXED-MODEL; VULNERABILITY; TRENDS; STATE; RESTORATION; IMPACTS; DROUGHT	In In Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks wetlands offer critical habitat and play a key role in supporting biological diversity. The shallow depths and small size of many palustrine wetlands in these protected areas and elsewhere make them vulnerable to changes in climate compared with larger and deeper aquatic habitats. Here, we use a simple water balance model to generate estimates of biophysical drivers of wetland change. We then examine the relationship between wetland inundation status and four principal drivers (i.e., temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff) spanning varying meteorological conditions over an 8-year time series from Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. We found that models containing snowmelt runoff outperformed models with other meteorological drivers and determined that a higher percentage of surveyed wetlands were dry in years characterized by lower runoff. Our work further shows that wetland drying was widespread across both parks, but sub-regional variations were best described at the hydrologic subbasin-level. Documenting the varying responses of wetlands to meteorological drivers is a necessary first step to identifying which subbasins are most sensitive to recent climatic change and contemplating how future change may alter the distribution of wetlands and their dependent taxa.

Such wide variation poses challenges when checking policy objectives compliance and for setting coherent management goals across European waters. To help MS achieve good ecological status (GES) in surface waters, different statistical approaches have been proposed in a Best Practice Guide (BPG; CIS Nutrients Standards Guidance) for establishing suitable nutrient boundaries. Here we used the intercalibrated results from the WFD for the biological quality element phytoplankton to test the applicability of this BPG for deriving nutrient boundaries in coastal and transitional waters. Overall, the statistical approaches proved adequate for coastal lagoons, but are not always robust to allow deriving nutrient boundaries in other water categories such as estuaries, in transitional waters, or some coastal water types. The datasets available for analysis provided good examples of the most common problems that might be encountered in these water categories. Similar issues have been found in freshwater environments, for which solutions are proposed in the BPG and which are demonstrated here for coastal and transitional waters. The different approaches available and problems identified can be useful for supporting the derivation of nutrient concentrations boundaries both for the Water and the MSFDs implementation.

From 2006-2017 we monitored monarchs at >400 sites throughout Iowa to link site occupancy and colonization/extinction dynamics to the presence of milkweed, site-specific habitat metrics, and landscape context at differing spatial scales. We used a robust design occupancy model in Program MARK and a hierarchical model selection approach to estimate site occupancy, extinction and colonization probabilities, and detection probability. Occupancy models revealed that monarchs responded differently to landscape features, environmental conditions, and local habitat conditions for site occupancy, extinction, and colonization probabilities. For site occupancy, the mean patch size of grassland at the 1-km spatial scale had a positive effect (beta(GrassPS1K) = 0.94, SE = 0.54) while the percent of the landscape in woodland at the 200-m spatial scale had a negative effect (beta(WoodPL200) = -1.68, SE = 0.34). For extinction, there were additive effects of the percent of the landscape in woodland at the 100-m spatial scale (beta(WoodPLAND100) = 2.70, SE = 0.63), the interspersion of grassland at the 1-km spatial scale (beta(GrassIJI1K) = -2.30, SE = 0.63), and litter depth (beta(Litter) = 0.46, SE = 0.13). Finally, there were negative effects of the percent of the landscape in woodland at the 200-m spatial scale (beta(WoodPLAND200) = -4.67, SE = 1.37) and the interspersion of grassland at the 100-m spatial scale (beta(GrassPS1K) = -2.02, SE = 0.70) on colonization probability. Detection probability was affected by the additive effects of canopy cover and monarch density; no other detection model was competitive. In the top model there was a positive effect of monarch density (beta(Density) = 0.28, SE = 0.05) and a negative effect of canopy cover (beta(Canopy) = -0.18, SE = 0.03) on detection probability. In Iowa, monarchs are widespread on conservation lands where they avoid sites with lots of canopy cover. Colonization and extinction processes are influenced by an interplay of landscape attributes across multiple spatial scales and site habitat attributes. Our study provides the first comprehensive insight into monarch use of conservation lands in Iowa, and predicted responses to important covariates may be useful for future conservation efforts.

Error was determined by comparison to gravimetric measurements and direct measurement of leakage. One out of three types of septa leaked above 1 bar (gauge) headspace pressure, losing 25 to 30% of biogas produced. But manometric BMP showed a negative bias even in the absence of leakage. Maximum error was 24% from 160 mL bottles with 40 mL of headspace (headspace fraction of 0.25). Error decreased with increasing headspace fraction, and was small (3%) for a headspace fraction of 0.75, showing that a high headspace volume is the best approach for minimizing error. Relative error in CH4 production measurement increased with headspace pressure as well, but controlling pressure alone is not sufficient for minimizing error. Calculations showed that observed error may be due to volatilization of CH4 during venting as well as inaccurate headspace volume determination, although these sources do not completely explain the magnitude of error observed. Measurement of biogas composition before and after venting showed that CO2 volatilization can occur, but is probably a minor source of error. Calculations showed that error in estimation of ambient pressure or headspace temperature had only minor effects (<3%). Gravimetric measurements, which were unaffected by leakage and insensitive to error in estimation of headspace pressure, temperature or volume, can provide a simple check on manometric results, or a complete replacement.

High primary production followed by rapid heterotrophic utilization of organic matter supports the formation of one of the most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the world ocean, where dissolved oxygen (O-2) concentrations reach less than 1 mu mol kg(-1). The high productivity leads to an accumulation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the surface layers that may serve as a substrate for heterotrophic respiration. However, the importance of DOM utilization for O-2 respiration in the Peruvian upwelling system in general and for shaping the upper oxycline in particular remains unclear so far. This study reports the first estimates of diapycnal fluxes and supply of O-2, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved hydrolysable amino acids (DHAA) and dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) for the ETSP off Peru. Diapycnal flux and supply estimates were obtained by combining measured vertical diffusivities and solute concentration gradients. They were analysed together with the molecular composition of DCCHO and DHAA to infer the transport of labile DOM into the upper OMZ and the potential role of DOM utilization for the attenuation of the diapycnal O-2 flux that ventilates the OMZ. The observed diapycnal O-2 flux (50 mmolO(2) m(-2) d(-1) at maximum) was limited to the upper 80 m of the water column; the O-2 supply of similar to 1 mu mol kg(-1) d(-1) was comparable to previously published O-2 consumption rates for the North and South Pacific OMZs. The diapycnal DOM flux (31 mmol Cm-2 d(-1) at maximum) was limited to similar to 30m water depth, suggesting that the labile DOM is extensively consumed within the upper part of the shallow oxycline off Peru. The analyses of DCCHO and DHAA composition support this finding, suggesting that DOM undergoes comprehensive remineralization within the upper part of the oxycline, as the DOM within the core of the OMZ was found to be largely altered. Estimated by a simple equation for carbon combustion, aerobic respiration of DCCHO and DHAA, supplied by diapycnal mixing (0.46 mu mol kg(-1) d(-1) at maximum), could account for up to 38% of the diapycnal O-2 supply in the upper oxycline, which suggests that DOM utilization plays a significant role for shaping the upper oxycline in the ETSP.

LEPIDOPTERA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FINE-SCALE; TEMPERATURE; POPULATION; NICHE; CONSERVATION; DECLINES; MAXENT	Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are widespread in North America but have experienced large rangewide declines. Causes of recent declines likely involve multiple biotic and abiotic stressors including climate change and loss and degradation of native milkweed (Asclepius spp.), monarchs' obligate larval host plant. Recent broad-scale modeling efforts suggest milkweed and monarch distributions in the eastern United States will expand northward during summer months while fine-scale modeling of western population overwintering sites in California indicate shifts inland and upward in elevation. However, species' response to climate measures varies at sub-regional scales across its range and both the impacts of climate change and potential adaptation measures may be sensitive to the spatial scale of climate data used, particularly in areas of complex topography. Here, we develop fine-scale models of monarch breeding habitat and milkweed distributions in Idaho, an area at the northern extent of the monarch breeding range in North America and important in western overwintering population recruitment. Our models accurately predict current distributions for showy milkweed (A. speciosa), swamp milkweed (A. incarnate), and monarch with AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) = 0.899, 0.981, and 0.929, respectively. Topographic, geographic, edaphic, and climatic factors all play important roles in determining milkweed and, thus, monarch distributions. In particular, our results suggest that at sub-regional and fine-scales, non-climatic factors such as soil depth, distance to water, and elevation contribute significantly. We further assess changes in potential habitat across Idaho under mid-21st century climate change scenarios and potential management implications of these changing distributions. Models project slight decreases (-1,318 km(2)) in potential suitable habitat for showy milkweed and significant increases (+5,830 km(2)) for swamp milkweed. Projected amounts of suitable habitat for monarch are likely to remain roughly stable with expansion nearly equal to contraction under a moderate scenario and slightly greater when under the more severe scenario. Protected areas encompass 8% of current suitable habitat for showy milkweed, 11% for swamp milkweed, and 9% for monarch. Our study shows that suitable habitat for monarchs and/or milkweeds will likely continue to be found in managed areas traditionally seen as priority habitats in Idaho through mid-century.

Adequate-species selection for ecological recovery is of great importance. In this study, field investigations along the disturbance gradients (marginal area, restoration area, and control area) in a manganese ore deposit of Guangxi in Southern China were carried out. We screened the adequate species from two aspects. In the marginal area, the result of corrected Akaike information criterion revealed that Mn was the most important soil parameter affecting vegetation diversity. Cyclosorus parasiticus (L.) Farwell., Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv., Mimosa sepiaria Benth., and Bidens pilosa L. were selected for their abilities to adapt to high-Mn-content soils. In the restoration area and control area, we combined important values and field performance (Dickson quality index, DQI) of species to select adequate species. Miscanthus sinensis Anderss. and Arundinella hirta (Thunb.) Tanaka were selected using the similar DQI (p > 0.05) in both areas. In summary, C. parasiticus (L.) Farwell., S. viridis (L.) Beauv., M. sinensis Anderss., and A. hirta (Thunb.) Tanaka were selected as adequate species because of their high potential to adapt to these disturbed sites. Our results and methodology could have a demonstrating effect for restoration programmes in manganese ore mining areas of China.

Dynamics of crAssphage as a human source tracking marker in potentially faecally polluted environments	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						crAssphage; Microbial source tracking; Faecal pollution; Environmental dynamics; Faecal indicators	BACTEROIDES-FRAGILIS BACTERIOPHAGES; TIME PCR ASSAY; WASTE-WATER; RNA BACTERIOPHAGES; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; GENETIC-MARKERS; QUANTITATIVE DETECTION; HOST STRAINS; INDICATORS; BACTERIA	Recent studies have shown that crAssphage is abundant in human faecal samples worldwide. It has thus been postulated as a potential microbial source tracking (MST) marker to detect human faecal pollution in water. However, an effective implementation of crAssphage in water management strategies will depend on an understanding of its environmental dynamics. In this work, the abundance and temporal distribution of crAssphage was analysed in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants using different sewage treatments, and in two rivers (water and sediments) that differ in pollution impact and flow regime. Additionally, the influence of environmental conditions (temperature and rainfall) on the removal of the marker was studied along a river section, and natural inactivation was assessed by a mesocosms approach. Molecular and culture-based tools were used to compare crAssphage abundance and dynamics with those of bacteria and bacteriophages currently applied as global indicators (E. coli, somatic coliphages, Bacteroides GA17 bacteriophages, and the human-associated MST markers HF183 and HMBif). CrAssphage concentrations in sewage effluent and river samples were similar to those of HF183 and HMBif and higher than other general and/or culture-based indicators (by 2-3 orders of magnitude). Measurement of crAssphage abundance revealed no temporal variability in the effluent, although rainfall events affected the dynamics, possibly through the mobilisation of sediments, where the marker was detected in high concentrations, and an increase in diffuse and point pollution. Another factor affecting crAssphage inactivation was temperature. Its persistence was longer compared with other bacterial markers analysed by qPCR but lower than culturable markers. The results of this study support the use of crAssphage as a human source tracking marker of faecal pollution in water, since it has similar abundances to other molecular human MST markers, yet with a longer persistence in the environment. Nevertheless, its use in combination with infectious bacteriophages is probably advisable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Balleste, E.; Pascual-Benito, M.; Martin-Diaz, J.; Blanch, A.

The Iberian Peninsula is not an exception to that rule, and therefore, farmers, researchers, and governments seek alternative tools to minimize the loss of biodiversity and wildfire risks. Extensive livestock including beef cattle is currently promoted as a suitable management tool by European agro-environmental policies yet pieces of evidence exist regarding the reciprocal effects between cows and Mediterranean woody vegetation. In this work, we performed a field manipulation to evaluate whether free-ranging beef cattle without supplementary feeding, at high density (2 livestock units (LU)/ha) for a short period of time i.e. "boom and bust grazing" management, are able to adapt their grazing preferences to the Mediterranean woody vegetation without health impairment, and prevent from bush encroachment and wildfires. For our purposes, a native herd of 14 adult cows was kept captive without supplementary feeding in a 14 ha enclosure covered by Mediterranean vegetation for two months (April-June 2016). Plant and cattle fecal and blood samples were collected to assess diet composition (plant cuticle microhistological analysis), fecal nitrogen and protein contents of consumed plants, and the nutritional status (non-esterified fatty acids) of cattle. Our results showed that cattle adapted their feeding habits toward a more woody diet including potentially flammable taxa but with some detrimental effects on health status. Hence, cattle cannot control woody vegetation for long periods of time without supplementary feeding. Further research should be oriented to explore other alternative approaches to minimize the health impairment of cattle used for control flammable vegetation in Mediterranean regions.

The application of a handheld mid-infrared spectrometry for rapid measurement of oil contamination in agricultural sites	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy; Petroleum-hydrocarbon contamination; Random forest; Partial least squares regression	TOTAL PETROLEUM-HYDROCARBONS; DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; SOIL; PREDICTION; PERFORMANCE; REGRESSION; RISK; IDENTIFICATION	Rapid analysis of oil-contaminated soils is important to facilitate risk assessment and remediation decision-making process. This study reports on the potential of a handheld mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometer for the prediction of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), including aliphatic (alkanes) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in limited number of fresh soil samples. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) modelling techniques were compared for the prediction of alkanes, PAH, and TPH concentrations in soil samples (n=85) collected from three contaminated sites located in the Niger Delta, Southern Nigeria. Results revealed that prediction of RF models outperformed the PLSR with coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.80, 0.79 and 0.72, residual prediction deviation (RPD) values of 2.35, 1.96, and 2.72, and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values of 63.80, 83.0 and 65.88 mg kg(-1) for TPH, alkanes, and PAH, respectively. Considering the limited dataset used in the independent validation (18 samples), accurate predictions were achieved with RF for PAH and TPH, while the prediction for alkanes was less accurate.

Stream invertebrate communities are primarily shaped by hydrological factors and ultimately fine-tuned by local habitat conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Species richness; Diversity; Species traits; Spatial; Temporal factors	BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; MEDITERRANEAN-CLIMATE STREAMS; SEASONAL-VARIATION; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; FLOW VARIABILITY; WATER-STRESS; RIVER; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; SCALE	The environmental factors that determine species richness and community structure in running waters have long been studied, but how these factors hierarchically and/or interactively influence benthic communities remains unclear. To address this research gap, we identified the principal abiotic factors that determine the taxonomic composition and functionality of stream macroinvertebrate communities and explored possible hierarchical and/or interactive patterns. We analyzed a large dataset from Greek rivers, and compared multiple macroinvertebrate metrics and traits between perennial and intermittent watercourses during wet and dry periods. We found that macroinvertebrates were primarily influenced by two ecological gradients: (i) aquatic vegetation-conductivity; and (ii) water temperature-canopy cover. Macroinvertebrates in perennial rivers were mainly influenced by the first gradient, whereas in intermittent rivers both gradients were important. Taxonomic richness and diversity were higher and temporally stable within years in perennial rivers, whereas in intermittent rivers, these metrics peaked during early summer, before the onset of streambed desiccation. The two environmental gradients determined the taxonomic richness and diversity in both spring and summer; however, a clear influence of hydrological factors (wetted width, water depth, flow velocity and discharge) was observed only in the intermittent samples. We conclude that the benthic invertebrate taxonomic richness and diversity in highly variable environments is primarily determined by hydrological variation and ultimately fine-tuned by local habitat factors. As climate change scenarios predict severe modification of hydrological and local habitat factors, this study concludes that in river management, hydrological restoration should be prioritized over other local habitat factors by maintaining natural hydrological variability, to ensure aquatic community richness and diversity.

However, whether alterations can be reversed has been poorly investigated, although such studies are essential to assess the effects of high-peak exposure events in waterways where pharmaceutical concentrations are usually low. In this study, we investigated the effects of two concentrations (environmentally relevant 1 mu g L-1 and high 100 mu g L-1) of oxazepam, an anxiolytic commonly detected in aquatic environments, and whether behavioural alterations are reversible after depuration. Specifically, we measured daytime and night-time swimming activity and daytime behaviours related to boldness (foraging, sheltering and routine swimming activity) using the freshwater burbot (Lota lota). We found that both swimming activity and boldness were affected by oxazepam. Fish exposed to the higher level had a higher burst swimming duration (i.e., fast swimming bouts), both in the daytime and night-time trials. Further, fish exposed to the lower oxazepam level spent less time sheltering than control-and high-level exposed fish, but there was no difference between the control and high oxazepam treatments. For routine swimming activity, quantified in the boldness trials, and for latency to forage, there were no treatment effects. When retesting the fish after depuration, the detected behavioural alterations were no longer present. Since the magnitude of these effects were not consistent across endpoints, our study suggests that oxazepam might not be a great concern for this particular, stress tolerant, species, highlighting the importance of evaluating species-specific effects of pharmaceuticals. The observation that the effects we did find were reversible after depuration is encouraging, and indicates that rapid restoration of behaviours after removal from oxazepam contamination is possible.

Attributing mortality from temperature extremes: A time series analysis in Varanasi, India	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Health effects; Temperature extreme; Mortality; Climate variability	POLLUTION RELATED DEATHS; HEAT-RELATED MORTALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AIR-POLLUTION; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; DISTRIBUTED LAG; HUMAN HEALTH; RISK-FACTOR; RANGE; IMPACT	Climate extremes are often associated with increased human mortality and such association varies considerably with space and time. We therefore, aimed to systematically investigate the effects of temperature extremes, daily means and diurnal temperature variations (DTV) on mortality in the city of Varanasi, India during 2009-2016. Time series data on daily mortality, air quality (SO2, NO2, O-3 and PM10) and weather variables were obtained from the routinely collected secondary sources. A semiparametric quasi-Poisson regression model estimated the effects of temperature extremes on daily all-cause mortality adjusting nonlinear confounding effects of time trend, relative humidity and air pollution; stratified by seasons. An effect modification by age, gender and place of death as semi-economic indicator were also explored. Daily mean temperature was strongly associated with excess mortality, both during summer (5.61% with 95% CI: 4.69-6.53% per unit increase in mean temperature) and winter (1.53% with 95% CI: 0.88-2.18% per unit decrease in mean temperature). Daily mortality was found to be increased by 12.02% (with 95% CI: 4.21-19.84%) due to heat wave. The DTV has exhibited downward trend over the years and showed a negative association with all-cause mortality. Significant association of mortality and different metric of temperature extreme along with decreasing trend in DTV clearly indicate the potential impact of climate change on human health in the city of Varanasi. The finding may well be useful to prioritize the government policies to curb the factors that causes the climate change and for developing early warning system. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Urban green infrastructures can mitigate air pollution, but a crucial step to use this knowledge into urban management is to quantify how much air-quality regulation can green spaces provide and to understand how the provision of this ecosystem service is affected by other environmental factors. Considering the insufficient number of air quality monitoring stations in cities to monitor the wide range of natural and anthropic sources of pollution with high spatial resolution, ecological indicators of air quality are an alternative cost-effective tool. The aim of this work was to model the supply of air-quality regulation based on urban green spaces characteristics and other environmental factors. For that, we sampled lichen diversity in the centroids of 42 urban green spaces in Lisbon, Portugal. Species richness was the best biodiversity metric responding to air pollution, considering its simplicity and its significative response to the air pollutants concentration data measured in the existent air quality monitoring stations. Using that metric, we then created a model to estimate the supply of air quality regulation provided by green spaces in all green spaces of Lisbon based on the response to the following environmental drivers: the urban green spaces size and its vegetation density. We also used the unexplained variance of this model to map the background air pollution. Overall, we suggest that management should target the smallest urban green spaces by increasing green space size or tree density. The use of ecological indicators, very flexible in space, allow the understanding and the modeling of the provision of air-quality regulation by urban green spaces, and how urban green spaces can be managed to improve air quality and thus improve human well-being and cities resilience.

PRESL; CD; PHYTOREMEDIATION; ZN; TOLERANCE	The success of cadmium phytoextraction operations with Noccaea caerulescens varies by a factor of 70 between sites of trials. However, soil factors driving the efficiency of cadmium(Cd) and zinc (Zn) phytoextraction are still poorly understood, as are the effects of nitrogen fertilizers. We studied biomass production and Cd and Zn uptake by two contrasting populations of N. caerulescens, Ganges (metallicolous) and Wilwerwiltz (non-metallicolous) grown in pots on a range of 24 field contaminated soils for 20 weeks. The addition of KNO3 and NH4NO3 fertilizers was also tested. Using model averaging of multiple regression models, we show that the major drivers of N. caerulescens growth are physical soil factors such as organic matter and soil bulk density while trace metal accumulation mainly relies on soil Cd and Zn exchangeable concentrations. We confirm the negative effect of soil copper (Cu) on growth, even at exchangeable concentrations below 30 mg kg(-1), and therefore on uptake efficiency, while increasing soil lead (Pb) content was related to increased biomass probably due to a protective effect against soil pathogens. Finally, there is a small positive effect of nitrogen fertilization on biomass production only in soils with low initial nitrogen content (under 25 mu g g(-1) NO3-), while above this value, the positive impact of initial nitrogen content is offset by lower shoot Cd and Zn concentrations. Our data bring substantial information regarding the physico-chemical properties to ensure N. caerulescens growth: a soil bulk density under 1.05 kg/dm(3), organic matter above 7% and pH under 7.5. We show that phytoextraction efficiency is maximal for moderate soil contamination in Cd (2-10 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (300-1000 mg kg(-1)). (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Birds in particular mistake plastic for prey, and millions of wild birds carry small plastic loads in their stomach and are exposed to potential toxicological effects. It is currently unknown how severely the toxicological and endocrine disrupting chemicals in plastic affect avian development, reproduction and endocrine function. To address this question, we conducted multi-generational plastic feeding experiments to test the toxicological consequences of plastic ingestion at environmentally relevant loads in Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, investigating parental and two filial generations. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of lasting toxicological effects on mortality, adult body weight, organ histology, hormone levels, fertility, hatch rates and eggshell strength in birds experimentally fed plastic. However, we found plastic ingestion causes higher frequencies of male reproductive cysts and minor delays in chick growth and sexual maturity, though without affecting ultimate survival or reproductive output. We report that although plastic ingestion causes detectable endocrine effects in our model species, our lack of finding mortality, morbidity and adverse reproductive outcomes may challenge the common hypothesis of severe toxicological harm and population-level effects when environmentally relevant loads of plastic are ingested.

Spatial variation of human influences on grassland biomass on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Alpine grasslands; Distance to settlements; Human influences; Livestock density; Overgrazing; Remote sensing of biomass; Spatial-pattern modeling	NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; SOIL CARBON STOCKS; ALPINE GRASSLAND; HUMAN APPROPRIATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RANGELAND DEGRADATION; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; VEGETATION; CHINA; WATER	An improved understanding of increased human influence on ecosystems is needed for predicting ecosystem processes and sustainable ecosystem management. We studied spatial variation of human influence on grassland ecosystems at two scales across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), where increased human activities may have led to ecosystem degradation. At the 10 km scale, we mapped human-influenced spatial patterns based on a hypothesis that spatial patterns of biomass that could not be attributed to environmental variables were likely correlated to human activities. In part this hypothesis could be supported via a positive correlation between biomass unexplained by environmental variables and livestock density. At the 500 m scale, using distance to settlements within a radius of 8 km as a proxy of human-influence intensity, we found both negatively human-influenced areas where biomass decreased closer to settlements (regions with higher livestock density) and positively human-influenced areas where biomass increased closer to settlements (regions with lower livestock density). These results suggest complex relationships between livestock grazing and biomass, varying between spatial scales and regions. Grazing may boost biomass production across the whole QTP at the 10 km scale. However, overgrazing may reduce it near settlements at the 500 m scale. Our approach of mapping and understanding human influence on ecosystems at different scales could guide pasture management to protect grassland in vulnerable regions on the QTP and beyond.

To analyze the development of the pig production sector at the scale of world regions, we developed the IMAGE-Pig model to describe changes in feed demand, feed conversion ratios (FCRs), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and nitrogen excretion for backyard, intermediate and intensive systems during the past few decades as a basis to explore future scenarios. For each region and production system, total production, productive characteristics and dietary compositions were defined for the 1970-2005 period. The results show that due to the growing pork production total feed demand has increased by a factor of two (from 229 to 471Tg DM). This is despite the improvement of FCRs during the 1970-2005 period, which has reduced the feed use per kg of product. The increase of nitrogen use efficiency was slower than the improvement of FCRs due to increasing protein content in the feed rations. As a result, total N excretion increased by more than a factor of two in the 1970-2005 period (from 4.6 to 11.1 Tg N/year). For the period up to 2050, the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) provide information on levels of human consumption, technical development and environmental awareness. The sustainability of pig production systems for the coming decades will be based not only on the expected efficiency improvements at the level of animal breeds, but also on four additional pillars: (i) use of alternative feed sources not competing with human food, (ii) reduction of the crude protein content in rations, (iii) the proper use of slurries as fertilizers through coupling of crop and livestock production and (iv) moderation of the human pork consumption.

Our objective was to identify key areas for conserving the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of threatened vascular plants in Italy, one of the most species-rich regions in the Mediterranean Basin. We used spatial data and the conservation status of 995 threatened vascular plants and applied a phylogenetically informed spatial planning to minimize conservation costs. We then determined the degree of overlap with existing protected areas and evaluated whether this PD-based prioritisation of areas provides adequate protection for threatened phylogenetically distinctive species (EDGE). The cost-effective procedure identified as priority for conservation 12% of the study territory, while achieving over 90% of conservation targets (total PD). We showed that priority areas and protected areas are moderately spatially mismatched. We also showed that not all top-EDGE species were met by the procedure applied, hence we conclude that the PD-based model indicated key areas for protection, but nevertheless additional attention is needed to protect top-EDGE species. This study represents one of the most comprehensive analyses, to date, for the conservation of the native flora in the Mediterranean, incorporating both spatial distribution and evolutionary relationships. Our work on the prioritisation of threatened plant species across Italy can serve as a guide for future conservation applications. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of salinity and alkalinity on growth and the accumulation of copper and zinc in the Chlorophyta Ulva fasciata	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Ulva; Copper; Zinc; Bioaccumulation; Salinity; Alkalinity	MACROALGAE; RESPONSES; TOXICITY; TEMPERATURE; SEDIMENTS; POLLUTION; REMOVAL; PROTEIN; PH	Copper and zinc accumulation in macroalgae is a complex issue. While these metals exist as micronutrients and can serve to add nutritional value to the macroalgae when consumed by both plants and animals, elevated levels of the metals can reduce growth or even kill the algae. Many water parameters can influence the toxicity of the metals, though past studies have rarely isolated individual water parameters. This study aimed to independently determine the effects that salinity and alkalinity have on the growth and accumulation of these two metals on the macroalgae Ulva fasciata, distinguishing the effects of salinity and alkalinity as whole parameters from the collective effects of the water different constituents. The effect of salinity was determined using sodium chloride additions rather than seawater dilution, as performed in past studies, while alkalinity was tested using sodium bicarbonate additions to artificial seawater. The results of the study reinforce previous findings that copper is very toxic to macroalgae, even at low concentrations (50 mu g L-1) though the effects of zinc remain inconclusive at 50 mu g L-1, since the experiment was conducted over only a two-week trial period. The research suggests that salinity and alkalinity have no significant effect on the toxicity of copper to the growth of the macroalgae, but alkalinity significantly reduced copper and increased zinc accumulation in U. fasciata. The results of this study warrant further research in the field to investigate which other components of seawater and macroalgae reduce metal toxicity in the macroalgae. Additionally, these findings suggest the need for further refinement of toxicity models when adapted to macroalgae.

Patterns of Endemism in Turkey, the Meeting Point of Three Global Biodiversity Hotspots, Based on Three Diverse Families of Vascular Plants	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Anatolia; areas of endemism; biodiversity conservation; biodiversity hotspots; biogeography; centers of endemism	ANATOLIAN TAURUS MOUNTAINS; SOUTH-WEST ASIA; SPECIES RICHNESS; AREAS; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; ALPINE; FLORA; BIOGEOGRAPHY; CRITERION	Centers of endemism and areas of endemism are important biogeographic concepts with high relevance for conservation and evolutionary biology. Turkey is located at the intersection of three global biodiversity hotspots (Mediterranean, Caucasian, lrano-Anatolian) and harbors remarkable levels of plant diversity and endemism. Nevertheless, hotspots of vascular plant endemics have never been identified using formal quantitative approaches in this diverse region. Here, using data on 1,102 endemic taxa of three species-rich families (Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Boraginaceae) we identified (i) centers of endemism based on three well-established indices (endemic richness, range-restricted endemic richness and weighted endemic richness) and (ii) areas of endemism using Endemicity Analysis. A total of 14 grid cells belonging to centers of endemism are identified as hotspots by at least one of the indices. Areas of endemism were identified in south-western Turkey (West-Taurus), southern and central Anatolia (Anatolian Diagonal), in north-eastern Turkey (Pontic-Ala), and in south-eastern Turkey (Hakkari). All hotspots of plant endemism in Turkey included high mountains, which are severely threatened by anthropogenic activities. Although the identified centers of endemism cover only 16% of surface area of Turkey they harbor 59% of the endemic taxa, emphasizing their conservation priority. As the majority of the endemic taxa of Turkey are local endemics and narrowly distributed, protection of the identified hotspots would allow a high proportion of likely threatened species to be protected.

Biologging Tags Reveal Links Between Fine-Scale Horizontal and Vertical Movement Behaviors in Tiger Sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier)	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						vertical movement; behavior; tortuosity; top predator; predator-prey interaction	AREA-RESTRICTED SEARCH; HABITAT USE; FORAGING SUCCESS; MARINE PREDATOR; ACCELERATION; PREY; STRATEGIES; RESOLUTION; TRACKS; DIET	An understanding of the role that large marine predators play in structuring trophic flow and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems requires knowledge of their fine-scale (m-km) movement behaviors. In this study, biologging tags were used to reveal new insights into the three-dimensional fine-scale movement ecology of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Tags deployed on 21 sharks in April-May 2017 for durations of 5-48 h recorded both physical parameters such as depth and temperature, and, through the use of accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses, in-situ measurements of animal trajectory and locomotion. Animal-borne-video enabled the validation of behavioral signatures, mapping of habitat, and recording of interactions with prey. Collectively, these data were used to examine the link between vertical (oscillations) and horizontal (tortuosity) movements, and link sensor data to prey interactions recorded by the video. This biologging approach revealed complex movements that would otherwise be invisible within the time-depth records provided by traditional tagging techniques. The rate of horizontal turning was not related to vertical oscillations, suggesting that vertical movements occur independently of searching behaviors in tiger sharks. These animals displayed tortuous movements possibly associated with prey searching for 27% of their tracks, and interactions with prey elicited varied responses including highly tortuous paths and burst movements. Accurate speed measurements and GPS anchor points will considerably enhance the value of magnetometer data in future studies by facilitating more accurate dead-reckoning and geo-referencing of area-restricted search behaviors.

In Europe, it is considered a species of Union concern and national authorities have to establish surveillance plans, early warning and rapid response systems or control plans. These strategies customarily require the assessment of the areas that could be colonised beyond outbreaks or expanding ranges, so as to establish efficient containment protocols. The hornet is spreading through a mix of natural diffusion and human-mediated transportation. Despite the latter dispersion mode is hardly predictable, natural diffusion could be modelled from nest data of consecutive years. The aim of this work is to develop a procedure to predict the spread of the yellow-legged hornet in the short term in order to increase the efficiency of control plans to restrain the diffusion of this species. We used data on the mean distances of colonial nests between years to evaluate the probability of yellow-legged hornet dispersal around the areas where the species is present. The distribution of nests in Italy was mainly explained by elevation (95% of nests located within 521 m a.s.l.) and distance from source sites (previous years' colonies; 95% within 1.4-6.2 km). The diffusion models developed with these two variables forecast, with good accuracy, the spread of the species in the short term: 98-100% of nests were found within the predicted area of expansion. A similar approach can be applied in areas invaded by the yellow-legged hornet, in particular beyond new outbreaks and over the border of its expanding range, to implement strategies for its containment. The spatial application of the models allows the establishment of buffer areas where monitoring and control efforts can be allocated on the basis of the likelihood of the species spreading at progressively greater distances.

This study aimed to analyze the occurrence of plant species, their Mn concentrations, and mycorrhizal colonization after implementation of two revegetation techniques (replacement of topsoil with natural seed bank and planting of seedlings) in an area of disposal of tailings from Mn processing compared to a native forest area as well as to a place that was not revegetated. Plant samples (at least three individuals/species) were collected from the understory at revegetated locations and forest. The established plant species and their Mn concentrations, mycorrhizal colonization, and forms of Mn in the soil were analyzed. The use of topsoil led to greater plant diversity. The high concentrations of Mn in the substrates did not affect the occurrence of vegetation in the understory and mycorrhizal colonization. The plant species established in the revegetated areas differed in relation to Mn concentration (471-27,842 mg kg(-1) in leaves), Mn translocation factor (0.2-125.3) and mycorrhizal colonization rates (1-35%). Four potential Mn hyperaccumulators species were identified: Aparisthmium cordatum, Clidemia hirta, Socratea exorrhiza, and Vismia latifolia.

We aimed to assess how the biomass of invasive Prunus serotina changed over eight years and how this change was affected by light availability, tree stand growth, and propagule pressure. The study was conducted in Siemianice Experimental Forest (W Poland), a common garden forest experiment with 14 tree species. We investigated aboveground biomass and density of P. serotina within 53 experimental plots with initial measurements in 2005 and repeated in 2013. We also measured light availability and distance from seed sources. We used generalized additive models to assess the impact of particular predictors on P. serotina biomass in 2013 and its relative change over eight years. The relative biomass increments of P. serotina ranged from 0 to 22,000-fold. The success of P. serotina, expressed as aboveground biomass and biomass increment, varied among different tree species stands, but was greater under conifers. Total biomass of P. serotina depended on light and propagule availability while biomass increment depended on the change in tree stand biomass, a metric corresponding to tree stand maturation. Our study quantified the range of invasion intensity, expressed as biomass increment, in a forest common garden experiment with 14 tree species. Canopy cover was the most important variable to reduce susceptibility to invasion by P. serotina. Even a modest decrease of overstory biomass, e.g. caused by dicback of coniferous species, may be risky in areas with high propagule pressure from invasive tree species.

Nonetheless, some findings suggest that trait differences between invasive and non-invasive species are context dependent. In this study, two forms of an invasive vine species, Dolichandra unguis-cati, were used to test the context-dependent hypothesis. Dolichandra unguis-cati is a weed of national significance in Australia with two different forms: the 'long pod' (LP) and 'short pod' (SP). The two forms have different levels of distribution on the eastern Seaboard of the continent, with the SP form occurring extensively in both States of Queensland and New South Wales while the LP form is found only in isolated sites in South-East Queensland. This study examines whether differences in eco-physiological performance could be responsible for differential success of the two forms. A partially factorial experiment was set up in controlled conditions where potted plants of both forms were grown under two levels of light, water and nutrient resources (high and low) for 15 months. We measured several traits that are known to correlate with plant performance and resource use efficiency (RUE). The SP form exhibited higher values of carbon assimilation, RUE, number of subterranean tubers and leaf nitrogen than the LP form. However, the LP form produced greater biomass than the SP form, with the difference driven mainly by high resource conditions. The LP form displayed significantly higher phenotypic integration (number of traits significantly correlated) than the SP form in response to all treatments while the SP form exhibited higher phenotypic integration than the LP form in response to high resource conditions only. The SP form displayed traits that are well suited for successful colonization, possibly explaining its increased success in Australia, while the LP form possessed traits of opportunistic plants. Overall, we find that the two forms of the weedy vine deploy different carbon economies in response to resource conditions, which is evidence of the context-dependent trait hypothesis.

The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh "blue carbon" stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.

Mesozooplankton Community Composition Controls Fecal Pellet Flux and Remineralization Depth in the Southern Ocean	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						copepods; euphausiids; Scotia Sea; biological carbon pump; sea-ice; export	ORGANIC-CARBON FLUX; SINKING RATES; VERTICAL FLUX; MARINE SNOW; SCOTIA SEA; PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOM; MESOPELAGIC ZONE; NATURAL COPEPOD; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; FOOD-WEB	Zooplankton fecal pellets (FPs) are important conduits of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, as shown by their presence in deep-sea sediment traps. Zooplankton themselves are thought to play an important role in the breakdown and reworking of FPs as they sink, whilst processes such as diel vertical migration (DVM) may enhance the supply of carbon to the mesopelagic. However, comparatively little is known about the processes or variability of FP sinking/transport within the upper mesopelagic and how this relates to deeper ocean export. Profiles of FP type and size, and the contribution made by FPs to mesopelagic carbon flux to a depth of 400 m, were considered. Three contrasting locations in the Scotia Sea were compared, which together reflect the variability in physical regime and productivity encountered across the Southern Ocean. Comparing observed FPs with predictions from the mesozooplankton community, we show that, even at shallow depths, the smallest fraction of FP is under-represented, suggesting rapid remineralization, incorporation into larger aggregates or reworking into larger FPs, and that the flux is dominated by FPs from larger zooplankton. In contrast to models where POC attenuation rates are set to increase with temperature, we find that FP carbon flux attenuates rapidly in low productivity, colder regions dominated by krill, while remineralization is deeper in warmer areas where productivity is high and copepods dominate. This emphasizes the strong modulation of the zooplankton community on the supply and transfer of FP carbon between the epi-and mesopelagic. Evidence was found to suggest that DVM enhances FP flux across the upper mesopelagic, producing a pulse of fresh, dense material that may support secondary production and heterotrophic respiration in the mesopelagic. This illustrates that variability in flux at short (daily) as well as longer (seasonal) timescales may have important implications for the supply of FP carbon to deeper waters.

We used long term soil management database of a production farm that is based on principles of conservation agriculture such as: a) eliminate soil disturbance; b) maintain permanent soil surface cover; C) adopt crop diversity with high biomass-C input; for 30 years and agroecosystem models to study the potential of different management options to sequester C in soils. Using Century and Roth-C models we simulated the carbon stocks evolution in the farm and four subtropical soil management scenarios and studied C sequestration potential. The scenarios were: a) existing farm biomass input (14.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) or C input (6.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)); b) 15% increase of farm biomass input (16.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) or C input (7.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)); c) 15% decrease of farm biomass (12.3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) or C input (5.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and, d) 30% decrease of farm biomass input (10.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) or C input (4.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). Our results demonstrate that soil organic carbon continuously increased after conservation management practices adoption in 1985 until 2015, and currently soil organic carbon is in equilibrium. We found that an increase of 2.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1 )biomass-C input for 60 years resulted into increase of 12 Mg ha(-1) soil organic carbon stocks. The same way, crop yields increased with time, and were more pronounced for maize compared to soybean and wheat. The scaling up of model results to similar climate and soil types indicated that conservation management practices has the potential to sequester 2.7 +/- 0.02 Pg C at 0-20 cm and 4.8 +/- 3 Pg C at 0-100 cm soil depth in 43 million ha area globally. In the 30% and 15% decrease scenarios the sequestration were 2.2 +/- 0.02 and 2.4 +/- 0.02 Pg C at 0 -20 cm an in 15% increase scenario it goes to 3.2 +/- 0.02 Pg C. This equilibrium soil organic carbon stocks considering the currently adopted system are equivalent to 3.5-4.5% of the world SOC stocks in 3% of the world croplands and correspond to 6 years of global land use and land use change emissions, indicating that conservation management practices can lead the soil be a sink and a promising tool to promote C sequestration in subtropical soils.

However, existing studies usually assume a universal lag association across sites and seasons. Such a strategy ignores the heterogeneity of lag structures and may lead to bias in the estimation of effects. Methods: A Bayesian hierarchical model with flexible lag structures was applied to estimate the impact of particulate matter less than 10 mu m (PM10) on mortality and determine whether the lag structure varied by season and location. Data from nine US communities, obtained from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS), was used to examine the lagged associations between PM10 and daily mortality, The estimates obtained from the flexible lag approaches were compared with those from the universal lag approach. Results: Of potential varying lag structures, a 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM10 was associated with 0.32% (95% credible interval: 0.16, 0.45) and 0.36% (0.18, 0.52) increases in mortality from nonaccidental and cardiovascular-respiratoiy death. The community-specific estimates of PM10 mortality effects were distinct between the flexible and the universal lag approaches, with relative change of the effects ranged from 7.21% to 9.25% for nonacciclental morality, and from 5.78% to 4.16% for cardiovascular-respiratory morality. Moreover, the lag structure varied by location and season. For instance, the nonaccidental mortality effect of PM10 attributable to the current and previous day was 293% in El Paso while 55.0% in Chicago; the overall effect attributable to the previous two to five days were 60.6%, 51.9%, 59.5%, and 59.3% in winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated that a universal lag association across sites and seasons may bias the mortality effect of air pollution. The varying lag structures should be considered in studies of short-term environmental exposures to get a more precise effect estimate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A 2000-year sediment record reveals rapidly changing sedimentation and land use since the 1960s in the Upper Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sediment core; Land use change; Deforestation; Mara River; East Africa; Lake Victoria	HIPPOPOTAMUS HIPPOPOTAMUS-AMPHIBIUS; LAKE-VICTORIA; WATER-RESOURCES; WILDEBEEST MIGRATION; ACCUMULATION RATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-EROSION; COVER CHANGE; EAST-AFRICA; RIVER-BASIN	The Mara River basin is a trans-boundary basin of international importance. It forms the headwaters of the Nile River and serves as the primary dry season water source for an estimated 1.1 million rural people and the largest remaining overland migration of 1.4 million wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem. Changes throughout the basin arc impacting the quantity and quality of the Mara River, yet the historical context of environmental conditions in the basin is not well known. We collected sediment cores throughout the wetland at the mouth of the Mara River, and we used isotopic dating methods and a suite of analyses to examine historical patterns of sediment quantity and source, mercury contamination, and carbon and nutrient loading. Our results show that ecological conditions in the Mara River basin were fairly stable over paleoecological time scales (2000-1000 years before present), but there has been a period of rapid change in the basin over the last 250 years, particularly since the 1960s. A shift in the source and quantity of sediments in the liver began in the late 1700s and became much more pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s, coincident with increasing mercury concentrations. The quantity of sediment from the Upper Mara increased, particularly since 1960, but the proportion of total sediment from this region decreased as the Talek and Middle Mara portions of the basin began producing more sediment. The decadal oscillation in sediment accumulation was congruent with known periods of extreme precipitation events. Carbon and nitrogen loading also increased since the 1960s, and the shift in the isotopic ratio of nitrogen provides evidence for increased anthropogenic loading. Altogether, these data likely reflect patterns of change also experienced in other basins throughout East Africa. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This represents a major environmental concern given that various pharmaceuticals act on drug targets that arc evolutionarily conserved across diverse taxa, arc often persistent in the environment, and can bioconcentrate in organisms and bioaccumulate in food chains. Despite this, relatively little is known about the potential for pharmaceutical contaminants to affect animal behaviour, especially across multiple fitness-related contexts. Here, we investigated impacts of 21-day exposure of wild-caught male eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) to a field-realistic level of the veterinary pharmaceutical 17 beta-trenbolone-a growth-promoting steroid used extensively in beef production worldwide and a potent androgenic endocrine disruptor repeatedly detected in surface waters affected by livestock effluent run-off First, we examined male boldness, activity, and exploratory behaviour in a novel environment (maze arena) and found no significant effect of 17 beta-trenbolone exposure. Second, the same males were tested in a reproductive assay for their tendency to associate with a stimulus (unexposed) female behind a partition. Exposed males exhibited reduced association behaviour, taking longer to first associate with, and spending less time within close proximity to, a female. Third, all males were assayed fur sperm function (computer-assisted sperm analysis, sperm viability) or quantity (total sperm count) and, although no significant main effects of 17 beta-trenbolone were seen on sperm trails, exposure altered the relationship between male morphology and sperm function. Lastly, morphological traits were assessed and exposed males were found to have, on average, increased mass relative to length. In combination, these results demonstrate that exposure to a field-realistic level of 17 beta-trenbolone can produce subtle but important trait alterations in male fish including context-specific behavioural changes, disruption of key sperm function trade-offs, and altered morphology with potential impacts on exposed wildlife.

Prior to harvesting, sugarcane dry leaves are burned to facilitate manual cutting and enhance productivity. This practice generates ashes from sugarcane straw (hereafter referred as SCA), which may be carried to aquatic ecosystems, where its impacts on organisms and ecosystem integrity remain unknown. Here, we experimentally tested the toxicity of five different concentrations of SCA (0, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 mg/L) on three native (Astyanax lacustris, Moenkhausia born La and M. forestii) and two non-native (Oreochrotmis niloticus and Poecilia reticulata) fish from the Parana. River Basin, Brazil. The toxicity was estimated by calculating the median lethal concentration (LC50-24) and the hepatosomatic index (HSI). We hypothesised that native fish are more sensitive to an increase in SCA than non-native fish. We verified that the mortality of native fish sharply increased with the increase in higher SCA concentration (LC50-24h values: A lacustris = 2525.71 mg/L M. bonita = 2124.95 mg/L and M. forestil 1981.74 mg/L). However, no deaths were recorded for non-native fish species in any SCA concentrations. Accordingly, the HSI index values statistically differed with the increase in SCA concentrations for native fish, while for non-native fish we did not observe any difference. Therefore, only native species died or suffered liver damage with an increase in SCA concentrations. Extrapolating our findings to natural environments, we suggest that sugarcane burning, a widely used agricultural technique, has the potential to reduce the population size of native organisms and facilitate the dominance of non-native fish species in aquatic ecosystems.

The effect of fire affected Pinus radiata litter and char addition on soil nitrogen cycling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Litter decomposition; N cycling; Soil respiration; N absorption; Pious radiata	ORGANIC-MATTER; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; LEAF-LITTER; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; EXTRACTION METHOD; CARBON; FOREST; BIOCHAR; MINERALIZATION; DECOMPOSITION	In pine forest litters, decomposition rate is directly affected by the pathway the needle followed to the ground, whether that was via programmed apoptosis and abscission or via stress induced loss through branch damage or tree death. Stress induced losses may occur due to fire damage, which leads to a post-fire litter layer composed of non-senescent debris that fell during or after the event. This study investigates decomposition and nitrogen cycling in soils amended with two litters from Pinus radiata plantations that had different recent fire histories. Litters were incubated in the presence or absence of field collected char for up to 94 days. These soil treatments were analysed for microbial activity (soil respiration) and N pools (microbial, mineral, and potentially mineralisable). Soil and litter treatments were additionally incubated in the presence of ammonium nitrate solution to determine N absorption potential of the litters. Respiration was greatest in soils that received fire affected (FA) litter regardless of the presence or absence of char. Nitrogen pools were largely similar between the control (no litter) treatment and not fire affected (NFA) litter treatments. Measured N pools were exceedingly low (92% of samples <2 mu g-N g soil(-1) where detected) or not detectable (37% of samples below detection limits) in all FA litter treatments at most times. Char appeared inert throughout and had no effects on microbial activity or nitrogen cycling. This study indicates that fire affected pine litter collected four months post fire has strong N absorption properties with or without the presence of char. The presence of fire affected litter is likely to affect N availability for regeneration of forest growth. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The metabolism of tropical systems may differ profoundly from temperate systems due to the higher temperatures and wider variations in precipitation. Here, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of the variability in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and its drivers in a set of 102 low-latitude lakes and reservoirs that encompass wide gradients of precipitation, productivity and landscape properties (lake area, perimeter-to-area ratio, catchment size, catchment area-to lake area ratio, and types of catchment land use). We used multiple regressions and structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the direct and indirect effects of the main in-lake variables and landscape properties on the water pCO(2) variance. We found that these systems were mostly supersaturated with CO2 (92% spatially and 72% seasonally) regardless of their trophic status and landscape properties. The pCO(2) values (9-40,020 mu atm) were within the range found in tropical ecosystems, and higher (p < 0.005) than pCO(2) values recorded from high latitude ecosystems. Water volume had a negative effect on the trophic state (r = -0.63), which mediated a positive indirect effect on pCO(2) (r = 0.4), representing an important negative feedback in the context of climate change-driven reduction in precipitation. Our results demonstrated that precipitation drives the pCO(2) seasonal variability, with significantly higher pCO(2) during the rainy season (F = 16.67; p < 0.001), clue to two potential main mechanisms: (1) phytoplankton dilution and (2) increasing inputs of terrestrial CO2 from the catchment. We conclude that at low latitudes, precipitation is a major climatic driver of pCO(2) variability by influencing volume variations and linking lentic ecosystems to their catchments.

These compounds can leach into the aqueous environment, where they can potentially have toxic effects. The aim of this study was to assess the photochemical degradation of three common bisphenols: BPI', BPS and BPZ in aqueous solution and determine their degradation kinetics and characterise their transformation products. Three independent experiments were performed based on: 1) direct photolysis using UV irradiation, 2) cyclodexixin-enhanced photolysis and 3) the photo-Fenton reaction. Analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS). This approach enabled for the first time a comparison between various conditions of photochemical degradation, revealing to be an effective way of removing (>90%) BPF, BPS and BPZ from aqueous samples. In all cases, degradation followed a pseudo-first order kinetic profile, while removal efficiency and formation of transformation products depended on the applied process. The photo-Fenton process resulted in the shortest half-lives (16.1 21.7 min) and generated the highest number of transformation products. Overall, in this study we identified 11 novels and eight previously reported TPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mercury concentrations in marine species from the Aleutian Islands: Spatial and biological determinants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Muscle; North Pacific; Mercury; Stable isotopes of C and N; Fish	STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; FOOD-WEB; TROPHIC POSITION; BERING-SEA; LIPID CORRECTION; FISH ASSEMBLAGE; PACIFIC COD; METHYLMERCURY; ALASKA; CARBON	Several species found in the Bering Sea show significant spatial variation in total mercury concentrations ([THg]) longitudinally along the Aleutian Island chain. We assessed [THg] in other members of the Bering Sea food web to better understand the factors shaping regional differences. [THg] and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13 values) were measured in muscle tissue from 1052 fishes and cephalopods from parts of the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Aleutian Islands. The spatial distribution of the samples enabled regional comparisons for S species of fish and one species of cephalopod. Pour species showed higher mean length-standardized [THg] in the western Aleutian Islands management area. [THg] in yellow Irish lord were very different relative to those observed in other species and when included in multi-species analyses drove the overall regional trends in mean [THg]. Multi-species analyses excluding measurements for yellow Irish lord showed mean length-standardized [THg] was greater in the western Aleutian Islands than in the central Aleutian Islands management area. Linear regression of [THg] and delta N-15 values showed a significant and positive relationship across all species, varying between regions and across species. Isotopic space of all species was significantly different between the western Aleutian Islands and central Aleutian Islands, driven largely by delta C-13 values. Stable isotope values observed follow the same regional trend of lower trophic taxa reported in the literature, with significantly lower delta C-13 values in the western Aleutian Islands. We conclude that there are regional differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ecology, as well as species-specific feeding ecology that influence [THg] dynamics in part of the marine food web along the Aleutian Island chain.

A framework for automated anomaly detection in high frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Big data; Forecasting; Near-real time; Quality control and assurance; River; Time series	DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; SEDIMENT; RIVER; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; OUTLIERS; SCIENCE; MODELS; LAND; FLOW	Monitoring the water quality of rivers is increasingly conducted using automated in situ sensors, enabling timelier identification of unexpected values or trends. However, the data are confounded by anomalies caused by technical issues, for which the volume and velocity of data preclude manual detection. We present a framework for automated anomaly detection in high-frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors, using turbidity, conductivity and river level data collected from rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef. After identifying end-user needs and defining anomalies, we ranked anomaly importance and selected suitable detection methods. High priority anomalies included sudden isolated spikes and level shifts, most of which were classified correctly by regression-based methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average models. However, incorporation of multiple water-quality variables as covariates reduced performance due to complex relationships among variables. Classifications of drift and periods of anomalously low or high variability were more often correct when we applied mitigation, which replaces anomalous measurements with forecasts for further forecasting, but this inflated false positive rates. Feature-based methods also performed well on high priority anomalies and were similarly less proficient at detecting lower priority anomalies, resulting in high false negative rates. Unlike regression-based methods, however, all feature-based methods produced low false positive rates and have the benefit of not requiring training or optimization. Rule-based methods successfully detected a subset of lower priority anomalies, specifically impossible values and missing observations. We therefore suggest that a combination of methods will provide optimal performance in terms of correct anomaly detection, whilst minimizing false detection rates. Furthermore, our framework emphasizes the importance of communication between end-users and anomaly detection developers for optimal outcomes with respect to both detection performance and end-user application. To this end, our framework has high transferability to other types of high frequency time-series data and anomaly detection applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Extensive field surveys using GPS, and the visual interpretation of satellite images, used to prepare a digital map of the spatial distribution of gullies. 130 locations were sampled to elucidate the spatial distribution of the soil surface properties. Topographic attributes were provided from digital elevation model (DEM). The land use and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps were created by satellite image ry.The functional relationships between gully erosion and controlling factors were calculated using the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Na ve Bayes (NB), and generalized additive model (GAM) models. The performance of models was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on efficiency, Kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that the RF model had the highest amount of efficiency, Kappa coefficient, and AUC and the lowest amounts of MAE and RMSE compared with SVM, NB, and GAM. The RF model showed the highest predictive performance (mean AUC 924%), followed by SVM (mean AUC 90.9%), GAM (mean AUC 89.9%), and NB (mean AUC 87.2%) models. Overall accuracy of the models ranged from excellent (NB, GAM) to outstanding (RF, SVM) classes. The capacity of all models for creating GESM was quite stable when the calibration and validation samples were changed through10-fold cross-validation technique. According to variable importance analysis performed by RF model, the most important variables are distance from rivers, calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and topographic position index (TPI). The obtained maps can help identifying areas at risk of gully erosion and facilitate the implementation of plans for soil conservation and sustainable management. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, direct measurement of K-s is time consuming and arduous. Alternatively, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed to estimate K-s indirectly through more easily measurable soil properties that are part of regional, national, or international databases. These PTFs are usually based on datasets collected from large regions. However, their validity for a specific site remains unclear. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of established PTFs in estimating K-s in a specific field and improve PTFs to arrive at a locally adapted estimation result for K-s. Forty-one soil samples were collected from 10 locations at five depths at a farmland in western Kentucky for hydraulic conductivity and physical property measurements. The performance of seven PTFs in estimating K-s was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and the coefficient of determination (R-2). At this scale, all the selected PTFs exhibited unsatisfactory prediction of K-s (high RMSE, low NSE and R-2). In the field studied, approximately 60% of variance in K-s could be explained by soil texture and macropore components based on factor analysis. Clay content and macroporosity were identified as the most representative variables for each component. The performance of a PTF in estimating K-s for the field site investigated was significantly improved by including macroporosity (pores with diameter >75 mu m) as a predictor. The results confirmed that soil structure was crucial in characterizing soil hydraulic conductivity.

To assess possible contamination of non-target areas, 71 public playgrounds located next to intensively managed apple and wine orchards were selected in four valleys of South Tyrol (northern Italy). Further, the impact of environmental site characteristics on the number and concentration of pesticides was assessed. Grass samples from the selected playgrounds were collected and screened for 315 pesticide residues using standard gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.ResultsNearly half of the playgrounds (45%) were contaminated by at least one pesticide and a quarter (24%) by more than one. Eleven of the 12 different detected pesticides are classified as endocrine-active substances including the insecticide phosmet and the fungicide fluazinam showing the highest concentrations (0.069 and 0.26mgkg(-1), respectively).Additionally, one disinfectant and one preservation agent was found. Playgroundsin Venosta valley were most often contaminated(76% of all investigated playgrounds), highest concentrations were found in the Low Adige (2.02mgkg(-1)). Pesticide concentrations were positively associated with areal proportion of apple orchards in the surroundings, the amount of rainfall and wind speed. In contrast, increasing global irradiance, opposite wind direction, increasing distance to agricultural sites and high wind speeds when pesticide application was not allowed were associated with decreasing pesticide contamination.ConclusionThis study is among the first investigating pesticide contamination of public playgrounds together with environmental factors in areas with pesticide-intensive agricultureat the beginning of the growing season. It is likely that playgrounds will be affected by more pesticides and higher concentrations over the course of the crop season. The result, that the majority of the detected pesticides are classified as endocrine active is worrisome as children are especially vulnerable. Hence, we recommend that pesticide risk assessments should better include protection measures for non-target areas.

However, studies of these trends are often taxonomically-biased toward well-known organisms and especially those with relatively large bodies, and environmental variability at the local scale may perturb these general effects. Here, we focus on understudied organisms-soil invertebrates-in Antarctic deserts, which are among the driest and coldest places on Earth. We sampled two remote Antarctic sites in the Darwin Glacier area and established an altitudinal gradient running from 210 to 836 m a.s.l. We measured soil geochemistry and organic matter content and linked these parameters with the presence of soil invertebrates. We found three general outcomes, two of which are consistent with general assumptions: (a) the hostile climatic condition of the Darwin Glacier region supports an extremely low diversity of soil metazoans represented by a single nematode species-Scottnema lindsayae; (b) soil geochemistry is the main factor influencing distribution of nematodes at the local scale. Contrary to our expectations, a positive correlation was found between nematode density and altitude. This last observation could be explained by an additional effect of soil moisture as we found this increased with altitude and may be caused by orographic clouds, which are present in this region. To the best of our knowledge such effects have been described in tropical and temperate regions. Potential effect of orographic clouds on soil properties in polar deserts may be a fruitful area of ecological research on soil fauna.

However, little is known of the differences in physicochemical and geographical factors influencing the bacterial and eukaryotic communities and of the relative contribution of these two types of predictors in such systems. Here, we investigated the structure and influential factors on bacterial and eukaryotic communities within the river-lake ecosystem sediments using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Numerous physicochemical parameters and geographical locations were measured among 15 sampling sites in the river-lake system of Poyang Lake. Bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria (32.08%), Acidobacteria (16.58%), and Chloroflexi (14.39%), while eukaryotic communities were dominated by Fungi (63.32%) and Alveolata (10.2%). Both bacterial and eukaryotic community structures statistically correlated with C, N, and Fe, but only bacterial community structure significantly correlated with pH, ON, and Fe. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that physicochemical parameters controlled strongly both bacterial and eukaryotic communities, whereas the direct influence of geographical coordinates and a combination of physicochemical parameters and geographical coordinates controlled relatively small. Bacterial community (31.64%) exhibited a stronger influence by physicochemical parameters than the eukaryotic community (17%).

The oxygen isotope ratio of phosphate (delta O-18(PO4)) can shed light on P sources and P cycling in ecosystems. This is the first assessment of the delta O-18(PO4), distribution in a whole catchment, namely, the Yasu River Watershed in Japan. The observed delta O-18(PO4) values in the river water varied spatially from 10.3 parts per thousand to 17.6 parts per thousand. To identify P sources in the watershed, we used an isoscape approach involving a multiple-linear-regression model based on land use and lithological types. We constructed two isoscape models, one using data only from the whole watershed and the other using data from the small tributaries. The model results explain 69% and 96% of the spatial variation in the river water delta O-18(PO4). The lower R-2 value for the whole watershed model is attributed to the relatively large travel time for P in the main stream of the lower catchment that can result in cumulative biological P recycling.

Distribution and Speciation of Copper and Arsenic in Rice Plants (Oryza sativa japonica 'Koshihikari') Treated with Copper Oxide Nanoparticles and Arsenic during a Life Cycle	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CUO NANOPARTICLES; SEEDLING GROWTH; ACCUMULATION; SOIL; TRANSPORTER; BIOAVAILABILITY; TOXICITY; PATHWAY; SYSTEM	A 6 x 2 factorial study was conducted to investigate the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles (nCuO, 0-100 mg/L), arsenic (As, 0-10 mg/kg), and their interaction on uptake, distribution, and speciation of Cu and As in rice plants (Oryza sativa japonica 'Koshihikari'). Arsenic (in As-addition treatments) and Cu in seedling roots (SRs) were 1.45 and 1.58 times those in soil, respectively. Arsenic and Cu concentrations further increased in mature plant roots (MRs), which were 2.06 and 2.35 times those in soil, respectively. Arsenic and Cu concentrations in seedling shoots (SSs) were 79% and 54% lower than those in SRs, respectively. The mature stems, however, contained only 3% and 44% of As and Cu in SSs. Copper in flag leaves did not vary much compared to that in stems, whereas As was 14.5 times that in stems. Species transformations of Cu and As were observed in rice including reductions of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and As(V) to As(III). Arsenic in dehusked grains was negatively correlated with Cu and was lowered by nCuO below the WHO (World Health Organization) maximum safe concentration for white rice (200 ng/g). This may alleviate As adverse effects on humans from rice consumption.

Thicker Shells Compensate Extensive Dissolution in Brachiopods under Future Ocean Acidification	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DISSOCIATION-CONSTANTS; SEAWATER ACIDIFICATION; CARBONIC-ACID; LIFE-HISTORY; IMPACT; CALCIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; REPAIR; RESPONSES; MOLLUSKS	Organisms with long generation times require phenotypic plasticity to survive in changing environments until genetic adaptation can be achieved. Marine calcifiers are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification due to dissolution and a reduction in shell-building carbonate ions. Long-term experiments assess organisms' abilities to acclimatize or even adapt to environmental change. Here we present an unexpected compensatory response to extensive shell dissolution in a highly calcium-carbonate-dependent organism after long-term culture in predicted end-century acidification and warming conditions. Substantial shell dissolution with decreasing pH posed a threat to both a polar (Liothyrella uva) and a temperate (Calloria inconspicua) brachiopod after 7 months and 3 months exposure, respectively, with more extensive dissolution in the polar species. This impact was reflected in decreased outer primary layer thickness in the polar brachiopod. A compensatory response of increasing inner secondary layer thickness, and thereby producing a thicker shell, was exhibited by the polar species. Less extensive dissolution in the temperate brachiopod did not affect shell thickness. Increased temperature did not impact shell dissolution or thickness. Brachiopod ability to produce a thicker shell when extensive shell dissolution occurs suggests this marine calcifier has great plasticity in calcification providing insights into how similar species might cope under future environmental change.

Long-Term Changes in Precipitation and Temperature Have Already Impacted Nitrogen Loading	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; LARGE WATERSHEDS; UNITED-STATES; NUTRIENT; RIVER; EUTROPHICATION; ATTRIBUTION; TRENDS; INPUTS; LOSSES	Increases in nitrogen loading over the past several decades have led to widespread water quality impairments across the U.S. Elevated awareness of the influence of climate variability on nitrogen loading has led to several studies investigating future climate change impacts on water quality. However, it remains unclear whether long-term climate impacts can already be observed in the historical record. Here, we quantify long-term trends in total nitrogen loading over the period 1987-2012 across the contiguous U.S. and attribute these trends to long-term changes in nitrogen inputs and climatic variables. We find that annual precipitation, extreme springtime precipitation, and springtime temperature are key drivers of trends in historical loading in most regions. These decadal climate trends have either amplified or offset loading trends expected from nitrogen inputs alone. We also find that rising temperatures have been insufficient to offset precipitation-induced loading increases, suggesting that future increases in temperature under climate change may have limited potential to counteract loading increases expected as a result of anticipated changes in precipitation. This work demonstrates the important role of decadal climate variability in long-term nitrogen loading, emphasizing the need to consider climate change risks when designing and monitoring nutrient reduction programs.

This method is based on a standard floating chamber in which a well-defined carrier gas flows. The concentration of CH4 is measured continuously at the outlet of the chamber, and the flux is determined from a mass balance equation. The method was carefully tested in a laboratory and was subsequently applied to two lakes, in Mexico, with contrasting trophic states. We show here that the method allows for the continuous quantification of CH4 diffusive flux higher than 25 x 10(-6) g m(-2) h(-1), the determination of ebullitive flux, and the individual characterization of bubbles larger than 1.50-1.72 mm in diameter. The method was also applied to determine carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). In that case, the method was less sensitive but allowed for the characterization of diffusive fluxes higher than 10 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and of bubbles larger than 5.3-8.4 mm in diameter. This high-throughput method can be adapted to any gas detector at low cost, making it a convenient tool to better constrain greenhouse gas emission from freshwater ecosystems.

Silicon Availability from Chemically Diverse Fertilizers and Secondary Raw Materials	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DETERMINING REACTIVE SILICON; ABSORPTIOMETRIC DETERMINATION; RICE; SOILS; BIOCHAR; WATER; EARTH	Crops may require Si fertilization to sustain yields. Potential Si fertilizers include industrial byproducts (e.g., steel slags), mined minerals (CaSiO3), fused Ca-Mg-phosphates, biochar, ash, diatomaceous earth, and municipal sewage sludge. To date, no extraction method was shown to accurately predict plant availability of Si from such chemically diverse Si fertilizers. We tested a wide range of products in greenhouse experiments and related the plant Si content to Si extracted by several common Si fertilizer tests: 5-day extraction in Na2CO3-NH4NO3, 0.5 mol L-1 HCl, and Resin extraction. In addition, we tested a novel sink extraction approach for Si(OH)(4)(0) that utilizes a dialysis membrane filled with ferrihydrite ("Iron Bag"). Wheat straw biochars and ash exhibited equivalent or marginally higher Si solubility and availability compared to wheat straw. Thermo-chemically treated municipal sewage sludge, as well as diatomaceous earth, did not release substantial amounts of Si. The Resin and the Iron Bag extraction methods gave the best results to predict plant availability of Si. These methods better reproduce the conditions of fertilizer dissolution in soil and around the root by (1) buffering the pH close to neutral and (2) extracting the dissolved Si(OH)(4)(0) with ferrihydrite (Iron Bag method) for maximum quantitative extraction.

The importance of mineral determinations to PROFILE base cation weathering release rates: a case study	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							FOREST SOILS; DECISION-SUPPORT; NORWAY SPRUCE; MODEL; NUTRIENT; SWEDEN; A2M	Accurate estimates of base cation weathering rates in forest soils are crucial for policy decisions on sustainable biomass harvest levels and for calculations of critical loads of acidity. The PROFILE model is one of the most frequently used methods to quantify weathering rates, where the quantitative mineralogical input has often been calculated by the Lambda 2M ("Analysis to Mineralogy") program based solely on geochemical data. The aim of this study was to investigate how uncertainties in quantitative mineralogy, originating from modeled mineral abundance and assumed stoichiometry, influence PROFILE weathering estimate, by using measured quantitative mineralogy by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) as a reference. Weathering rates were determined for two sites, one in northern (Flakaliden) and one in southern (Asa) Sweden. At each site, 3-4 soil profiles were analyzed at 10 cm depth intervals. Normative quantitative mineralogy was calculated from geochemical data and qualitative mineral data with the A2M program using two sets of qualitative mineralogical data inputs to Lambda 2M: (1) a site-specific mineralogy based on information about mineral identification and mineral chemical composition as determined directly by XRPD and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), and (2) regional mineralogy, representing the assumed minerals present and assumed mineral chemical compositions for large geographical areas in Sweden, as per previous published studies. Arithmetic means of the weathering rates determined from A2M inputs (W-A2M) were generally in relatively close agreement with those (W-XRPD) determined by inputs based on direct XRPD and EMPA measurements. The hypothesis that using site-specific instead of regional mineralogy will improve the confidence in mineral data input to PROFILE was supported for Flakaliden. However, at Asa, site-specific mineralogies reduced the discrepancy for Na between W-A2M and W-XRPD but produced larger and significant discrepancies for K, Ca and Mg. For Ca and Mg the differences between weathering rates based on different mineralogies could be explained by differences in the content of some specific Ca-and Mg-bearing minerals, in particular amphibole, apatite, pyroxene and illite. Improving the accuracy in the determination of these minerals would reduce weathering uncertainties. High uncertainties in mineralogy, due for example to different A2M assumptions, had surprisingly little effect on the predicted weathering of Na- and K-bearing minerals. This can be explained by the fact that the weathering rate constants for the minerals involved, e.g. K feldspar and micas, are similar in PROFILE. Improving the description of the dissolution rate kinetics of the plagioclase mineral group as well as major K-bearing minerals (K feldspars and micas) should be a priority to help improve future weathering estimates with the PROFILE model.

Here, we propose the use of the probability of detection as a metric to assess the feasibility of management actions for alien species. We explore how detectability can influence the management of alien reptiles, a group of emergent alien vertebrates globally. We use a Rapid Biological Assessment method (time-limited transects) to estimate the probability of detection for alien reptiles present on Christmas Island (Australia). Across the five species studied, we found low probabilities of detection and poor explanatory capacity of the individual covariates included in our models. These findings indicate that management options to deal with alien reptiles are limited due to the potential high cost and low efficacy associated with low probabilities of detection. Strict preventive strategies, firmly espousing the principles of adaptiveness and precautionary policies, combined with early detection and biosecurity response activities are needed to address the emergence of alien reptiles. Our research was focussed on alien reptiles on islands, but the rise of new pools of alien species from all taxonomic realms across the world suggests that our conclusions may be applicable more generally. Further research is called for to explore the applicability of our conclusions and recommendations to other taxonomic groups and regions of the world.

Substantial oceanographic changes in 2015 and 2016, due to the anomalously warm ocean conditions associated with a large-scale marine heatwave perturbation, resulted in onshore and northward advection of warmer and more stratified surface waters resulting in reduced upwelling. Here we quantify changes in the macrozooplankton and micronekton community composition and structure based on five highly contrasting ocean conditions. Data from fine-mesh pelagic trawl surveys conducted off Oregon and Washington during early summer of 2011 and 2013-2016 were examined for interannual changes in spatial distribution and abundance of fish and invertebrate taxa. Overall species diversity was highest in 2015 and lowest in 2011, but 2016 was similar to the other years, although the evenness was somewhat lower. The community of taxa in both 2015 and 2016 was significantly different from the previously sampled years. Crustacean plankton densities (especially Euphausiidae) were extremely low in both of these years, and the invertebrate composition became dominated mostly by gelatinous zooplankton. Fishes and cephalopods showed mixed trends overall, but some species such as age-0 Pacific hake were found in relatively high abundances mainly along the shelf break in 2015 and 2016. These results suggest dramatically different pelagic communities were present during the recent warm years with a greater contribution from offshore taxa, especially gelatinous taxa, during 2015 and 2016. The substantial reorganization of the pelagic community has the potential to lead to major alterations in trophic functioning in this normally productive ecosystem.

The Galapagos Islands are renowned for their exceptional biological diversity; however, marine dinoflagellate communities have not been represented in biodiversity assessments. Therefore, this study aims to provide key information about dinoflagellate diversity and abundances, with special attention to harmful species, during a weak La Nina event in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). The study was performed during March-April 2017 and four transects were conducted at four Islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Fe, Seymour, and Pinzon) representing the southern region of the GMR. Water net samples were collected at 2, 5, and 10 nautical miles (nm) from the coast, at a total of 48 sampling sites. The presence of toxic species, and their cell abundance was estimated in seven transects at 0, 15, and 30 m of depth. A total of 152 taxa belonging to 7 orders, 22 families, and 38 genera were registered. The number of taxa found is almost three times higher than the maximum observed in previous studies. Dinoflagellate species richness among stations ranged between 53 and 23 taxa and was higher in northern sites. From the applied cluster analysis, five dinoflagellate assemblages were identified as a discrete community structure, one was found only in Santa Fe Island, which is probably related to the presence of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). Regarding cell abundance estimations, low abundances were registered throughout the sampling sites and no blooms were detected. Higher abundances were registered in the northern transects coinciding with one of the most productive areas of the archipelago, situated north of Santa Cruz. Among the identified taxa, 19 of them were potentially toxic, including epiphytic species, allowing the possibility of blooms in benthic areas. This study presents the first record of several dinoflagellate species in the area (both nontoxic and harmful species) and thus, emphasizing the need for the implementation of phytoplankton monitoring programs by the government to prevent potential ecological, sanitary and economic impacts in the GMR.

Measurements of Greenhouse Gas Flux from Composting Green-Waste Using Micrometeorological Mass Balance and Flow-Through Chambers	COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION			English	Article							NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; METHANE EMISSIONS; DAIRY MANURE; LANDFILL; VOLATILIZATION; CARBON; RATES; N2O; CH4	Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are produced during the composting process, but few studies have measured emissions from a full-scale windrow of composting green-waste. This is important for evaluating composting as a waste management option and for understanding how changes to current composting management practices could help reduce emissions. This study uses micrometeorological mass balance (MMB) and open flow-through chamber techniques to measure emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a windrow of composting green-waste in Northern California. The MMB technique yielded mean upwind-downwind concentration differences over the study period that showed sourcing of all three GHGs. CO2 showed a stronger signal than CH4 and N2O. A strong diel pattern was found in the concentration differences at lower levels and fluxes of CO2, with substantial noise likely obscuring any possible daily patterns for CH4 and N2O. Fluxes normalized by the time since the previous turn event revealed an initial rapid rise in CO2 concentration differences (at lower levels) and fluxes, peaking close to 13 h after the turn event followed by a gradual decline. The same pattern was not as clear for the other two gases but overall declines in concentration differences and fluxes were apparent with increasing time since the previous turn event. Substantial differences between MMB and chamber calculated fluxes were found, due to both differences in the techniques as well as sampling frequency.

Bacterial Insights into the Formation of Opaline Stromatolites from the Chimalacatepec Lava Tube System, Mexico	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Biospeleothems; cave bacteria; lava tube; microbial mat; opal	MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; SIERRA-CHICHINAUTZIN; SCORIA CONES; CAVE; DIVERSITY; SPELEOTHEMS; MINERALS; BIOFILM; SOUTH; MATS	Cave lithifying systems are excellent models to study biomineralization in the dark. The Chimalacatepec Lava Tube System in Mexico harbors diverse biospeleothems where previous studies suggest that the formation of opaline terrestrial stromatolites is related to microorganisms in contiguous mats. However, there is no information regarding their characterization and their role in mineral formation. In this study, we characterized the bacterial and archaeal composition of microbial mats and stromatolites and suggested the main processes involved in the genesis of opaline stromatolites. Our results showed that the microbial mats and stromatolites have a similar 16S rRNA gene composition, but stromatolites contain more Actinobacteria, which have been previously found in other lava tubes together with other key bacteria. Microorganisms found here belonged to groups with the potential to fix carbon and degrade organic matter. We propose that the synergic interaction of autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms that thrive in the dark might be inducing carbonate precipitation within the Ca-enriched extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), generating opal-A and calcite laminae. The similar 16S rRNA gene fingerprint and the presence of potential pathways that induce carbonate precipitation in opaline stromatolites and microbial mats suggest that microbial mats lithify and contribute to the stromatolite biotic genesis.

In such systems, little is known about root dynamics which may depend on individual plant properties and environment as well as seasonal water shortages and site fertility. Patterns of root biomass and activity are affected by the presence of scattered trees, grazing, site management, and chronic nitrogen deposition, all of which can affect nutrient ratios and potentially cause development of nitrogen : phosphorus (N : P) imbalances in ecosystem stoichiometry. In this study we combined observations from minirhizotrons with root measurements from direct soil cores and ingrowth cores, along with measures of above-ground biomass to investigate seasonal root dynamics and root : shoot ratios in a Mediterranean tree-grass "savanna". We investigated responses to soil fertility, using nutrient manipulation (N = NP addition) and spatial microhabitat treatments between open-pasture and microhabitats under the tree canopy. Root dynamics over time were also compared with indices of above-ground growth drawn from proximal remote sensing. Results show distinct differences in root dynamics and biomass between treatments and microhabitats. Root biomass was higher with N additions, but did not differ from the control with NP additions in early spring. By the end of the growing season root biomass had increased with NP in open pastures but not higher than N added alone. In contrast, root length density (RLD) in pastures responded stronger to the NP than N-only addition, while beneath trees root biomass tended to be higher with only N. Even though root biomass increased, the root : shoot ratio decreased under nutrient treatments. Timing of root and shoot growth was reasonably well paired, although in autumn root growth appeared to be substantially slower than "regreening" of the system. We interpret these differences as a shift in community structure and/or root traits under changing stoichiometry induced by the fertilization. We also consider seasonal (phenology) differences in the strength and direction of effects observed.	[Nair, Richard K.

While it holds true that the highest concentrations of plastic particles are found in these locations (10(3)-10(4) particles m(-3) in sediments vs. 0.1-1 particles m(-3) in the water column), our meta-analysis also highlights that in open oceans, microplastic polymer types segregated in the water column according to their density. Lower density polymers, such as polypropylene and polyethylene, dominated sea surface samples (25% and 42%, respectively) but decreased in abundance through the water column (3% and 2% in the deep-sea, respectively), whereas only denser polymers (i.e. polyesters and acrylics) were enriched with depth (5% in surface seawater vs. 77% in deep-sea locations). Our meta-analysis demonstrates that some of the most abundant and recalcitrant manufactured plastics are more persistent in the sea surface than previously anticipated and that further research is required to determine the ultimate fate of these polymers as current knowledge does not support the deep sea as the final sink for all polymer types.

Here, we attempt to fill this gap by studying several aspects of its biology. We sampled P. depressa in the reefs of Coruripe, Brazil and investigated the sex ratio, body size, maturity, the allometric growth of the gonopod in males and of the abdomen in females, the reproductive effort, the breeding season and the influence of environmental variables. We found that 1) the sex ratio, overall, does not deviate from 1:1; 2) females (33.71 +/- 10.62 mm) are larger than males (30.45 +/- 9.94 mm; t(1,764): -4.40, p<0.001); 3) males (23.42 +/- 0.24 mm) mature at smaller sizes than females (26.78 +/- 0.19 mm); 4) the growth of the gonopod is positive allometric in juveniles (slope = 1.66 +/- 0.04), but negative allometric in adolescents (0.93 +/- 0.02) and adults (slope = 0.86 +/- 0.03). In females, the abdomen undergoes a positive allometry in juveniles (slope = 1.74 +/- 0.04) and adolescents (slope = 1.97 +/- 0.09), but an isometric growth in adults (slope = 0.99 +/- 0.04); 5) the breeding period is continuous and not influenced by rainfall, water temperature and salinity; 6) egg mass strongly increases with body mass (slope = 1.56, R-2=0.84, p<0.001).

The Genomics of Circadian Timing in a Wild Bird, the Great Tit (Parus major)	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						circadian rhythm; clock; GWAS; heritability; Parus major	LATITUDINAL CLINE; CLOCK; GENE; SELECTION; RHYTHMS; ORGANIZATION; VARIABILITY; MUTATION; LENGTH; PERIOD	Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous among taxa and are essential for coping with recurrent daily events, leading to selection on the properties of the clock underlying these rhythms. To quantify this selection in the wild, we need, however, to phenotype wild individuals, which is difficult using the standard laboratory approach for which individuals need to be kept under constant conditions. To overcome this problem, we explored the possibility to link the variation in a key clock property, circadian period (Tau), to genetic variation. We measured Tau in 152 captive great tits (Parus major). We further linked Tau to two circadian phase markers, the onset of activity in the Light:Dark cycle, and the first onset in constant conditions (Dim:Dim), directly after entrainment. We did a genome-wide association study using a 650 k SNP chip, and we linked genetic polymorphisms of a set of 12 candidate genes, to Tau and the two circadian phase markers. In line with earlier studies, Tau was heritable (h(2) = 0.48 +/- 0.22). Despite this genetic variation, we did not find any significant associations at the genome-wide level with the measured traits and only one candidate gene showed association with onset of activity in the Light:Dark cycle. Identifying the genetic base of circadian timing for wild species thus remains challenging. Including alternative molecular methods such as epigenetics or transcriptomics could help to unravel the molecular basis of the biological clock in great tits.

However, studying coordination at the pair level presents two analytical difficulties. First, alternating or synchronous (i.e., simultaneous) feeding can occur randomly and be induced by a shared environment. Therefore, a null model must account for this apparent coordination that occurs by chance. Second, alternation and synchrony in provisioning are intrinsically linked to the rate of provisioning itself, and the effects of coordination and provisioning rate, for instance on fitness, need to be distinguished. In this paper, we explore several randomization procedures and simulation scenarios to tease apart true coordination from random alternation and synchrony, and to find an appropriate statistical model for analyzing coordination. First, to establish a baseline of alternated or synchronous visits expected by chance, we took data from a natural population of house sparrows and randomized inter-feeding intervals in various ways. Alternation and synchrony in the observed dataset were higher than expected by chance under any of our randomizations. However, it was impossible to exclude that alternation and synchrony patterns did not arise due to the pair's shared environment. Second, to identify a way of statistically modeling coordination without generating spurious effects due to intrinsic mathematical relationships between coordination and provisioning rates, we simulated data according to different scenarios. Only one out of five candidate models for analyzing alternation was deemed appropriate, and gave similarly appropriate results for analyzing synchrony. This work highlights the importance and difficulty of finding an adequate null model for studying behavioral coordination and other emergent behaviors. In addition, it demonstrates that analyzing simulated data, prior to analyzing empirical data, enables researchers to avoid spurious effects.

Understanding Where We Are Well: Neighborhood-Level Social and Environmental Correlates of Well-Being in the Stanford Well for Life Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						well-being; wellness; geography; neighborhoods; spatial analysis; social determinants of health		Individual well-being is a complex concept that varies among and between individuals and is impacted by individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, policy and environmental factors. This research explored associations between select environmental characteristics measured at the ZIP code level and individual well-being. Participants (n = 3288, mean age = 41.4 years, 71.0% female, 57.9% white) were drawn from a registry of individuals who completed the Stanford WELL for Life Scale (SWLS), a 76-question online survey that asks about 10 domains of well-being: social connectedness, lifestyle and daily practices, physical health, stress and resilience, emotional and mental health, purpose and meaning, sense of self, financial security and satisfaction, spirituality and religiosity, and exploration and creativity. Based on a nationally-representative 2018 study of associations between an independent well-being measure and county-level characteristics, we selected twelve identical or analogous neighborhood (ZIP-code level) indicators to test against the SWLS measure and its ten constituent domains. Data were collected from secondary sources to describe socio-economic (median household income, percent unemployment, percent child poverty), demographic (race/ethnicity), and physical environment (commute by bicycle and public transit), and healthcare (number of healthcare facilities, percent mammogram screenings, percent preventable hospital stays). All continuous neighborhood factors were re-classified into quantile groups. Linear mixed models were fit to assess relationships between each neighborhood measure and each of the ten domains of well-being, as well as the overall SWLS well-being measure, and were adjusted for spatial autocorrelation and individual-level covariates. In models exploring associations between the overall SWLS score and neighborhood characteristics, six of the twelve neighborhood factors exhibited significant differences between quantile groups (p < 0.05). All of the ten SWLS domains had at least one instance of significant (p < 0.05) variation across quantile groups for a neighborhood factor; stress and resilience, emotional and mental health, and financial security had the greatest number of significant associations (6/12 factors), followed by physical health (5/12 factors) and social connectedness (4/12 factors). All but one of the neighborhood factors (number of Federally Qualified Health Centers) showed at least one significant association with a well-being domain. Among the neighborhood factors with the most associations with well-being domains were rate of preventable hospital stays (7/10 domains), percent holding bachelor's degrees (6/10 domains), and median income and percent with less than high school completion (5/10 domains). These observational insights suggest that neighborhood factors are associated with individuals' overall self-rated well-being, though variation exists among its constituent domains. Further research that employs such multi-dimensional measures of well-being is needed to determine targets for intervention at the neighborhood level that may improve well-being at both the individual and, ultimately, neighborhood levels.

The Spatial Synoptic Classification is a useful tool for assessing weather effects on health because it considers the combined effect of meteorological factors rather than temperature only. The aim of this study was to assess the association between oppressive weather types and daily total mortality in Sweden. Time-series Poisson regression with distributed lags was used to assess the relationship between oppressive weather (Dry Polar, Dry Tropical, Moist Polar, and Moist Tropical) and daily deaths over 14 days in the extended summer (May to September), and 28 days during the extended winter (November to March), from 1991 to 2014. Days not classified as oppressive weather served as the reference category. We computed relative risks with 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for trends and seasonality. Results of the southern (Skane and Stockholm) and northern (Jamtland and Vasterbotten) locations were pooled using meta-analysis for regional-level estimates. Analyses were performed using the dlnm and mvmeta packages in R. During summer, in the South, the Moist Tropical and Dry Tropical weather types increased the mortality at lag 0 through lag 3 and lag 6, respectively. Moist Polar weather was associated with mortality at longer lags. In the North, Dry Tropical weather increased the mortality at shorter lags. During winter, in the South, Dry Polar and Moist Polar weather increased mortality from lag 6 to lag 10 and from lag 19 to lag 26, respectively. No effect of oppressive weather was found in the North. The effect of oppressive weather types in Sweden varies across seasons and regions. In the North, a small study sample reduces precision of estimates, while in the South, the effect of oppressive weather types is more evident in both seasons.

Not much is known about the health effects in adults. We investigated the association of residential exposure to road traffic noise and annoyance due to road traffic noise with cognitive function in a cohort of 288 elderly women from the longitudinal Study on the influence of Air pollution on Lung function, Inflammation and Aging (SALIA) in Germany. Residential noise levelsweighted 24-h mean (L-DEN) and nighttime noise (L-NIGHT)were modeled for the most exposed facade of dwellings and dichotomized at 50 dB(A). Traffic noise annoyance (day and night) was estimated by questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry on Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-Plus) Neuropsychological Assessment Battery. The modeled noise levels were associated with impaired total cognition and the constructional praxis domain, independently of air pollution. Self-reported noise annoyance was associated with better performance in semantic memory and constructional praxis domains. This finding should be interpreted with caution since we could not control for potential confounding by hearing loss. Noise levels and annoyance were associated, but their health effects seemed mutually independent.

Global Health Perspectives on Cigarette Butts and the Environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						tobacco product waste; framework convention; cigarette butts; tobacco control	PUBLIC-POLICY; TOBACCO; WASTE; FRAMEWORK; ATTITUDES; TOXICITY; IMPACTS; SMOKERS	Cigarette butts, which are also known as tobacco product waste (TPW), are the single most collected item in environmental trash cleanups worldwide. This study used an online survey tool (Qualtrics) to assess knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding this issue among individuals representing the Framework Convention Alliance (FCA). The FCA has about 680 members on its listserv, including non-governmental tobacco control advocacy groups that support the implementation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Respondents (n = 65) represented countries from all six WHO regions. The majority (82%) had heard the term TPW, and they all considered TPW as an environmental harm at some level. Additionally, 29% of respondents failed to identify that cigarette filters make smoking easier. Most (73%) correctly identified TPW components; however, fewer (60%) correctly identified the composition of cigarette butts. The majority (57%) were unfamiliar with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Product Stewardship (PS) as possible environmental intervention strategies. Respondents expressing opinions concurred that adding a litter fee to fund TPW programs will aid in reducing tobacco use and reduce the environmental impacts of TPW (100%); that prevention, reduction, and mitigation of TPW could be an important part of international tobacco control programs (98%); and, that banning smoking in outdoor venues could reduce TPW (95%). Only 16% reported effective prevention or clean-up efforts in their countries. Weighted rankings revealed that respondents' saw the national government, the tobacco industry, and state governments as the most important in addressing TPW. The results of this research will inform continuing international discussions by the FCTC Conference of the Parties (COP) regarding environmental policies that may be addressed within FCTC obligations.

We formulated a hypothesis that some factors, i.e., frailty, medical and functional factors, psychological factors, quality of life, awareness of recommendations, and sociodemographic factors influence the decisions of taking up physical activity. This prospective study comprised 72 dialysis patients aged 57.8 +/- 16.0 ( +/- SD; in the range of 19-87 years of age). The following research tools were used: an interview about awareness of the physical activity recommendations, the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Scale (CSHA-CFS), scales for the assessment of functional status, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), and the questionnaire of Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-SF 1.3). The majority of patients diagnosed with frailty did not follow the physical activity recommendations (79.3%). Quality of life was better in active patients compared to inactive patients, especially in the domains of sleep and physical performance. The severity of trait anxiety was significantly higher in patients who did not follow the recommendations compared to patients who adhered to physical activity recommendations (46.0 +/- 10.5 vs. 40.0 +/- 8.2; ). The likelihood of adherence decreased by 1% after each subsequent month of dialysis (odds ratio = 0.99; 95% confidence interval = 0.972-0.999; ). Adherence was most limited by frailty. Adherence to recommendations on physical activity was affected by: motivation, lower levels of trait anxiety, and better quality of life. Age modified the effect of awareness and acceptance of the disease on adherence to physical activity recommendations.

In order to study the response of soil microbes to vegetation restoration in coal mining subsidence areas, the composition and distribution of soil microbes were discussed through three plots: unsubsided area (CA), new subsided area (NSA), and old subsided area (OSA) with different vegetation restoration time in Huabei coal mine. Meanwhile, changes in soil catalase and urease activity were explored and the correlation between soil bacteria, fungi, and environmental factors was analysed. The results demonstrated that Nitrospira was the dominant bacteria in all areas sampled. Microorganisms in the 0-20 cm and 40-60 cm soil layers of OSA had the highest Simpson index, whereas the index in NSA was lowest (at all soil depths). The catalase activity in NSA was significantly higher than that in CA, and there was no significant difference in catalase activity with soil depth, while the urease activity declined gradually with increasing soil depth. The urease activity in the 20-60 cm soil layer of NSA and OSA was significantly higher than that of CA. Furthermore, the distribution of bacteria was mainly affected by soil organic matter, available potassium, available phosphorus, and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, whereas pH and catalase activity mainly affected fungal distribution. These results implied that soil catalase activity in NSA and urease activity in the 20-40 cm soil layer of NSA and OSA were significantly enhanced after vegetation restoration, and that long-term plant restoration could improve soil fertility and soil microbial community diversity in coal mining areas.

In this study, ash trees (Fraxinus Chinensis) were planted on pervious pavement (PP), impervious pavement (IPP), and non-pavement (NP) plots. After five years, we determined the soil bacterial community composition and diversity by high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The results of our field experiment reveal that the presence of pavement changed soil bacterial community composition and decreased the Shannon index, but had no impact on the Chao 1 at the 0-20 cm layer. However, we achieved the opposite result at a depth of 20-80 cm. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in bacterial community composition using the Shannon index and the Chao 1 at the 80-100 cm layer. Soil total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), NO3--N, and available potassium (AK) were the main factors that influenced soil bacterial composition and diversity across different pavements. Soil bacterial composition and diversity had no notable difference between PP and IPPs at different soil layers. Our results strongly indicate that pavements have a greater impact on topsoil bacterial communities than do subsoils, and PPs did not provide a better habitat for micro-organisms when compared to IPPs in the short term.

Rapid Transit Systems: Smarter Urban Planning Using Big Data, In-Memory Computing, Deep Learning, and GPUs	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						rapid transit systems; metro; London underground; tube; big data; deep learning; TensorFlow; Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs); in-memory computing; Graphics Processing Units (GPUs); transport planning; transport prediction; smart cities; smart transportation	TRAIN; LOGISTICS; TRANSPORT	Rapid transit systems or metros are a popular choice for high-capacity public transport in urban areas due to several advantages including safety, dependability, speed, cost, and lower risk of accidents. Existing studies on metros have not considered appropriate holistic urban transport models and integrated use of cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach toward large-scale and faster prediction of metro system characteristics by employing the integration of four leading-edge technologies: big data, deep learning, in-memory computing, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Using London Metro as a case study, and the Rolling Origin and Destination Survey (RODS) (real) dataset, we predict the number of passengers for six time intervals (a) using various access transport modes to reach the train stations (buses, walking, etc.); (b) using various egress modes to travel from the metro station to their next points of interest (PoIs); (c) traveling between different origin-destination (OD) pairs of stations; and (d) against the distance between the OD stations. The prediction allows better spatiotemporal planning of the whole urban transport system, including the metro subsystem, and its various access and egress modes. The paper contributes novel deep learning models, algorithms, implementation, analytics methodology, and software tool for analysis of metro systems.

Yet, removing dams from small streams also represents a major disturbance to rivers that can have varied impacts on environmental conditions and aquatic biota. We examined the effects of dam removal on the structure, function, and composition of benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities in a temperate New England stream. We examined the effects of dam removal over the dam removal time-series using linear mixed effects models, autoregressive models, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and indicator and similarity analyses. The results indicated that the dam removal stimulated major shifts in BMI community structure and composition above and below the dam, and that the BMI communities are becoming more similar over time. The mixed model analysis revealed that BMI functional groups and diversity were significantly influenced by sample site and several BMI groups also experienced significant interactions between site and dam stage (P < 0.05), while the multivariate analyses revealed that community structure continues to differ among sites, even three years after dam removal. Our findings indicate that stream restoration through dam removal can have site-specific influences on BMI communities, that interactions among BMI taxa are important determinants of the post-dam removal community, and that the post-dam-removal BMI community continues to be in a state of reorganization.

However, unpredictable climatic events may interact with hunting. We established a population model for European hares (Lepus europaeus) in Lower Austria. We compared the sustainability of voluntary quotas used by hunterswhich are derived from hare-specific guidelineswith the actual numbers of hares shot and our recommended quotas for hares, which have been derived from climate and population modeling. We used population modeling based on vital rates and densities to adjust our recommended quotas in order to achieve sustainable harvest. The survival of age classes 1 and 3 had the highest impact on the population growth rate. Population viability analysis showed that a recommended quota with a harvest rate of 10% was sustainable for population densities of 45 hares/km(2), and that the threshold for hunting should be raised from 10 hares/km(2) so that hare populations with <15 hares/km(2) are not hunted. The recommended quota outperformed the voluntary hunting quota, since more hares could be harvested sustainably. Age Class 1 survival was strongly linked with weather: a single year with unfavorable weather conditions (low precipitation) negatively affected population densities. Game species, including the European hare, face increasingly frequent weather extremes due to climate change, so hunting quotas need to be sensitive to frequent population fluctuations.

Recently, the spread of aquatic weed infestations (Eichhornia crassipes, Egeria densa, Ludwigia spp., and Onagraceae) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of northern California has raised concerns, and nitrogen loading from California's intensive farming regions is considered as one of the major contributors. In this study, we employed the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate nitrogen exports from the agriculturally intensive San Joaquin River watershed to the Delta. The alternate tile drainage routine in SWAT was tested against monitoring data in the tile-drained area of the watershed to examine the suitability of the new routine for a tile nitrate simulation. We found that the physically based Hooghoudt and Kirkham tile drain routine improved model performance in representing tile nitrate runoff, which contributed to 40% of the nitrate loading to the San Joaquin River. Calibration results show that the simulated riverine nitrate loads matched the observed data fairly well. According to model simulation, the San Joaquin River plays a critical role in exporting nitrogen to the Delta by exporting 3135 tons of nitrate-nitrogen annually, which has a strong ecological implication in supporting the growth of aquatic weeds, which has impeded water flow, impairs commercial navigation and recreational activities, and degrades water quality in Bay-Delta waterways. Since nitrate loadings contributed by upstream runoff are an important nutrient to facilitate weed development, our study results should be seen as a prerequisite to evaluate the potential growth impact of aquatic weeds and scientific evidence for area-wide weed control decisions.

Although soils worldwide are extremely biodiverse, the relationship between decomposers (fauna and microorganisms), and ecosystem function is poorly understood. Collembola are abundant and ubiquitous microarthropods that are found in terrestrial ecosystems. They can affect the amount of biomass and the activity of microbial communities, either directly through selectively feeding on fungi and bacteria, or indirectly by dissemination of microbial propagules, and the alteration of nutrient availability. However, despite the functional role they play in belowground food webs, the interactions between natural assemblages of soil microbes and Collembola receive little attention. This study, conducted in microcosm conditions, examines the effects of two distinct natural assemblages of functional groups of Collembola (ep- and euedaphic) upon microbial communities using PLFA markers and their associated soil functions (e.g., enzymatic activities and C mineralization rate) over a 2-month period. Our principal objective was to determine whether different functional groups of Collembola had varying effects on microbial soil community abundance, structure and activity, resulting in potentially important effects on ecosystem processes. Our findings show that the interactions of the functional groups of Collembola with microbial communities vary significantly whether they are alone or combined. A distinct response in the composition of the microbial communities was found at the end of the 2-month period. The communities were significantly different from each other in terms of PLFA marker composition. We found that the epedaphic species were related to and promoted Gram+ bacteria whereas euedaphic species were related to Gram- bacterial markers. This had further repercussions on soil function, such as nutrient recycling. Combining both functional groups did not lead to a complementary effect on soil microbial properties, with a drastically different outcome between the first and the second month of the experiment. Additional research dealing with the interactions between decomposers using natural assemblages will help to predict the functional outcomes of soil biota structure and composition.

Dominance network analysis provides a new framework for studying the diversity-stability relationship	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						community dominance; core-periphery network; diversity-stability relationship; human microbiome; mean crowding; nestedness; skeleton network; species dominance network; trio motifs	VAGINAL MICROBIOME; DYNAMICS; HEALTH; COMPLEXITY; MODELS	The diversity-stability relationship is a long-standing, central focus of community ecology. Two major challenges have impeded studies of the diversity-stability relationship (DSR): the difficulty in obtaining high-quality longitudinal data sets; and the lack of a general theoretical framework that can encompass the enormous complexity inherent in "diversity," "stability," and their many interactions. Metagenomic "Big Data" now provide high quality longitudinal data sets, and the human microbiome project (HMP) offers an unprecedented opportunity to reinvigorate investigations of DSRs. We introduce a new framework for exploring DSRs that has three parts: (1) a cross-scale measure of dominance with a simple mathematical form that can be applied simultaneously to individual species and entire communities and can be used to construct species dominance networks (SDNs); (2) analysis of SDNs based on special trio motifs, core-periphery, rich-club, and nested structures, and high salience skeletons; and (3) a synthesis of coarse-scale core/periphery/community-level stability modeling with fine-scale analysis of SDNs that further reveals the stability properties of the community structures. We apply this new approach to data from the human vaginal microbiome of the HMP, simultaneously illustrating its utility in developing and testing theories of diversity and stability while providing new insights into the underlying ecology and etiology of a human microbiome-associated disease.

Eighteen years of ecological monitoring reveals multiple lines of evidence for tundra vegetation change	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						climate change; community composition; greening; growth; permafrost; phenology; tundra; warming	HIGH NORTHERN LATITUDES; SHRUB EXPANSION; PLANT PHENOLOGY; GROWING-SEASON; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; BREEDING HABITAT; HERSCHEL ISLAND; PATCH DYNAMICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE	The Arctic tundra is warming rapidly, yet the exact mechanisms linking warming and observed ecological changes are often unclear. Understanding mechanisms of change requires long-term monitoring of multiple ecological parameters. Here, we present the findings of a collaboration between government scientists, local people, park rangers, and academic researchers that provide insights into changes in plant composition, phenology, and growth over 18 yr on Qikiqtaruk-Herschel Island, Canada. Qikiqtaruk is an important focal research site located at the latitudinal tall shrub line in the western Arctic. This unique ecological monitoring program indicates the following findings: (1) nine days per decade advance of spring phenology, (2) a doubling of average plant canopy height per decade, but no directional change in shrub radial growth, and (3) a doubling of shrub and graminoid abundance and a decrease by one-half in bare ground cover per decade. Ecological changes are concurrent with satellite-observed greening and, when integrated, suggest that indirect warming from increased growing season length and active layer depths, rather than warming summer air temperatures alone, could be important drivers of the observed tundra vegetation change. Our results highlight the vital role that long-term and multi-parameter ecological monitoring plays in both the detection and attribution of global change.	[Myers-Smith, Isla H.; Thomas, Haydn J.

A comprehensive analysis of autocorrelation and bias in home range estimation	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						animal movement; kernel density estimation; local convex hull; minimum convex polygon; range distribution; space use; telemetry; tracking data	GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM; BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES; ANIMAL BEHAVIOR; MOVEMENT DATA; SAMPLE-SIZE; TELEMETRY; DENSITY; TIME; CONSERVATION; SPACE	Home range estimation is routine practice in ecological research. While advances in animal tracking technology have increased our capacity to collect data to support home range analysis, these same advances have also resulted in increasingly autocorrelated data. Consequently, the question of which home range estimator to use on modern, highly autocorrelated tracking data remains open. This question is particularly relevant given that most estimators assume independently sampled data. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of autocorrelation on home range estimation. We base our study on an extensive data set of GPS locations from 369 individuals representing 27 species distributed across five continents. We first assemble a broad array of home range estimators, including Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with four bandwidth optimizers (Gaussian reference function, autocorrelated-Gaussian reference function [AKDE], Silverman's rule of thumb, and least squares cross-validation), Minimum Convex Polygon, and Local Convex Hull methods. Notably, all of these estimators except AKDE assume independent and identically distributed (IID) data. We then employ half-sample cross-validation to objectively quantify estimator performance, and the recently introduced effective sample size for home range area estimation ((N) over cap (area)) to quantify the information content of each data set. We found that AKDE 95% area estimates were larger than conventional IID-based estimates by a mean factor of 2. The median number of cross-validated locations included in the hold-out sets by AKDE 95% (or 50%) estimates was 95.3% (or 50.1%), confirming the larger AKDE ranges were appropriately selective at the specified quantile. Conversely, conventional estimates exhibited negative bias that increased with decreasing (N) over cap (area). To contextualize our empirical results, we performed a detailed simulation study to tease apart how sampling frequency, sampling duration, and the focal animal's movement conspire to affect range estimates. Paralleling our empirical results, the simulation study demonstrated that AKDE was generally more accurate than conventional methods, particularly for small (N) over cap (area). While 72% of the 369 empirical data sets had >1,000 total observations, only 4% had an (N) over cap (area) >1,000, where 30% had an (N) over cap (area) <30. In this frequently encountered scenario of small <(N)over cap>(area), AKDE was the only estimator capable of producing an accurate home range estimate on autocorrelated data.

The intrinsic predictability of ecological time series and its potential to guide forecasting	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						empirical dynamic modelling; forecasting; information theory; permutation entropy; population dynamics; time series analysis	LONG-TERM; PERMUTATION ENTROPY; PREDICTION; DYNAMICS; COMPLEXITY; EVOLUTION	Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are complex, stochastic, and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems' intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE-FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.

Spatially structured ecological networks are often used to represent spatial landscape-genetic relationships, where nodes represent individuals or populations and resistance to movement is represented using non-binary edge weights. Weights are typically assigned or estimated by the user, rather than observed, and validating such weights is challenging. We provide a synthesis of current methods used to estimate edge weights and an overview of common model types, stressing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and their ability to model landscape-genetic data. We further explore a set of spatial-statistical methods that provide ecologists with alternative approaches for modeling spatially explicit processes that may affect genetic structure. This includes an overview of spatial autoregressive models, with a particular focus on how correlation and partial correlation are used to represent neighborhood structure with the inverse of the covariance matrix (i.e., precision matrix). We then demonstrate how to model resistance by specifying an appropriate statistical model on the nodes, conditioned on the edge weights, through the precision matrix. This integration of network ecology and spatial statistics provides a practical analytical framework for landscape-genetic studies. The results can be used to make statistical inferences about the relative importance of individual landscape characteristics, such as the vegetative cover, hillslope, or the presence of roads or rivers, on gene flow. In addition, the R code we include allows readers to explore landscape-genetic structure in their own datasets, which will potentially provide new insights into the evolutionary processes that generated ecological networks, as well as valuable information about the optimal characteristics of conservation corridors.

Despite its ubiquity, our understanding of this invisible but often critical relationship is still in its infancy. We employed adult Neotropical butterflies as a study system to ask three questions: First, how does gut microbial community composition vary across host individuals, species and dietary guilds? Second, how do gut microbiota compare to food microbial communities? Finally, are gut flora functionally adapted to the chemical makeup of host foods? To answer these questions we captured nearly 300 Costa Rican butterflies representing over 50 species, six families, and two feeding guilds: frugivores and nectivores. We characterized bacteria and fungi in guts, wild fruits, and wild nectars via amplicon sequencing and assessed the catabolic abilities of the gut microbiota via culture-based assays. Gut communities were distinct from food communities, suggesting that the gut environment acts as a filter on potential colonists. Nevertheless, gut flora varied widely among individuals and species. On average, a pair of butterflies shared 21% of their bacterial species and 6% of their fungi. Host species explained 25-30% of variation in microbial communities while host diet explained 4%, suggesting that non-dietary aspects of host biology play a large role in structuring the butterfly gut flora. Much of the variation between species correlated with host phylogeny. Host diet was related to gut microbial function: compared to frugivores, nectivores' gut flora exhibited increased catabolism of sugars and sugar alcohols and decreased catabolism of amino acids, carboxylic acids, and dicarboxylic acids. Since fermented juice contains more amino acids and less sugar than nectar, it appears that host diet filters the gut flora by favoring microbes that digest compounds abundant in foods. By quantifying the degree to which gut communities vary among host individuals, species and dietary guilds and evaluating how gut microbial composition and catabolic potential are related to host diet, this study highlights the linkages between structure and function in one of the most complex and ubiquitous symbioses in the animal kingdom.

Movement response to landscape variables occurs at multiple temporal scales, from sub-diurnal to multiannual. Additionally, individuals may respond to both current and past conditions of resource availability. In this paper, we examine the temporal scale and variation of current and past resource variables that affect movement patterns of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) using sub-hourly movement data from GPS-GSM collared elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. We created detailed satellite-based spatiotemporal maps of vegetation biomass, as well as distance from surface water, road and fence. We used step selection functions to measure the relative importance of these landscape variables in determining elephants' local movement patterns. We also examined how elephants respond to information, in locations they have previously visited, on productivity integrated over different temporal scales: from current to historical conditions. Our results demonstrate that elephants choose patches with higher than average annual productivity and grass biomass, but lower tree biomass. Elephants also prefer to walk close to water, roads, and fences. These preferences vary with time of day and with season, thereby providing insights into diurnal and seasonal behavioral patterns and the ecological importance of the landscape variables examined. We also discovered that elephants respond more strongly to long-term patterns of productivity than to immediate forage conditions, in familiar locations.

Negative frequency-dependent growth underlies the stable coexistence of two cosmopolitan aquatic plants	ECOLOGY			English	Article						aquatic plants; coexistence; competition; dormancy; invasibility; Lemnaceae; negative frequency dependence; storage effect; temperature	SPECIES COEXISTENCE; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; NICHE DIFFERENCES; LEMNA-MINUTA; MECHANISMS; VARIABILITY; PROMOTES; DORMANCY; LONG; CONSEQUENCES	Identifying and quantifying the mechanisms influencing species coexistence remains a major challenge for the study of community ecology. These mechanisms, which stem from species' differential responses to competition and their environments, promote coexistence if they give each species a growth advantage when rare. Yet despite the widespread assumption that co-occurring species stably coexist, there have been few empirical demonstrations in support of this claim. Likewise, coexistence is often assumed to result from interspecific differences in life-history traits, but the relative contributions of these trait differences to coexistence are rarely quantified, particularly across environmental gradients. Using two widely co-occurring and ecologically similar species of freshwater duckweed plants (Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minor), we tested hypotheses that interspecific differences in facultative dormancy behaviors, thermal reaction norms, and density-dependent growth promote coexistence between these species, and that their relative influences on coexistence change as average temperatures and fluctuations around them vary. In competition experiments, we found strong evidence for negative frequency-dependent growth across a range of both static and fluctuating temperatures, suggesting a critical role of fluctuation-independent stabilization in coexistence. This negative frequency dependence could be explained by our observation that for both species, intraspecific competition was over 1.5 times stronger than interspecific competition, granting each species a low-density growth advantage. Using an empirically parameterized competition model, we found that while coexistence was facilitated by environmental fluctuations, fluctuation-independent stabilization via negative frequency dependence was crucial for coexistence. Conversely, the temporal storage effect, an important fluctuation-dependent mechanism, was relatively weak in comparison. Contrary to expectations, differences in the species' thermal reaction norms and dormancy behaviors did not significantly promote coexistence in fluctuating environments. Our results highlight how coexistence in two ubiquitous and ostensibly similar aquatic plants is not necessarily a product of their most obvious interspecific differences, and instead results from subtle niche differences causing negative frequency-dependent growth, which acts consistently on both species across environmental gradients.

Most of the work quantifying these changes has been done in small areas and over relatively recent time scales. These land-cover transitions are highly spatially variable, and we have limited understanding of the factors underlying this variation. We use repeat photography to generate a data set of land-cover changes in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, stretching back a century and spanning a range of edaphic, topographic, and climatic conditions. Most land-cover classes were quite stable, with low probabilities of transitioning to other land-cover types. The advance of woody vegetation into low-stature tundra, and the spread of conifer trees into shrub-dominated areas, were both more likely at low elevations and in areas without permafrost. Permafrost also reduced the likelihood of herbaceous vegetation transitioning to woody cover. Exceptions to the general trend of relative stability included nearly all (96%) of the broadleaf forest-dominated areas being invaded by conifers, an expected successional trajectory, and many open gravel river bars (17.8%) transitioning to thick shrubs. These floodplain areas were distinctly not at equilibrium, as only 0.1% of shrub-dominated areas converted to gravel. Warming temperatures in coming decades and concomitant declines in the extent of permafrost are predicted to enhance the spread of woody vegetation in Denali further, but only by similar to 3%. Land-cover transitions, notably the rapid advance of trees and shrubs observed in other studies, could be less likely and more spatially heterogeneous here than in other high-latitude systems.

Despite the process information contained in the ic of N species and the associated potential for model validation, the implementation of isotopes in ecosystem models has lagged behind. To foster the validation of ecosystem models based on the ic of N species, we developed the stable isotope model for nutrient cycles (SIMONE). SIMONE uses fluxes between ecosystem N pools (soil organic N, mineral N, plants, microbes) calculated by biogeochemical models, and literature isotope effects for these processes to calculate the ic of N species. Here, we present the concept of SIMONE, apply it to simulations of the biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC, and assess the capability of N-15-N2O and, to our knowledge for the first time, SP, to constrain simulated N fluxes by LandscapeDNDC. LandscapeDNDC successfully simulated N2O emission, soil nitrate, and ammonium, as well as soil environmental conditions of an intensively managed grassland site in Switzerland. Accordingly, the dynamics of N-15-N2O and SP of soil N2O fluxes as simulated by SIMONE agreed well with measurements, though N-15-N2O was on average underestimated and SP overestimated (root-mean-square error [RMSE] of 8.4& and 7.3&, respectively). Although N-15-N2O could not constrain the N cycling process descriptions of LandscapeDNDC, the overestimation of SP indicated an overestimation of simulated nitrification rates by 10-59% at low water content, suggesting the revision of the corresponding model parameterization. Our findings show that N isotope modeling in combination with only recently available high-frequency measurements of the N2O ic are promising tools to identify and address weaknesses in N cycling of ecosystem models. This will finally contribute to augmenting the development of model-based strategies for mitigating N pollution.	[Denk, Tobias R.

Direct and indirect effects of forest microclimate on pathogen spillover	ECOLOGY			English	Article						disease ecology; emerging infectious disease; microclimate; path analysis; pathogen spillover; Phytophthora ramorum; sudden oak death	PHYTOPHTHORA-RAMORUM; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; LANDSCAPE; CALIFORNIA; TRANSMISSION; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS; HOST; SUSCEPTIBILITY; POPULATIONS	Disease dynamics are governed by variation of individuals, species, and environmental conditions across space and time. In some cases, an alternate reservoir host amplifies pathogen loads and drives disease transmission to less competent hosts in a process called pathogen spillover. Spillover is frequently associated with multi-host disease systems where a single species is more tolerant of infection and more competent in pathogen transmission compared to other hosts. Pathogen spillover must be driven by biotic factors, including host and community characteristics, yet biotic factors interact with the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature) to create disease. Despite its fundamental role in disease dynamics, the influence of the abiotic environment on pathogen spillover has seldom been examined. Improving our understanding of disease processes such as pathogen spillover hinges on disentangling the effects of interrelated biotic and abiotic factors over space and time. We applied 10 yr of fine-scale microclimate, disease, and tree community data in a path analysis to investigate the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on pathogen spillover for the emerging infectious forest disease sudden oak death (SOD). Disease transmission in SOD is primarily driven by the reservoir host California bay laurel, which supports high foliar pathogen loads that spillover onto neighboring oak trees and create lethal canker infections. The foliar pathogen load and susceptibility of oaks is expected to be sensitive to forest microclimate conditions. We found that biotic factors of pathogen load and tree diversity had relatively stronger effects on pathogen spillover compared to abiotic microclimate factors, with pathogen load increasing oak infection and tree diversity reducing oak infection. Abiotic factors still had significant effects, with greater heat exposure during summer months reducing pathogen loads and optimal pathogen conditions during the wet season increasing oak infection. Our results offer clues to possible disease dynamics under future climate change where hotter and drier or warmer and wetter conditions could have opposing effects on pathogen spillover in the SOD system. Disentangling direct and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic factors affecting disease processes can provide key insights into disease dynamics including potential avenues for reducing disease spread and predicting future epidemics.

UV-B may act as an environmental filter during plant invasions, which might particularly apply to plant species from Europe introduced to New Zealand. Just like for any other abiotic or biotic filter, successful invaders can cope with novel environmental conditions via plastic responses and/or through rapid adaptation by natural selection in the exotic range. We conducted a multispecies experiment with herbaceous plants in two common gardens located in the species' native and exotic ranges, in Germany and New Zealand, respectively. We used plants of German and New Zealand origin of eight species to test for adaptation to higher UV-B radiation in their new range. In each common garden, all plants were exposed to three radiation treatments: (1) ambient sunlight, (2) exclusion of UV-B while transmitting ambient UV-A, and (3) combined exclusion of UV-B and UVA. Linear mixed-effect models revealed significant effects of UV-B on growth and leaf traits and an indication for UV-B-induced biomass reduction in both common gardens pointing to an impact of natural, ambient UV radiation intensities experienced by plants in the northern and in the southern hemisphere. In both common gardens, the respective local plants (i.e., German origins in Germany, New Zealand origins in New Zealand) displayed enhanced productivity and aboveground biomass allocation, thus providing evidence for recent evolutionary processes in the exotic range. Genetic differentiation between different origins in consequence of divergent local selection pressures was found for specific leaf area. This differentiation particularly hints at different selective forces in both ranges while only little evidence was found for an immediate selective effect of high UV-B intensities in the exotic range. However, reaction norm slopes across ranges revealed higher plasticity of exotic individuals in functional leaf traits that might allow for a more sensitive regulation of photoprotection measures in response to UV-B. During the colonization, New Zealand populations might have been selected for the observed higher phenotypic plasticity and a consequently increased ability to successfully spread in the exotic range.

Here, we test a set of predictions concerning the role of ecological filters in restructuring native bee assemblages inhabiting fragmented coastal sage scrub ecosystems in southern California, USA. In 2011 and 2012, we collected native bees in scrub habitat belonging to two treatment categories: large natural reserves and small habitat fragments embedded in an urban landscape. We compared bee assemblages in reserve and fragment sites with respect to their taxonomic and functional alpha diversity, beta diversity, assemblage composition, and mean geographical range size estimated via distribution maps compiled for this study from digitized specimen records. We found multiple lines of evidence that ecological filtering drove bee diversity loss in fragments: a disproportionate loss of functional diversity relative to taxonomic diversity, shifts in assemblage composition driven largely by the preferential extirpation of reserve-associated indicator species, and disproportionate loss of range-restricted species. However, we found no evidence of taxonomic or functional homogenization across fragment bee assemblages, suggesting that filtering was not sufficiently strong to cause a subset of functional traits (and their associated species) to dominate assemblages in fragments. Our results suggest that ecological filtering altered bee assemblages in habitat fragments, even when such fragments contained well-preserved native plant assemblages, underscoring the importance of preserving large areas of natural habitat for the conservation of bees (especially range-restricted taxa) and their associated ecological functions.

Invasive earthworm and soil litter response to the experimental removal of white-tailed deer and an invasive shrub	ECOLOGY			English	Article						aboveground-belowground interactions; earthworms; invasion; leaf litter; Lonicera maackii; temperate deciduous forest; white-tailed deer	HONEYSUCKLE LONICERA-MAACKII; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; ODOCOILEUS-VIRGINIANUS; FOREST; DECOMPOSITION; COMMUNITIES; HERBIVORE; ECOSYSTEMS; FEEDBACKS; ABUNDANCE	Recent studies have shown that complex species interactions can regulate above- and belowground processes in terrestrial systems. Ungulate herbivory and invasive species are known to have strong effects on plant communities in some systems, but their impacts on soil biota and belowground processes are lesser known. Growing evidence suggests white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and invasive plants facilitate increased abundance of exotic earthworms in temperate forests of the eastern United States. We conducted an experimental study that manipulated deer access and the presence of an invasive understory shrub in an eastern deciduous forest of southwestern Ohio, USA, from 2013 to 2017. Earthworm density and biomass, and standing litter biomass were measured in five paired deer access and exclosure plots, each with a split-plot removal of Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Earthworm density declined in response to the experimental exclusion of deer, with earthworm density decreasing over time in the deer exclosure plots relative to deer access plots. Deer exclusion produced greater variation in earthworm species composition relative to access plots. Multivariate analyses indicated that larger earthworms in the genus Lumbricus were associated with deer exclosure plots, while smaller endogeic species were ubiquitous in both treatments. Standing litter biomass decreased over time in the deer-access plots. In contrast, honeysuckle removal had little effect on earthworm density and standing litter biomass. There was an interaction between deer and honeysuckle treatments on earthworm biomass, with honeysuckle removal reducing earthworm biomass when deer were excluded. Our results demonstrate strong effects of herbivores on invasive earthworms and ecosystem processes, but indicate a weaker influence of invasive shrubs. Further, our findings suggest that the effects of deer overabundance in forest ecosystems are potentially reversible with long-term intervention.

Although the prevalence of trophic cascades triggered by non-consumptive effects is increasingly recognized in a wide range of ecosystems, how its relative strength changes as prey individuals grow in size along various life stages remains poorly resolved. We investigated how the effects of predators vary with the ontogeny of a key herbivorous sea urchin, which is responsible for transforming diverse macroalgal forests to a barren state dominated by bare rock and encrusting coralline algae. We conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to determine how susceptibility to predation, prey behavioral responses, and grazing impact on algal cover vary with sea urchin size. The consumptive effects of predators were greater on smaller sea urchin size classes, which were more susceptible to predation. Unexpectedly however, predator non-consumptive effects acted only on larger sea urchins, significantly reducing their grazing activity in the presence of predator cues. Crucially, only these larger sea urchins were capable of overgrazing macroalgae in the field, with non-consumptive effects reducing sea urchin foraging activity and macroalgal grazing impact by 60%. The decoupling between risk and fear as prey grow indicates that the strength of consumptive and non-consumptive trophic cascades may act differently at different ontogenetic stages of prey. While the consumptive effects of predators directly influence population numbers, the consequences of non-consumptive effects may far outlive consumptive effects as prey grow, finding refuge in size, but not from fear.

Associations among hydraulic traits, other leaf and stem traits, and species' performance are relatively well understood for trees, but remain poorly studied for lianas. We evaluated the coordination among hydraulic efficiency (i.e., maximum hydraulic conductivity), hydraulic safety (i.e., cavitation resistance), a suite of eight morphological and physiological traits, and species' abundances for saplings of 24 liana species and 27 tree species in wet tropical forests in Panama. Trees showed a strong trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and hydraulic safety, whereas efficiency and safety were decoupled in lianas. Hydraulic efficiency was strongly and similarly correlated with acquisitive traits for lianas and trees (e.g., positively with gas exchange rates and negatively with wood density). Hydraulic safety, however, showed no correlations with other traits in lianas, but with several in trees (e.g., positively with leaf dry matter content and wood density and negatively with gas exchange rates), indicating that in lianas hydraulic efficiency is an anchor trait because it is correlated with many other traits, while in trees both efficiency and safety are anchor traits. Traits related to shade tolerance (e.g., low specific leaf area and high wood density) were associated with high local tree sapling abundance, but not with liana abundance. Our results suggest that different, yet unknown mechanisms determine hydraulic safety and local-scale abundance for lianas compared to trees. For trees, the trade-off between efficiency and safety will provide less possibilities for ecological strategies. For lianas, however, the uncoupling of efficiency and safety could allow them to have high hydraulic efficiency, and hence high growth rates, without compromising resistance to cavitation under drought, thus allowing them to thrive and outperform trees under drier conditions.

Effects of artificial light on flowering of foredune vegetation	ECOLOGY			English	Article						flowers; foredune; light pollution; nebkha; reproductive cycle; Traganum moquinii	NIGHT	The impact of ecological light pollution involves alteration of periods of natural light, a fact that has proven effects on ecosystems. Few studies have focused on the impact of this pollution on wild plant species, and none on coastal dune plants. Many coastal dunes and their plants are adjacent to tourist areas, and these might be affected by light pollution. Such is the case of the Natural Reserve Dunas de Maspalomas (Gran Canaria), where some individuals of the plant species Traganum moquinii, located in the El Ingles beach foredune zone, are affected by light pollution. This study examines the effect of light pollution on the flowering process and, by extension, the reproductive cycle of these plants. Plants located closer to high artificial illumination sources receive similar to 2,120 h/yr of intense light more than plants located furthest from those artificial lighting sources. Parts of the plants of Traganum moquinii exposed directly to the artificial light show a significant decrease in the production of flowers, compared to the parts in plants in shade, and to the plants more distant from artificial lights. In consequence, plants exposed more directly to artificial light have a lower potential for seed reproduction. The spectrum of artificial light also affects the plants, and light between 600 and 700 nm primarily affects the reproductive cycle of the Traganum moquinii species. The implications for the ecological and geomorphological functioning of the dune system are discussed, because this species plays a decisive role in the formation of foredune zones and nebkhas in arid dune systems.

Phosphorus alleviation of salinity stress: effects of saltwater intrusion on an Everglades freshwater peat marsh	ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon cycling; coastal marsh; Florida Everglades; peat collapse; phosphorus; sea level rise	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; TYPHA-DOMINGENSIS; SOIL RESPIRATION; EXPERIMENTAL NUTRIENT; CLADIUM-JAMAICENSE; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; WETLAND ECOSYSTEM; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; RESPONSES; ENRICHMENT	Saltwater intrusion and salinization of coastal wetlands around the world are becoming a pressing issue due to sea level rise. Here, we assessed how a freshwater coastal wetland ecosystem responds to saltwater intrusion. In wetland mesocosms, we continuously exposed Cladium jamaicense Crantz (sawgrass) plants and their peat soil collected from a freshwater marsh to two factors associated with saltwater intrusion in karstic ecosystems: elevated loading of salinity and phosphorus (P) inputs. We took repeated measures using a 2 9 2 factorial experimental design (n = 6) with treatments composed of elevated salinity (similar to 9 ppt), P loading (14.66 mu mol P/d), or a combination of both. We measured changes in water physicochemistry, ecosystem productivity, and plant biomass change over two years to assess monthly and two-year responses to saltwater intrusion. In the short-term, plants exhibited positive growth responses with simulated saltwater intrusion (salinity + P), driven by increased P availability. Despite relatively high salinity levels for a freshwater marsh (similar to 9 ppt), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the elevated salinity + P treated monoliths compared to the freshwater controls. Salinity stress became evident after extended exposure. Although still higher than freshwater controls, GEP and NEP were significantly lower in the elevated salinity + P treatment than the + P treatment after two years. However, elevated salinity decreased live root biomass regardless of whether P was added. Our results suggest that saltwater intrusion into karstic freshwater wetlands may initially act as a subsidy by stimulating aboveground primary productivity of marsh plants. However, chronic exposure to elevated salinity results in plant stress, negatively impacting belowground peat soil structure and stability through a reduction in plant roots.

To address this knowledge gap, we used repeat forest inventory data from 92,285 trees across four large permanent plots (4-25 ha in size) in temperate mixed forests in northeast China to ask the following questions: (1) How do soil conditions and stand age drive biomass demographic processes? (2) How do vegetation quality (i.e., functional trait diversity and composition) and quantity (i.e., initial biomass stocks) influence biomass demographic processes independently from soil conditions and stand age? (3) What is the relative contribution of growth, recruitment, and mortality to net biomass change? Using structural equation modeling, we showed that all three demographic processes were jointly constrained by multiple abiotic and biotic factors and that mortality was the strongest determinant on net biomass change over time. Growth and mortality, as well as functional trait diversity and the community-weighted mean of specific leaf area (CWMSLA), declined with stand age. By contrast, high soil phosphorous concentrations were associated with greater functional diversity and faster dynamics (i.e., high growth and mortality rates), but associated with lower CWMSLA and initial biomass stock. More functionally diverse communities also had higher recruitment rates, but did not exhibit faster growth and mortality. Instead, initial biomass stocks and CWMSLA were stronger predictors of biomass growth and mortality, respectively. By integrating the full spectrum of abiotic and biotic drivers of forest biomass dynamics, our study provides critical system-level insights needed to predict the possible consequences of regional changes in forest diversity, composition, structure and function in the context of global change.

Life table invasion models: spatial progression and species-specific partitioning	ECOLOGY			English	Article						demography; detection; eradication; invasion ecology; life table; tephritid	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; SUCCESS; INSECT; SPREAD; RATES; ESTABLISHMENT; RISK; PEST	Biological invasions are increasingly being considered important spatial processes that drive global changes, threatening biodiversity, regional economies, and ecosystem functions. A unifying conceptual model of the invasion dynamics could serve as a useful tool for comparison and classification of invasion processes involving different species across large geographic ranges. By dividing these geographic ranges that are subject to invasions into discrete spatial units, we here conceptualize the invasion process as the transition from pristine to invaded spatial units. We use California cities as the spatial units and a long-term database of invasive tropical tephritids to characterize the invasion patterns. A new life-table method based on insect demography, including the progression model of invasion stage transition and the species-specific partitioning model of multispecies invasions, was developed to analyze the invasion patterns. The progression model allows us to estimate the probability and rate of transition for individual cities from pristine to infested stages and subsequently differentiate the first year of detection from detection recurrences. Importantly, we show that the interval of invasive tephritid recurrence in a city declines with increasing invasion stages of the city. The species-specific partitioning model revealed profound differences in invasion outcome depending on which tephritid species was first detected (and then locally eradicated) in the early stage of invasion. Taken together, we discuss how these two life-table invasion models can cast new light on existing invasion concepts; in particular, on formulating invasion dynamics as the state transition of cities and partitioning species-specific roles during multispecies invasions. These models provide a new set of tools for predicting the spatiotemporal progression of invasion and providing early warnings of recurrent invasions for efficient management.

Multiple mechanisms confer stability to isolated populations of a rare endemic plant	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						asynchrony; conservation biology; demographic buffering; density dependence; population viability; portfolio effect; rare species; source-sink dynamics.	ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY; DEMOGRAPHIC COMPENSATION; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; VIABILITY ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VITAL-RATES; PERSISTENCE; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; HETEROGENEITY	The persistence of small populations remains a puzzle for ecology and conservation. Especially interesting is how naturally small, isolated populations are able to persist in the face of multiple environmental forces that create fluctuating conditions and should, theory predicts, lead to high probabilities of extirpation. We used a combination of long-term census data and a five-year demographic study of a naturally rare, endemic plant, Yermo xanthocephalus, to evaluate the importance of several possible mechanisms for small population persistence: negative density dependence, vital rate buffering, demographic compensation, asynchrony in dynamics among sub-populations, and source-sink dynamics. These non-exclusive explanations for population persistence all have been shown to operate in some systems, but have rarely if ever been simultaneously examined for the same population or species. We hypothesized that asynchrony in dynamics and demographic compensation would be more powerful than the other three mechanisms. We found partial support for our hypothesis: density dependence, asynchrony among population segments, and source-sink patterns appear to be the most important mechanisms maintaining population viability in this species. Importantly, these processes all appear to operate strongly at very fine spatial scales for Yermo, allowing the only two, extremely small, populations to persist. We also found considerable differences in the results of our census and demographic analyses. In general, we estimated substantially greater chances of population survival from the census data than from the shorter-term demographic studies. In part, this difference is due to drier than average climate conditions during the years of the demographic work. These results emphasize that while demographic information is necessary to understand various components of population dynamics, longer term studies, even if much less detailed, can be more powerful in uncovering some mechanisms that may be critical in stabilizing population numbers, especially in variable environments.

Migrating birds regularly pass through heavily illuminated landscapes, and bright lights affect avian orientation. But risks to migrating birds from artificial light are not spatially or temporally uniform, representing a challenge for mitigating potential hazards and developing action plans to catalog risks at continental scales. We leveraged over two decades of remote-sensing data collected by weather surveillance radar and satellite-based sensors to identify locations and times of year when the highest numbers of migrating birds are exposed to light pollution in the contiguous US. Our continental-scale quantification of light exposure provides a novel opportunity for dynamic and targeted conservation strategies to address the hazards posed by light pollution to nocturnally migrating birds.

The stick insect species Clitarchus hookeri and C. tepaki differ in their genital morphology and hybridize along a narrow peninsula in northern New Zealand. We utilize three lines of evidence to understand the role of premating isolation and species boundaries: (a) genetic differentiation using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA; (b) variation in 3D surface topology of male claspers and 2D morphometrics of female opercular organs; and (c) behavioural reproductive isolation among parental and hybrid populations through mating crosses. The genetic data show introgression between the parental species and formation of a genetically variable hybrid swarm. Similarly, the male and female morphometric data show genital divergence between the parental species as well as increased variation within the hybrid populations. This genital divergence has not resulted in reproductive isolation between species, instead weak perimating isolation has enabled the formation of a hybrid swarm. Behavioural analysis demonstrates that the entire mating process influences the degree of reproductive isolation between species undergoing secondary contact. Mechanical isolation may appear strong, whereas perimating isolation is weak.

Adaptation to developmental diet influences the response to selection on age at reproduction in the fruit fly	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						ageing; experimental evolution; life-history evolution; phenotypic plasticity	TERM LABORATORY EVOLUTION; HISTORY TRADE-OFF; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; STARVATION RESISTANCE; CORRELATED RESPONSES; BODY-SIZE; LIFE-SPAN; ARTIFICIAL SELECTION; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; OPPOSING SELECTION	Experimental evolution (EE) is a powerful tool for addressing how environmental factors influence life-history evolution. While in nature different selection pressures experienced across the lifespan shape life histories, EE studies typically apply selection pressures one at a time. Here, we assess the consequences of adaptation to three different developmental diets in combination with classical selection for early or late reproduction in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We find that the response to each selection pressure is similar to that observed when they are applied independently, but the overall magnitude of the response depends on the selection regime experienced in the other life stage. For example, adaptation to increased age at reproduction increased lifespan across all diets; however, the extent of the increase was dependent on the dietary selection regime. Similarly, adaptation to a lower calorie developmental diet led to faster development and decreased adult weight, but the magnitude of the response was dependent on the age-at-reproduction selection regime. Given that multiple selection pressures are prevalent in nature, our findings suggest that trade-offs should be considered not only among traits within an organism, but also among adaptive responses to different-sometimes conflicting-selection pressures, including across life stages.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

Using the Silene-Microbotryum interaction (the castrating anther smut disease), eleven Himalayan Silene species were assessed in regions of high host diversity to ascertain levels of pathogen specificity. We also investigated disease prevalence, seasonal dynamics of infection and flowering patterns in five co-blooming Silene species. We identified several new Microbotryum lineages with varying degrees of specialization that is likely influenced by degrees of host divergence and ecological similarities (i.e. shared pollinator guilds). Affected species had 15%-40% of plants infected by anther smut. Flowering was seasonally overlapping among host species (except for the species pair S. asclepiadea and S. atrocastanea), but diseased flowering onset was earlier than healthy plants, leading to dramatic seasonal shifts in observed disease prevalence. Overlapping distributions and flowering provides opportunities for floral pathogen movement between host species, but host specialization may be constrained by the plant phylogenetic relatedness, adaptation to micro-habitats and difference in pollinator/vector guilds.

Deleterious alleles that reach locally high frequencies contribute to genetic load, especially in inbred or selfing populations, in which selection is relaxed. In the event of secondary contact, the recessive portion of the genetic load is masked in the hybrid offspring, producing heterosis. This advantage, only attainable through outcrossing, should favour evolution of greater outcrossing even if inbreeding depression has been purged from the contributing populations. Why, then, are selfing-to-outcrossing transitions not more common? To evaluate the evolutionary response of mating system to heterosis, we model two monomorphic populations of entirely selfing individuals, introduce a modifier allele that increases the rate of outcrossing and investigate whether the heterosis among populations is sufficient for the modifier to invade and fix. We find that the outcrossing mutation invades for many parameter choices, but it rarely fixes unless populations harbour extremely large unique fixed genetic loads. Reversions to outcrossing become more likely as the load becomes more polygenic, or when the modifier appears on a rare background, such as by dispersal of an outcrossing genotype into a selfing population. More often, the outcrossing mutation instead rises to moderate frequency, which allows recombination in hybrids to produce superior haplotypes that can spread without the mutation's further assistance. The transience of heterosis can therefore explain why secondary contact does not commonly yield selfing-to-outcrossing transitions.

We compared how frequently alien and native species have been implicated as drivers of recent extinctions in a comprehensive global database, the 2017 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Alien species were considered to be a contributing cause of 25% of plant extinctions and 33% of animal extinctions, whereas native species were implicated in less than 5% and 3% of plant and animal extinctions, respectively. When listed as a putative driver of recent extinctions, native species were more often associated with other extinction drivers than were alien species. Our results offer additional evidence that the biogeographic origin, and hence evolutionary history, of a species are determining factors of its potential to cause disruptive environmental impacts.

The prediction of large-scale particle motion in a stochastic framework implies identifying the relation between the Lagrangian velocity statistics and the statistical characteristics of the Eulerian flow field and the hydraulic medium properties. In this paper, we approach both challenges from numerical and theoretical points of view. Direct numerical simulations of Darcy-scale flow and particle motion give detailed information on the evolution of the statistics of particle velocities both as a function of travel time and distance along streamlines. Both statistics evolve from a given initial distribution to different steady-state distributions, which are related to the Eulerian velocity probability density function. Furthermore, we find that Lagrangian velocities measured isochronally as a function of travel time show intermittency dominated by low velocities, which is removed when measured equidistantly as a function of travel distance. This observation gives insight into the stochastic dynamics of the particle velocity series. As the equidistant particle velocities show a regular random pattern that fluctuates on a characteristic length scale, it is represented by two stationary Markov processes, which are parametrized by the distribution of flow velocities and a correlation distance. The velocity Markov models capture the evolution of the Lagrangian velocity statistics in terms of the Eulerian flow properties and a characteristics length scale and shed light on the role of the initial conditions and flow statistics on large-scale particle motion.

In this work, an emulator to mimic a hydrological model at catchment scale is proposed, taking into account the effect of land use on the hydrological processes involved in water balance. The proposed approach is novel for its combination of techniques. The dimension of the temporal model output is reduced via principal component analysis, and this reduced output is approximated using Gaussian process emulators built on a conditioned Latin hypercube design to reflect constrained land use inputs. Uncertainty from both the model approximation and the dimension reduction is propagated back to the space of the original output. The emulator has been applied to simulate river flow in a rural river basin located in south west England, the Frome at East Stoke Total, but the methodology is general. Results showed that the use of the emulator for water resources assessment at catchment scale is an effective approach, providing accurate estimates of the model output as a function of land use inputs, for a reduction of the computational burden.

Seagrass Zostera noltei was exposed to two pH levels (8.36 and 8.03) and three copper levels (nominal concentrations, < 3, 30 and 300 mu g Cu L-1) in a factorial design during 21 days, while Gammarus Iocusta amphipods were continuously fed with the treated seagrass leaves. We found that the toxicity and bioconcentration of copper in seagrasses were not affected by pH, yet complex copper-pH interactions were observed in the seagrass photosynthesis. We demostrated that seagrasses can act as a copper source in the food web via direct consumption by herbivores. Future research need to investigate the interactive effects on a long-term basis, and to include biochemical and molecular endpoints to provide additional insights to the complex phisiological interactions observed.

Historic disposal of DC at sea has resulted in the formation of large piles on the seabed that may be left in situ following infrastructure decommissioning. This study provides a first insight into the microbial abundance, diversity and community structure of two DC piles from North Sea oil and gas installations. The abundance of both bacteria and archaea was lower in DC than in surrounding natural sediments. Microbial diversity and richness within DC were low but increased with distance from the piles. Microbial community structure was significantly different in DC piles compared to nearby natural sediments. DC bacterial communities were dominated by Halomonas, Dietzia and Dethiobacter. The presence of such organisms suggests a potential function of hydrocarbon degradation ability and may play an active role in DC pile re mediation.	[Potts, Lloyd D.; Calderon, Luis J.

Two complementary studies were conducted. AChE activity, at the sub-individual level, and behavioural responses, at the individual level, were evaluated in worms from the Loire estuary (France), whereas density and biomass of H. diversicolor were determined at the population level. A Spearman positive correlation between both biomarkers (AChE and burrowing) suggested that inhibition of AChE activity was linked to behaviour impairments. At the population level, lower AChE and behaviour activities were detected in worms corresponding to lower population density and biomass. These results provide direct empirical field evidence demonstrating the sensitivity of behaviour of H. diversicolor as a biomonitor of estuarine health status assessment.

We aimed at assessing the impact of contamination in one of the hot spots of pollution along Mediterranean coasts, the gulf of Gabes in Tunisia, on Common tern Sterna hirundo, a piscivorous top predator bird. Firstly, we compared the reproductive effort of breeding adults through clutch size distribution in three sites with different levels of pollution. Then, a battery of genotoxicity and oxidative stress biomarkers was carried out to assess physiological impairments in chicks. While defense mechanisms showed a depletion, lipid peroxidation and genotoxicity increased significantly according to pollution level. The multi-biomarker approach used here, discriminated chicks according to contamination degree of their nesting sites. Increases in genotoxicity and oxidative stress were correlated to a decrease in chick body mass known to lead to long-term impacts on juvenile survival and recruitment in birds.

We have investigated the occurrence and composition of microplastics in beach sediments from the micro-tidal Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Samples were collected on two beaches (northern and southern site) of the western Gulf of Lion showing markedly different characteristics. Sampling was performed along depositional lower, mid and upper beaches and repeated after 1 month. Concentrations of microplastics in the northern and southern site were highly variable, ranging from 33 to 798 and from 12 to 187 microplastics per kg of dry sediment, respectively. Highest concentrations were found at three specific locations: nearby a local river mouth, within an accretionary area and in a depositional upper beach. The spatial and temporal distribution of beached microplastics seems to be directly dependent on external forcing such as wind, swell, precipitation, outflow and river mouth proximity.

However, a comprehensive understanding of lake-wide spatial differences in anthropogenic pressures is lacking and the biological consequences of human impacts are poorly understood. This paper therefore aims at assessing the individual and combined effects of critical anthropogenic pressures on the Caspian Sea ecoregions. First, cumulative pressure scores were calculated with a cumulative environmental assessment (CEA) analysis. Then, the individual contribution of anthropogenic pressures was quantified. Finally, ecoregion-specific differences were assessed. The analyses show that both cumulative and individual pressure scores are unevenly distributed across the Caspian Sea. The most important individual pressures are invasive species, chemical pollution and poaching. This uneven distribution of pressure scores across Caspian Sea ecoregions creates new challenges for future conservation strategies, as different ecoregions usually require different conservation measures.

Inter-specific differences in feather Hg reflected known differences in habitats and diversity of diets: benthic-foraging Gentoo penguins and Rockhopper penguins that foraged both inshore and offshore had significantly higher feather mercury than the more pelagic, specialist foraging King and Royal penguins. Hg significantly decreased between historic and modern samples in King and Royal penguins. This decrease could be due to changes in either diet, foodwebs, or atmospheric Hg input and sources in the Southern Hemisphere. Because Macquarie Island is home to 2.8 million marine animals, these data may indicate that other species that forage and breed in this region are also exposed to low Hg concentrations in this environment.

Samples were conducted weekly, at each moon phase, for two months using a beach seine net in the surf zone. Abundance of debris were estimate by swept area (itemskm(-1) and gkm(-1)). A total of 12 categories of debris were recorded. Plastic - both hard and soft types - was the most abundant debris category. Most fragments were classified as macro (20-100 mm) and mega debris (>100 mm). Significant differences (P < 0.05) between areas and tides were registered for plastic, metal and cloth. Spring tides were responsible for the high rates of marine debris found in the surf zone of Miramar beach. The results demonstrate the occurrence and abundance of litter in this fish nursery area and reinforce the need and importance of environmental protection and educational programs.

Stay clean: direct steam exposure to manage biofouling risks	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Biosecurity; Decontamination; Invasive species; Spread-prevention; Macroalgae; Bivalve; Barnacle	INVASIVE ASIAN CLAM; CORBICULA-FLUMINEA; SPREAD; DESICCATION; REGRESSION; VIABILITY; SURVIVAL; THREAT; TOOL	Biofouling by marine organisms can result in a variety of negative environmental and economic consequences, with decontamination procedures remaining problematic, costly and labour-intensive. Here, we examined the efficacy of direct steam exposure to induce mortality of selected biofouling species: Mytilus edulis; Magallana gigas; Semibalanus balanoides; Fucus vesiculosus; and an Ulva sp. Total mortality occurred at 60-sec of steam exposure for M. edulis and juvenile M. gigas, at 30-sec for S. balanoides, while 300-sec was required for adult M. gigas. Application of steam reduced the biomass of F. vesiculosus and significantly reduced Ulva sp. biomass, with complete degradation being observed for Ulva sp. following 120-sec of exposure. Accordingly, it appears that steam exposure can cause mortality of biofouling organisms through thermal shock. Although preliminary, our novel and promising results suggest that steam applications could potentially be used to decontaminate niche areas and equipment.	[Joyce, Patrick W.

Status and recent trends in coral reefs of the Philippines	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Hard coral cover; Diversity; Monitoring; Assessment; Philippines	SHIFTS	Concern about the condition of Philippine coral reefs has prompted a recent reassessment of the status of the nation's reefs, the results of which are reported here. This paper presents the largest updated dataset on Philippine coral cover and generic diversity. The dataset was obtained from equally-sized sampling stations on fore-reef slopes of fringing reefs in six biogeographic regions using identical methods. A total of 206 stations were surveyed from 2014 to 2017, and another 101 stations were monitored from 2015 to 2018. The weighted average hard coral cover (HCC) was 22.8% (+/- 1.2 SE) and coral generic diversity averaged 14.5 (+/- 0.5 SE). Both were highest in the fully-formed reefs of the Sulu Sea biogeographic region and lowest in the eastern Philippines. Comparisons of findings with those of previous assessments show the continued decline in coral cover over a larger time scale, with the loss of about a third of the reef corals over the last decade. However, no consistent changes were evident in the 101 monitoring stations from 2015 to 2018 despite the global coral bleaching event. An expanded monitoring program, not just one-off assessments, is recommended to improve reef management in the Philippines.	[Licuanan, W.

Size of marine debris items ingested and retained by petrels	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Diet; Plastic ingestion; Pollution; Shearwater; Seabird; Procellariiform	PLASTIC DEBRIS; ENVIRONMENT	Pollution of the world's oceans by marine debris has direct consequences for wildlife, with fragments of plastic < 10 mm the most abundant buoyant litter in the ocean. Seabirds are susceptible to debris ingestion, commonly mistaking floating plastics for food. Studies have shown that half of petrel species regularly ingest anthropogenic waste. Despite the regularity of debris ingestion, no studies to date have quantified the dimensions of debris items ingested across petrel species ranging in size. We excised and measured 1694 rigid anthropogenic debris items from 348 petrel carcasses of 20 species. We found that although the size of items ingested by petrels scale positively with the size of the bird, 90% of all debris items ingested across species fall within a narrow "danger zone" range of 2-10 mm, overlapping with the most abundant oceanic debris size. We conclude that this globally profuse size range of marine plastics is an ingestion hazard to petrels.

Spatial distribution of foreshore litter on the northwest European continental shelf	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Beach litter; Spatial variation; Northwest European shelf; Monitoring; Indicators	MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; PLASTIC DEBRIS; BEACH; POLLUTION; SEA	Foreshore litter data from a UK citizen-science programme, combined with OSPAR data, were analysed for possible spatial patterns around Scottish and North Sea coastlines. Loading distributions were positively skewed, and statistics commensurate with such distributions were used. When considering coast type, litter loadings on Scottish harbour and river foreshores were influenced by local litter sources. When considering exposure to the predominant westerly winds over Scotland, litter loadings on the west coast (i.e. predominant onshore winds) were greater on foreshores on open coasts compared to those within embayments. The opposite was true for the Scottish east coast (i.e. predominantly offshore winds). The north east coast of the UK appeared to have an organised pattern of plastic litter loading, increasing in magnitude (median) and spread (inter quartile range) in the direction of the coastal flow. Four other coastal segments with similar patterns were suggested from the west of Scotland to Denmark.	[Turrell, W.

As such, water utilities generally carry out these operations following a corrective approach. This paper studies the impact of the spatiotemporal correlation between these failure events using Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) models. In addition, the association of failure events to physical and environmental covariates was assessed. The proposed methods were applied to analyze sediment-related blockages in the sewer system of an operative zone in Bogota (Colombia). The results of this research allowed the identification of significant covariates that were further used to model spatiotemporal clusters with high sediment-related failure risk in sewer systems. The LGCP model proved to be more accurate in comparison to those models that build upon a fundamental assumption that a failure is equally likely to occur at any time regardless of the state of the system and the system's history of failures (i.e. a homogeneous Poisson process model).

Flow estimates from pumping stations, which are an integral part of most separate sewer systems, might help in this regard. A robust model and an associated optimization procedure is proposed for estimating inflow to a pumping station using only registered water levels in the pump sump and power consumption. The model was successfully tested on one month of data from a single upstream station. The model is suitable for identification of pump capacity and volume thresholds for switching the pump on and off. These are parameters which are required for flow estimation during periods with high inflows or during periods with flow conditions triggering pump switching on and off at frequencies close to the temporal resolution of monitored data. The model is, however, sensitive within the transition states between emptying and filling to observation errors in volume and on inflow/outflow variability.

Yet is it enough to ensure water quality and avoid the effects of eutrophication? In this study, we hypothesize that sewered and non-sewered regions of Conceicao lagoon (Southern Brazil) have similar water quality, due to the poorly designed sewerage system and the lack of effective public policies. The LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) biogeochemical model was used to understand how the lagoon responds to nutrient inputs from the watershed. There was no significant difference in the water quality between the urbanized rivers. Both regions (sewered and non-sewered) showed high concentrations of phosphate, ammonium and fecal coliform. The percentage of urbanization was directly correlated with deoxygenation, nutrients and coliform. Lower concentrations of nutrients and oxic waters were found in the non-urbanized rivers and in the lagoon. As such, biogeochemical and physical processes counterbalance the nutrient inputs. However, the sewage runoff might be fueling the dead zone of the lagoon, since the water residence time and nutrient retention are high. Our results indicate that the sewage treatments are inefficient in preventing the input of organic matter and nutrients to the system. Additionally, new management strategies are required to revert eutrophication, such as the expansion of the serviced area by the sewage system and the improvement of its technology.

The study area corresponds to a recreational sandy seashore beach (Monte Hermoso) where particulate metal levels showed large and irregular fluctuations throughout the study period. The study area is strongly influenced by a human-impacted estuary located nearby and it is believed that the levels of metals found in the particulate fraction are linked to this human impacted estuary. In particular Cd was found in high concentrations (2.63 mu g g(-1) dry weight) and therefore it was possible to characterize the SPM with some degree of Cd pollution through EF and I(geo)index. In addition, sediments were the main component of the SPM during most of the period of study. Finally, the present study provides new insights into the behavior of metals in the SPM in the surf zone, characterized as one of the most productive transitional areas between the continent and the sea, and poorly known from a pollution perspective.

Catchment-derived stressors, recruitment, and fisheries productivity in an exploited penaeid shrimp	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Penaeidae; Metapenaeus macleayi; Acid sulfate soils; Seagrass; pH; Aluminium	PRAWN METAPENAEUS-MACLEAYI; SULFATE SOIL LEACHATE; TIGER PRAWNS; FRESH-WATER; COASTAL FISHERIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-REGION; ESTUARINE; SEAGRASS; SURVIVAL	Many factors can affect growth, survival, reproduction, and fisheries productivity of estuarine species, including structural and physico-chemical habitats, and freshwater inflow to estuaries. Land-based activities can lead to poor catchment condition, and catchment-derived stressors can adversely impact estuarine systems. Using the Eastern School Prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) in a south-eastern Australian estuary (Camden Haven Estuary) as a case study, we examine juvenile recruitment and fisheries productivity alongside a comprehensive suite of catchment-derived stressors, and interpret patterns in the context of existing studies of lethal and sub-lethal impacts of these stressors on penaeid prawns. Logged dissolved oxygen data indicated a moderate frequency of hypoxia throughout the system, with occasional periods of anoxia. Dissolved aluminium concentrations remained above the relevant marine water quality guideline for the majority of the study period, and concentrations tended to correlate with estuarine inflow. Hypoxia led to depressed prawn abundance, and both hypoxia and high estuary inflow led to decreased somatic condition in prawns. Long-term commercial catch negatively correlated with estuary inflow, which was the opposite of the expected pattern for the species. These patterns highlight the potential cumulative impacts of a complex array of catchment-derived stressors on an important exploited penaeid species. Similar patterns probably occur for prawn species across other floodplain estuaries across south-eastern Australia, and suggest a hitherto unquantified economic impact of degraded catchments through losses in fisheries productivity.

Does the presence of elephant dung create hotspots of growth for existing seedlings?	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Elephants; Kibale National Park; megaherbivores; nutrient; seedling growth; seedling survival	KIBALE NATIONAL-PARK; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; FOREST; TREE; LIGHT; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; SAVANNA; CONSEQUENCES	Megaherbivores play a central role in the evolution and functioning of ecosystems. In tropical forests elephant species are some of the few remaining megaherbivores. Through elephant foraging, nutrients that would be locked in leaves and stems, taking months or years to decay, are quickly liberated for use. In 10 experimental sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we set up 10 pairs of plots (4 x 4 m), each pair involved one treatment, elephant dung addition, and one control. After 1 y, we quantified growth (height and leaf number) and survival of young light-demanding (12) and shade-tolerant (19) plant species (439 stems in total). In general, the addition of elephant dung did not increase seedling growth, and it only increased the number of leaves in shade-tolerant plants with a large initial number of leaves. Researchers have speculated that the loss of elephants would shift the composition of African forests to slow-growing tree species. However, this is not supported by our finding that shows some slow-growing shade-tolerant plants grew more new leaves with additional nutrient input from elephant dung, a condition that would occur if elephant numbers increase.

Here, we test whether SADs are more likely to either follow a lognormal-like or follow a logseries-like distribution and how that may change with spatial scale. Our results show that the shape of SADs changes from logseries-like at small, plot scales to lognormal-like at large, landscape scales. However, the rate at which the SAD's shape changes also depends on species traits linked to the spatial distribution of individuals. Specifically, we show for oligophagous and small macro-moth species that a logseries distribution is more likely at small scales and a lognormal distribution is more likely at large scales, whereas the logseries distribution fits well at both small and large scales for polyphagous and large species. We also show that SAD moments scale as power laws as a function of spatial scale, and we assess the performance of Tchebichef moments and polynomials to reconstruct SADs at the landscape scale from information at local scales. Overall, the method performed well and reproduced the shapes of the empirical distributions.

Water clarity and temperature effects on walleye safe harvest: an empirical test of the safe operating space concept	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; ecosystem change; fisheries; harvest; lake; Mille Lacs; oligotrophication; safe operating space; thermal-optical habitat; walleye; water clarity	HABITAT; FISH; FISHERIES; LIGHT; LAKES; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; PREDATOR; VITREUM; MODEL	Successful management of natural resources requires local action that adapts to larger-scale environmental changes in order to maintain populations within the safe operating space (SOS) of acceptable conditions. Here, we identify the boundaries of the SOS for a managed freshwater fishery in the first empirical test of the SOS concept applied to management of harvested resources. Walleye (Sander vitreus) are popular sport fish with declining populations in many North American lakes, and understanding the causes of and responding to these changes is a high priority for fisheries management. We evaluated the role of changing water clarity and temperature in the decline of a high-profile walleye population in Mille Lacs, Minnesota, USA, and estimated safe harvest under changing conditions from 1987 to 2017. Thermal-optical habitat area (TOHA)-the proportion of lake area in which the optimal thermal and optical conditions for walleye overlap-was estimated using a thermodynamic simulation model of daily water temperatures and light conditions. We then used a SOS model to analyze how walleye carrying capacity and safe harvest relate to walleye thermal-optical habitat. Thermal-optical habitat area varied annually and declined over time due to increased water clarity, and maximum safe harvest estimated by the SOS model varied by nearly an order of magnitude. Maximum safe harvest levels of walleye declined with declining TOHA. Walleye harvest exceeded safe harvest estimated by the SOS model in 16 out of the 30 yr of our dataset, and walleye abundance declined following 14 of those years, suggesting that walleye harvest should be managed to accommodate changing habitat conditions. By quantifying harvest trade-offs associated with loss of walleye habitat, this study provides a framework for managing walleye in the context of ecosystem change.	[Hansen, Gretchen J.

Invasive species can alter ecosystem properties and cause state shifts in landscapes. Resource managers charged with maintaining landscapes require tools to understand implications of alternative actions (or inactions) on landscape structure and function. Simulation models can serve as a virtual laboratory to explore these alternatives and their potential impacts on a landscape. To be useful, however, managers need to participate in model development to ensure that model structure can evaluate the response of key resources to plausible actions. Here, we detail development of a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM) to evaluate buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris L. syn Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link) in Saguaro National Park (SNP), Arizona, USA, through collaboration between managers and researchers. We integrate expert knowledge and research to create and parameterize a stochastic, spatially explicit STSM to evaluate specific management objectives. We also develop a dynamic link between the STSM and a fire behavior model to allow exploration of potential novel processes introduced to the ecosystem by buffelgrass invasion. Our projections show that buffelgrass can be expected to increase on the landscape and that the integration of fire into the model accelerates the projected rate of invasion and increases degradation of resources of management concern. We highlight the benefit of engaging end users in the modeling process so that the model is targeted to evaluate management objectives, in this case retention of saguaro cacti (Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britton & Rose) on the landscape. Being able to integrate an external model that can help address the unique characteristics of a problem such as the introduction of fire into the SNP desert ecosystem increases the ability of simulations to address complex ecological and management questions.

Relevant studies suggest that seasonal variability in the functional composition of phytoplankton shows an increase as eutrophication progresses. The aim of the present study was to test this hypothesis through the assessment of long-term changes in the functional diversity and composition of phytoplankton in a large shallow lake situated in Central Europe with a history of dramatic changes in trophic state. Contrary to our expectations, results have shown that the maximum range of compositional variability had a significant negative correlation with the summer biomass maxima. On the other hand, average seasonal variability measured as annual beta diversity exhibited an increasing trend throughout the years from the period of early eutrophication to the recent period of reoligotrophication, seemingly following a decline in functional richness and a long-term rise in annual mean water temperature. The enhanced variability in phytoplankton succession implies that all the ecosystem processes connected to the phytoplankton follow more complex seasonal dynamics. Besides changing community structure, trophic state also seems to be an important factor in setting the limits to compositional changes during the annual cycle, whereas long-term warming is likely to enhance instability in the phytoplankton. The trajectories of these two factors and the changes in seasonal succession indicate a lake in transition, urging more in-depth research efforts to understand the impact of climate change on this specific ecosystem, and raise the question of whether the observed changes can also occur in other similar aquatic systems.

As seasonal precipitation patterns change, so will the soil resources available for plants. In the midwestern United States, winter temperatures and precipitation are expected to increase, while snowfall is expected to be reduced. Reduced snowpack could lead to greater frost damage and alter the timing and amount of plant available resources at the start of the growing season. In the summer, precipitation is expected to decrease, and variability is expected to increase, creating longer and more frequent dry periods. In temperate forests, herbaceous understory plants and woody plants in early developmental stages are expected to be highly sensitive to changes in abiotic conditions. Here, we study how seasonal changes in precipitation affect the timing and availability of resources in a temperate deciduous forest. Further, we examine how changes in abiotic conditions influence understory composition and woody plant recruitment. We established a fully factorial experiment that manipulated winter snowfall and summer precipitation to create wet, dry, and control (ambient) conditions in a temperate deciduous forest near West Lafayette, Indiana, USA. We found that large changes in winter and summer precipitation appeared to affect forest processes independently of one another, and changes in seasonal precipitation altered understory composition minimally and had little to no effect on mineralization rates. The recruitment of woody plant species may be more sensitive to altered precipitation, as snow removal lowered germination rates and wet summer conditions lowered relative growth of a woody plant species, Lindera benzoin. In general, though, ecological processes in this forest understory were relatively resistant to change, at least in the short timeframe of this experiment.

Across scales, pronghorn select sagebrush, avoid fences, and show negative responses to anthropogenic features in winter	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Antilocapra americana; energy development; fence; oil and gas; pronghorn; resource selection function; roads; sagebrush; step-selection function; summer and winter resource selection; Wyoming	HABITAT SELECTION; MULE DEER; TEMPORAL VARIATION; ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; PREDATION RISK; BEHAVIOR; MORTALITY; DYNAMICS; ALLOCATION; PATTERNS	Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are endemic to western North America where they occupy expanses of grassland and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitats. The Red Desert region in south-central Wyoming, USA, has historically served as a stronghold for pronghorn populations, but many herds there have experienced declining population trends over the last two decades, concurrent with oil and natural gas development. These demographic changes and the potential for such energy development, its associated infrastructure, and other anthropogenic features including roads and fences to influence pronghorn habitat selection were the impetuses for our study. We sought to evaluate the potential effect of human-induced disturbance on multi-scale seasonal resource selection of 142 adult female pronghorn from 2013 to 2016 using 442 unique animal-season-year datasets. We utilized a traditional resource selection function to evaluate seasonal home-range selection and a step-selection function to assess fine-scale, patch-level seasonal selection. We also compared resource selection during daytime and nighttime hours with step-selection analyses. At the seasonal home-range scale, pronghorn selected for areas with more sagebrush during both seasons and areas farther from fences during summer. This trend was also apparent at the patch-scale level, where pronghorn selected sagebrush-dominant habitats and avoided crossing fences in all seasons during both day and night. Additionally at this scale, pronghorn selected areas farther from fences during daytime in summer. At the broader, home-range scale, pronghorn selected areas with greater road density during summer, but with lower road densities and farther from wells during winter. Avoidance of anthropogenic features during winter was also observed at the finer, patch-scale, with pronghorn selecting for increased density of roads and oil and natural gas wells during daytime in summer, but selecting areas farther from these features during daytime in winter. We recommend minimizing fencing and other forms of anthropogenic disturbance in high-quality seasonal pronghorn habitats with high proportions of sagebrush, particularly during winter when risk-avoidance responses may be amplified.

However, lipids may influence stable isotope ratios due to the depletion of C-13 in adipose tissues relative to proteins and carbohydrates. delta C-13 values can be corrected by lipid extraction or normalization models. The aims of our study were to evaluate the effects of lipid extraction on stable isotope ratios in a terrestrial mammal, the caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), and to propose relevant lipid normalization models that are method- and tissue-specific for delta C-13 values. We also evaluated whether four delta C-13 lipid normalization and correction models proposed in the literature were applicable to our study species. Stable isotope ratios were obtained for hair, plasma, and red blood cell samples of 44 caribou in the Gaspesie National Park (Quebec, Canada). The effects of lipid extraction on stable isotope ratios were tested using a paired t-test. A simple linear model was used to correct for the effects of lipid extraction and to assess its performance compared to that of published equations. Lipid content significantly influenced delta C-13 values in caribou hair. The four lipid normalization equations commonly used in the literature did not accurately predict delta C-13(lipid-free) values of caribou hair. Based on our results, we recommend controlling systematically for lipids in terrestrial systems and analyzing delta C-13 (lipid-free) and delta N-15 (bulk) from two separate aliquots to reach a greater precision. We also recommend controlling for lipids in hair tissue. If not possible, we recommend using a lipid normalization model that is tissue-, method-, and species-specific or applying a model that has been previously validated for the tissue and species of interest.

Landscape fragmentation may reduce herbivory directly (i.e., decreasing abundance and species richness of herbivores), but also indirectly increase herbivory (i.e., releasing herbivores from top-down control). At a local scale, reduced plant diversity may enhance herbivory through lessened associated resistance, while resource availability (i.e., higher vegetation height and cover) may promote herbivory. Few studies have simultaneously considered the influence of local and landscape variables on insect herbivory. We evaluate effects of landscape (fragment size, connectivity, and arable land percentage) and local factors (plant cover and height and plant species richness) on insect herbivory in fragmented calcareous grasslands. Further, we ask whether these effects depend on feeding traits of herbivores (chewers vs. suckers) and habitat specialization of plants (specialists vs. generalists). Results show that herbivory was best explained by models including variables at both local and landscape scales. However, local factors were more important than landscape variables. Herbivory was in all cases positively related to height of herbs (i.e., taller and more heterogeneous food resources), whereas the effect of plant species richness varied with feeding traits of herbivores. Herbivory by chewers, which are commonly more generalist feeders, was negatively affected by plant species richness, supporting the idea of associated plant resistance. In contrast, herbivory by suckers, which tend to be more specialized, increased with plant richness. Although there was little influence of landscape scale, herbivory on specialist plants was significantly higher in smaller grasslands probably as a consequence of herbivore release from natural enemies. Functional redundancy among herbivore species would allow to maintain overall herbivory in fragmented calcareous grasslands. This study highlights the need to consider different herbivore and plant traits for a better understanding of herbivory responses to local and landscape factors.

While flower microbial communities are spatially structured among floral organs, how dispersal vectors distribute microbes among floral organs is unknown. Pollinators are recognized as key microbial vectors, but effects of their different foraging behaviors on transfer dynamics among flowers or different floral organs are not known. We asked how foraging behaviors of a model pollinator (Bombus impatiens) affect acquisition and dispersal of microbes among flower organs. We used monkeyflowers (Mimulus guttatus) to examine dispersal within a natural context and artificial flowers to test how common bee foraging behaviors (nectaring, buzzing, or scrabbling) shaped dispersal of a green fluorescent protein-labeled bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens. Bees acquired 1% of a flower's microbes and dispersed 31% of acquired microbes to the next flower. All bees acquired microbes, and 85% and 76% of bees dispersed microbes to live and artificial flowers, respectively. Microbes acquired from the corolla were mainly deposited on the corolla, followed by the stamens, and least on the nectary/pistil. Bee foraging behavior affected acquisition, with scrabbling for pollen resulting in 23% more microbes acquired than nectaring, and with buzzing for pollen resulting in a 79% slower rate of microbial acquisition relative to scrabbling. Bee foraging behavior also affected deposition but depended on the floral organ: Scrabbling and buzzing for pollen led to greater deposition than nectaring for corolla and stamen but not nectary. Our results have implications for transmission of beneficial and pathogenic microbes among plants and pollinators, and thus the ecology and evolution of floral microbial communities.

Mechanisms underlying increased nest predation in natural gas fields: a test of the mesopredator release hypothesis	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						anthropogenic disturbance; apex predators; deer mouse; energy development; human-induced rapid environmental change; predator-prey; rodent; sagebrush; songbird; surface disturbance	SMALL-MAMMAL COMMUNITIES; HOME-RANGE SIZE; ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; HABITAT; RESPONSES; POPULATIONS; COYOTES; RISK; FRAGMENTATION; DENSITIES	Anthropogenic activities are changing landscapes and the context in which predator-prey dynamics evolved, thereby altering key ecological processes and community structure. Yet, the specific mechanisms underlying such changes are rarely understood. We tested whether a mesopredator release explained increased rodent density and concomitant predation of songbird nests near natural gas development. From 2015 to 2016, we surveyed apex predators (coyotes, badgers, raptors, and corvids) and measured apparent survival and perceived predation risk of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus; a primary nest predator), at 12 plots spanning a gradient of surface disturbance caused by energy development in Wyoming, USA. Additionally, we measured densities of three nest predators: deer mice, least chipmunks (Tamias minimus), and thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Contrary to the mesopredator release hypothesis, counts of apex predators and perceived predation risk of deer mice increased with surface disturbance from energy development, whereas apparent survival of mice decreased. Densities of mice and ground squirrels, however, increased with surface disturbance, despite increased predation pressure. We therefore rejected the mesopredator release hypothesis as a potential mechanism underlying altered trophic dynamics near energy development. Our results suggest that apex predator control measures would not benefit declining songbirds on natural gas fields. Rather, apex predator abundance may be regulated from the bottom-up by rodents in this system. Our results corroborate a pattern showing weakened effects of mesopredator release in habitats modified by humans. Understanding how predator-prey dynamics may be altered in novel environments requires an understanding of how predators and prey alike respond to habitat change under different contexts.

Predicting species distributions: unifying model selection and scale optimization for multi-scale occupancy models	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Bayesian model selection; habitat model; hierarchical model; King Rail; marsh bird; scale dependence; spatial ecology; species distribution model	AFFECTING DETECTION PROBABILITY; CALL-BROADCAST; LANDSCAPE; HABITAT; INFERENCE; BIRDS; PERFORMANCE; ABSENCE; FOREST; GUIDE	Geographic distributions are a basic component of a species' ecology, and predicting distributions is a fundamental task of conservation and resource management. Reliable prediction depends on identification of appropriate scales of effect for environmental data, and scale-optimization techniques are thus desirable to identify optimal scales for predictor variables. Recent statistical developments have also advanced methods of model selection based explicitly on predictive ability, which differ from commonly used methods that regulate model structures via anticipated predictive performance. Such methods are beginning to permeate into species distribution models (SDMs), yet there remains no consensus methodology for developing optimally predictive multi-scale SDMs when covariate data are collected over a range of scales. Thus, we compared the performance of common approaches for scale optimization and model selection in terms of their ability to produce optimally predictive multi-scale Bayesian occupancy models for predicting a species distribution, using models of the breeding distribution for King Rails (Rallus elegans) as a case study. Our results demonstrate sizable gains in predictive performance for hierarchical occupancy models selected via their ability to predict out-of-sample data using the logarithmic scoring rule, as compared to models selected using information criteria (deviance information criteria [DIC] and Watanabe information criteria [WAIC]). Information criteria commonly selected individual covariates, as well as scales of effect for those covariates, with suboptimal predictive performance. Performance of models selected using the logarithmic scoring rule was also robust across the method of scale optimization, which was not true for models selected using DIC and WAIC. Thus, we demonstrate empirical benefits of study designs and statistical tools that enable covariate and scale selection based explicitly on predictive ability. Our results also imply that more careful consideration of what constitutes an optimal scale is warranted in many ecological applications, as the meaning of optimal is not independent of the technique used for scale selection.

We investigated how initial presence of net-spinning caddisflies (Hydropsychidae) and their structures that provide and modify habitat differentially influence benthic community colonization in a headwater stream by conducting an in situ experiment that included three treatments: (1) initial engineering organism with its habitat modification structure occupied (hereafter caddisfly); (2) initial habitat modification structure alone (hereafter silk); and (3) a control with the initial absence of both engineer and habitat modification structure (hereafter control). Total invertebrate colonization density and biomass was higher in caddisfly and silk treatments compared to controls (similar to 25% and 35%, respectively). However, finer-scale patterns of taxonomy revealed that density for one of the taxa, Chironomidae, was similar to 19% higher in caddisfly compared to silk treatments. Additionally, conspecific biomass was higher by an average of 50% in silk treatments compared to controls; however, no differences in Hydropsyche sp. biomass were detected between caddisfly treatments and controls, indicating initially abandoned silk structures elevated conspecific biomass. These findings suggest that the positive effects of the habitat modification structures that were occupied for the entirety of the experiment may outweigh any potential negative impacts from the engineer, which is known to be territorial. Importantly, these results reveal that the initial presence of the engineer itself may be important in maintaining the ecological significance of habitat modifications. Furthermore, the habitat modifications that were initially abandoned (silk) had similar positive effects on conspecific biomass compared to caddisfly treatments, suggesting legacy effects of these engineering structures may have pertinent intraspecific feedbacks of the same magnitude to that of occupied habitat modifications. Elucidating how engineers and their habitat modifications differentially facilitate organisms will allow for a clearer mechanistic understanding of the extent to which animal engineers and their actions influence aspects of community organization such as colonization.

In this study, we examined land snail communities in forests and grasslands in three regions of Germany. We aimed to quantify the extent to which snail density, diversity, and community composition in forests and grasslands are determined by (1) land-use intensity, (2) abiotic drivers and (3) biotic substrates, and (4) whether these effects are consistent across regions. In total, we collected 15,607 snail individuals belonging to 71 species and analyzed both direct and indirect effects using structural equation modeling. Snail densities and their local diversity varied across regions and between forest and grassland habitats within a region albeit with contrasting trends. Community composition also differed among regions-more strongly in forests than in grasslands-and each habitat had unique species (18 in forests, 21 in grasslands). In general, the direct impact of land-use on snail density, diversity, and community structure was on average nine (forests) and seven (grasslands) times lower than the impact of abiotic drivers and biotic substrates which both affected snail assemblages about equally. However, land-use factors had indirect effects on snail responses through abiotic variables such as soil moisture and soil pH. Furthermore, land-use factors also had indirect effects via changing biotic substrates, such as plant cover in grasslands and deadwood cover in forests. Our results show that land snails strongly respond to environmental gradients and add an important indicator taxon to the current evidence of land-use impacts, highlighting the complexity of direct and indirect effects via biotic and abiotic drivers across regions in Central Europe.

Savanna canopy trees under fire: long-term persistence and transient dynamics from a stage-based matrix population model	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						eucalyptus savanna; fire frequency; fire season; Kakadu National Park; matrix population model; population viability; savanna physiognomy; sensitivity analysis; sorghum; stochastic disturbance; transient population dynamics; variable environments	KAKADU-NATIONAL-PARK; AUSTRALIAN TROPICAL SAVANNAS; FERAL WATER-BUFFALO; WET-DRY TROPICS; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; LIFE-HISTORY; CALLITRIS-INTRATROPICA; EUCALYPTUS-MINIATA; SORGHUM-INTRANS; SEED PRODUCTION	Fire is a major disturbance driving the dynamics of the world's savannas. Almost all fires are set by humans who are increasingly altering fire timing and frequency on every continent. The world's largest protected areas of savannas are found in monsoonal northern Australia. These include relatively intact, tall, open forests where traditional indigenous fire regimes have been largely replaced in the past half century by contemporary patterns with trees experiencing fire as often as three out of five years. Eucalypt canopy trees form the basic structure of these savannas and changes to the canopy due to fire regimes cascade to affect other plants and animals. In this study, we used data from nearly three decades of field studies on the effects of fire on individual trees to define eight life-history stages and to calculate transition rates among stages. We developed a stage-based matrix population model that explicitly considers how fire season and understory influence growth, survival, and recruitment for each life-history stage. Long-term population growth rates and transient population dynamics were calculated under five different fire regimes, each in two understory types, using both deterministic and stochastic simulations of seasonal timing of fires. We found that fire was necessary for long-term persistence of eucalypt canopy tree populations but, under annual fires, most populations did not survive. Population persistence was highly dependent on fire regime (fire season and frequency) and understory type. A stochastic model tended to yield higher population growth rates than the deterministic model with regular, periodic fires, even under the same long-term frequency of fires. Transient population dynamics over 100 yr also depended on fire regime and understory, with implications for savanna physiognomy and management. Model predictions were tested in an independent data set from a 21-yr longitudinal field study in Kakadu National Park. This study is a novel and integrative contribution to our understanding of fire in savanna biomes regarding the potential for long-term persistence and transient dynamics of savanna canopy tree populations. The model is relatively simple, generalizable, and adaptable for further investigations of the population dynamics of savanna trees under fire.

Functional relations between body mass and risk-taking behavior in wild great tits	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						behavioral syndrome; body condition; body size; morphology; Parus major; structural equation modeling	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR; EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR; PERSONALITY; SIZE; INTEGRATION; PATTERN; MODELS	Natural selection often favors particular combinations of functionally-related traits, resulting in adaptive phenotypic integration. Phenotypic integration has been proposed as a potential mechanism explaining the existence of repeatable among-individual differences in behavior (i.e., animal personality). In this study, we investigated patterns of covariation between morphology and behavior in a population of free-living great tits (Parus major) monitored for 7 years. In particular, we aimed to disentangle the effect of structural size versus body condition on risk-taking behavior. To do so, we repeatedly quantified multiple morphological (body mass, wing, tarsus, and bill length) and behavioral traits (aggressiveness and exploration) in 742 individual males. Structural equation modeling (SEM) allowed us to test causal a priori hypothesized relationships between the different morphological and behavioral traits. Our best-fitting SEM model supported the existence of a behavioral character, risk-taking behavior that covaried simultaneously with the latent variable body size, and body condition. Our findings thus demonstrate that an individual's morphological and behavioral traits represent expressions of an integrated phenotype, suggesting a role for phenotypic integration in generating animal personality in a wild bird population. Many studies show that individual animals are repeatable in their behavior, but are these differences part of whole-organism differences? Using long term data from a wild population of great tits, we show that body size and body condition differences were related to differences in risk-taking behavior (exploration and aggression) but had opposing effects, thereby providing an explanation of why we observe long-standing individual differences in behavior in the wild.

Female preference for novel males constrains the contemporary evolution of assortative mating in guppies	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						ecological speciation; experimental evolution; mate choice; Poecilia reticulata; reproductive isolation	MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX; LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION; MHC CLASS IIB; SEXUAL SELECTION; MATE-CHOICE; POECILIA-RETICULATA; NATURAL-SELECTION; MALE COLOR; GENE FLOW; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION	Progress toward local adaptation is expected to be enhanced when divergent selection is multidimensional, because many simultaneous sources of selection can increase the total strength of selection and enhance the number of independent traits under selection. Yet, whether local adaptation ensues from multidimensional selection also depends on its potential to cause the build-up of reproductive barriers such as sexual signals and preference for these signals. We used replicate experimental introductions of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in nature to test whether an abrupt and dramatic shift in multiple important ecological dimensions (at a minimum: parasitism, predation, and diet/resources) promoted the contemporary evolution of assortative mating. After 8-12 postintroduction guppy generations in the wild, we bred descendants of each population in a common-garden laboratory environment for 2 generations, after which we recorded the preferences of females from each population for males from all populations. We found contemporary evolution of male traits (size, body condition, color) that should influence mate choice, but no evidence for the occurrence of positive assortative preferences. That is, females in a given evolving population did not prefer males from that population over males from other populations. Instead, females tended to prefer novel males (i.e., disassortative mating), which likely acts as a mechanism preventing the evolution of reproductive isolation. Preferences for novelty may explain why many cases of local adaptation do not lead to the evolution of reproductive barriers and ecological speciation. Female preference for local, versus foreign, males is an important component of adaptation to new environments. We find that guppy-female preferences for novel males precludes the evolution of behavioral barriers to between-population mating. This result ensues despite rapid evolution of male signaling traits that influence female preference, and strong divergence between environments in several important ecological components (e.g., exposure to parasites, predators, and food availability) that ought to reduce the survival of foreign individuals.

Game theory models suggest 2 major types of decision criteria: 1) self-assessment, where individuals withdraw when they reach a cost-threshold determined by their own fighting ability that may or may not be affected by injuries, or 2) mutual assessment, where the decision is based on information about the relative fighting ability of the opponents. Many empirical studies have assumed that opponents use a single strategy throughout the whole fight. However, they often find partial support for a specific model. This might be due to individuals changing their strategy between phases of a contest. In this work, we addressed this issue by evaluating if males of the cricket Melanotes ornata switch their assessment strategy between phases. We used hind femur length as a proxy for fighting ability, as it was the attribute most strongly associated with contest outcome. Overall fight duration was positively associated with the loser's femur length and negatively associated with the winner's femur length, while the probability of escalation to physical aggression was negatively related to the difference in femur between opponents. However, such relationships held only at the first contest phase. During the escalated phase, fight duration was only correlated (although weakly) with femur length of losers. These results indicate that M. ornata males perform mutual assessment in the initial phase but switch their assessment strategy when fights escalate, suggesting a single strategy does not correctly explain how contests are settled. How do animals decide when it is time to give up a fight? For a cricket species, this depends on the stage of the fight. In early stages, combatants obtain information about each other, fleeing when they perceive their opponent to be stronger. However, when they have similar fighting abilities, the combat advances to the final stage, when such information is no longer obtained and combatants fight until reaching their motivational or physiological limits.

Cleaner personality and client identity have joint consequences on cleaning interaction dynamics	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						cleaner fish; coral reefs; mutualism; personality; repeatability; trade-offs	WRASSE LABROIDES-DIMIDIATUS; ANIMAL PERSONALITY; BEHAVIORAL TYPES; FISH; MUTUALISM; ECOLOGY; REEF; SIZE; TEMPERAMENT; STABILITY	Mutualistic interactions involve 2 species beneficially cooperating, but it is not clear how these interactions are maintained. In many mutualisms, one species interacts with multiple species, and since partners differ in terms of the commodities they trade, partner identity will directly influence the decisions and behaviors of interacting individuals. Here, we investigated the consequences of within and between-species diversity on a model cleaner-client interaction in a natural environment, by quantifying the behavior of both partners. We found that the predominant Caribbean cleaner fish, the sharknose goby (Elacatinus evelynae), shows personality variation as we documented repeatable individual differences in activity, boldness, and exploratory behaviors. Personality variation was associated with cleaner-client interactions: cleaner boldness and activity were significantly related to posing by clients and cleaning, respectively. Cleaner personality variation was also associated with the functional identity (sociality, mobility, body size, and trophic level) of clients posing and being cleaned. We thus demonstrate that partner identity can have consequences on mutualistic outcomes which will contribute to the context-dependency and highly heterogeneous patterns we observe at a population level. We also suggest that within- and between-species differences have consequences on partner choice, a feature that has been previously thought to be absent from these cleaner-client interactions. Cleaner fish personality links with client identity to determine who interacts with whom and how. Our field study demonstrates that both client and cleaner identities contribute jointly to the variable patterns we observe for mutualisms. We challenge the existing paradigm that Caribbean cleaning gobies represent a simple system for studying cleaner-client interactions.

Contest dynamics and assessment strategies in combatant monkey beetles (Scarabaeidae: Hopliini)	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						contest assessment strategy; exaggerated trait; male competition; Scarabaeidae; sexual selection	RESOURCE VALUE; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; FIGHTING ABILITY; GAME-THEORY; EVOLUTION; SIZE; ALLOMETRY; INFORMATION; POLLINATION; COMPETITION	Some of the most striking examples of intrasexual contest competition are to be found in the insects, whose weaponry and contest behaviors have become highly intricate and diverse. Game theory has been used as a basis to develop models of the competitive assessment strategies that may be used by males either to judge their probability of winning by comparing their own fighting ability to that of their opponents or to persist in contests for a period determined only by their own fighting ability. Conclusions from empirical studies about the means of assessment in their study systems have not, however, always been clear. In view of this, some authors have suggested that utilizing a broad suite of data concerning multiple facets of the study system may assist in gaining clearer insights into animal contests and assessment strategies. The present study integrates data on contest behavior, weapon morphology, residency effects, cost accumulation, and correlates of contest success to test game theory-informed models of competitive assessment strategies in the sexually dimorphic monkey beetle, Heterochelus chiragricus. We found that males of all sizes engaged aggressively in intrasexual contests for mating access to sedentary females, utilizing their hypertrophied hind legs as weapons. Contest outcome was determined by hind femur size and strongly influenced by residency effects. We found mixed support for both pure self-assessment and mutual assessment contest strategies. Such inconclusive findings are not uncommon in animal contest assessment studies, even when contest cost and resource holding power data are contextualized with behavioral and ecological data. In species where female mates are scarce, there is intense competition between males for females. Here we study physical contests for females among male monkey beetles. Males wrestle with their hind legs. We find that males are more likely to win if they have bigger hind legs and if they are the first to find a female. As in similar studies, the male fighting strategy operational in our system is not consistent with theoretical models.

The reliability of signals, however, can be reduced when signal production is partially dependent on the environment. Here, we assess the effect of display-site properties on the production, attractiveness and honesty of sexual signals. We recorded male tungara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) while manipulating water levels in order to constrain calling. We found that water level affected male call properties in a size-dependent manner, with call amplitude being less affected in smaller males when forced to call in shallow water. Next, we tested how size-dependent and display-site-dependent signaling affected female choice and rival competition. Both males and females showed the strongest response to the call of a large male when he was calling at the deepest water levels. However, females showed no preference for large over small males when both were recorded in shallow water levels, or, depending on the call rate and timing of calls, even preferred small males. Likewise, males responded equally to large and small rivals recorded calling during shallow water level trials. Our experiments show that display-site properties can influence signal production and attractiveness in a size-dependent manner. These results can have important consequences for the evolution of signaling, as small males may be able to use their size to their advantage when selecting appropriate display sites and thereby outcompete large males. Many animals use sounds to advertise their body size to potential mates and rivals. Here, we show that the location from which male frogs call influences how large they sound and that both females as well as rival males respond to this environmental impact on call production. These results have important evolutionary consequences, as it demonstrates that small males can outcompete large males by strategically choosing their calling site.	[Smit, Judith A.

In plant-pollinator mutualisms, plants signal pollinators via floral displays, composed of olfactory, visual, and other plant-derived cues. While plants are understood to be associated with microbes, only recently has the role of microbial (yeast and bacteria) inhabitants of flowers as intermediaries of plant-pollinator communication been recognized. Animals frequently use microbial cues to find resources, yet no study has examined whether microbes directly mediate learned and innate pollinator responses. Here, we asked whether microbes on the flower surface, independent of their modification of floral rewards, can mediate these key components of pollinator preference. In the field, we characterized flower and bumble bee microbial abundance, and in laboratory assays we tested whether bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) discriminated flowers on the basis of an experimental floral microbial community on the petals and whether microbe-derived chemicals were effective cues. Learning of microbial community cues was associative and reward context-dependent and mediated by microbial chemicals. Deconstructing the experimental microbial community showed bees innately avoided flowers with bacteria, but were undeterred by yeast. Microbial cues thus potentially facilitate dynamic communication between plants and pollinators such as bumble bees, especially as pollinator visitation can change flower microbiota. We suggest that the study of communication in mutualism generally would benefit by considering not only the multicellular eukaryote partners, but their microbial associates. Microbes on flower surfaces can mediate plant-pollinator communication. We demonstrate that an experimental community of yeast and bacteria on artificial and live flowers can directly mediate the learned floral preferences of bees. Bacteria, but not yeast, mediated innate preference. Preferences were directly mediated by microbial chemicals and did not require modification of the floral reward. We showed microbes were abundant on flowers and floral microbes may therefore potentially widely facilitate communication between plants and pollinators.

Coloration usually covaries with other phenotypic traits affecting life history and thus is often used as a criterion for mate choice. Here, we assess whether mating patterns, natal dispersal, and breeding output are phenotype-dependent in the color polymorphic Eleonora's falcon. We used a long-term dataset of 946 individually ringed adult falcons that included 109 individuals monitored from birth up to recruitment into the breeding population. Overall, patterns of mate choice with regard to coloration were neither assortative nor disassortative. Natal dispersal distance was greater in females but was not associated with coloration. Breeding success was both morph-dependent and context-dependent. Although clutch size was similar in differently colored pairs, differences arose in the number of chicks that fledge. In some years, dark males raised more offspring, regardless of female color morph. Differences in the breeding tactics between male morphs could be associated with intraspecific predation and may thus contribute to the observed differences in breeding output, especially when food availability is low. This suggests that mating patterns may interact with other factors and give rise to the observed higher breeding output of dark males only under certain environmental conditions. In color polymorphic species, individuals can prefer mates of the same or different color, change preference according to socio-environmental conditions, or even show no preference. Coloration can advertise many individual qualities, including kinship. Eleonora's falcons morphs do not mate assortatively or disassortatively, although two incestuous pairs were of the same dark-morph. Dark males raised more offspring than pale ones, but not all years, suggesting that mating interactions in turn interact with environmental factors.

Although several studies highlight some adjustments of sex allocation according to mating opportunities, empirical support for the trade-off between sexual functions is surprisingly scarce. Here, we argue that this lack of support for a trade-off might partially depend on the fact that sex allocation studies often overlook gender-related traits other than gamete production. We investigated whether parental care (a putative female behavior) and motility (a proxy for mate searching, and a putative male behavior) varied plastically according to mating opportunities in the hermaphroditic polychaete worm Ophryotrocha diadema. We found that parental care was higher under low mating opportunities, whereas motility increased under high mating opportunities, and the two behaviors were negatively correlated with each other-that is, there was a trade-off between them. We also observed the behavior of a separate-sex species closely-related to O. diadema-Ophryotrocha labronica. We found that males moved more than females in the separate-sex species and that mothers performed more parental care than fathers in both Ophryotrocha species. Our results provide convincing evidence in support of a trade-off between sexual functions and highlight the importance of investigating sex allocation adjustments in reproductive traits other than gametes. Hermaphrodites in large groups are expected to reallocate resources from female to male function to face increased mate competition. Hermaphroditic worms experimentally exposed to mate competition increased motility and decreased parental care more than worms exposed to no mate competition did. In a closely related separate-sex species, parental care was typically a female trait and motility a male one. These results highlight that hermaphrodites exhibit sex-specific behaviors, which play a central role in reproductive decisions.

In group-living animals, individuals' activity rhythms must be synchronized not only with diel light-dark cycle but also with other group members. Increasing evidence has recently shown that circadian behaviors of animals are consistent within individuals and different between individuals, but the sources and consistency of diel activity variation in social context are less known. Using radio frequency identification technology, we recorded individual moving activity of the Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) in randomly formed groups through 10 full diel cycles in seminatural environment. We found diel changes in variability and repeatability of behavioral activity both within and between the groups: individual differences in activity were more repeatable in nighttime, whereas group differences were more repeatable in daytime. The results suggest that collective group behavior in daylight obscures the expression of individuality, whereas the weak group effects in nighttime reveal a substantially wider continuum of individually consistent activity types. Our findings imply that 1) studying activity variation only on diurnal basis may underestimate the total activity variation among social individuals and may thus bias the repeatability estimates, and 2) accounting for diel variation in social effects may be essential for detecting ecologically realistic behavioral variation within and between animal groups. To conclude, this study highlights the complex interactions between circadian activity rhythms, individual behavioral differences, and group dynamics, and thereby provides new insights for understanding overall behavioral diversity in social animals. Circadian activity rhythms of group-living animals are influenced by social environment. The study demonstrates how the detectable variation in daytime activity of shoaling fish is principally constituted of consistent differences between social groups. On the contrary, nocturnal activity variation is produced by a great diversity of individually consistent activity types. The result underline the importance of studying social animals around the clock to understand the interactions between individual behavioral differences and group dynamics.

Specialization reduces foraging effort and improves breeding performance in a generalist bird	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						GPS tracking; Herring Gull; niche; reproduction; specialization	GULLS LARUS-ARGENTATUS; HERRING-GULLS; INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION; FEEDING STRATEGIES; DIET SPECIALIZATION; NICHE WIDTH; ECOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; CONSISTENCY; EVOLUTION	While competition is generally presumed to promote intraspecific niche diversification, populations of many apparent generalist species still exhibit considerable individual variation in foraging specialization. This suggests that different cost-benefit trade-offs may underlie individual variation in foraging specialization. Indeed, while specialization may improve foraging efficiency by a better knowledge of the spatio-temporal availability of resources, individuals may also become more vulnerable to fluctuations in these resources. In this study, we used multiyear GPS tracking data of 19 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding along the Belgian coast to assess whether foraging effort and reproductive success varied among different levels of foraging specialization. First, we quantified spatial and habitat specialization during incubation and chick rearing for 31 individual breeding cycles during which birds raised young until the age of 21 days. Next, we tested whether spatial and habitat specialization were related to the daily distance covered (as a proxy for foraging effort), and to chick growth (as a proxy for reproductive success). We found that birds primarily varied in their extent of habitat specialization. Habitat specialization was associated with reduced daily distances covered and increased offspring growth rates, in particular the growth rate of the youngest chicks. Yet, positive effects of habitat specialization on chick growth decreased at high levels of spatial specialization. Our results thus demonstrate fitness benefits of foraging specialization during our 5-year study period, but also highlight the need for longer-term studies as environmental changes may cause benefits to vary throughout a lifetime. GPS tracking reveals that specialization reduces foraging effort and increases the breeding success of Belgian Herring Gulls.

African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana), African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis), and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) all combine broadband calls (roars, barks, and cries) and low-frequency calls (rumbles) into single utterances known as combination calls. We investigated whether the structure of such calls differs among species and whether any differences are better explained by phylogenetic relationships or by socioecological factors. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the species differ significantly in the frequency with which they produce different call combinations using data from multiple study sites. Elephas maximus and L. africana mostly produced roar-rumble combinations, whereas L. cyclotis produced a more even distribution of roar-rumble, rumble-roar, and rumble-roar-rumble combinations. There were also significant differences in favored structure among populations of the same species. Moreover, certain call orders were disproportionately likely to be given in particular behavioral contexts. In L. africana, rumble-roar-rumble combinations were significantly more likely than expected by chance to be produced by individuals separated from the group. In E. maximus, there was a nonsignificant trend for rumble-roar-rumbles to be given more often in response to a disturbance. Site-specific socioecological conditions appear more influential for call combination structure than phylogenetic history. All 3 elephant species produce call combinations in various orders, but the preferred order differs among species. African savannah elephant call combinations were more similar to those of the distantly related Asian elephant than to those of the closely related African forest elephant, suggesting that the species difference is better explained by ecological or social factors than by evolutionary closeness. Different call orders were associated with different contexts, suggesting that order may affect call function.

Behavioral responses by an apex predator to urbanization	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Chicago; coyote (Canis latrans); foraging; home range; movement behavior	HOME-RANGE; HABITAT USE; URBAN; COYOTES; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; CARNIVORES; ECOLOGY; SPACE; SIZE	Wildlife can respond to urbanization positively (synanthropic) or negatively (misanthropic), and for some species, this is a nonlinear process, whereby low levels of urbanization elicit a positive response, but this response becomes negative at high levels of urbanization. We applied concepts from foraging theory to predict positive and negative behavioral responses of coyotes (Canis latrans) along an urbanization gradient in the Chicago metropolitan area, USA. We estimated home range size and complexity, and metrics of 3 movement behaviors (encamped, foraging, and traveling) using Hidden Markov movement models. We found coyotes exhibited negative behavioral responses to highly urbanized landscapes: coyotes viewed the landscape as lower quality, riskier, and more fragmented (home range size and complexity, and time spent encamped increased). Conversely, we found evidence of both positive and negative responses to suburban landscapes: coyotes not only viewed the landscape as higher quality than natural fragments and equally risky, but also viewed it as fragmented (home range size decreased, time spent encamped did not change, and home range complexity increased). Although the spatial and behavioral responses of coyotes to urbanization became increasingly negative as urbanization increased, coyotes were still able to occupy highly urbanized landscapes. Our study demonstrates how wildlife behavioral responses can be dependent on the degree of urbanization and represents one of the first descriptions of apex predator space use and movement in a highly urbanized landscape. As urbanization increases globally, wildlife must respond. We applied concepts from foraging behavior to determine how coyote movement behavior varies across a gradient of urbanization. In suburban landscapes, coyotes responded positively by requiring less space to live. In highly urbanized landscapes, coyotes responded negatively by requiring more space and spending more time not moving. Despite these challenges, coyotes can thrive in highly urbanized landscapes, such as downtown Chicago, USA.	[Ellington, E.

Adult nutritional stress decreases oviposition choosiness and fecundity in female butterflies	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						choosiness; diet; insect; life history; oviposition; reproductive investment	PIERIS-RAPAE LEPIDOPTERA; NEST-SITE SELECTION; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; AMINO-ACIDS; TRADE-OFFS; FLIGHT MORPHOLOGY; MATE CHOICE; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; LARVAL PERFORMANCE; FOOD LIMITATION	Despite the benefits of careful decision-making, not all animals are choosy. One explanation is that choosiness can cost time and energy and thus depend on nutrition. However, it is not clear how allocation to choosiness versus other components of life-history shifts in the face of nutritional stress. We tested 2 hypotheses about the effects of nutritional stress on choosiness and other life-history traits: 1) poor nutrition leads to compensatory shifts in life-history strategy towards greater investment per offspring in terms of choosy oviposition behavior and egg resources, and 2) poor nutrition negatively affects a range of life-history traits. Cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) females were reared under low or high nutrition conditions during the larval and adult stage in a fully factorial design. Choosiness was quantified as avoidance of conspecific models during oviposition. Adult life-history traits included egg number, egg size, and thorax protein. Females that experienced nutritional stress as adults were less choosy and less fecund, in support of the second hypothesis. Yet females that were stressed as larvae invested more in thorax muscle, consistent with the first hypothesis. Overall, adult nutritional stress decreased investment in multiple reproductive traits, including a behavioral trait, but larval stress increased investment in flight, potentially to disperse away from nutritionally poor environments. Nutritional stress has varying effects depending on life stage and trait of interest. We show that in female butterflies, poor adult nutrition reduces choosy egg-laying behavior and egg number, while poor larval nutrition increases protein in adult wing muscles, which could enhance flight. Females might compensate for poor larval nutrition by eating more food or by flying to a better environment. If neither strategy is possible, females without adequate access to food may suffer reproductive consequences.

Diet of Nestling Red-headed Woodpeckers in South Carolina	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							MELANERPES-ERYTHROCEPHALUS; HABITAT THRESHOLDS; FRUIT; WILDLIFE; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; ADULT; FIRE	Melanerpes erythrocephalus (Red-headed Woodpecker) has experienced sharp declines in portions of its range. Knowledge of how birds use their nesting habitats, particularly what foods they exploit, may be important in determining causes of population declines, but no modern quantitative study exists on diets of nestling Red-headed Woodpeckers. Our objectives were to identify diets of nestling Red-headed Woodpeckers and quantify variability in food types over time and between roles of males and females in provisioning their young. We conducted observations of nests on the Savannah River Site, SC, from June to September, 2006-2007. We recorded 791 food items fed to nestlings, representing 7 taxa of plants and 18 taxa of animals (16 invertebrate, 2 vertebrate). We assigned food items as either animal matter or soft mast and compared proportions using a binomial mixed model approach. Of the 12 models we tested, 3 received 67% of the cumulative AIC model weight and all included either year or month, indicating annual and monthly variation in foods fed to nestlings. Animal matter composed the majority of Red-headed Woodpecker nestling foods (71.5%), but notably, soft mast was an important component (28.5%). We suggest that future research on Red-headed Woodpeckers consider how the availability of soft mast may or may not limit productivity of this species.

Do Bee Wings Adapt for Flight in Urban Environments?	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY; URBANIZATION; SIZE; MORPHOLOGY; DECLINES; ECOLOGY; APIDAE	Understanding how organisms respond to urban-associated environmental changes is key to protecting vulnerable species. Bees, in particular, have gained interest due to their economic and ecological roles. We used a geometric morphometric approach to describe changes in wing shape and size in the solitary bee Andrena barbara (Barbara's Miner) collected across an urban landscape. We found that, although the wing morphology suggests a limited dispersal ability in its short and narrow frame, the urban landscape did not significantly explain how wing shape or size vary. Our findings are consistent with other studies that show little variation in wing morphology in urban solitary bees, and suggests that urban habitats may potentially serve an important role in bee conservation.

A Growing Conspiracy: Recolonization of Common Ravens (Corvus corax) in Central and Southern Appalachia, USA	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							WHITE-TAILED DEER; REINTRODUCED ELK; BIOGEOGRAPHY; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; LANDSCAPE; GROWTH; CROWS; OLD	Corvus corax (Common Raven, hereafter Raven) was historically ubiquitous throughout much of North America, but persecution and habitat loss after European settlement resulted in range reduction and population decline across much of the eastern US. Increasing numbers of confirmed sightings of Ravens in the eastern US over the past 70 years suggest rapid regional recolonization, particularly in central and southern Appalachia where, in many states, Ravens were thought to be extirpated or at least highly range-restricted. We compiled 64,611 Raven observations from multiple public and private sources across Appalachia between 1950 and 2016 and performed spatial analyses to characterize regional recolonization trends. The Appalachian Mountain range has served as both a refugium for Ravens during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and a regional source population for range expansion between 1950 and 2016. Ravens are now common in the mountainous areas of Appalachia and have recently expanded their range into lower elevations, including the successful recolonization of 4 states: Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. Spatial analyses demonstrated a 40% increase in the Raven's apparent geographic range in central and southern Appalachia, which now spans at least 470,380 km(2). We present an updated map detailing current Raven distributions in central and southern Appalachia and review potential habitat, interspecific, and trophic factors aiding range expansion for Ravens.

Sciurus carolinensis (Eastern Gray Squirrel, hereafter, EGS) are generalists found throughout the eastern US that have historically avoided competition with SFSs through habitat-partitioning. Spring Island, SC, once reported the densest population of SFSs in the southeast, but residents of the island community recently reported decreasing SFS populations and increasing EGS populations. We used baited game-cameras at stratified random points to estimate SFS density, observe patterns of SFS and EGS diurnal activity, and examine the influence of habitat structure and management techniques (e.g., prescribed fire) on SFS and EGS occurrence on Spring Island. Our estimate of SFS density on Spring Island (0.28-0.97 SFSs/ha) was similar to the high density previously reported (0.758 SFSs/ha). SFSs and EGSs had similar diurnal patterns, but SFSs were most active around midday while EGSs were most active in early morning and evening hours. EGS occupancy was negatively associated with fire frequency. EGS detection probability was negatively associated with maximum daily temperature. These data suggest that habitat management via prescribed fire has allowed stable populations of both SFSs and EGSs to persist despite anthropogenic land changes.

We telemetered 12 neonate Agkistrodon piscivorus (Cottonmouth) and monitored their spatial use, activity, and habitat selection. Neonates did not have large spatial requirements, nor did they disperse far before hibernation. Neonates selected habitat edges, and within edges they used areas with thick vegetative cover. We suggest that the habitat selection and limited use of space by neonate Cottonmouths arc products of the migration their mothers make before parturition. Habitat edges appear to be important for both parturition and hibernation. Our study offers valuable insight into the initial life-history stages of Cottonmouths and presents a good baseline for future research on their ontogenetic ecological development.

Owing to its numerous applications, its industrial production is likely to lead to environmental release, including into aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a transcriptomic approach was used to assess the effect of FLG at low (0.1 mg L-1) and high (50 mg L-1) concentrations on the benthic freshwater diatom Nitzschia palea after 48 h of exposure. Direct contact with FLG and induced shading were distinguished to compare the transcriptomic responses. Genes that were differentially expressed after exposure compared with control conditions were identified, and their functional descriptions are discussed. A slight transcriptomic response related to cell wall repair was observed in diatoms exposed to the low FLG concentration. Exposure to the high FLG concentration induced a strong response involving 1907 transcripts. Notably, 16 transcripts involved in the chlorophyll biosynthesis process were under-expressed (log2 fold change between -3 and -1.2), suggesting a down-regulation of the photosynthetic metabolism. Diatoms exposed to the high FLG concentration over-expressed about 13 transcripts encoding for extracellular proteins that play a role in cellular adhesion, and two transcripts involved in cell wall repair were highly up-regulated. Light deprivation caused by shading induced a downregulation of genes involved in the energetic metabolism of N. palea. Overall, these results revealed that metabolic pathways impacted by FLG exposure are concentration and contact dependent. Moreover, this study suggests that a low FLG concentration, close to that in environmental conditions, will have a minor impact on diatom biofilms whereas a high FLG concentration, mimicking accidental release, might be critical for ecosystems.

Neotropical primates inhabit forests and play ecological roles in maintaining forest biodiversity. Currently, many primate communities are restricted to forest fragments. We (1) evaluated the influence of environmental, matrix, and site attributes on species richness and functional traits of primates in the Neotropics; and (2) evaluated the effect of the sub-region on the relationships between primates and environmental, matrix, and site attributes. We conducted literature searches to find published data on primate communities in forest fragments throughout the Neotropics. Each fragment was assigned to 1 of 11 sub-regions: Mesoamerica, Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena, Caribbean, Orinoco, Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Chaco, Andes, Caatinga, and Pampa. Based on actual and expected species occurrences, we calculated the proportion of primate species retained in the fragments, the mass retained, and dietary items retained considering reproductive and vegetative plant parts and prey. We used linear mixed models to correlate primate variables with environmental, matrix, and site attributes. Fragment area was more important for primate retention than environmental, matrix, and site attributes, with primate retention being higher in larger fragments. Fragment size was positively correlated with all primate variables, except for retention of prey consumption, whose retention decreased as water bodies and density of buildings in the matrix increased. Fragments within protected areas retained larger species than unprotected fragments. The proportion of extant mass retained and vegetative plant parts in the diet were highest in Mesoamerica and lowest in the Atlantic Forest. Conservation planning of Neotropical primates should consider both the differences among sub-regions, forest restoration to increase fragment size, and the creation of new protected areas, even in fragmented landscapes.

Intraspecific variation in individual properties of these strong facilitators can affect the whole suite of the dependent taxa. Marine macroalgae often act as ecosystem engineers, providing shelter and substrate for numerous associated organisms. Epibiosis of foliose red algae, however, remains underexplored, especially in the high latitudes. Here we studied sessile macrobenthic assemblages associated with a foliose red algae Phycodrys rubens in the White Sea (66 degrees N) shallow subtidal, and the effect of individual plant properties on their structure. The blades of P. rubens develop annually, and it is possible to tell the young (usually larger) plant parts from the old ones. We hypothesized that epibenthic community structure depends on plant part age and size. We examined epibiosis on 110 plants at two sites, and the results generally supported our hypotheses. Old plant parts were several times smaller, and had higher total cover than young parts. Sponges strongly dominated the epibiosis on old parts, and young parts were dominated by polychaetes and bryozoans. Plant part surface area negatively correlated with total cover on young parts, while on old parts the relatioship was location-specific. On young parts the relative abundance of a polychaete Circeis armoricana increased with surface area, and the proportion of sponges decreased. The patterns indicate that epibenthic community structure is linked to the demography of an ecosystem engineer.

Lichens, due to their poikilohydric nature, are very sensitive to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, lichen communities have been widely used as bioindicators of climatic and environmental changes. In this study, we evaluated how the species richness and community composition of epiphytic lichens respond to land-use intensity in riparian ecosystems of the Andes in southern Ecuador. Additionally, we evaluate how the richness of six functional traits (photobiont type, growth form, and reproductive strategy) changed across the different land-use intensity. We selected 10 trees in twelve sites for a total de 120 trees, equally divided into four riparian land-use intensities (forest, forest-pasture, pasture and urban). We recorded a total of 140 lichen species. Species richness was highest in the forest sites and decreased towards more anthropogenic land uses. Lichen community composition responded to land-use intensity, and was explained by microclimate variables (e.g., precipitation, percentage forested area) and distance to the forest. Richness of functional traits of lichens also differed significantly among the four land-use intensity and decreased from forests to urban land-use. Taxonomic diversity and functional traits can be effectively applied as bioindicators to assess and monitor the effects of land-use changes in the riparian ecosystems of tropical montane regions.

Species-specific differences in plant functional morphology affect sand capture and dune shape. In this study, we build on research showing a relationship between dune grass species and dune geomorphology on the US central Atlantic Coast. This study seeks to determine the ways in which four co-occurring dune grass species (Ammophila breviligulata, Panicum amarum, Spartina patens, Uniola paniculata) differ in their functional morphology and sand accretion. We surveyed the biogeography, functional morphology, and associated change in sand elevation of the four dune grass species along a 320-kilometer distance across the Outer Banks. We found that A. breviligulata had dense and clumped shoots, which correlated with the greatest sand accretion. Coupled with fast lateral spread, it tends to build tall and wide foredunes. Uniola paniculata had fewer but taller shoots and was associated with similar to 42% lower sand accretion. Coupled with slow lateral spread, it tends to build steeper and narrower dunes. Panicum amarum had similar shoot densities and associated sand accretion to U. paniculata despite its shorter shoots, suggesting that shoot density is more important than morphology. Finally, we hypothesize, given the distributions of the grass species, that foredunes may be taller and wider and have better coastal protection properties in the north where A. breviligulata is dominant. If under a warming climate A. breviligulata experiences a range shift to the north, as appears to be occurring with U. paniculata, changes in grass dominance and foredune morphology could make for more vulnerable coastlines.

While their effects on the quality, amount and patterns of landcover patches are commonly studied, how they affect ecological processes, such as predation on focal species remains neglected. This macroecological study tests the hypothesis that predator assemblages are affected by land use intensity linked to different socio-economic contexts. We measured the distribution and abundance of two avian predator groups (generalist corvid birds and specialist raptors), and proxy variables that mirror their food resources, at three spatial scales in northern Europe's West and East. In total, we made 900 survey counts for avian predators and their resources in six landcover strata throughout five landscapes and analyzed their relationships. The abundance of omnivorous corvid birds was associated with the number of anthropogenic food resources. Thus, corvid birds were most common in the urban and agricultural landcovers, and where forest cover was low. Corvid bird abundance, and availability of their resources, increased with increasing land use intensity. Raptors were less abundant than corvid birds and most common in semi-natural grasslands. The number of raptor species increased with decreasing land use intensity. This study shows that the abundance and composition of avian predator species must be understood to maintain functional habitat networks.

Assessing the Impacts of Urbanization on Sex Ratios of Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta)	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						Chicago; chelonian; conservation; urban ecology; Illinois; impervious surface; preserve; protected area; road density	FRESH-WATER TURTLES; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION; TRACHEMYS-SCRIPTA; GENETIC DIVERSITY; HABITAT FEATURES; UNITED-STATES; CONSERVATION; MOVEMENTS; DEMOGRAPHICS	Turtles are particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of urbanization due to low mobility and a life history strategy emphasizing long generation times and high adult survival. In addition to declines directly through habitat loss, urbanization has been hypothesized to limit populations of aquatic turtles through changes in population structure, as adult females are disproportionally killed on and near roads, leading to male-biased populations, which can lead to population declines or local extirpations. The purpose of this study was to better understand how urbanization impacts the sex ratios of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in an urban ecosystem, as empirical results linking male-biased turtle populations to roads and urbanization are mixed. Using eight years of trapping data from a long-term monitoring program in a suburb of Chicago, IL, USA, we report one of the most male-biased populations of turtles in the USA, consistent with prevailing road mortality hypotheses. However, we found no evidence that male-biased populations were related to road density or the amount of protected area around a sampling location and found that impervious surface (a metric of urbanization) was weakly related to less male-biased populations. Our results highlight the importance of replicating ecological studies across space and time and the difficulty in assessing population structure in aquatic turtles. We suggest that active conservation measures may be warranted for the continued persistence of urban turtle populations.

Landscape context and fluctuation in floral resources may influence the distribution of pollination services.ObjectivesThis study investigates how landscape context influences bumble bee density on cranberry marshes across a resource pulse created by the target crop bloom.MethodsWe sampled bumble bees at fourteen cranberry marshes before, during, and after the cranberry bloom in central Wisconsin. We quantified floral richness and surrounding land cover and assessed their effects on bumble bee density and colony representation using OLS regression. We measured colony representation as a colony detection ratewhere low colony detection means more colonies were represented by single individual foragers.ResultsThe amount of forest surrounding marshes explained the most variation in colony density, but not colony representation on site. Sites with high meadow interspersion in the surrounding landscape had lower colony representation (i.e., detection rate), suggesting some dilution effect. Colony density and detection did not change between the pre- and post-bloom period and resource pulse, even after statistically controlling for important landscape-scale effects. Yet, relative increase in colony density, was best explained by increased floral richness and decreased open-shrub bog. Landscapes with less clumpy forest experienced increased colony representation during the crop bloom.ConclusionsWe suggest maintaining forest within cultivated landscapes to promote local bumble bee colony density, and increasing floral richness on site to attract foraging bees.

Montane meadows are biodiversity hotspots for flowering plants and pollinators, but they are contracting due to tree invasion.ObjectivesThis study quantified flowering plants and their flower-visitor species in montane meadows in the western Cascade Range of Oregon. Species diversity in small, isolated meadows was expected to be lower and nested relative to large meadows. Alternatively, landform features may influence richness and spatial turnover.MethodsFlowering plants and their visitors were sampled in summers of 2011-2017 in twelve montane meadows with varying soil moisture. All flowering plants and all flower-visitors were recorded during five to seven 15min watches in ten 3x3m plots in each meadow and year.ResultsA total of 178 flowering plant species, 688 flower-visitor species and 137,916 interactions were identified. Richness of flower-visitors was related to meadow patch size, but neither plant nor flower-visitor richness was related to isolation measured as meadow area within 1000m. Species in small meadows were not nested subsets of those in large meadows. Species replacement accounted for more than 78% of dissimilarity between meadows and was positively related to differences in soil moisture.ConclusionsAlthough larger meadows contained more species, landform features have influenced meadow configuration, persistence, and soil moisture, contributing to high plant and insect species diversity. Hence, conservation and restoration of a variety of meadow types may promote landscape diversity of wild plants and pollinators.

Plantation forests are a major land use worldwide and are likely to expand substantially in the near term, especially with projected cellulosic biofuel production. But little is known about the potential local and landscape-scale impacts of plantation forestry on bees, the most important group of pollinators worldwide.ObjectivesWe studied the effects of local management, landscape context, and their interaction on bee abundance and species richness in the southeastern US, in pine plantations and other nearby land uses.MethodsWe sampled bee communities using aerial netting and pan trapping in 85 sites over 3years.ResultsWe found that both landscape composition and configuration are important factors for bee diversity and abundance at the landscape scale, though interestingly many landscape factors showed contrasting directional responses for diversity versus abundance. Removing the four most common species, all in the genus Lasioglossum (and which comprised similar to 45% of all specimens) largely harmonized the results between diversity and abundance. In addition, we found several interactions between local management and landscape factors, all consistent with the idea that compositional heterogeneity and configurational complexity are more important for bee communities in poorer-quality local habitat.ConclusionsOur results underscore the importance of considering (1) both landscape configuration and composition in analyses, and (2) interactions between local management and landscape factors. The interactions in particular highlight the need to maintain landscape compositional heterogeneity and configurational complexity, particularly in heavily managed landscapes.

However, agricultural intensification and loss of semi-natural habitat may have adverse effects on colony performance. While mass-flowering crops may serve as food sources, landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture may be a poor bumblebee habitat compared to landscapes dominated by semi-natural habitat, such as forests and species-rich grasslands.ObjectivesWe investigated the effect of different land use classes on bumblebee colony performance at two periods of time during the flying season. We expected mass-flowering crops to have a positive influence on colony performance during flowering. After mass-flowering, presence of semi-natural habitat was hypothesized to be essential for colony development.MethodsWe placed artificial colonies of Bombus terrestris in 28 apple and pear orchards during and after mass-flowering. We measured colony growth and took pollen samples from foraging workers. Causal relationships between land-use, pollen quality, amount of pollen collected and colony performance were analyzed.ResultsContrary to our expectations, we found a negative correlation between orchard cover and amount of pollen collected in spring, during mass-flowering, resulting in a lower colony performance. During mass-flowering, colony performance and pollen diversity were positively correlated with cover of open semi-natural habitat, while after mass-flowering, colony performance was positively correlated with forest cover. After mass-flowering, pollen sources were more diverse and colony growth was related to land use classes at a larger spatial scale, indicating that bumblebees foraged further. We did not find a correlation between the performances of colonies at one specific site that were placed during and after mass-flowering.ConclusionsLandscapes dominated by mass-flowering orchards represent inferior habitats for bumblebees during flowering. Heterogenous landscapes, containing a mix of various types of semi-natural habitat increase the habitat quality for bumblebees. We advise to maintain these diverse patches of semi-natural habitat, as mass-flowering crops alone are insufficient to support bumblebee colonies.

Sampling pollinators across entire landscapes is challenging, as trapping needs to cover many habitat types.ObjectivesWe developed and tested a landscape-wide sampling design for pollinators. We assessed the predictability and stability of pollinator biodiversity estimates in agricultural landscapes, and tested how estimates were affected by sampled habitat, landscape composition and spatial scale.MethodsWe sampled pollinators using pan traps at 250 locations in 10 replicated landscapes measuring 1x1km and calculated bee richness predictions based on different sample sizes. Traps were placed regularly in each landscape, sampling each habitat proportionally to its area. Landscapes contained semi-natural habitats, crop fields and forests and differed in the amount of a mass-flowering crop (oilseed rape).ResultsRegular sampling reflected local habitat amount. Compared with cereal fields, significantly more pollinators occurred in oilseed rape, and fewer in forests. Sampling in only one habitat type led to biased estimates of landscape-wide bee species richness, even when sample size was increased. The spatial scale of best predictions depended on the sampled habitat. Species richness was overestimated when sampling was limited to semi-natural habitats and underestimated in oilseed rape fields. Precision increased with the number of sampling points per landscape.ConclusionsTo study landscape-wide pollinator biodiversity, we suggest to sample multiple sites per landscape in a broad range of resource-providing habitat types, with sample sizes proportional to habitat amount. Our approach will also be useful for biodiversity monitoring programs in general.

We hypothesized that source limitation at Los Tuxtlas makes seed dispersal more reliant on landscape patterns measured across larger spatial scales, especially when considering connectedness-related landscape metrics and dispersal-dependent responses.MethodsWe recorded the abundance and diversity of tree seeds in 20 forest sites per region, separately assessing local (dropping from neighboring trees) and dispersed (immigrant) seeds. We measured forest cover, fragmentation, and matrix openness in 11 concentric landscapes surrounding each site and tested for differences in SoE among regions, landscape metrics, response variables, and seed origins.ResultsContrary to expectations, SoE did not differ between regions and seed origins. Yet, as expected, forest cover tended to have larger SoE than matrix openness, with fragmentation showing intermediate values. Response variables also followed the predicted SoE pattern (abundance<diversity<species richness).ConclusionsForest cover has larger SoE than matrix openness, possibly because forest cover is related to large-scale processes (e.g. long-distance dispersal) and matrix openness may drive small-scale processes (e.g. edge effects). Species richness may have larger SoE because of its dependence on long-distance dispersal. Therefore, to accurately assess the effect of landscape structure on seed dispersal, the optimal scale of analysis depends on predictor and response variables.

Linking mesoscale landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity: gardens and tree cover significantly modify flower-visiting beetle communities	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Flower-visiting beetles; Landscape heterogeneity; Landscape mosaics; Mesoscale landscape; Urban biodiversity	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; ARTHROPOD ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY; FARMLAND; SCALE; CONSERVATION; DISPERSAL; BIRDS; CONFIGURATION	ContextMaintaining biodiversity in multifunction landscapes is a significant challenge. Planning for the impacts of change requires knowledge of how species respond to landscape heterogeneity. Some insect groups are known to respond to heterogeneity at the mesoscale, defined here as hundreds of metres. However, for many taxa these effects are poorly known.ObjectivesTo identify key elements of mesoscale landscape heterogeneity influencing community composition in flower-visiting beetles, and whether landscape explains any variation in beetle communities beyond that driven by immediate habitat cover.MethodsFlower-visiting beetles were sampled from 36 transects, laid out using a 6km(2) grid located in southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was measured for 30 and 200m buffers around the transects and the relative response of beetle communities to each assessed using ordination analyses followed by variation partitioning.ResultsThe composition of immediately adjacent habitat (30m) and mesoscale landscape heterogeneity (200m) explained unique portions of the variation in flower-visiting beetle communities. A number of species, including those affiliated with deadwood habitats, were positively linked to tree cover in the surrounding mesoscale landscape. Gardens covered a smaller area than trees but modified beetle communities to the same extent.ConclusionsThe local abundance of some flower-visiting beetles is modified by the composition of the surrounding landscape. Results highlight the importance of tree cover for maintaining insect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, while suggesting that gardens associated with small urban areas may have a disproportionate influence on biodiversity.

Connectivity of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations in a highly fragmented urban landscape	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Habitat fragmentation; Highways; Roads; Gene flow; Urbanization; Ungulates; Least-cost paths; Resource selection	WHITE-TAILED DEER; RECENT HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; COASTAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; GENE FLOW; SOFTWARE; DIVERSITY; DIFFERENTIATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; CARNIVORE; MOVEMENT	ContextUrbanization is a substantial force shaping the genetic and demographic structure of natural populations. Urban development and major highways can limit animal movements, and thus gene flow, even in highly mobile species. Characterizing varying species responses to human activity and fragmentation is important for maintaining genetic continuity in wild animals and for preserving biodiversity. As one of the only common and wide-ranging large wild herbivores in much of urban North America, deer play an important ecological role in urban ecosystems, yet the genetic impacts of development on deer are not well known.ObjectivesWe assessed genetic connectivity for mule deer to understand their genetic response to habitat fragmentation, due to development and highway barriers, in an increasingly urbanized landscape.MethodsUsing non-invasive sampling across a broad region of southern California, we investigated genetic structure among several natural areas that were separated by major highways and applied least-cost path modelling to determine if landscape context and highway attributes influence genetic distance for mule deer.ResultsWe observed significant yet variable differentiation between subregions. We show that genetic structure corresponds with highway boundaries in certain habitat patches, and that particular landscape configurations more greatly limit gene flow between patches.ConclusionsAs a large and highly mobile species generally considered to be well adapted to human activity, mule deer nonetheless showed genetic impacts of intensive urbanization. Because of this potential vulnerability, mule deer and other ungulates may require further consideration for effective habitat management and maintenance of landscape connectivity in human-dominated landscapes.

We used a multi-species analysis following a Bayesian approach. We modeled species occurrence as a function of landscape complexity (estimated through the Shannon habitat diversity index) at six spatial scales.ResultsWe found that the occurrence probability of species that are favored by agriculture intensification increased with the decrease of landscape complexity, whereas that of species dependent on natural habitats decreased. Some species occurred over the whole range of landscape complexity, one species was only present in the simplest landscapes and the others occurred at intermediate and high values of landscape complexity. Species richness increased with landscape complexity. On average, our results suggest that landscape complexity is perceived by small mammals at a spatial scale of 150-200m.ConclusionsLandscape heterogeneity is a key factor to maintain biodiversity and species persistence in agroecosystems. An important finding of our study is that a complex landscape at 200m (16ha) spatial scale would benefit most small mammal assemblage species. This result would be key to define management strategies for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes of central Argentina.

This trend persists despite the recognition that patch quality can strongly influence population demography at the local scale. The quality of patches is often temporally variable and influenced by abiotic conditions. However, few studies have explicitly investigated how climatic variables influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of spatially-structured populations either directly or indirectly through changes in patch quality.ObjectivesUsing a 10-year census of a spatially-structured population of an outbreaking caterpillar, we determined the relative importance of patch quality (determined demographically), connectivity, precipitation, and their interactive effects on patch abundance, occupancy, colonization, and extinction.MethodsWe generated a series of statistical models and performed comparisons using Akaike's information criterion. We subsequently used likelihood ratio tests to determine the influence of each parameter on model fit.ResultsPatch quality and precipitation were the strongest predictors of the observed dynamics. We found that the dynamics of the spatially-structured population of Arctia virginalis were strongly influenced by precipitation: all patches had a higher probability of occupancy, contained higher abundances of caterpillars, and experienced fewer extinctions following wet winters compared to years following droughts.ConclusionThese findings suggest that precipitation may act to influence the strength of heterogeneity of patch quality. This work demonstrates that patch-based models that do not include local and climatic factors may produce poor predictions under future climatic regimes.

However, the current trend of land use intensification in Central Europe involves the risk of trade-offs between them. Since cultural ecosystem services (CES) are less tangible, they are often underrepresented in landscape management decisions. To highlight this subject we evaluated CES in agro-ecosystems in the biosphere reserve Swabian Alb (Southwestern Germany). We conducted a survey among visitors to investigate their usage of the landscape, their perception as well as valuation of CES, and interrelations with biodiversity. The results show the presence of various types of usage related to cultural services, the most prominent being recreation and landscape aesthetics. People declared a high affinity to nature and biodiversity awareness. A participatory mapping task revealed their appreciation of biodiverse and ecologically relevant places such as protected species-rich grasslands, traditional orchards and hedgerows. Several socio-demographic differences emerged, e.g., between age classes and local/non-local visitors. We conclude that our exemplary methodical approach was successful in capturing the CES and their link to biodiversity in the investigated biosphere reserve, while identifying priority fields of action concerning the integration of CES into management and planning of cultural landscapes, ultimately serving as guides for local decision-makers.

The use of smart card data to estimate accessibility indicators for explaining the housing market has not yet been explored in the literature. Hence, this paper employs information from Brisbane, Australia's go card and corresponding property data to develop residential property hedonic pricing models using an ordinary least square (OLS) model, a spatial lagged model (SL), a spatial error model (SE), and a geographically weighted regression (GWR). Due to the systematic coincidence between location and price similarities, these spatial econometric models yield superior goodness-of-fit over the OLS model. Using the proposed definition of public transit accessibility in this study, it was found that properties located in well-connected, well-serviced, and accessible locations generally experience premiums in their values. The results indicate that there is value added to the property market from the public investment in public transport services and infrastructure, which supports the adoption of transit funding mechanisms, such as value-capture taxes. Furthermore, the analysis of spatial interactions between transport accessibility and the housing market could be of use to policy makers to ensure a just distribution of capital investment in future infrastructure projects.

The challenge occurs for two reasons: (1) tremendous natural environmental heterogeneity exists within a continental landscape and (2) reference sites vary in quality both across and within major regions of the continent. We describe the process used to set reference expectations and define a disturbance gradient for the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency's National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA). The NWCA employed a probability design and sampled 1138 wetland sites across the conterminous US to make an unbiased assessment of wetland condition. NWCA vegetation data were used to define 10 reporting groups based on ecoregion and wetland type that reduced the naturally occurring variation in wetland vegetation associated with continent-wide differences in biogeography. These reporting groups were used as a basis for defining quantitative criteria for least disturbed and most disturbed conditions and developing indices and thresholds for categories of ecological condition and disturbance. The NWCA vegetation assessment was based on a reference site approach, in which the least disturbed reference sites were used to establish benchmarks for assessing the condition of vegetation at other sites. Reference sites for each reporting group were identified by filtering NWCA sample data for disturbance using a series of abiotic variables. Ultimately, 277 least disturbed sites were used to set reference expectations for the NWCA. The NWCA provided a unique opportunity to improve our conceptual and technical understanding of how to best apply a reference condition approach to assessing wetlands across the US. These results will enhance the technical quality of future national assessments.

Characterizing nonnative plants in wetlands across the conterminous United States	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Nonnative plant indicator (NNPI); Potential ecological stress; Nonnative richness; Nonnative relative cover; Nonnative relative frequency; National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA); Conterminous United States	INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS; REED PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; MICROSTEGIUM-VIMINEUM; COMMON REED; PHALARIS-ARUNDINACEA; TAMARIX-RAMOSISSIMA; ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL; SPECIES RICHNESS; NORTH-AMERICA; SOIL	Nonnative plants are widely recognized as stressors to wetlands and other ecosystems. They may compete with native plant species or communities and alter ecosystem properties, which can affect ecological condition, posing challenges to resource managers. As part of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA), we characterized the status of nonnative plants in wetlands across the conterminous United States (US). Our primary goals were to (1) document the composition of nonnative taxa at 1138 NWCA sites sampled in 2011 and (2) estimate the areal extent of wetland under stress from nonnative plants within the NWCA 2011 sampled population of similar to 25 million ha of wetland (represented by 967 sampled probability sites and the NWCA survey design). A total of 443 unique nonnative taxa were observed, encompassing a species pool adapted to diverse ecological conditions. For individual sites, the number of nonnative taxa ranged from 0 to 29, and total absolute cover of nonnatives ranged from 0 to 160%. We devised the nonnative plant indicator (NNPI) as a categorical indicator of stress (low to very high) from the collective set of nonnative plant taxa occurring at a particular location, based on a decision matrix of exceedance values for nonnative richness, relative frequency, and relative cover. Wetland area of the sampled population occurring in each NNPI category was estimated at the scale of the conterminous US and within five large ecoregions and four broad wetland types. Potential stress from nonnative plants, as indicated by the NNPI category, was low for approximately 61% (similar to 15.3 million ha), moderate for about 20% (similar to 5.2 million ha), high for about 10% (similar to 2.48 million ha), and very high for about 9% (similar to similar to 2.2 million ha) of the wetland area in the entire sampled population. Percent of wetland area with high and very high NNPI varied by ecoregional subpopulations: greater within interior and western ecoregions (similar to 29 to 87%) than within ecoregions in the eastern half of the nation (similar to 11%). Among wetland type subpopulations, greater percent of wetland area with high and very high NNPI was observed for herbaceous vs. woody types and for inland vs. estuarine types. Estimates of wetland area by NNPI categories are expected to be useful to policy makers or resource managers for prioritizing management actions by identifying situations where stress from nonnative plants is most extensive. We also considered four exploratory analyses aimed at providing ecological information useful in interpreting NNPI extent results. We conducted three population-scale analyses examining ecoregional and wetland type population means for (1) the three NNPI metrics, (2) absolute cover of growth-habit groups of nonnative plants, and (3) metrics describing human-mediated disturbance. Finally, we examined ecological relationships with site-level NNPI status using a random forest (RF) analysis with NNPI as the response variable and predictor variables including ecoregion, wetland type, and a variety of characteristics describing natural vegetation structure, environment, and human-mediated disturbance.

Survey design to assess condition of wetlands in the United States	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Wetlands; Probability survey design; Wetland condition; Frame imperfections; Non-response	SAMPLING DESIGN; PENNSYLVANIA; ECOREGIONS; EXAMPLE	The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) initiated planning in 2007 and conducted field work in 2011 for the first National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) as part of the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS). It complements the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetland Status and Trends (S&T) program that estimates wetland acres nationally. The NWCA used a stratified, unequal probability survey design based on wetland information from S&T plots to select 900 sites for the conterminous 48 states. Based on site evaluation information, the NWCA estimates that there are 94.9 (+/- 6.20) million acres of wetlands in the NWCA target wetland population (reported in acres to be consistent with S&T). Not all of the estimated target population acres could be sampled due to accessibility and field issues. Based on the sites that could be sampled, the sampled population for the NWCA is estimated to be 62.2 (+/- 5.28) million acres of wetland area. Landowner denial for access was the main reason (24.7%+/- 3.5%) for the sampled population being smaller than the target population, and physical inaccessibility was the second reason (6.8%+/- 2.1%). The NWCA 2011 survey design was successful in enabling a national survey for wetland condition to be conducted and coordinated with the USFWS S&T survey of wetland extent. The NWCA 2016 survey design has been modified to address sample frame issues resulting from the difference in S&T focusing only on national estimates and NWCA focusing on national and regional estimates.

Drift happens: Molecular genetic diversity and differentiation among populations of jewelweed (Impatiens capensis Meerb.) reflect fragmentation of floodplain forests	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						de novo parameter optimization; genetic drift; inbreeding; landscape genetics; loss of genetic diversity; wetlands	INBREEDING DEPRESSION; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPE GENETICS; RIPARIAN; FLOW; SIZE; CONSEQUENCES; EXTINCTION; DISPERSAL; EVOLUTION	Landscape features often shape patterns of gene flow and genetic differentiation in plant species. Populations that are small and isolated enough also become subject to genetic drift. We examined patterns of gene flow and differentiation among 12 floodplain populations of the selfing annual jewelweed (Impatiens capensis Meerb.) nested within four river systems and two major watersheds in Wisconsin, USA. Floodplain forests and marshes provide a model system for assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation within agricultural/urban landscapes and for testing whether rivers act to genetically connect dispersed populations. We generated a panel of 12,856 single nucleotide polymorphisms and assessed genetic diversity, differentiation, gene flow, and drift. Clustering methods revealed strong population genetic structure with limited admixture and highly differentiated populations (mean multilocus F-ST = 0.32, F-ST' = 0.33). No signals of isolation by geographic distance or environment emerged, but alleles may flow along rivers given that genetic differentiation increased with river distance. Differentiation also increased in populations with fewer private alleles (R-2 = 0.51) and higher local inbreeding (R-2 = 0.22). Populations varied greatly in levels of local inbreeding (F-IS = 0.2-0.9) and F-IS increased in more isolated populations. These results suggest that genetic drift dominates other forces in structuring these Impatiens populations. In rapidly changing environments, species must migrate or genetically adapt. Habitat fragmentation limits both processes, potentially compromising the ability of species to persist in fragmented landscapes.

Standing genomic variation within coding and regulatory regions contributes to the adaptive capacity to climate in a foundation tree species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Eucalyptus sensu lato; genotype environment association; landscape genomics; local adaptation; standing genetic variation	LOCAL ADAPTATION; CANDIDATE GENES; ABSCISIC-ACID; EUCALYPTUS; LANDSCAPE; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES; DROUGHT; FOREST	Global climate is rapidly changing, and the ability for tree species to adapt is dependent on standing genomic variation; however, the distribution and abundance of functional and adaptive variants are poorly understood in natural systems. We test key hypotheses regarding the genetics of adaptive variation in a foundation tree: genomic variation is associated with climate, and genomic variation is more likely to be associated with temperature than precipitation or aridity. To test these hypotheses, we used 9,593 independent, genomic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 270 individuals sampled from Corymbia calophylla's entire distribution in south-western Western Australia, spanning orthogonal temperature and precipitation gradients. Environmental association analyses returned 537 unique SNPs putatively adaptive to climate. We identified SNPs associated with climatic variation (i.e., temperature [458], precipitation [75] and aridity [78]) across the landscape. Of these, 78 SNPs were nonsynonymous (NS), while 26 SNPs were found within gene regulatory regions. The NS and regulatory candidate SNPs associated with temperature explained more deviance (27.35%) than precipitation (5.93%) and aridity (4.77%), suggesting that temperature provides stronger adaptive signals than precipitation. Genes associated with adaptive variants include functions important in stress responses to temperature and precipitation. Patterns of allelic turnover of NS and regulatory SNPs show small patterns of change through climate space with the exception of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene variant with 80% allelic turnover with temperature. Together, these findings provide evidence for the presence of adaptive variation to climate in a foundation species and provide critical information to guide adaptive management practices.

Nonfertilizing sperm in Lepidoptera show little evidence for recurrent positive selection	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Danaus plexippus; Manduca sexta; population genetics; sperm dimorphism	APYRENE SPERM; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; REPRODUCTIVE-TRACT; SWIMMING SPEED; MATING SYSTEM; GENOME; COMPETITION; RATES; POLYMORPHISM	Sperm are among the most variable cells in nature. Some of this variation results from nonadaptive errors in spermatogenesis, but many species consistently produce multiple sperm morphs, the adaptive significance of which remains unknown. Here, we investigate the evolution of dimorphic sperm in Lepidoptera, the butterflies and moths. Males of this order produce both fertilizing sperm and a secondary, nonfertilizing type that lacks DNA. Previous organismal studies suggested a role for nonfertilizing sperm in sperm competition, but this hypothesis has never been evaluated from a molecular framework. We combined published data sets with new sequencing in two species, the monandrous Carolina sphinx moth and the highly polyandrous monarch butterfly. Based on population genetic analyses, we see evidence for increased adaptive evolution in fertilizing sperm, but only in the polyandrous species. This signal comes primarily from a decrease in nonsynonymous polymorphism in sperm proteins compared to the rest of the genome, suggesting stronger purifying selection, consistent with selection via sperm competition. Nonfertilizing sperm proteins, in contrast, do not show an effect of mating system and do not appear to evolve differently from the background genome in either species, arguing against the involvement of nonfertilizing sperm in direct sperm competition. Based on our results and previous work, we suggest that nonfertilizing sperm may be used to delay female remating in these insects and decrease the risk of sperm competition rather than directly affect its outcome.

Satellite tracking of gulls and genomic characterization of faecal bacteria reveals environmentally mediated acquisition and dispersal of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						antimicrobial resistance; molecular epidemiology; satellite telemetry; whole genome sequencing; wildlife	ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; INCREASED PREVALENCE; GENES; IDENTIFICATION; BIRDS; SURVEILLANCE; MIGRATION; LANDFILL; BEHAVIOR; JEJUNI	Gulls (Larus spp.) have frequently been reported to carry Escherichia coli exhibiting antimicrobial resistance (AMR E. coli); however, the pathways governing the acquisition and dispersal of such bacteria are not well described. We equipped 17 landfill-foraging gulls with satellite transmitters and collected gull faecal samples longitudinally from four locations on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska to assess: (a) gull attendance and transitions between sites, (b) spatiotemporal prevalence of faecally shed AMR E. coli, and (c) genomic relatedness of AMR E. coli isolates among sites. We also sampled Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) harvested as part of personal-use dipnet fisheries at two sites to assess potential contamination with AMR E. coli. Among our study sites, marked gulls most commonly occupied the lower Kenai River (61% of site locations) followed by the Soldotna landfill (11%), lower Kasilof River (5%) and upper Kenai River (<1%). Gulls primarily moved between the Soldotna landfill and the lower Kenai River (94% of transitions among sites), which were also the two locations with the highest prevalence of AMR E. coli. There was relatively high spatial and temporal variability in AMR E. coli prevalence in gull faeces and there was no evidence of contamination on salmon harvested in personal-use fisheries. We identified E. coli sequence types and AMR genes of clinical importance, with some isolates possessing genes associated with resistance to as many as eight antibiotic classes. Our findings suggest that gulls acquire AMR E. coli at habitats with anthropogenic inputs and subsequent movements may represent pathways through which AMR is dispersed.

Marginal populations should often experience low effective population sizes (N-e) where genetic drift is high due to demographic expansion and/or census population size is low due to unfavourable environmental conditions. Nevertheless, invasive species demonstrate increasing evidence of rapid evolution and potential adaptation to novel environments encountered during colonization, calling into question whether significant reductions in N-e are realized during range expansions in nature. Here we report one of the first empirical tests of the joint effects of expansion dynamics and environment on effective population size variation during invasive range expansion. We estimate contemporary values of N-e using rates of linkage disequilibrium among genome-wide markers within introduced populations of the highly invasive plant Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) in North America (California, USA), and within native Eurasian populations. As predicted, we find that N-e within the invaded range is positively correlated with both expansion history (time since founding) and habitat quality (abiotic climate). History and climate had independent additive effects with similar effect sizes, indicating an important role for both factors in this invasion. These results support theoretical expectations for the population genetics of range expansion, though whether these processes can ultimately arrest the spread of an invasive species remains an unanswered question.

Major shifts in gut microbiota during development and its relationship to growth in ostriches	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						colonization; microbiome; ontogeny; Struthio camelus; succession	INTESTINAL BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; STRUTHIO-CAMELUS CHICKS; HIGH-FAT DIET; AKKERMANSIA-MUCINIPHILA; ZINC BACITRACIN; DIVERSITY; INFLAMMATION; ANTIBIOTICS; HEALTH; MODE	The development of gut microbiota during ontogeny is emerging as an important process influencing physiology, immunity and fitness in vertebrates. However, knowledge of how bacteria colonize the juvenile gut, how this is influenced by changes in the diversity of gut bacteria and to what extent this influences host fitness, particularly in nonmodel organisms, is lacking. Here we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to describe the successional development of the faecal microbiome in ostriches (Struthio camelus, n = 66, repeatedly sampled) over the first 3 months of life and its relationship to growth. We found a gradual increase in microbial diversity with age that involved multiple colonization and extinction events and a major taxonomic shift in bacteria that coincided with the cessation of yolk absorption. Comparisons with the microbiota of adults (n = 5) revealed that the chicks became more similar in their microbial diversity and composition to adults as they aged. There was a five-fold difference in juvenile growth during development, and growth during the first week of age was strongly positively correlated with the abundance of the genus Bacteroides and negatively correlated with Akkermansia. After the first week, the abundances of six phylogenetically diverse families (Peptococcaceae, S24-7, Verrucomicrobiae, Anaeroplasmataceae, Streptococcaceae, Methanobacteriaceae) were associated with subsequent reductions in chick growth in an age-specific and transient manner. These results have broad implications for our understanding of the development of gut microbiota and its associations with animal growth.

They select for hosts that evolve counter-adaptive strategies to cope with infection. Helminth parasites are special because they can modulate their hosts' immune responses. This phenomenon is important in epidemiological contexts, where coinfections may be affected. How different types of hosts and helminths interact with each other is insufficiently investigated. We used the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) - Schistocephalus solidus model to study mechanisms and temporal components of helminth immune modulation. Sticklebacks from two contrasting populations with either high resistance (HR) or low resistance (LR) against S. solidus, were individually exposed to S. solidus strains with characteristically high growth (HG) or low growth (LG) in G. aculeatus. We determined the susceptibility to another parasite, the eye fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, and the expression of 23 key immune genes at three time points after S. solidus infection. D. pseudospathaceum infection rates and the gene expression responses depended on host and S. solidus type and changed over time. Whereas the effect of S. solidus type was not significant after three weeks, T regulatory responses and complement components were upregulated at later time points if hosts were infected with HG S. solidus. HR hosts showed a well orchestrated immune response, which was absent in LR hosts. Our results emphasize the role of regulatory T cells and the timing of specific immune responses during helminth infections. This study elucidates the importance to consider different coevolutionary trajectories and ecologies when studying host-parasite interactions.

Integrating encounter theory with decision analysis to evaluate collision risk and determine optimal protection zones for wildlife	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						abundance; collision risk; encounter rate; Florida Manatee; human-wildlife interactions; marine mammals; protection zones	PROBABILITY; ABUNDANCE; EXAMPLE; WHALES	Better understanding human-wildlife interactions and their links with management can help improve the design of wildlife protection zones. One example is the problem of wildlife collisions with vehicles or human-built structures (e.g., power lines, wind farms). In fact, collisions between marine wildlife and watercraft are among the major threats faced by several endangered species of marine mammals. Natural resource managers are therefore interested in finding cost-effective solutions to mitigate these threats. We combined abundance estimators with encounter rate theory to estimate relative lethal collision risk of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) from watercraft. We first modelled seasonal abundance of watercraft and manatees using a Bayesian analysis of aerial survey count data. We then modelled relative lethal collision risk in space and across seasons. Finally, we applied decision analysis and Linear Integer Programming to determine the optimal design of speed zones in terms of relative risk to manatees and costs to waterway users. We used a Pareto efficient frontier approach to evaluate the performance of alternative zones, which included additional practical considerations (e.g., spatial aggregation of speed zones) in relation to the optimal zone configurations. Under the various relationships for probability of death given strike speed that we considered, the current speed zones reduced the relative lethal collision risk by an average of 51.5% to 70.0% compared to the scenario in which all speed regulations were removed (i.e., the no-protection scenario). We identified optimal zones and near-optimal zones with additional management considerations that improved upon the current zones in terms of cost or relative risk. Policy implications. Our analytical framework combines encounter rate theory and decision analysis to quantify the effectiveness of speed zones in protecting manatees while accounting for uncertainty. Our approach can be used to optimize the design of protection zones intended to reduce conflicts between human waterborne activity and marine mammals. This framework could be extended to address many other problems of human-wildlife interactions, such as the optimal placement of wind farms to minimize collisions with wildlife or the optimal allocation of ranger effort to mitigate poaching threats.

A variety of approaches exist for seabed habitat classification. Most partition the environment according to physical environmental characteristics, with an assumption that resulting habitat classes are biologically meaningful. In the absence of comprehensive broad-scale biological data, this strategy offers a logical and pragmatic way of producing habitat maps to help manage the marine environment. Across Europe, the physical based European Nature Information System (EUNIS) classification has gained wide acceptance, with maps used to classify broadscale habitats within Marine Protected Areas and to design monitoring programmes. An alternative approach to habitat classification, made possible by increasing quantities of data, is to use the biology to identify meaningful habitats. With such contrasting approaches, the question arises as to which provides the most robust and efficient basis for biological monitoring. To investigate, we compared variability in macrofaunal assemblages across different EUNIS sediment classes to those of two new habitat classification approaches developed in this study. The first of these (PHY) is based on a wide suite of physical variables known to influence the fauna. The second (BIO) uses the fauna to identify meaningful habitats. Both classifications were produced using a training dataset (9,619 grab samples) and employing k-means clustering and Random Forest Modelling. Power analysis of test set data (4,123 samples) was used to assess the number of samples required to detect a 20% change in taxon richness and total abundance across all classes of each classification approach. Results showed that across all habitat classes, the BIO classification required 49% and 31% fewer samples to detect the change in richness and abundance than EUNIS level 4. Whilst offering some improvement on EUNIS, PHY still required many more samples than BIO. Synthesis and applications. Habitat maps based on biological data have generally lower within-habitat variability in community metrics than those produced using physical attributes alone. As a result, biologically-based habitat maps could offer a more cost-effective basis for ecological monitoring.

Organic farming promotes biotic resistance to foodborne human pathogens	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						agroecology; coprophage; disease ecology; E; coli O157:H7; ecosystem service; farm biodiversity; food safety	DUNG BEETLES COLEOPTERA; ESCHERICHIA-COLI O157-H7; SOUTHERN ALBERTA; FOOD SAFETY; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; SEASONAL ACTIVITY; CATTLE DUNG; SCARABAEIDAE; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION	Farmland biodiversity benefits pollination, biological control and other key ecosystem services. Food safety has been seen as an exception to this broader pattern, as diverse farmlands attract wildlife that vector foodborne human pathogens. Resulting mitigation efforts thus often seek to deter wildlife by removing natural habitats, while also excluding vertebrate livestock. However, surprising recent evidence suggests that farm simplification actually increases the likelihood that produce will be contaminated with human pathogens. Here, we consider the possibility that intensified agriculture harms faeces-feeding (coprophagous) beetles and bacteria, which could contribute to heightened food-safety risk. In 70 commercial vegetable fields spanning the US west coast, using either organic or conventional farming methods, we surveyed coprophages both above- and below-ground. We also measured removal rates of the faeces of Sus scrofa, which vectors foodborne pathogens both as livestock and as feral wildlife. Above-ground, organic farms fostered dung beetle species that removed S.scrofa faeces more rapidly than was seen on conventional farms, although this benefit was weakened in simplified landscapes dominated by pasture and an introduced dung beetle. Below-ground, organic farming encouraged significantly higher biodiversity among soil bacteria. Organic farming similarly benefitted dung beetles and bacteria on farms that produced livestock alongside vegetables, or vegetables alone. Complementary laboratory experiments revealed that the dung beetle species and biodiverse bacterial assemblages typical of organic farms were significantly more effective at suppressing human-pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7, compared to coprophage communities associated with conventional farms. This suggests that farm management practices, coprophage conservation, and human-pathogen suppression might be linked.Synthesis and applications. Altogether, our results indicate that insects and microbes can rapidly remove faeces, with the potential to also decrease the persistence of human pathogens. In turn, this suggests that improved food safety may be an important, and perhaps underappreciated, ecosystem service that is enhanced by on-farm biodiversity. We recommend that farm managers and regulators consider the risks and benefits to coprophages when making management decisions regarding food safety.

Plant community regeneration differs greatly in structure and composition after agricultural impacts, yet the mechanisms underpinning these dramatic changes are poorly understood. It is critical to determine the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors that limit plant establishment and success during the recovery process. In particular, below-ground competition for resources in soils affected by former agricultural uses may play an important role in limiting plant establishment. Yet, below-ground competition is generally studied less than above-ground, especially in the context of land-use history. We compare plant establishment with and without below-ground competition in the context of a large-scale experiment manipulating land-use histories (i.e. with and without a history of agriculture) and restoration of historical vegetation structure (i.e. thinned and unthinned canopy trees) and determine how life stage and the local environment (e.g. soil water holding capacity, vegetation cover) influence this relationship. For three of our four target species, below-ground competition strongly limited establishment success, but did not interact with land-use history and canopy thinning directly. Instead, land-use history and canopy thinning interacted to affect establishment during germination and survival in spring, while below-ground competition limited growth during the summer. The strength of below-ground competition was affected by local resources, but the directionality of this relationship depended on agricultural history and canopy thinning.Synthesis and applications. Because adding seeds increased establishment in all cases, we recommend confronting land-use legacies by overcoming dispersal limitation with seed additions (even in degraded sites) and ensuring that below-ground structures are managed during restoration, especially in summer. In addition, managers should consider how the relationship between local resources and below-ground competition at individual sites might depend on land-use history or canopy thinning.

However, management strategies for optimal insect pollination are still unclear for most crops. Current management focuses on providing high densities of honeybees, but recommended densities are highly variable, even within single crops and cultivars. We performed an extensive literature search to record honeybee densities (colony density and/or flower visitation rates) and crop productivity (fruit set, seed set, fruit weight and/or yield). Effect sizes were represented as the difference in crop productivity between the two most extreme levels of honeybee densities. Out of 795 reviewed studies, only 22 analysed the effect of at least two levels of honeybee densities on crop productivity (reporting 60 resulting effect sizes in total). Moreover, few recommendations for crop pollination management are based on results from controlled experimental designs, and with comparable methodology. We found that both colony density and visitation rates increased all the productivity variables. However, effects were nonlinear for visitation rates, suggesting that there is an optimum (mean of 8-10 visits per flower) beyond which more honeybees are not beneficial (and can even be detrimental) for crop productivity. Effect sizes for visitation rates were greater than that for colony densities, suggesting that visitation rates are a more direct measure of the pollination process. Data on the relation between colony density and visitation rates are lacking. Interestingly, effect sizes for visitation rates were greater for crops with separate sexes than those with hermaphroditic flowers; therefore, the benefits of honeybee pollination vary according to the crop biology.Synthesis and applications. Current practices for crop pollination assume that more honeybees are always better for crop yield, even if the effect of this management on crop production still unclear. In contrast, our analyses suggest that there is an optimum for honeybee densities. Despite the importance of honeybees and pollinator-dependent crops world-wide, there is a lack of studies designed for finding such an optimal level of crop pollination. Our analyses further suggest that visitation rates could be used as a proxy to guide management recommendations such as colony density and spatial arrangement. Foreign Language AbstractResumen Los deficits de polinizacion estan limitando la productividad de los cultivos en todo el mundo. Para sustentar el servicio de polinizacion en zonas de agricultura intensiva, el manejo actual consiste en saturar los cultivos de flores con abejas meliferas proveyendo altas densidades de colmenas. Sin embargo, se sabe muy poco sobre la eficiencia de este manejo para poder alcanzar una polinizacion optima y existe controversia respecto las densidades recomendadas. Realizamos una sintesis global de la literatura cientifica para registrar la densidad de abejas meliferas (tasa de visitas o densidad de colmenas) y la productividad de los cultivos (cantidad de frutos o de semillas por flor, peso del fruto, o rendimiento por hectarea o planta). Los tamanos de efecto se calcularon como la diferencia en la productividad entre los dos niveles mas extremos de densidades de abejas. De los 795 estudios revisados, solo 22 analizaron el efecto de al menos dos niveles de densidad de abejas sobre la productividad de los cultivos (resultando en 60 tamanos de efecto en total). Ademas, pocos estudios se basan en los resultados de disenos experimentales controlados y con una metodologia comparable. Encontramos que tanto la tasa de visita como la densidad de colmenas aumentaron todas las variables de productividad. Sin embargo, el efecto de la tasa de visita fue curvilineo, lo que sugiere que hay un optimo (8-10 visitas por flor) mas alla del cual mas abejas no es beneficioso (o incluso perjudicial) para la productividad de los cultivos. Los tamanos de efecto para la tasa de visitas fueron mayores que para la densidad de colmenas, lo que sugiere que la tasa de visitas es una medida mas directa del proceso de polinizacion. Faltan datos sobre la relacion entre la tasa de visitas y la densidad de colmenas. De modo interesante, el tamano de efecto de la tasa de visitas fue mayor para cultivos con sexos separados que para aquellos con flores hermafroditas, lo que sugiere que los beneficios de la polinizacion por la abeja melifera dependen de la biologia floral. Sintesis y aplicaciones. El manejo actual para la polinizacion de los cultivos asume que mas abejas siempre aumenta la productividad de los cultivos. En cambio, nuestros analisis sugieren que existe un optimo para la tasa de visita de abejas y que esa variable podria usarse como un proxy para guiar las recomendaciones de manejo, como la densidad de colmenas y su disposicion espacial. Current practices for crop pollination assume that more honeybees are always better for crop yield, even if the effect of this management on crop production still unclear.

However, research has concentrated on the effects of land management on pollinator abundance and diversity, while studies directly measuring pollination services are still lacking for many crops and regions. This study examines the effects of landscape heterogeneity, pesticide use intensity and flowering time on insect pollination of turnip rape Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera, a major oil crop at high latitudes. The field experiment included monitoring pollinator visits on turnip rape flowers and measuring yield in 34 spring-sown turnip rape fields in Southern Finland. The fields were situated in two landscape types that differed in the cover of arable land and represented independent gradients of pesticide use intensity and flowering time. Based on flower visits and number of seeds per silique, turnip rape was best pollinated in fields with late flowering time. The result suggests a temporal mismatch between crop flowering and the availability of pollination service in early sown fields. The increase in flower visits during summer was steeper among fields with low than high pesticide use, possibly due to a faster colony growth of important bee pollinators. Pollinator community in turnip rape fields was more diverse in heterogeneous landscapes with less arable land than in homogeneous field-dominated landscapes, suggesting higher stability of pollination services in diverse landscapes. Total yield per plant was positively related to pesticide use intensity. The relationship between insect pollination and total yield was weakened by high compensation capacity of turnip rape, the plants producing more flowers under poor pollination.Synthesis and applications. Crop pollination can be enhanced by shifting sowing time to better match crop flowering to the peak availability of the most important pollinators. Reduced pesticide use may also enhance pollination services but can lead to the total yield reduction due to pests. This highlights the need for pollinator-friendly pest control methods to maintain turnip rape yields while conserving pollination services.

Tutkimukset maankayton vaikutuksista viljelykasvien hyonteispolytykseen kuitenkin puuttuvat yha monilta viljelykasveilta ja alueilta. Tama tutkimus tarkasteli maiseman monimuotoisuuden, torjunta-aineiden kayton ja kukinta-ajan vaikutusta rypsin hyonteispolytykseen. Peltokokeessa seurattiin polyttajien vierailuja rypsin kukilla ja mitattiin satoa 34 kevatrypsipellolla Uudellamaalla. Pellot sijaitsivat kahdessa maisematyypissa, joista toinen oli peltovaltainen ja toinen monimuotoisempi ja vahemman peltoa sisaltava. Lisaksi pellot erosivat toisistaan torjunta-aineiden kayton ja kukinta-ajan suhteen.

Viljelykasvin polytysta voi parantaa saatamalla kylvoaikaa siten, etta kasvin kukinta ajoittuu tarkeimpien polyttajien runsaushuippuun.

Polyttajaystavallisten kasvinsuojelukeinojen kehittaminen on tarkeaa korkeiden rypsisatojen ja polytyspalveluiden sailymisen kannalta. Crop pollination can be enhanced by shifting sowing time to better match crop flowering to the peak availability of the most important pollinators. Reduced pesticide use may also enhance pollination services but can lead to the total yield reduction due to pests. This highlights the need for pollinator-friendly pest control methods to maintain turnip rape yields while conserving pollination services.

One challenge is to attract and retain efficient natural enemies in crop fields, which often are a suboptimal environment. Towards this goal, the attract-and-reward strategy relies on combining attractive synthetically produced herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) with companion plants (non-crop plants which provide alternative resources to the targeted natural enemies). Although severely overlooked, the spatial arrangement of HIPV dispensers and rewards inside crop fields may strongly influence the foraging behaviour and persistence of natural enemies and thus the success of this pest management strategy. We tested the impact of two contrasting spatial arrangements of HIPV dispensers and rewards, alternatively inside and around a block of target apple trees, on the efficacy of the biological control of Aphis citricola populations by the common predatory ladybird Propylea japonica in apple orchards in northern China. We used synthetic methyl salicylate (MeSA) as an attractant and the companion plant Calendula officinalis as a reward. To better understand how the spatial arrangement of MeSA dispensers and companion plants affected the attraction and foraging behaviour of adult ladybirds, we conducted indoor experiments in a flight mill, an olfactometer and a wind-tunnel. Blocks of target trees treated with MeSA dispensers inside and companion plants around provided the most efficient pest control in orchards, compared with the opposite spatial arrangement. The synthetic MeSA dispenser and the companion plant synergistically attracted ladybirds in the olfactometer and enhanced their flight activity in the flight mill. In the wind-tunnel, MeSA served as a spatial cue for ladybirds to find nearby prey, while companion plants were sought in the absence of prey. Synthesis and applications. This study aims to further improve aphid control in apple orchards through a careful spatial arrangement of herbivore-induced plant volatiles dispensers (HIPVs) and rewards (companion plants) in optimized attract-and-reward strategies. Without such assessment, these strategies may be hazardous even with well-identified targeted natural enemies. Associated lab experiments highlight that interactions between HIPVs and companion plants influence ladybird foraging pattern, and that their spatial arrangement can modulate the ability of such key predators to find their prey.

While these species are primarily selected as flagships for marketing campaigns, it is important to evaluate their surrogacy potential, i.e. the extent to which their protection benefits other biodiversity elements. Four charismatic megafauna species are used as surrogates in the megadiverse island of Sumatra: the Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae, Sumatran elephant Elephas maximus sumatranus, Sumatran orangutan Pongo abelii and Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. We examined how well each of these species performed in representing the distribution of all co-occurring terrestrial mammal species on the island, and the priority areas for the conservation of three facets of mammalian biodiversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional). We used habitat suitability models to represent the distribution of 184 terrestrial mammal species, 160 phylogenetic groups and 74 functional trait groups. We then identified priority conservation areas using the spatial prioritisation software Zonation. We found that the habitat overlap between each of the four charismatic species and the other mammal species varied, ranging from a mean of 52% (SD=27%) for the tiger to 2% (SD=2%) for the rhino. Combining the four species together improved the representation levels only marginally compared to using the tiger only. Among the four charismatic megafauna species, the extent of suitable habitat of Sumatran tiger covered the highest proportion of priority conservation areas. The Sumatran tiger also outperformed most of other mammal species with similar range sizes. We found that some of the top-ranked conservation areas for taxonomic (28%), phylogenetic (8%) and functional diversity (19%) did not overlap with any of the charismatic species' suitable habitat.Synthesis and applications. Wide-ranging charismatic species can represent broader mammalian biodiversity, but they may miss some key areas with high biodiversity importance. We suggest that a combination of systematic spatial prioritisation and surrogacy analyses are important in order to determine the allocation of conservation resources in biodiversity-rich areas such as Sumatra, where an expansion of the protected area network is required. Foreign Language AbstractAbstrak Organisasi konservasi dan pemerintah seringkali menggunakan megafauna karismatik sebagai spesies pengganti untuk merepresentasikan biodiversitas yang lebih luas. Walaupun spesies pengganti biasanya memilik peran utama sebagai flagship untuk kampanye, penting juga untuk mengetahui apakah perlindungan spesies tersebut dapat memberikan keuntungan bagi aspek biodiversitas lainnya. Empat megafauna karismatik digunakan sebagai spesies pengganti di Pulau Sumatera, yaitu harimau sumatera Panthera tigris sumatrae, gajah sumatera Elephas maximus sumatranus, orangutan sumatera Pongo abelii dan badak sumatera Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. Kami mengevaluasi bagaimana keempat spesies tersebut merepresentasikan distribusi spesies mamalia terestrial lainnya di Sumatera dan area prioritas untuk konservasi tiga aspek keanekaragaman hayati (taksonomik, filogenetik, dan fungsional). Kami menggunakan pemodelan kesesuaian habitat untuk merepresentasikan distribusi 184 spesies mamalia terestrial, 160 kelompok filogenetik, dan 74 kelompok karakteristik fungsional. Kami kemudian mengidentifikasi area konservasi prioritas menggunakan perangkat lunak Zonation. Tumpang-tindih habitat di antara keempat spesies karismatik dan spesies mamalia lainnya bervariasi, berkisar dari rerata 52% (SD=27%) untuk harimau hingga 2% (SD=2%) untuk badak. Menggabungkan distribusi keempat spesies hanya sedikit meningkatkan tumpang-tindih habitat dibandingkan jika hanya menggunakan harimau. Di antara keempat spesies karismatik, habitat yang sesuai bagi harimau sumatera melingkupi area konservasi prioritas dengan proporsi tertinggi. Harimau sumatera juga mengungguli sebagian besar mamalia lain yang memiliki luas habitat yang serupa. Beberapa area konservasi prioritas untuk keanekaragaman taksonomik (28%), filogenetik (8%), dan fungsional (19%) tidak bertumpang-tindih dengan habitat spesies karismatik mana pun.Sintesis dan aplikasi. Spesies karismatik dengan distribusi yang luas dapat merepresentasikan keanekaragaman mamalia, tetapi dapat juga melewatkan beberapa area yang penting untuk konservasi biodiversitas. Kombinasi antara analisis spasial untuk menentukan prioritas konservasi dan analisis surogasi merupakan hal yang penting untuk menentukan alokasi sumber daya konservasi di area yang kaya akan biodiversitas, seperti Sumatera, di mana perluasan kawasan konservasi diperlukan.

Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an effective and non-invasive method, which can provide semi-quantitative information about fish communities in large lakes. This study further investigated the potential of fish-based eDNA metabarcoding as a tool for lake assessment by collecting and analysing water samples from eight Welsh lakes and six meres in Cheshire, England, with well-described fish faunas. Water samples (N=252) were assayed using two mitochondrial DNA regions (Cytb and 12S rRNA). eDNA sampling indicated the presence of very similar species in the lakes compared to those expected on the basis of existing and historical information. Firstly, 24 species were detected, with a total of 111 species occurrences in the lakes studied using eDNA. Secondly, there was a significant positive correlation between expected faunas and eDNA data in terms of confidence of species occurrence (Spearman's r=0.74, df=109, p<0.001). Thirdly, eDNA data can estimate relative abundance with the standard five-level classification scale (DAFOR'). Lastly, four ecological fish communities were characterized using eDNA data which agree with the predefined lake types according to environmental characteristics.Synthesis and applications. There are some limitations when using conventional captured-based methods for surveying species richness and relative abundance, such as morphological identification bias, difficulties in recording small-bodied, rare and/or elusive species and destructive impacts on the environment. This study provides further evidence that environmental DNA metabarcoding outperforms other captured-based survey techniques in a wide range of lake types for community-level analysis whether in species detection, relative abundance estimate using the standard five-level classification scale or characterization ecological fish communities. Therefore, the fish-based environmental DNA metabarcoding, a non-invasive genetic method, has great potential as an assessment tool for lake quality under the European Water Framework Directive.

Assessing the effect of predator control on an endangered goose population subjected to predator-mediated food web dynamics	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						carrion; culling; Lesser White-fronted goose; management evaluation; red fox; reindeer; rodents; tundra food web	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION; MESOCARNIVORE; REPRODUCTION; VARIABILITY; BIOLOGY; CYCLES; IMPACT; SHIFTS; SIZE	Assessing the effectiveness of conservation actions to halt population declines is challenging when confounded by other factors. We assessed whether culling of red fox, a predator currently increasing in number in the sub-Arctic, contributed to recent recovery of the critically endangered Fennoscandian population of Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, while controlling for potentially confounding food web dynamics. Using 19years of data, 10 before and 9 after the implementation of annual red fox culling, we estimated the effect of this action on annual performance of the goose population. We corrected for the potentially confounding effects of cyclic rodent dynamics and semi-domestic reindeer carrion abundance, both of which are expected to trigger predator functional and numerical responses, as well as for annual variation in spring phenology. Goose reproductive success fluctuated in synchrony with the rodent cycle and was negatively related to abundant carrion. When accounting for these aspects of food web dynamics, there was no evidence for an effect of red fox culling on reproductive success. There was, however, a tendency for fox culling to increase adult survival. Our analysis suggests that goose performance in their breeding area is influenced by fluctuating offspring predation, mediated by mainly natural (rodents) and partly anthropogenic (semi-domestic reindeer) dynamic components of the food web.Synthesis and applications. The effect of a decade-long red fox culling on goose reproductive success and survival is currently uncertain, despite predation driving reproductive success through changes in rodent and reindeer carrion abundance. New management actions may consist of regulation of reindeer herd sizes and/or removal of carcasses to reduce the subsidizing effect of reindeer carrion on mesopredators. Getting robust evidence regarding the impact of red fox culling on population recovery depends on continuing research to disentangle food web dynamics and efficiency of management actions.

Species richness of polypores can be increased by supplementing dead wood resource into a boreal forest landscape	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						boreal forest; dead wood; experiment; polypore species; resource; restoration; species-energy theory; wood-decaying fungi	ENERGY RELATIONSHIPS; PRODUCTIVITY; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; GRADIENTS; FUNGI; AREA	To prevent local species extinction and to counteract population declines, we must ensure species have access to resources they require for life. This can be done through ecological restoration where previously depleted resources are reintroduced. If the restoration is conducted as a one-off action in a large area, it resembles a natural resource pulse, which should lead to increased abundance of individuals, accompanied possibly by increased species richness. Species-energy relationship and underlying theory enable predictions about how different features of resource pulses affect species richness. We conducted a large-scale, controlled, randomized and replicated field experiment to study the effect of a resource addition on polypore species richness in a previously managed boreal forest landscape in Finland. We manipulated the amount and distribution of dead wood and studied the effects on polypore assemblages on added and natural dead wood during 9years after manipulation (2004-2012). By adding dead wood, species richness grew, mainly through increasing abundances: a large amount of dead wood resulted in higher abundance, higher number and faster accumulation of species than a small amount of dead wood. For a given abundance, dead wood addition contained fewer species than natural dead wood. This is most probably because added dead wood was of low diversity and provided habitat only for a limited number of species. Species richness on natural dead wood increased substantially during the study period, and this increase was not related to the resource manipulation. Thus, habitat improvement through natural succession can occur within a relatively short time period irrespective of human intervention. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate how the introduction of dead wood additions can strengthen polypore populations. The species taking advance of the introduced resource were primarily common species, instead of rare or red-listed species. Thus, we recommend ensuring the natural formation of dead wood while the populations of the common species supporting ecosystem functions can be increased by adding dead wood in the landscape.

Here, we develop and test a novel pollen-tracking technique using quantum dots as pollen-grain labels. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals that are so small, they behave like atoms. When exposed to UV light, they emit extremely bright light in both visible and infrared wavelengths. We tested the suitability of non-toxic CuInSexS2-x/ZnS (core/shell) quantum dots with oleic-acid ligands as pollen-grain labels. Using a micropipette, we dispensed quantum dots dissolved in hexane in minute volumes (0.15-0.5l) directly onto dehisced anthers of four different plant species from four different families (Wachendorfia paniculata [Haemodoraceae], Sparaxis villosa [Iridaceae], Arctotheca calendula [Asteraceae], Oxalis purpurea [Oxalidaceae]). After application, the hexane solvent evaporated immediately, leaving behind quantum dots that remained attached to pollen grains of the four different plant species even after agitation in a polar solvent. This suggests a lipophilic interaction between oleic-acid ligands on quantum dots, and pollenkitt surrounding pollen grains. We also showed that most pollen grains within anthers of the same four plant species were labelled with quantum dots after applying a volume of quantum-dot solution sufficient to cover an individual anther. To test whether quantum-dot pollen labels influenced pollen transport, we conducted pollen transfer trials (one donor, 10 sequential recipients) on S.villosa using captively reared honey bees to ensure bees were free of external pollen prior to experiments. We found no difference in pollen transport to recipients from donor flowers with labelled or unlabelled pollen grains. We demonstrate that quantum dots can be used as pollen labels allowing subsequent tracking of pollen fates. This method is relatively inexpensive (<$500 for equipment and ca. $0.02 per labelled anther thereafter) and can be simply and directly applied to anthers of most flowers in the lab and field. The ability to track pollen grain movement in situ, may help to address a historically neglected aspect of plant reproductive ecology and evolution.

SCR often relies on data collected over relatively long sampling periods. While longer sampling periods can yield larger sample sizes and thus increase the precision of estimates, they also increase the risk of violating the closure assumption, thereby potentially introducing bias. The sampling period characteristics are therefore likely to play an important role in this bias-precision trade-off. Yet few studies have studied this trade-off and none has done so for SCR models. In this study, we explored the influence of the length and timing of the sampling period on the bias-precision trade-off of SCR population size estimators. Using a continuous time-to-event approach, we simulated populations with a wide range of life histories and sampling periods before quantifying the bias and precision of population size estimates returned by SCR models. While longer sampling periods benefit the study of slow-living species (increased precision and lower bias), they lead to pronounced overestimation of population size for fast-living species. In addition, we show that both bias and uncertainty increase when the sampling period overlaps the reproductive season of the study species. Based on our findings, we encourage investigators to carefully consider the life history of their study species when contemplating the length and the timing of the sampling period. We argue that both spatial and non-spatial capture-recapture studies can safely extend the sampling period to increase precision, as long as it is timed to avoid peak recruitment periods. The simulation framework we propose here can be used to guide decisions regarding the sampling period for a specific situation.

A cost-effective approach to leaf elemental analysis is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), whereby components such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) can be predicted using NIR spectra from plant material. However, a major factor limiting the widespread use of NIRS by plant ecologists is the availability of free software and calibration data for developing plant chemistry datasets from spectra. Here, we present a pair of companion r packages (plantspec' and plantspecDB') that satisfy this need by providing an entire workflow, from spectra to predicted elemental data. The main r package, called plantspec', allows users to manipulate spectral data and develop custom partial least square (PLS) models for predicting the elemental composition of their own datasets. The second package, plantspecDB', provides NIR spectra, and matched elemental data obtained with standard analytical techniques, for herbaceous samples collected from 18 grassland sites around the world, primarily sourced from the Nutrient Network experiment. The plantspecDB' data package also provides calibrations for C, N, P and K for bulk samples and separated by plant functional type: grasses, forbs and legumes. Finally, we provide an example of the plantspec' workflow, and external validation of these models, and an example application to the stoichiometry of East African grasses as it relates to their evolutionary relationships. The r package plantspec', and our associated workflow, provides a template to produce robust calibration models and increase the application of NIR in ecology. Although, we focus on plant stoichiometry, the workflow presented here can be applied broadly for a broad range of applications, including soils, remote sensing data, solutions and tissues. Finally, our global dataset provides unprecedented access to NIR calibration data as they pertain to tissue concentrations of key plant limiting elements.

Applications include identifying ancient mass extinctions and inferring both biotic and abiotic controls on diversification rates. We introduce divDyn, a new r package that facilitates the calculation of taxonomic richness, extinction and origination rates from time-binned fossil data. State-of-the-art counting protocols, and sampling standardization functions permit the reconstruction of biologically meaningful time series. Additional functions permit the partitioning of turnover rates by environmental affinity. Using divDyn, we display Phanerozoic-scale diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates. With the help of the core function and standard subsampling options, we revisit the hypothesis of declining taxonomic rates over time, mass extinctions and equilibrial diversity dynamics and assess their methodological dependency. Our results suggest that rates declined only over the early Phanerozoic, only three mass extinctions stand out clearly, and evidence of equilibrial dynamics is dependent on the used methods. The modular and fast implementation of published methods ensures traceability, reproducibility and comparability of future studies.

However, issues with data quality, especially incorrect geo-referencing or dating, can diminish their usefulness. Manual cleaning is time-consuming, error prone, difficult to reproduce and limited to known geographical areas and taxonomic groups, making it impractical for datasets with thousands or millions of records. Here, we present CoordinateCleaner, an r-package to scan datasets of species occurrence records for geo-referencing and dating imprecisions and data entry errors in a standardized and reproducible way. CoordinateCleaner is tailored to problems common in biological and palaeontological databases and can handle datasets with millions of records. The software includes (a) functions to flag potentially problematic coordinate records based on geographical gazetteers, (b) a global database of 9,691 geo-referenced biodiversity institutions to identify records that are likely from horticulture or captivity, (c) novel algorithms to identify datasets with rasterized data, conversion errors and strong decimal rounding and (d) spatio-temporal tests for fossils. We describe the individual functions available in CoordinateCleaner and demonstrate them on more than 90million occurrences of flowering plants from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and 19,000 fossil occurrences from the Palaeobiology Database (PBDB). We find that in GBIF more than 3.4 million records (3.7%) are potentially problematic and that 179 of the tested contributing datasets (18.5%) might be biased by rasterized coordinates. In PBDB, 1205 records (6.3%) are potentially problematic. All cleaning functions and the biodiversity institution database are open-source and available within the CoordinateCleaner r-package.

We know little of how sessile organisms respond to physical disturbances such as displacements. Using Mytilaster minimus, a mussel that is native to the Mediterranean Sea, we tested how byssus production and oxygen uptake rates changed in response to different frequencies of disturbance events (10-60 events h(-1)). Mussels increased oxygen uptake rates but not byssus production with increasing disturbance frequencies (50-60 events h(-1)). Our results show that sub-lethal, physical disturbances can cause increased physiological rates in mussels if disturbances repeat rapidly. Therefore, sub-lethal, physical disturbances can have negative consequences for benthic organisms even if they do not cause immediate damage or mortality.

The aim of this study was to screen selected red algae, a highly diverse phylogenetic group, for the production of photo-protective molecules. The pigment content and composition (Le. chlorophyll-a, phycobiliproteins and carotenoids) and the composition of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) were studied in 40 species of red macroalgae collected in Brittany (France), at two distinct periods (i.e. February and July 2017). A high inter-specific variability was demonstrated in terms of pigment content and MAA composition. Twenty-three potential MAAs were detected by HPLC, and six were identified by LC-MS (i.e. shinorine, palythine, asterina-330, porphyra-334, usurijene and palythene). This is the first study to report on the composition of pigments and MAAs in a diverse group of red seaweeds from Brittany, including some species for which the MAA composition has never been studied before. Nevertheless, the results suggested that some species of red algae are more likely to cope with high levels of light radiation since those species such as Bostrychia scorpioides, Porphyra dioica, Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Vertebrata lanosa are living in environments exposed to higher levels of irradiation, and had various MAAs in addition to their photo-protective pigments.

Reduced exploitation is associated with an altered sex ratio and larger length at maturity in southwest Pacific (east Australian) Pomatomus saltatrix	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Reproductive biology; Bluefish; Fecundity; Multiple spawning periods; Tailor; Historical changes; Fishing effects	LIFE-HISTORY PATTERNS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; COHORT DYNAMICS; FISH; BLUEFISH; GROWTH; COAST; TAILOR; AGE	Pomatomus saltatrix is an important recreational fishing species with seven major populations worldwide. The reproductive biology of the southwest Pacific Ocean (east Australian) population is uncertain, with both an extended spawning and multiple spawning periods previously hypothesised. Here we demonstrate an altered sex ratio biased towards females and a larger length at 50% maturity (L-50) compared to those recorded for the population 40 years ago, before comprehensive management strategies were implemented. We also report a second, previously undescribed, late-summer spawning event which was identified by analysing patterns in a gonadosomatic index across the whole population and an historical larval fish database. P. saltatrix are capable of spawning multiple times per season with estimates of batch fecundity ranging from 99,488 to 1,424,425 eggs per fish. When combined with the length frequency distribution of the population, the majority of eggs (64%) were shown to be produced by fish <= 40 cm fork length (FL). L-50 was estimated at 30.2 and 31.5 cm FL for male and female P. saltatrix respectively, 4 cm larger than 40 years ago. The sex ratio of the population was found to have significantly shifted over the last 40 years from an equal sex ratio to a female dominated population (1.58 females:1 male). These dramatic alterations to the sex ratio and L-50 highlights the value of monitoring the reproductive biology of exploited fish populations to ensure that management plans remain appropriate.

To quantify lethal and sublethal toxicity in a key Holarctic forage fish, capelin embryos were exposed to Hibernia crude oil water accommodated fraction (WAF) produced at an oil-to-water ratio of 1:9 (v:v) and chemically-enhanced WAF (CEWAF) produced with the dispersant Corexit (TM) EC9500A at a dispersant-to-oil ratio of 1:10 (CEWAF H) or 1:50 (CEWAF L). Corexit alone yielded similar embryotoxicity to CEWAF. 10% CEWAF H, with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of 99.2 mu g/L, decreased embryo survival following 10 h of exposure, while continual exposed to 1% CEWAF L decreased hatching and heart rates. Concentrations down to 0.1% CEWAF L increased in a dose-dependent manner the transcript level of cytochrome P4501a1 (cyp1a1) in hatched larvae. These data indicate that embryo-larval survival of capelin is likely at risk if an oil spill coincides in space and time with spawning.

Filling this knowledge gap is crucial as the depth limits of corals are related to important environmental factors such as light and temperature. Furthermore, the health and survivorship of corals may be threatened due to warming-induced sea-level rise, particularly for colonies living at the deeper limits of species depth ranges. Here we collected benthic and environmental data along the reef profile to characterise the depth ranges of coral species, and analysed species diversity and community structure in relation to possible depth-related biophysical parameters on the sediment-stressed reefs of Singapore. The results reveal clear environmental covariations with depth, expectedly with light availability showing the most marked decline as depth increases. Live coral cover, species richness and diversity are associated positively and significantly with light, which also structures coral communities along the reef profile more strongly than temperature or sediment levels. Relatedly, we detect species-specific depth distributions with two main strategies observed among coral species: shallow specialists and depth generalists. We suggest that corals in Singapore are unlikely to be impacted by light limitation specifically as sea level rises due to the wider depth range of the deeper species. Our data will inform conservation efforts especially in the selection of sites and depths for coral transplantation.	[Chow, Gwendolyn S. E.; Chana, Y. K.

Assessing the impact of introduced infrastructure at sea with cameras: A case study for spatial scale, time and statistical power	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Marine monitoring; Human impact; Renewable energy; Power analysis; BRUV	REMOTE UNDERWATER VIDEO; OFFSHORE WIND FARM; RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; REEF FISH ASSEMBLAGES; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; MARINE BIODIVERSITY; INFORMATION-POOR; SAMPLING DESIGN; BAITED VIDEO; DATA-RICH	Detecting the effects of introduced artificial structures on the marine environment relies upon research and monitoring programs that can provide baseline data and the necessary statistical power to detect biological and/or ecological change over relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we report on, and assess the use of, Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) systems as a technique to monitor diversity, abundance and assemblage composition data to evaluate the effects of marine renewable energy infrastructure on mobile epi-benthic species. The results from our five-year study at a wave energy development facility demonstrate how annual natural variation (time) and survey design (spatial scale and power) are important factors in the ability to robustly detect change in common ecological metrics of benthic and bentho-pelagic ecosystems of the northeast Atlantic. BRUV systems demonstrate their capacity for use in temperate, high energy marine environments, but also how weather, logistical and technical issues require increased sampling effort to ensure statistical power to detect relevant change is achieved. These factors require consideration within environmental impact assessments if such survey methods are to identify and contribute towards the management of potential positive or negative effects on benthic systems.

We investigated whether coral assemblages on inshore and more turbid reefs differ from those on offshore reefs in the largest coral reefs of the Southwest Atlantic. We compared inshore and offshore reefs (with different turbidity climatologies) in terms of benthic and coral assemblage structures, abundances and individual sizes of coral populations and recruitment patterns. Unexpectedly, the inshore reefs showed higher coral cover and abundance, larger colonies and more recruits. This finding is related to the predominance of sediment-tolerant species on the turbid reefs. In contrast, only Mussismilia braziliensis (main builder of Abrolhos) showed better performance (greater coverage, larger diameter and more recruits) on offshore reefs, apparently behaving as a strong competitor in less turbid environments. These results reinforce the recent thinking of coral reef of turbid environments as resistant ecosystems and potential refuges considering the unnatural increase of sediment supply.

Morphological variation of a rapidly spreading native macroalga across a range of spatial scales and its tolerance to sedimentation	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Caulerpa filiformis; Native invader; Plasticity; Sedimentation; Depth; Light; Latitude; Disturbance	RACEMOSA VAR. CYLINDRACEA; WAVE EXPOSURE; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; CAULERPA-TAXIFOLIA; ECKLONIA-RADIATA; GROWTH FORM; CORAL-REEFS; C. AGARDH; TEMPERATURE; COAST	Understanding how species' traits can shape winners and losers of environmental change can help resolve drivers of current community composition patterns and predict future drivers. Sedimentation is one of the main environmental stressors shaping coastal marine communities and tolerance of high sedimentation rates (e.g. via morphological variation) may allow for competitive dominance. In New South Wales, Australia, the abundance and range of the native green macroalga Caulerpa filiformis have increased over recent decades, apparently associated with sediment disturbance. We used field measurements to test hypotheses about morphological variability in C. filiformis in relation to local- and large-scale environmental variation in water depth, sediment cover and latitude. Using a lab experiment, we tested hypotheses about survival and morphological change under different sedimentation regimes. In the field, C. filiformis fronds were more elongated and less branched when a sediment veneer is present and when water depth increased (i.e. reduced light). At larger spatial scales, frond length and width decreased with increased latitude, but latitude was less important in explaining the variation C. filiformis' length than were depth or sedimentation. Our lab experiment showed a high tolerance to sedimentation, aided by increased investment in vertical growth. This study shows that rapid morphological plasticity is a likely key attribute of the spreading native macroalga C. filiformis. We argue that having a broad environmental tolerance is key to define a species success under environmental change.

Here we evaluated the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations (i.e. similar to 900 mu atm) on the shelter use and group cohesion of the gregarious damselfish Chromis viridis using groups of sub-adults exposed to a predatory threat. Results showed that, under predatory threat, fish reared at elevated CO2 concentrations displayed a risky behaviour (i.e. decreased shelter use), whereas their group cohesion was unaffected. Our findings add on increasing evidence to account for social dynamics in OA experiments, as living in groups may compensate for CO2-induced risky behaviour.

Site moisture is an important component of the forest landscape for maintaining biodiversity, including forest-floor bryophytes. However, little is known about its role in shaping understorey responses to harvesting. 2. We investigated the influence of site wetness, determined using a remotely sensed, topographic depth-to-water (DTW) index, on responses of bryophyte cover, richness, diversity and composition to variable retention harvesting (comparing: 2% [clear-cut], 20% and 50% dispersed green tree retention and uncut controls [100% retention]) in three boreal forest cover-types (broadleaf, mixed and conifer forests) in western Canada. The DTW index provides an approximation of DTW at or below the soil surface and was derived from wet-areas mapping based on discrete Airborne Laser Scanning data acquired over an experimentally harvested landscape located in north-western Alberta, Canada. 3. The effectiveness of leaving retention (vs. clear-cutting) for conserving bryophyte communities depended on site wetness, as indicated by DTW, with the specifics varying among forest types. In broadleaf forests, bryophyte cover and richness were generally low and not much affected by harvesting but drier sites had higher richness and a few more unique species. In mixed and conifer forests, leaving retention (vs. clear-cutting) on wetter (vs. drier) sites was more effective for conserving bryophyte cover, wetter sites had higher total species richness and more species were exclusive to wetter sites. 4. Synthesis and applications. Site wetness, as indicated using the remotely sensed topographic site wetness index "depth-to-water" mediates bryophyte responses to variable-retention harvests. Specifically, our results suggested that in conifer and mixed forests it would be more beneficial to target wetter sites for retention patches or dispersed retention whereas in broadleaf forests there might be a slight advantage to targeting drier sites. Our study demonstrates that this tool could be used to inform management decisions around leaving dispersed or patch retention.	[Bartels, Samuel F.; James, Ryan S.; Caners, Richard T.; Macdonald, S.

Such signatures can also be affected by local geography and tolerance to environmental conditions. However, disentangling the different drivers of population structure is often difficult. In an attempt to do so, we surveyed two independent gene pools of the same species that followed similar paths of post-glacial colonization across contrasting landscapes and environmental conditions. We aimed to determine how these differences have affected the post-glacial population dynamics of each gene pool. Location: The Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Mexico. Taxon: Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans; Avicenniaceae). Methods: Using microsatellite variation, we estimated the divergence time of black mangrove populations through approximated Bayesian computation and implemented a comparative approach to evaluate different demographic hypotheses within and between coasts. Results: The Pacific and Atlantic gene pools diverged long after the rise of the Central American Isthmus (Mid-Pleistocene), although occasional transisthmian gene exchanges were also inferred. Both coasts showed the characteristic isolation by distance (IBD) pattern expected for expanding gene pools. However, populations from the Atlantic coast were more genetically diverse and admixed than those from the Pacific basin. Both our migration models and the climate data gathered suggested a more ancient establishment and/or more stable conditions for black mangrove on the Atlantic coast. Main conclusions: The Atlantic basin likely bore more favourable climate conditions than the Pacific, allowing for the survival of A. germinans during the Last Glacial Maximum in situ. Populations from the northern Pacific coast became established after the Holocene warming, leading to contrasting genetic patterns between the two gene pools. Nevertheless, the action of environmental factors in determining the contemporary distribution of genetic variation in A. germinans cannot be discarded.

Whether ice-age glaciers wiped out all terrestrial plant life or whether some populations persisted in situ remains unclear. We reconstructed the phylogeography of two dominant Patagonian cushion peat bog species, Astelia pumila (G. Forst.) Gaudich. (Asteliaceae) and Donatia fascicularis J. R. Forst. & G. Forst. (Stylidiaceae), to test (a) the hypothesis of a glacial refugium for moorland plants in south-central Chile and (b) the tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. The retrieved phylogeographic patterns were compared with those reported previously for a further cushion peat bog species (Pfanzelt et al., Molecular Ecology 26, 4027-4044), with the objective to provide a broader picture of how West Patagonian moorland plants responded to the Quaternary ice-ages. Location: West and Fuegian Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), southern South America. Methods: DNA sequence data from seven and fourteen, respectively, nuclear loci containing Simple Sequence Repeats of 371 and 328 individuals of the two study species were analysed using population genetic summary statistics, phylogenetic networks and Bayesian and multivariate methods to determine genetic structure. Ecological niche modelling was used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of suitable habitat at the Last Glacial Maximum. Results: All A. pumila populations belong to a single population genetic cluster. In the case of D. fascicularis, only the northernmost sampled population from Nahuelbuta (Chile) is genetically distinct, whereas the remainder forms a cluster without much further substructure. According to palaeodistribution models, south-central Chile offered suitable habitat during the last glacial. Main conclusion: Both ecological niche modelling and the very low genetic subdifferentiation are congruent with a tabula rasa scenario for the Patagonian Channels. Populations survived the last glacial in south-central Chile, in an area to the northwest of the ice sheet. From there, southern regions were recolonized through highly bottlenecked source populations. Other, non-mutually exclusive factors may have further shaped the population genetic patterns, among them high gene flow mediated by the strong westerly winds.

Methods: Light-trapping using a semi-nested design at 84 fixed sites which were each repeatedly sampled six times. Results: Autocovariate models show that sampling sites with a higher number of forest and meadow macro-moth species (alpha diversity) were surrounded by a higher amount of forest and meadow habitat, respectively within a 160 and 320 m radius (scale of effect). These top-ranked models, containing only habitat amount as a significant variable, had lower Akaike's information criteria (AIC) than models (only) containing patch size and/or isolation. Complementary to this, the countryside species-area relationship (SAR) model outperforms the classic SAR model, so that the effective area of habitat explains landscape species richness (gamma diversity) across spatial scales (beta diversity) better than the classic SAR. Specifically, we show that forest macro-moths have a higher spatial turnover than meadow macro-moths and that, on average, there are more species in forest than in meadow habitat. Main conclusions: The habitat amount hypothesis predicts alpha species richness in multi-habitat landscapes better than do patch size and isolation while the countryside SAR predicts beta and gamma diversity better than the classic SAR. We suggest that evidence is mounting to revise the application of the classical approaches of island biogeography and metapopulation theory to conservation biogeography.

Location: Red Sea, Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Taxon: Xeniidae, a family of reef-dwelling octocorals (Anthozoa, Octocorallia). Methods: Xeniids collected at 13 locations were sequenced at three barcode loci, and assigned to MOTUs defined by minimum genetic distance thresholds. Taxon richness (number of MOTUs) and endemicity (per cent of MOTUs found at a single location) were quantified. Patterns of beta-diversity (species turnover) and phylogenetic beta-diversity (lineage turnover) among geographical regions were visualized using hierarchical clustering, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots and distance-decay relationships. Community assembly was investigated by comparing the mean pairwise distance (MPD) and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) separating species in each assemblage to values generated for null communities. Results: A genetic distance threshold of 0.3% discriminated 67 MOTUs, with taxon richness ranging from 2-18 MOTUs per site. Out of the 67 MOTUs, 48 (72%) were found at only a single location, and only two spanned both the western Indian and Pacific Oceans. Species turnover among sites was high, but phylogenetic beta-diversity was lower than beta-diversity and differed significantly from null models of community assembly at only two sites. beta-diversity and phylogenetic beta-diversity both increased significantly with geographic distance, and sites clustered into three distinct biogeographic regions (Red Sea and western Indian Ocean; Western Australia; western Pacific Ocean and Great Barrier Reef, Australia). All five major clades of xeniids were represented in each region. Main conclusions: A genetic approach to biodiversity estimation suggests that most xeniid taxa are regional endemics whose geographic distribution is likely governed by dispersal limitation. This conclusion contrasts with published records of certain morphospecies occurrences, which imply that they have broad geographic ranges. So far, the distribution of xeniid biodiversity mirrors that of scleractinian corals, with species richness highest in the Coral Triangle, but endemicity peaking in peripheral areas.

JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						ecological gradient analysis; Ellenberg indicator values; forest understorey vegetation; global climate change; herbaceous layer; macroclimate gradient; soil pH; species niche width; top soil carbon and nitrogen	PLANT-COMMUNITIES; GLOBAL CHANGE; FOREST; SHIFTS; UNDERSTOREY; NITROGEN; BOREAL; BIOINDICATION; DEPOSITION; VEGETATION	Aim: Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) are frequently used in regions outside their Central European origin as proxies for environmental conditions, a practice further boosted by the increasing scientific focus on global change. The performance of EIV outside their geographic origin and over long gradients has, however, rarely been tested. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the indicative power of EIV changes over a large geographic gradient and to analyse the potential causes of such changes. Location: Sweden. Taxon: Vascular plants. Methods: We used data on forest understorey vegetation and soils from >15,000 plots from the Swedish National Forest Inventory to model how the relationship between community mean EIV and measured environmental variables changes along an extensive latitudinal gradient (>15 degrees). We used Generalized Additive Mixed Models to account for the inventory design, and for potential nonlinearities in the relationship between the mean EIV and the environmental variables. Additionally, Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models were developed for the relationship between the incidence probability and the environmental variables to analyse if the widths of species niches change along the geographic gradient. Results: Our study shows that EIV for N (nutrients), R (pH) and T (temperature) are useful as far north as the Arctic Circle, while those for K (continentality) showed a much weaker relationship with measured continentality. However, the indicative power of the EIV for N and R gradually became weaker towards the north along with shifts towards larger environmental niche widths of the indicator species. Main conclusions: EIV are useful indicators of soil conditions in boreal forests located far north of Central Europe. However, the drop in indicative power in the northernmost regions due to increasing environmental niche widths needs to be taken into account when applying EIV along long geographic gradients to avoid spatial bias.

The dominance of beech in these forests developed during the ongoing post-glacial northward re-colonization, concurrently with intensified forest use by humans. We investigated how these two processes together with climate shaped the patterns of functional diversity of two major species groups involved in wood decomposition and whether functional diversity is determined on the local or regional species pool level. Location: European beech forest distribution range. Taxon: Saproxylic beetles and fungi. Methods: We analysed records of 532,496 saproxylic beetles of 788 species and 8,630 records of 234 saproxylic fungal species based on sets of traits similar to both groups. We tested how space, climate and landscape composition affect trait-based functional diversity on local and regional scales. Using structural equation modelling, we tested whether functional diversity is shaped on the local or regional scale. Results: The response of local functional diversity of both saproxylic beetles and fungi followed a highly congruent pattern of decreasing functional diversity towards the north, with higher elevation and accounted for overall geographical gradients with higher temperature, while increasing with higher precipitation. Structural equation modelling revealed that local functional diversity is determined by community changes operating on the level of the regional species pool. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that the functional diversity patterns of saproxylic organisms in European beech forests are mainly determined on the regional scale and driven by anthropogenic and biogeographical processes. To conserve the variation and hotspots of functional diversity in beech forests, activities have to focus on a broad spatial and climatic range of sites throughout Europe, including the primeval forests in the east, as started by the UNESCO World Heritage selection of "Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe".

However, disentangling the relative roles of these processes on spatial patterns of differentiation-whether regarding taxonomic differentiation (TD) between communities or genetic differentiation (GD) between populations-is challenging. Investigating whether spatial patterns of TD and GD are correlated (beta-SGDCs) is a promising approach to address this issue. Here, we investigated beta-SGDCs over broad spatial scales and 22 freshwater fish species to elucidate the processes shaping TD and GD between drainage basins. Location: Global scope, data mainly from Europe and North America. Taxon: Actinopterygii and Petromyzontiformes (freshwater fishes). Methods: We used Mantel tests to investigate the raw correlation between TD and GD. We carried out multiple regressions to characterize the effects of geographic distance (proxy of dispersal limitation), environmental distance (proxy of environmental selection) and pairwise harmonic mean area between basins (proxy of drift) on TD and GD taken separately. We then analyzed the correlation between the residuals of these two regressions with Mantel tests. Finally, we investigated whether the variation in beta-SGDC between species was related to species traits. Results: We detected an overall positive beta-SGDC, both for the raw and the residual correlations. This implies that, unmeasured effects, other than geographic distance, environmental distance and harmonic mean area, influence the beta-SGDC observed. Values of beta-SGDCs greatly varied between species, but this was not explained by any species traits. Main conclusions: Independently of the effects of geographic distance, environmental distance and harmonic mean area, the beta-SGDC we observed suggests that historical processes strongly shaped the patterns of TD and GD between basins. Consequently, TD may be an appropriate proxy to explain the influence of historical processes on GD.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the role exposure to line particulate matter (PM2.5) during clilferent prenatal and postnatal windows may play in children's cognitive development at school age. METHODS: Within the Brain Development and Air Pollution Ultrafine Particles in School Children (BREATHE) Project, we estimated residential PM2.5 exposures by land use regression for the prenatal period and first seven postnatal years of 2,221 children from Barcelona, Spain. The participants (8.5 +/- 0.9 y old) completed computerized tests assessing working memory, attentiveness, and conflict network during four visits in 2012-2013. We used linear mixed effects and distributed lag models to assess the period of exposure to PM2.5 in association with cognitive development. RESULTS: Inverse associations were identified between PM2.5 exposure during the fifth and sixth postnatal years and working memory, with boys showing much higher vulnerability. Regarding attention functions, exposure to higher PM2.5 levels during the prenatal period and from the fourth postnatal year were associated with a reduction in conflict network performance, though we found no association with attentiveness. The overall estimated cumulative effect of a 10 mu g 111-3 increase in PM2.5 resulted in a reduction in the working memory d score of 19.50 [95% confidence interval (CI): 31.44, 7.57] points and an increase in the conflict attentional network of 11.31 (95% CI: 6.05, 16.57) milliseconds, indicating a poorer performance. CONCLUSIONS: Early life exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a reduction in fundamental cognitive abilities, including working memory and conflict attentional network.

Impatiens noli-tangere was found along steep streams as well as gentle streams, whereas I. textori and P. thunbergii were less frequent along steep streams than along gentle streams. Impatiens noli-tangere was the least tolerant or resistant to environmental disturbances such as submergence, rapid water current, herbivory and possibly shading. P. thunbergii was the most tolerant or resistant, and I. textori showed an intermediate response. On the other hand, I. noli-tangere started reproduction earliest, followed by I. textori and P. thunbergii. Earlier start of reproduction of I. noli-tangere is assumed to serve as a means to reduce risks to encounter catastrophic events before reproduction. In addition, I. noli-tangere was the tallest per stem dry-weight unit. Growing taller would be an adaptation to reduce risk of shading. It is assumed that earlier reproduction enables I. noli-tangere to leave offspring along steep streams where water current after heavy rain is more rapid and catastrophic.

The jaguar and its main arboreal prey - the brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) and the red howler monkey (Alouatta juara) - are widespread in the Amazonian floodplain forests of the Mamiraua Reserve. These forest-dwelling species are the most common mammal species both in the continuous forest and the forest patches surrounded by a river matrix - the fluvial islands - of the Solimoes and Japura rivers. We used sign surveys along line-transects to assess the pattern of habitat occupancy by jaguars in Amazonian floodplain forests. Specifically, we (i) tested whether habitat occupancy by jaguars differs between river islands and continuous forest; and (ii) evaluated whether and how the local abundance of sloths and howler monkeys influence the probability of site occupancy by jaguars. We built an occupancy model and used Bayesian inference to reach these goals. The proportion of sites estimated to be used by jaguars was psi = 0.75 (HPD95: 0.36-1.00), and it did not differ between islands and continuous forest. The abundance of both prey species had a direct influence on jaguar's habitat use, whereas the aquatic matrix seems to have a negligible effect on the use of islands by jaguars. We conclude that the isolation of the river islands within the aquatic matrix does not hamper jaguars to use them. We also conclude that prey search modulates jaguars' habitat occupancy patterns with both prey species having a similar effect. This finding is compatible with the previously reported importance of sloths to the diet of jaguars in the study region despite its lower abundance than howlers. Finally, we suggest that sign surveys are an alternative method to assess the pattern of jaguar habitat occupancy in floodplain forests.

We used generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM) to analyse the relative importance of flooding as a driver of snake community composition in the Paraguay River Basin (PRB), which encompasses discontinuous seasonal flooded areas, including the Pantanal floodplain, one of the largest Neotropical wetland systems. We modelled the beta diversity of pairs of PRB snake communities (based on species occurrence and phylogenetic relationships) as a function of biogeographical and environmental dissimilarities between areas, considering predictors that represent distinct limitations of species' ability to use an area. Annual flooding directly drives snake diversity, mainly when ancient evolutionary relationships between species were considered to calculate the phylogenetic diversity of the communities. Floods recurrently produce major changes in the environment and probably limit the persistency of species extremely specialized in habitat use. Despite the confirmation of the effect of flooding, the most important predictor of beta diversity between snake communities in the PRB was forest cover where communities were placed. Forest cover seems to constrain the occurrence of some species in both gradient extremities through the absence of suitable conditions for either specialized habitat use or thermoregulatory behaviours. Geographical distance was also an important predictor of beta diversity, highlighting the importance of neutral process in the assembly of local communities in systems such as seasonally flooded areas, where annual disturbances of varying intensities continually disassemble and reassemble biological communities. For the first time, we quantified the relative importance of flooding affecting patterns of biological communities in the Pantanal floodplain, compared to multiple factors also acting on species turnover in the area.

I explored the spatial patterns of tropical and temperate plant diversity in Northwest Yunnan and their primary determinants. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and variance partitioning were used to investigate the influences of predictors. Temperate genus diversity significantly increased with latitude, whereas tropical genus diversity did not show any obvious latitudinal trends. Proportions of tropical genera decreased with latitude, whereas those of temperate genera were on the contrary. Environment heterogeneity explained higher percentage of the spatial variation of temperate genus diversity than for that of tropical genus diversity. It may imply that the influence of environment heterogeneity on plant diversity may depend on the taxa's biogeographic affinities, which might modify the exploitation of environment heterogeneity, though the flora diversification induced by the uplifting of the Tibet Plateau may also play important roles. Climate predictors explained higher percentages of variation in the proportions of tropical genera than for the variations in tropical genus diversity. It may suggest that compared with the associations between genus diversity with tropical affinities and climatic conditions, the associations between the proportions of tropical plants and climatic conditions might more accurately reflect niche conservatism of tropical plants in the study area.

We investigated these structural and functional properties of food webs in stream ecosystems distributed across woodland, agricultural and urban areas in the Zagreb region of Croatia. We compared resource availability and consumer diet composition using stable isotope mixing models and tested how the isotopic variance of basal resources, primary consumers, macroinvertebrate predators and other food web characteristics change with different land-use types. Combination of increased loading and altered composition of nutrients, lower water discharge and higher light availability at urban sites likely promoted the contribution of aquatic macrophytes to diets of primary consumers. Macroinvertebrate predators shifted their diet, relying more on active filterers at urban sites relative to woodland and agricultural sites. Urban food webs also had lower trophic redundancy (i.e. fewer species at each trophic level) and a more homogenized energy flow from lower to higher trophic levels. There was no effect of land use on isotopic variation of basal resources, primary consumers or macroinvertebrate predators, but all these trophic groups at urban and agricultural sites were N-15-enriched relative to their counterparts in woodland stream food webs. The physical and chemical ecosystem characteristics associated with intensive land use altered the resource availability, trophic redundancy and the flow of energy to other trophic levels, with potentially negative consequences for community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. These empirical findings indicate that reducing nutrient pollution, agricultural runoffs and maintaining riparian vegetation can mitigate the impacts of land use on structure and function of stream ecosystems.

We chose our study species and populations to provide a strong test of recent theoretical predictions that optimal foraging by an apex fish predator in a typical aquatic environment would be consistent with feeding to satiation rather than continuous feeding. We chose four populations where the primary prey type differed along a body size gradient (from small invertebrates to large planktivorous fish) and along a thermal accessibility gradient (from easily accessible cold-water pelagic prey to less accessible warm-water epilimnetic and littoral prey). We expected that these gradients in prey type would evoke distinctly different activity gradients depending on whether predators fed to satiation (e.g., less frequent rest detections where primary prey are smaller/less accessible) or fed continuously (e.g., fixed level of rest detections under all prey conditions). Our study organism was a fall spawning, cold-water visual apex predator (lake trout). Therefore, we focused our study on diel (early night, dawn, day, dusk, late night) changes in metabolic costs associated with summer feeding behaviour. The duration (similar to 20days) and fine temporal scale (similar to 30min) of our behavioural data provided a uniquely detailed picture of intra- and inter-population differences in activity patterns over a critical period in the annual growing season. In all populations, diel shifts in activity were qualitatively consistent with that expected of a visual predator (e.g., resting state detections were most frequent at night). Between-lake differences in daytime thermal experience were qualitatively consistent with between-lake differences in the location of primary prey (e.g., excursions to warm habitats were common in lakes with epilimnetic/littoral fish as primary prey and relatively rare in lakes with pelagic cold-water invertebrates/fish as primary prey). Daytime activity patterns were more consistent with the feeding pattern expected from feeding to satiation rather than continuous feeding: (a) individuals in all four populations exhibited clearly delineated bouts of resting behaviour and active behaviour; (b) the frequency of resting bouts and the resultant overall cost of daily activity were strongly associated with the size and accessibility of preyin lakes with smaller and/or less accessible prey, predators rested less frequently, exhibited marginally higher costs when active and had higher overall daytime activity costs. Within each lake, similar changes in activity occurred concurrently with diel changes in prey accessibility/relative density.	[Cruz-Font, Liset; Shuter, Brian J.; Minns, C.

Life-history variation along environmental and harvest clines of a northern freshwater fish: Plasticity and adaptation	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian; biphasic growth; clinal variation; harvest-induced evolution; life-history trade-offs; plasticity; Salvelinus namaycush	TROUT SALVELINUS-NAMAYCUSH; LAKE TROUT; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; SOMATIC GROWTH; EVOLUTION; SIZE; POPULATIONS; FISHERIES; TRAITS	Plasticity, local adaptation and evolutionary trade-offs drive clinal variation in traits associated with lifetime growth. Disentangling the processes and determinants that cause these traits to vary helps to understand species' responses to changing environments. This is particularly urgent for exploited populations, where size-selective harvest can induce life-history evolution. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are an exploited fish with a life history adapted to low-productivity freshwaters of northern North America, which makes them highly vulnerable to ecosystem changes and overfishing. We characterized life-history variation across a broad and diverse landscape for this iconic northern freshwater fish and evaluated whether clinal variation was consistent with hypotheses for local adaptation or growth plasticity. We estimated growth-associated traits for 90 populations exposed to a diversity of environments using a Bayesian multivariate hierarchical model. We tested for clinal variation in their somatic growth, size at maturity and reproductive allocation along environmental gradients of lake productivity, climate, prey and exploitation clines under competing hypotheses of plasticity and local adaptation. Clinal life-history variation was consistent with growth plasticity and local adaptations but not harvest-induced evolution. Variation in somatic growth was explained by exploitation, climate and prey fish occurrence. Increased exploitation, from pristine to fully exploited conditions, led to increased somatic growth (from 32 to 45mm/year) and adult life spans, and reduced age at maturity (from 11 to 8years). Variation in size at maturity was explained by climate and, less certainly, prey fish occurrence, while reproductive allocation was explained by evolutionary trade-offs with mortality and other traits, but not environment. Lake trout life-history variation within this range was as wide as that observed across dozens of other freshwater species. Lake trout life histories resulted from evolutionary trade-offs, growth plasticity and local adaptations along several environmental clines. Presuming a plastic response, we documented similar to 1.4-fold growth compensation to exploitationlower growth compensation than observed in many freshwater fishes. These results suggest that harvested species exposed to spatially structured and diverse environments may have substantial clinal variation on different traits, but due to different processes, and this has implications for their resilience and successful management.

Although adult life span often accounts for much of the variation in fitness in long-lived animals, we know little about how early environment affects adult life span in the wild, and even less about whether these effects differ between the sexes. Using data collected over 45years from wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), we investigated the effects of early environment on adult mortality in both sexes, distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic sources of mortality. We used the average body mass of yearlings (at about 15months of age) as a yearly index of environmental quality. We first examined sex differences in natural mortality responses to early environment by censoring harvested males in the year they were shot. We then investigated sex differences in the effects of early environment on overall mortality (natural and hunting mortality combined). Finally, we used path analysis to separate the direct influence of early environment from indirect influences, mediated by age at first reproduction, adult mass and horn length. As early environmental conditions improved, natural adult mortality decreased in both sexes, although for males the effect was not statistically supported. Sex differences in the effects of early environment on adult mortality were detected only when natural and hunting mortality were pooled. Males that experienced favourable early environment had longer horns as adults and died earlier because of trophy hunting, which does not mimic natural mortality. Females that experienced favourable early environment started to reproduce earlier and early primiparity was associated with reduced mortality, suggesting a silver-spoon effect. Our results show that early conditions affect males and females differently because of trophy hunting. These findings highlight the importance of considering natural and anthropogenic environmental factors across different life stages to understand sex differences in mortality.

Foraging mode, relative prey size and diet breadth: A phylogenetically explicit analysis of snake feeding ecology	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						active foragers; Alethinophidia; ambush foragers; meal size; Serpentes; sit-and-wait foragers	SIT-AND-WAIT; METABOLIC-RESPONSE; DESERT LIZARDS; SEARCH MODES; PATTERNS; PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTION; BIRDS; SPECIALIZATIONS; CONSEQUENCES	Foraging modes (ambush vs. active foraging) are often correlated with a suite of morphological, physiological, behavioural and ecological traits known as the "adaptive syndrome" or "syndrome hypothesis." In snakes, an ecological correlate often reported in the literature is that ambush-hunting snakes have a higher relative meal size compared to actively foraging snakes which feed on smaller prey items. This large meal versus small meal feeding hypothesis between ambush and active foragers has become a widely accepted paradigm of snake feeding ecology, despite the fact that no rigorous meta-analysis has been conducted to support this generalization. We conducted a phylogenetically explicit meta-analysis, which included ca. 100 species, to test this paradigm of snake feeding ecology. We gathered data on prey size by inducing regurgitation by palpation in free-ranging snakes and by examining the stomach contents of preserved museum specimens. When we found prey, we recorded both snake and prey mass to estimate relative prey mass (prey mass/snake mass). We also reviewed published studies of snake feeding ecology to gather similar information for other species. Ambush and active foragers did not differ in minimum or average meal size but the maximum meal sizes consumed by ambush-foraging snakes were larger than the maximum meal sizes eaten by active foragers. This results in ambush-foraging snakes consuming a significantly wider range of meal sizes, rather than being large meal specialists compared to active foragers. We argue that ambush foragers evolved to be more opportunistic predators because they encounter prey less frequently compared to active foragers. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that ambush foragers also exhibited marginally wider diet breadths, consuming a broader range of prey types in comparison with active foragers. Our study challenges aspects of the foraging syndrome as it is currently conceived, and our results have important implications for our understanding of how foraging mode has shaped the behaviour and physiology of ambush-foraging snakes.

One framework for understanding herbivore feeding behaviour, the forage-maturation hypothesis, predicts that herbivores should align their movements with intermediate forage biomass (i.e., peak green-up); this phenomenon is known as surfing the green wave. Crop-raiding elephants, however, often consume not just foliage, but also fruits and tubers (e.g., maize and potatoes), which generally mature after seasonal peaks in photosynthetic activity. Thus, although elephants have been reported to surf the green wave in natural habitats, they may utilize a different strategy in cultivated landscapes by selecting crops that are browning down. We sought to understand the factors that underpin movement of elephants into agricultural landscapes. In Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, we used movement data from GPS-collared elephants, together with precipitation records, remotely sensed estimates of landscape greenness (NDVI), DNA-based diet analysis, measurements of plant nutritional quality and survey-based metrics of crop availability to understand spatiotemporal variation in elephant crop-raiding behaviour. Elephants tracked peak NDVI while foraging inside the Park. During the dry season, however, when NDVI within the Park declined and availability of mature crops was high, crop raiding increased dramatically, and elephants consistently selected crop plants that were browning down while foraging in cultivated landscapes. Crops contained significantly higher digestible energy than wild food plants, but comparable (and sometimes lower) levels of digestible protein, suggesting that this foraging strategy maximized energy rather than protein intake. Our study is the first to combine GPS tracking data with high-resolution diet analysis and community-based reporting of crop availability to reveal fine-scale plasticity in foraging behaviour of elephants at the human-wildlife interface. Our results extend the forage-maturation hypothesis by showing that elephants surf waves of plant brown-down in cultivated landscapes. These findings can aid efforts to reduce human-elephant conflict by enabling wildlife managers to prioritize mitigation actions in time and space with limited resources.

While ecological processes continue to operate within cities, urban ecosystems are profoundly different from their more natural counterparts. Thus, ecological predictions derived from more natural ecosystems are rarely generalizable to urban environments. In this study, we used data from a large-scale and long-term camera trap project in Chicago IL, USA, to determine whether urbanization alters predator-avoidance behaviour of urban prey species. We studied three behavioural mechanisms often induced by the fear of predation (spatial distribution, daily activity patterns and vigilance) of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) when coyote (Canis latrans)an urban apex predatorwas present. We found no evidence of spatial segregation between coyote and either prey species. Furthermore, neither white-tailed deer nor eastern cottontail changed their daily activity or increased vigilance in urban areas when coyotes were present. Eastern cottontail, however, had their uppermost level of vigilance in highly urban sites when coyotes were absent. Our study demonstrates that predator-prey dynamics might be modified in urban ecosystemsmoving from what is traditionally thought of as a two-player system (predator and prey) to a three-player system (predator, prey and people).

Velloziaceae is an important plant family in this environment, and some species colonize exposed quartzite rock. However, we know virtually nothing about their root development and nutrient acquisition within the rock outcrops and their possible role in rock weathering and landscape formation. We tested the hypothesis that Velloziaceae dissolve P from the rock, enhancing rock weathering. The study was carried out with two Barbacenia species (Velloziaceae) that colonize quartzite rocks. We assessed the root specializations and exudates, and determined the mineralogical composition of the rocks. The quartzite rocks contained a low concentration of total P in a matrix composed predominantly of silica. Using transmission electron microscopy, we show root growth perpendicular to the rock-bedding planes. A micro-XRF set-up at the XRF beamline of a synchrotron evidenced root-associated rock dissolution. The investigated roots show novel morphological and physiological specializations, coined vellozioid roots, which are highly effective at P acquisition. These carboxylate-releasing roots function like other specialized roots in nutrient-depleted soils. The rocks represent a barrier for most species, but due to their chemical and physical actions inside the rocks, vellozioid roots play a pivotal role in rock weathering, contributing to shaping the campos rupestres landscapes.

While turgor loss point ((tlp)) has been recognized as a direct determinant of drought tolerance in woody plants, information on it for grassland species is largely missing. We first validated a rapid method to estimate (tlp) for grassland species, using osmometry measurements ((tlp-osm)) of osmotic potential at full hydration ((o-osm)), originally proposed for woody species. We confirmed that (o-osm) was tightly positively related to (tlp) measured by the classic pressure-volume curve ((tlp-pv)). Cell wall elasticity was not important in the maintenance of turgor and neither specific leaf area nor leaf dry matter content influenced (tlp.) We then studied the relationship between (tlp-osm) measured under controlled conditions and species' soil moisture affinity (Ellenberg indicator values) in 40 diverse grassland species from the full range of soil moisture conditions found in temperate grasslands. On a subset of 12 species, we studied the adjustment in (tlp-osm) to drought stress and recovery from drought. We hypothesized that dry grassland species are better adapted to drier conditions by having comparatively higher leaf drought tolerance (more negative (tlp)) and a better ability to adjust to acute drought stress. We found that (tlp-osm) was unrelated to species' soil moisture affinity. However, all species developed higher leaf drought tolerance by decreasing (tlp-osm) after seven weeks of drought stress. After only one week of recovery, all species reduced the leaf drought tolerance back to the (tlp-osm) level comparable with non-stressed plants. Our results considerably extend the relationship between (o-osm) and (tlp), originally defined for woody species, and thus propose a yet unexploited direct method for assessing leaf drought tolerance via turgor loss point in herbaceous species. However, the lack of relationship between (tlp) and soil moisture affinity suggests that, unlike in woody plants, leaf-level drought tolerance in grassland plants does not fully translate into whole-plant drought resistance, suggesting an importance of other drought resistance strategies.

Chemical cues linked to risk: Cues from below-ground natural enemies enhance plant defences and influence herbivore behaviour and performance	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						below-ground chemical ecology; entomopathogenic nematodes; plant defence; tritrophic interactions	ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES; SPECIALIST HERBIVORE; SYSTEMIC RESISTANCE; VOLATILE EMISSION; PHYTOHORMONES; MANAGEMENT; BACTERIA; GROWTH	Chemical cues are essential for many ecological interactions. Previous studies of chemically mediated multitrophic interactions have typically focused on responses to cues from plants or herbivores above-ground. It is increasingly clear, however, that below-ground cues and those produced by organisms at higher trophic levels also have ecological importance. Prey animals often avoid predator odours to improve survival, and previous research has documented enhanced plant resistance following contact with below-ground natural enemies, though the ecological basis was unknown. Here, we investigated plant and insect responses to chemical cues from below-ground natural enemies and explored the ecological significance of these cues for multitrophic interactions. More specifically, we examined the influence of odours emitted by entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), a natural enemy of insect herbivores, on the performance and behaviour of their insect prey and the defence responses of nearby plants. Our findings revealed that EPN-infected insect cadavers emit a characteristic blend of volatile compounds with bioactivity in plants and insects. EPN chemical cues influenced both performance and preference of a specialist herbivore, Colorado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata), feeding on its host plant, potato (Solanum tuberosum). CPB larvae consumed less leaf tissue and gained less mass feeding on plants exposed to EPN cues compared to control plants. Female CPBs laid fewer eggs on plants with EPN cues than on controls, indicating deterrence by EPN cues or EPN-altered plant defences. Plant defences were enhanced by exposure to live EPNs or EPN chemical cues. Potato plants exposed to EPN infective juveniles induced higher amounts of the defence hormone salicylic acid (SA) and had higher expression of the pathogenisis-related gene PR-1(PR4) in foliar tissue. Exposing plants to EPN cues primed induction of SA and jasmonic acid in response to feeding damage by CPB larvae. These findings suggest that herbivores avoid cues from their EPN natural enemies and plants respond to the beneficial nematodes by enhancing systemic defences that reduce herbivore performance. This work has important implications for the chemical ecology of tritrophic interactions as we report that the third trophic level can play direct and indirect roles in plant defence.

Threshold elemental ratios and the temperature dependence of herbivory in fishes	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Andes; assimilation efficiency; consumption rate; ecological stoichiometry; latitudinal gradient; Loricariidae	SILURIFORMES LORICARIIDAE; ECOLOGICAL STOICHIOMETRY; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY; METABOLIC THEORY; TROPICAL STREAM; ARMORED CATFISH; PHOSPHORUS; DIET; WATER; LIMITATION	Herbivorous ectothermic vertebrates are more diverse and abundant at lower latitudes. While thermal constraints may drive this pattern, its underlying cause remains unclear. We hypothesized that this constraint stems from an inability to meet the elevated phosphorus demands of bony vertebrates feeding on P-poor plant material at cooler temperatures because low gross growth efficiency at warmer temperatures facilitates higher P ingestion rates. We predicted that dietary carbon:phosphorus (C:P) should exceed the threshold elemental ratio between carbon and P-limited growth (TERC:P) for herbivores feeding at cooler temperatures, thereby limiting the range of herbivorous ectothermic vertebrates facing P-limited growth. We tested this hypothesis using the Andean suckermouth catfishes Astroblepus and Chaetostoma. Astroblepus are invertivores that inhabit relatively cool, high-elevation streams while Chaetostoma are grazers that inhabit relatively warm, low-elevation streams. We calculated TERC:P for each genus across its elevational range and compared these values to measured values of food quality over an elevational gradient in the Andes. We also broadly summarized measurements of TERC:P across diverse groups of fishes. Supporting our hypothesis, we found that dietary C:P was predicted to exceed the TERC:P for the grazer Chaetostoma near the highest elevation where this genus has been recorded. Conversely, the TERC:P for the invertivore Astroblepus was consistently higher than that of Chaetostoma and thus its dietary C:P never approached the TERC:P. We found that, among all fishes, omnivores had higher average TERC:P than invertivores, and TERC:P did not vary with temperature. Our results suggest that, at least for Andean suckermouth catfishes, cool temperatures constrain herbivory at higher elevations. Increased gross growth efficiency at cooler temperatures evidently restricts the ability of P-limited consumers to meet P demand. However, our survey of fish TERC:P estimates suggests that some fishes are able to circumvent this constraint through behavioural and life-history adaptations that reduce P demand or increase P use efficiency. The physiological trade-offs underlying these functional shifts reveal that geographic dietary patterns can be predicted by stoichiometric theory, but variation in food quality and consumer traits that reduce P demand and/or increase P efficiency can create exceptions to these patterns.

Yet, we know little about the combined effects of warming and faunal species loss upon the marine carbon cycle. Using stable isotope pulse-chase experiments, we tested how faunal species loss affects microbial carbon sequestration and retention in intertidal sediments, under both ambient and predicted future warming conditions (ambient +2 degrees C), using the shore crab Carcinus maenas as a model predator. We traced the fixation and retention of a fixed dose of C-13-labelled sodium bicarbonate within sediment organic matter and microbial biomass.Carcinus presence was associated with higher total organic carbon concentration within the mesocosm sediments. Temperature had no significant effect upon sediment total organic carbon concentrations. Temperature and Carcinus presence had no significant effect on polar lipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations within the sediment, which is a proxy for microbial biomass.Carcinus presence increased retention of C-13-labelled carbon within the sediment organic matter pool under future warming conditions. Retention of the C-13-label within the microbial PLFAs decreased significantly under future warming conditions. Changes in the relative abundance of PLFAs revealed increased contribution of microeukaryotes to the microbial community under ambient conditions, in the absence of Carcinus. PLFA profiles revealed significant changes in C-13-label retention within the bacteria and microeukaryotes, driven by interactions between Carcinus presence and temperature. Given that temperature is a fundamental control on the metabolic activity of marine organisms (from bacteria to metazoans), we propose that interactions between faunal species loss and ocean warming will have a pronounced effect upon marine carbon budgets.

To date, however, few studies have considered the conservation importance of rivers draining these unique environments. In this study, lotic Odonata were used as indicators to examine factors affecting riparian forest-stream linkages in a lucidophyllous forest in south-western Japan. Lotic odonates of 10 species, including seven endemic species, and their habitats were studied along 30 stream reaches with varying environmental characteristics. Odonate species richness was greatest in shadier reaches as well as in heterogeneous locations in larger streams. In contrast, larger streams modified by channel enlargement for flood control had few or no odonate species. Protecting larger streams with less human impact and streams in dense riparian forest are the best options for conserving lotic odonates and their habitats in this globally unique forest type.

Among restoration measures, the addition of large wood (LW) in streams has been shown to increase fish abundance, yet which species benefit from LW, to what extent relative to other drivers, and which factors influence LW quantity is not clear, and these uncertainties limit our ability to use LW as an effective restoration measure. Here, a time series (from 1993 to 2016) of electrofishing data, including 3641 streams across Sweden, was used to investigate the beneficial effects of LW on the abundance of juvenile brown trout, Salmo trutta, juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and juvenile and adult sculpins, Cottus gobio and Cottus poecilopus, while accounting for other abiotic and biotic factors, and the drivers of LW abundance at a country-wide scale. Large wood benefitted brown trout, and the effects were greater with decreasing shaded stream surface. LW effects were comparable in magnitude to the positive effects of average annual air temperature and the negative effects of stream depth and predator abundance - factors where the influence was second only to the negative effects of stream width. LW did not benefit salmon abundance, which was correlated positively with stream width and negatively with altitude, nor did it benefit sculpin abundances, which mainly decreased with annual average air temperature and altitude. The quantity of LW strongly diminished with stream width, and, to a lesser extent, with stream depth, altitude, annual average air temperature, and forest age, whereas it increased with stream velocity, slope, and forest cover. The results suggest that LW can be used as an effective restoration tool for brown trout in shallow and narrow streams, especially in areas with little shade. Here, the addition of LW may help to alleviate the impacts of forest clearance and climate change.

A new local ecological knowledge dataset was obtained through large-scale questionnaire-based interviews with 510 artisanal fishers from 16 coastal fishing communities around Hainan, China. Almost all respondents (92.7%) reported regular encounters with marine mammals. Many respondents reported negative interactions with marine mammals, including bycatch (25.5%), consumption (36.1%), and the sale of meat (9.2%), and respondent perceptions of marine mammals were often negative. Generalized linear models (GLMs) indicated that respondent experiences of marine mammal encounters and bycatch events were mainly predicted by indices of fishing effort and experience, rather than by geographic or socio-economic factors. Respondent experiences of eating or selling marine mammal meat were predicted by geographic location and by some livelihood and socio-economic factors. Respondent perceptions of marine mammals were instead predicted by fishing experience and education level. Classification and regression trees (CARTs) showed that the most important factors determining respondent experiences and perceptions were number of fishing years and educational level, respectively. Both GLMs and CARTs indicated the complex effects of geographic, livelihood, and socio-economic factors on respondent experiences and perceptions of marine mammals. Regional community-based conservation of marine mammals could be promoted through improved regulatory management and environmental education, sustainable ecological exploitation and economic development, and positive partnerships and collaboration between fishing communities, enforcement agencies, and researchers.

So far, it has been unknown to which degree root exudate composition is species-specific and is affected by land use, the local impact and local neighborhood under field conditions. In this study, root exudates of 10 common grassland species were analyzed, each five of forbs and grasses, in the German Biodiversity Exploratories using a combined phytometer and untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach. Redundancy analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed a large set of semi-polar metabolites common to all species in addition to species-specific metabolites. Chemical richness and exudate composition revealed that forbs, such as Plantago lanceolata and Galium species, exuded more species-specific metabolites than grasses. Grasses instead were primarily affected by environmental conditions. In both forbs and grasses, plant functional traits had only a minor impact on plant root exudation patterns. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining and untargeted profiling of semi-polar metabolites under field condition and allow a deeper view in the exudation of plants in a natural grassland community.

Whilst large shark species are often difficult to study with direct methods, improved knowledge is needed for both population management and conservation, especially for species vulnerable to anthropogenic and climatic impacts. The tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, is an apex predator known to play important direct and indirect roles in tropical and subtropical marine ecosystems. While the global and Indo-West Pacific population genetic structure of this species has recently been investigated, questions remain over population structure and demographic history within the western Indian (WIO) and within the western Pacific Oceans (WPO). To address the knowledge gap in tiger shark regional population structures, the genetic diversity of 286 individuals sampled in seven localities was investigated using 27 microsatellite loci and three mitochondrial genes (CR, COI, and cytb). A weak genetic differentiation was observed between the WIO and the WPO, suggesting high genetic connectivity. This result agrees with previous studies and highlights the importance of the pelagic behavior of this species to ensure gene flow. Using approximate Bayesian computation to couple information from both nuclear and mitochondrial markers, evidence of a recent bottleneck in the Holocene (2,000-3,000 years ago) was found, which is the most probable cause for the low genetic diversity observed. A contemporary effective population size as low as 111 [43,369] was estimated during the bottleneck. Together, these results indicate low genetic diversity that may reflect a vulnerable population sensitive to regional pressures. Conservation measures are thus needed to protect a species that is classified as Near Threatened.

Landscape effects on the contemporary genetic structure of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) populations	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						dispersal barriers; gene flow; isolation by resistance; landscape genetics; population genetics; ruffed grouse	MICROSATELLITE LOCI; ECOLOGICAL FACTORS; MANTEL TEST; FLOW; DNA; SOFTWARE; DISTANCE; HYBRIDIZATION; WIDESPREAD; SELECTION	The amount of dispersal that occurs among populations can be limited by landscape heterogeneity, which is often due to both natural processes and anthropogenic activity leading to habitat loss or fragmentation. Understanding how populations are structured and mapping existing dispersal corridors among populations is imperative to both determining contemporary forces mediating population connectivity, and informing proper management of species with fragmented populations. Furthermore, the contemporary processes mediating gene flow across heterogeneous landscapes on a large scale are understudied, particularly with respect to widespread species. This study focuses on a widespread game bird, the Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), for which we analyzed samples from the western extent of the range. Using three types of genetic markers, we uncovered multiple factors acting in concert that are responsible for mediating contemporary population connectivity in this species. Multiple genetically distinct groups were detected; microsatellite markers revealed six groups, and a mitochondrial marker revealed four. Many populations of Ruffed Grouse are genetically isolated, likely by macrogeographic barriers. Furthermore, the addition of landscape genetic methods not only corroborated genetic structure results, but also uncovered compelling evidence that dispersal resistance created by areas of unsuitable habitat is the most important factor mediating population connectivity among the sampled populations. This research has important implications for both our study species and other inhabitants of the early successional forest habitat preferred by Ruffed Grouse. Moreover, it adds to a growing body of evidence that isolation by resistance is more prevalent in shaping population structure of widespread species than previously thought.

Using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in greater yam (Discorea alata L.), 4,593 good quality SNPs were identified in 40 accessions. One hundred ninety six of these SNPs were selected to represent the overall dataset and used to design a competitive allele specific PCR array (KASPar). This array was validated on 141 accessions from the Tropical Plants Biological Resources Centre (CRB-PT) and CIRAD collections that encompass worldwide D. alata diversity. Overall, 129 SNPs were successfully converted as cost-effective genotyping tools. The results showed that the ploidy levels of accessions could be accurately estimated using this array. The rate of redundant accessions within the collections was high in agreement with the low genetic diversity of D. alata and its diversification by somatic clone selection. The overall diversity resulting from these 129 polymorphic SNPs was consistent with the findings of previously published studies. This KASPar array will be useful in collection management, ploidy level inference, while complementing accurate agro-morphological descriptions.

Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator-the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first 3/4 km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities.

Why did the buffalo cross the park? Resource shortages, but not infections, drive dispersal in female African buffalo (Syncerus caffer)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						African buffalo; bovine tuberculosis; density dependence; disease; dispersal; gastrointestinal parasites; longitudinal study; resource limitation	CONDITION-DEPENDENT DISPERSAL; KRUGER-NATIONAL-PARK; NATAL DISPERSAL; BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; GENETIC DIVERSITY; BODY CONDITION; MOUTH-DISEASE; WOOD BISON; POPULATION	Dispersal facilitates population health and maintains resilience in species via gene flow. Adult dispersal occurs in some species, is often facultative, and is poorly understood, but has important management implications, particularly with respect to disease spread. Although the role of adult dispersal in spreading disease has been documented, the potential influence of disease on dispersal has received little attention. African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) are wide-ranging and harbor many pathogens that can affect nearby livestock. Dispersal of adult buffalo has been described, but ecological and social drivers of buffalo dispersal are poorly understood. We investigated drivers of adult buffalo dispersal during a 4-year longitudinal study at Kruger National Park, South Africa. We monitored the spatial movement of 304 female buffalo in two focal areas using satellite and radio collars, capturing each buffalo every 6 months to assess animal traits and disease status. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine whether likelihood of dispersal for individual female buffalo was influenced by animal traits, herd identity, environmental variables, gastrointestinal parasites, or microparasite infections. The likelihood and drivers of buffalo dispersal varied by herd, area, and year. In the Lower Sabie herd, where resources were abundant, younger individuals were more likely to disperse, with most dispersal occurring in the early wet season and during an unusually dry year, 2009. In the resource-poor Crocodile Bridge area, buffalo in poor condition were most likely to disperse. Our findings suggest that dispersal of female buffalo is driven by either seasonal (Lower Sabie) or perhaps social (Crocodile Bridge) resource restriction, indicating resource limitation and dispersal decisions are tightly linked for this social ungulate. We found no direct effects of infections on buffalo dispersal, assuaging fears that highly infectious individuals might be more prone to dispersing, which could accelerate the spatial spread of infectious diseases.

Information on AMW densities in the sea ice-covered parts of the Southern Ocean is required to contextualize abundance estimates obtained from circumpolar shipboard surveys in open waters, suggesting a 30% decline in AMW abundance. Conventional line-transect shipboard surveys for density estimation are impossible in ice-covered regions, therefore we used icebreaker-supported helicopter surveys to obtain information on AMW densities along gradients of 0%-100% of ice concentration. We conducted five helicopter surveys in the Southern Ocean, between 2006 and 2013. Distance sampling data, satellite-derived sea-ice data, and bathymetric parameters were used in generalized additive models (GAMs) to produce predictions on how the density of AMWs varied over space and time, and with environmental covariates. Ice concentration, distance to the ice edge and distance from the shelf break were found to describe the distribution of AMWs. Highest densities were predicted at the ice edge and through to medium ice concentrations. Medium densities were found up to 500 km into the ice edge in all concentrations of ice. Very low numbers of AMWs were found in the ice-free waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). A consistent relationship between AMW distribution and sea ice concentration weakens the support for the hypothesis that varying numbers of AMWs in ice-covered waters were responsible for observed changes in estimated abundance. The potential decline in AMW abundance stresses the need for conservation measures and further studies into the AMW population status. Very low numbers of AMWs recorded in the ice-free waters along the WAP support the hypothesis that this species is strongly dependent on sea ice and that forecasted sea ice changes have the potential of heavily impacting AMWs.

Honeybees (Apis mellifera L) are pollinators of many crops, but their behavior can be affected by conditions under covers. To determine how netting crop covers can affect honeybee foraging dynamics, colony health, and pollination services, we assessed the performance of 52 nucleus honeybee colonies in five covered and six uncovered kiwifruit orchards. Colony strength was estimated pre- and postintroduction, and the foraging of individual bees (including pollen, nectar, and naive foragers) was monitored in a subset of the hives fitted with RFID readers. Simultaneously, we evaluated pollination effectiveness by measuring flower visitation rates and the number of seeds produced after single honeybee visits. Honeybee colonies under cover exhibited both an acute loss of foragers and changes in the behavior of successful foragers. Under cover, bees were roughly three times less likely to return after their first trip outside the hive. Consequently, the number of adult bees in hives declined at a faster rate in these orchards, with colonies losing on average 1,057 +/- 274 of their bees in under two weeks. Bees that did forage under cover completed fewer trips provisioning their colony, failing to reenter after a few short-duration trips. These effects are likely to have implications for colony health and productivity. We also found that bee density (bees/thousand flowers) and visitation rates to flowers were lower under cover; however, we did not detect a resultant change in pollination. Our findings highlight the need for environment-specific management techniques for pollinators. Improving honeybee orientation under covers and increasing our understanding of the effects of covers on bee nutrition and brood rearing should be primary objectives for maintaining colonies and potentially improving pollination in these systems.

Location Altitudinal gradient on the Caribbean slope of the Talamanca Cordillera, Costa Rica. Taxon Angiosperm and gymnosperm trees, palms, and tree ferns. Methods We measured and identified all stems >= 10 cm dbh in 32 0.25-ha undisturbed rain forest plots over the gradient. We determined compositional patterns using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) ordination, and used linear regressions to explore the relationship between four alpha diversity metrics and altitude. With variation partitioning (VARPART), we determined the compositional variation explained by altitude, soil, and spatial variables quantified using Principle Components of Neighbor matrices. Results We identified 425 species. NMS axis 1 separated a lowland zone (440-1,120 m asl) from a transitional one dominated by holarctic Oreomunnea mexicana (1,400-1,600 m asl) and Quercus-dominated forests at altitudes >2,100 m asl. The lowland zone was separated into two clusters of plots on NMS axis 2, the first in the 430-620 m asl range and the second at 1,000-1,120 masl. Regressions showed that all alpha diversity metrics were strongly negatively related to altitude (R-2 > 0.78). Overall, adjusted R-2 from VARPART was 0.43, with 0.30, 0.21, and 0.17 for altitude, soil, and space respectively. The respective adjusted R-2 of individual matrices, on controlling for the other two, was 0.06, 0.05 and 0.09 (p < 0.001). Main conclusions There are two well-defined forest compositional zones on this gradient-lowlands 430-1,120 m asl and montane forests >2,150 m asl-with a transitional zone at 1,400-1,600 m asl, where lowland tropical and montane holarctic species are found together. Montane forests are very distinct in their composition and low alpha diversity. Vegetation and soil respond to altitude, and therefore temperature, as an integrated system, a model that goes beyond niche assembly as shown by the significant effect of space in the VARPART.

We examined these diversity elements in three types of grasslands in northern China, including two temperate steppes and an alpine meadow. We evaluated the differences in community-weighted means (CWM) of plant traits and functional dispersion (FDis) between 2 years with contrasting aridity in the growing season. Four traits were measured: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), and the maximum plant height (H). CWM for SLA of the alpine meadow increased in the dry year while that of the temperate steppe in Qinghai showed opposing trends. CWM of LDMC in two temperate steppes became higher and CWM of LNC in all grasslands became lower in the dry year. Compared with the wet year, FDis of LDMC in the alpine meadow and FDis of LNC in the temperate steppe in Qinghai decreased in the dry year. FDis of H was higher in the dry year for two temperate steppes. Only in the temperate steppe in Qinghai did the multi-FDis of all traits experience a significant increase in the dry year. Most of the changes in CWM and FDis between 2 years were explained by intraspecific trait variation rather than shifts in species composition. This study highlights that temporal intraspecific trait variation contributes to functional responses to environmental changes. Our results also suggest it would be necessary to consider habitat types when modeling ecosystem responses to climate changes, as different grasslands showed different response patterns.

Breeding latitude predicts timing but not rate of spring migration in a widespread migratory bird in South America	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Argentina; Brazil; cerrado; life history; light-level geolocator; Pampas	FLYCATCHERS TYRANNUS-SAVANA; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; DISTANCE; SEASONALITY; PHENOLOGY; DRIVERS; ARRIVAL; FOREST; CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE	Identifying the processes that determine avian migratory strategies in different environmental contexts is imperative to understanding the constraints to survival and reproduction faced by migratory birds across the planet. We compared the spring migration strategies of Fork-tailed Flycatchers (Tyrannus s. savana) that breed at south-temperate latitudes (i.e., austral migrants) vs. tropical latitudes (i.e., intratropical migrants) in South America. We hypothesized that austral migrant flycatchers are more time-selected than intratropical migrants during spring migration. As such, we predicted that austral migrants, which migrate further than intratropical migrants, will migrate at a faster rate and that the rate of migration for austral migrants will be positively correlated with the onset of spring migration. We attached light-level geolocators to Fork-tailed Flycatchers at two tropical breeding sites in Brazil and at two south-temperate breeding sites in Argentina and tracked their movements until the following breeding season. Of 286 geolocators that were deployed, 37 were recovered similar to 1 year later, of which 28 provided useable data. Rate of spring migration did not differ significantly between the two groups, and only at one site was there a significantly positive relationship between date of initiation of spring migration and arrival date. This represents the first comparison of individual migratory strategies among conspecific passerines breeding at tropical vs. temperate latitudes and suggests that austral migrant Fork-tailed Flycatchers in South America are not more time-selected on spring migration than intratropical migrant conspecifics. Low sample sizes could have diminished our power to detect differences (e.g., between sexes), such that further research into the mechanisms underpinning migratory strategies in this poorly understood system is necessary.

We concurrently obtained quantitative information on the seasonal variation in the detectability and body condition of adders. Our results show strong seasonality in body condition, encounter, and capture rates of adult adders, and these patterns differ markedly between sexes and between breeding and nonbreeding females. Seasonal variation in mortality rates was however virtually nonexistent in males and moderately low in both breeding and nonbreeding females. In addition, we found no evidence for among-year differences in the seasonal mortality schedules of males and females. During periods of intensive basking, both males and pregnant females are highly visible for humans, but are not subject to strong natural mortality. This low susceptibility to predation is presumably induced by various factors, including the limitation of overt exposure to short periods of time and specific microhabitats, the dorsal coloration pattern that provides cryptic protection and possibly also an aposematic warning signal, and presumed seasonal differences in the foraging behavior and food requirements of natural predators. Our data provide some evidence that female adders, but not males, are relatively vulnerable to predation during the seasonal migrations between the hibernation and feeding habitats. Mortality in the females was not much elevated during their breeding years, but was notably highest in the spring of the ensuing nonbreeding year. After giving birth, reproductive females are extremely emaciated and have a weakened general condition. They then run the risk of dying from starvation either before, during, or after hibernation. The higher mortality after giving birth, that is sustained over a period of ca. 9 months, should be considered as an indirect and delayed survival cost of reproduction.

We measured nutrient availability (DIN, total N [TN], total P [TP]), nutrient imbalance (TN:TP, DIN:TP, N:P-seston), species richness, and abundance of the whole phytoplankton community, as well as those specific for cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates in Cau Hai lagoon in Vietnam. We determined the correlation among these variables, using structural equation modeling. The models applied to the whole phytoplankton community indicated that the nutrient availability (particularly TP and DIN) drove variation in phytoplankton abundance and richness, and that abundance also depended on species richness. The models applied to different functional groups differed considerably from the entire community and among each other, and only a part of the models was significant. The relationship between nutrient availability (mainly TP) and abundance was driven by cyanobacteria, and the relationship between nutrient imbalance (only with N:P-seston) and species richness was driven by diatoms. Remarkably, the positive relationship between species richness and abundance, as consistently observed for the whole phytoplankton community, was only observed for one of the three functional groups (diatoms), indicating that resource complementarity occurs particularly among species of different functional groups. Our results emphasized that nutrient availability (TP and to a lesser extent DIN) as well as nutrient imbalance (albeit only with N:P-seston as proxy) were driving factors for the phytoplankton community in the Cau Hai lagoon and hence alterations in both of these factors leading to a shift in phytoplankton species composition and productivity.

However, in some mimetic species, nonmimetic individuals are present in populations, despite the benefits of mimicry. The mechanism for evolution of such mimetic polymorphism remains an open question. Here, we address the hypothesis that the abundance of mimics is limited by that of the models, leading to mimetic polymorphism. In addition, other forces such as the effects of common ancestry and/or isolation by distance may explain this phenomenon. To investigate this question, we focused on the butterfly, Papilio polytes, that exhibits mimetic polymorphism on multiple islands of the Ryukyus, Japan, and performed field surveys and genetic analysis. We found that the mimic ratio of P. polytes was strongly correlated with the model abundance observed on each of the five islands, suggesting negative frequency-dependent selection is driving the evolution of polymorphism in P. polytes populations. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that the southern island populations are the major source of genetic diversity, and the middle and northern island populations arose by relatively recent migration. This view was also supported by mismatch distribution and Tajima's D analyses, suggesting a recent population expansion on the middle and northern islands, and stable population persistence on the southern islands. The frequency of the mimetic forms within P. polytes populations is thus explained by variations in the model abundance rather than by population structure. Thus, we propose that predation pressure, rather than neutral forces, have shaped the Batesian mimicry polymorphism in P. polytes observed in the Ryukyus.

Genomic signatures of adaptation to Sahelian and Soudanian climates in sorghum landraces of Senegal	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Africa; drought tolerance; local adaptation; selective sweeps; stay-green	LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; GENETIC DIVERSITY; PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; WIDE ASSOCIATION; SELECTIVE SWEEPS; FLOWERING TIME; COMPLEX TRAITS; PLANT	Uncovering the genomic basis of climate adaptation in traditional crop varieties can provide insight into plant evolution and facilitate breeding for climate resilience. In the African cereal sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. [Moench]), the genomic basis of adaptation to the semiarid Sahelian zone versus the subhumid Soudanian zone is largely unknown. To address this issue, we characterized a large panel of 421 georeferenced sorghum landrace accessions from Senegal and adjacent locations at 213,916 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using genotyping-by-sequencing. Seven subpopulations distributed along the north-south precipitation gradient were identified. Redundancy analysis found that climate variables explained up to 8% of SNP variation, with climate collinear with space explaining most of this variation (6%). Genome scans of nucleotide diversity suggest positive selection on chromosome 2, 4, 5, 7, and 10 in durra sorghums, with successive adaptation during diffusion along the Sahel. Putative selective sweeps were identified, several of which colocalize with stay-green drought tolerance (Stg) loci, and a priori candidate genes for photoperiodic flowering and inflorescence morphology. Genome-wide association studies of photoperiod sensitivity and panicle compactness identified 35 and 13 associations that colocalize with a priori candidate genes, respectively. Climate-associated SNPs colocalize with Stg3a, Stg1, Stg2, and Ma6 and have allelic distribution consistent with adaptation across Sahelian and Soudanian zones. Taken together, the findings suggest an oligogenic basis of adaptation to Sahelian versus Soudanian climates, underpinned by variation in conserved floral regulatory pathways and other systems that are less understood in cereals.

Genetic changes caused by restocking and hydroelectric dams in demographically bottlenecked brown trout in a transnational subarctic riverine system	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						fish stocking; genetic diversity; genetic erosion; genetic integrity; habitat fragmentation; Salmo trutta	SCALE POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SALMO-TRUTTA L.; DENDRITIC CONNECTIVITY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SALAR L.; STOCKING; MICROSATELLITE; DIVERSITY; FRAGMENTATION; SOFTWARE	Habitat discontinuity, anthropogenic disturbance, and overharvesting have led to population fragmentation and decline worldwide. Preservation of remaining natural genetic diversity is crucial to avoid continued genetic erosion. Brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) is an ideal model species for studying anthropogenic influences on genetic integrity, as it has experienced significant genetic alterations throughout its natural distribution range due to habitat fragmentation, overexploitation, translocations, and stocking. The Pasvik River is a subarctic riverine system shared between Norway, Russia, and Finland, subdivided by seven hydroelectric power dams that destroyed about 70% of natural spawning and nursing areas. Stocking is applied in certain river parts to support the natural brown trout population. Adjacent river segments with different management strategies (stocked vs. not stocked) facilitated the simultaneous assessment of genetic impacts of dams and stocking based on analyses of 16 short tandem repeat loci. Dams were expected to increase genetic differentiation between and reduce genetic diversity within river sections. Contrastingly, stocking was predicted to promote genetic homogenization and diversity, but also potentially lead to loss of private alleles and to genetic erosion. Our results showed comparatively low heterozygosity and clear genetic differentiation between adjacent sections in nonstocked river parts, indicating that dams prevent migration and contribute to genetic isolation and loss of genetic diversity. Furthermore, genetic differentiation was low and heterozygosity relatively high across stocked sections. However, in stocked river sections, we found signatures of recent bottlenecks and reductions in private alleles, indicating that only a subset of individuals contributes to reproduction, potentially leading to divergence away from the natural genetic state. Taken together, these results indicate that stocking counteracts the negative fragmentation effects of dams, but also that stocking practices should be planned carefully in order to ensure long-term preservation of natural genetic diversity and integrity in brown trout and other species in regulated river systems.

Among the factors affecting FID, tests of effects of group size (i.e., number of potential prey) on FID have yielded contrasting results. Group size or flock size could either affect FID negatively (i.e., the dilution effect caused by the presence of many individuals) or positively (i.e., increased vigilance due to more eyes scanning for predators). These effects may be associated with gregarious species, because such species should be better adapted to exploiting information from other individuals in the group than nongregarious species. Sociality may explain why earlier findings on group size versus FID have yielded different conclusions. Here, we analyzed how flock size affected bird FID in eight European countries. A phylogenetic generalized least square regression model was used to investigate changes in escape behavior of bird species in relation to number of individuals in the flock, starting distance, diet, latitude, and type of habitat. Flock size of different bird species influenced how species responded to perceived threats. We found that gregarious birds reacted to a potential predator earlier (longer FID) when aggregated in large flocks. These results support a higher vigilance arising from many eyes scanning in birds, suggesting that sociality may be a key factor in the evolution of antipredator behavior both in urban and rural areas. Finally, future studies comparing FID must pay explicit attention to the number of individuals in flocks of gregarious species.

However, few studies use long-term field measurements to explore the interannual variations in plant biomass under climate fluctuations. Here, we examine the interannual variations of plant biomass within two vegetation types (alpine meadow and alpine shrub) during 2008-2017 and their relationships with climate variables. The following results were obtained. The aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) response differently to climate fluctuations, the AGB in KPM was dominated by mean annual precipitation (MAP), whereas the AGB in PFS was controlled by mean annual air temperature (MAT). However, the BGB of both KPM and PFS was only weakly affected by climate variables, suggesting that the BGB in alpine ecosystems may remain as a stable carbon stock even under future global climate change. Furthermore, the AGB in PFS was significantly higher than KPM, while the BGB and R/S in KPM were significantly higher than PFS, reflecting the KPM be more likely to allocate more photosynthates to roots. Interestingly, the proportion of 0-10 cm root biomass increased in KPM and PFS, whereas the other proportions both decreased, reflecting a shift in biomass toward the surface layer. Our results could provide a new sight for the prediction how alpine ecosystem response to future climate change.

Maternal Behavior Indicates Survival and Cause-Specific Mortality of Moose Calves	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Alces alces; animal movement; behavior; calf; moose; mortality; neonates	WHITE-TAILED DEER; CALF MORTALITY; INDUCED ABANDONMENT; HABITAT SELECTION; BIRTH; PARTURITION; VULNERABILITY; STRATEGIES; MOVEMENTS; PREDATION	Continuing research on cause-specific mortality and annual survival of moose (Alces alces) calves in northeastern Minnesota, USA, is important to understanding the long-term trajectory of the population. In 2013 and 2014, we observed global positioning system (GPS)-collared, female moose exhibit a specific behavior (i.e., mortality movement) associated with the death of their GPS-collared neonate. The females made a rapid, long-distance movement (flee), followed by a return to the calf mortality site. We used characteristics of this movement in 2013-2014 (n = 46) to develop models for assessing calf survival, and then evaluated these models using female movement rates (n = 49) in 2015-2016. Using this behavior as an indicator of calf mortality in 2016, we conducted field investigations, leading to evidence of 15 mortalities at a mean age of 30.6 +/- 15.5 (SE) days (range = 3-243 days). We launched 21 investigations in response to a mortality movement and they resulted in confirmation of 11 of the 15 calf mortalities. Specific causes of mortality included 9 wolf (Canis lupus)-kills, 3 black bear (Ursus americanus)-kills, 1 unknown predator-kill, and 2 deaths following vehicle collisions. The mean distance females fled after a mortality was 1,873 +/- 412 m (range = 126-5,805 m, n = 14). Females that made return visits returned a mean 2.8 +/- 0.5 times (range = 1-5, n = 8) to within a mean 106 +/- 22 m (range = 34-230 m, n = 8) of the mortality site. Calf survival to 30 days of age was 67 +/- 8% (95% CI = 53-84%, n = 36) but declined to 53 +/- 8% (95% CI = 39-72%, n = 36) by 3 months of age. We developed 2 population-level movement models to improve the efficacy of using the mortality movement to identify and locate calf mortalities in real time via field investigations. The first approach, a temporal-based model, used a 3-day average movement velocity threshold (118 m/hr) for all females to indicate calf mortality and accurately predicted survival status in 51% (n = 105) of the cases. The second approach, an age-specific model using different thresholds (28-135 m/hr) for females relative to calf age, was 80% (n = 231) accurate. Using movement behavior of females to assess calf mortality yielded important insights into mechanisms influencing the population decline that will inform future management decisions.

Modeling elk-to-livestock transmission risk to predict hotspots of brucellosis spillover	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Brucella abortus; Cervus canadensis; cross-species pathogen spillover; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; habitat selection; human-wildlife conflict; resource selection function; wildlife disease	RESOURCE SELECTION; WILDLIFE; DISEASE; PHENOLOGY; CONFLICT; MOVEMENT; CATTLE; SIZES; RANGE; BISON	Wildlife reservoirs of infectious disease are a major source of human-wildlife conflict because of the risk of potential spillover associated with commingling of wildlife and livestock. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the presence of brucellosis (Brucella abortus) in free-ranging elk (Cervus canadensis) populations is of significant management concern because of the risk of disease transmission from elk to livestock. We identified how spillover risk changes through space and time by developing resource selection functions using telemetry data from 223 female elk to predict the relative probability of female elk occurrence daily during the transmission risk period. We combined these spatiotemporal predictions with elk seroprevalence, demography, and transmission timing data to identify when and where abortions (the primary transmission route of brucellosis) were most likely to occur. Additionally, we integrated our predictions of transmission risk with spatiotemporal data on areas of potential livestock use to estimate the daily risk to livestock. We predicted that approximately half of the transmission risk occurred on areas where livestock may be present (i.e., private property or grazing allotments). Of the transmission risk that occurred in livestock areas, 98% of it was on private ranchlands as opposed to state or federal grazing allotments. Disease prevalence, transmission timing, host abundance, and host distribution were all important factors in determining the potential for spillover risk. Our fine-resolution (250-m spatial, 1-day temporal), large-scale (17,732 km(2)) predictions of potential elk-to-livestock transmission risk provide wildlife and livestock managers with a useful tool to identify higher risk areas in space and time and proactively focus actions in these areas to separate elk and livestock to reduce spillover risk.

Short-term effect of helicopter-based capture on movements of a social ungulate	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						animal welfare; bison; Bison bison; chemical immobilization; GPS collar; movement rates; wildlife capture and handling	BISON BISON-BISON; RANGING BIGHORN SHEEP; CHEMICAL IMMOBILIZATION; NET-GUN; SEXUAL SEGREGATION; WOOD BISON; GROUP-SIZE; DRIVE-NET; DROP-NET; BEHAVIOR	Capture and handling of wildlife is often an important component of studies where detailed demographic, behavioral, physiological, or health data are required. Yet, capturing and handling wildlife is sometimes controversial and lacking public support because of concern about effects on individuals. Investigating potential effects of capturing wildlife is also important to inform data-censoring protocols when using information obtained from captured animals. We investigated the short-term effect of helicopter-based capture and handling on movements of free-ranging bison (Bison bison) that were chemically immobilized in Yukon, Canada. We examined daily movement rates, home range size, and displacement of global positioning system-collared individuals immediately after capture and for 20 days thereafter. Our results indicate that there is a minimal short-term effect of helicopter-based capture on bison movements. Significant differences from apparent pre-capture movement behavior were observed only within 24 hours after capture. We observed variation among individuals, however, with some animals taking up to 10 days to return to apparent pre-capture movement rates, whereas others had no measurable response to capture. Despite individual variation, >80% of individuals had returned to apparent pre-capture movement behavior within the first 5 days after capture. Furthermore, sex-based effects were evident: females increased their daily movement rates, home range size, and displacement after capture, whereas males had either no effect or decreased movement rates. Our results suggest that movement rates are altered for only a short period after capture and, therefore, should not have severe negative effects on bison using our protocols. Accordingly, researchers should censor the first 10 days after capture from their analyses to avoid using biased information. Our study should also help inform public discourse regarding capturing and handling wildlife for research or management purposes.

Genetic outcomes of translocation of bighorn sheep in Arizona	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Arizona; bighorn sheep; genetic diversity; management; microsatellite; mitochondrial DNA; Ovis canadensis; translocation	WESTERN UNITED-STATES; MOUNTAIN SHEEP; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; OVIS-CANADENSIS; PNEUMONIA EPIZOOTICS; INSULAR POPULATION; CONSERVATION; SOFTWARE; RESCUE; MITOCHONDRIAL	Translocation is an important management tool that has been used for >50 years in Arizona, USA, to increase bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) population densities and to restore herds to suitable habitat throughout their historical range. Yet, translocation can also alter the underlying genetic diversity and spatial structure of managed wildlife species in beneficial or detrimental ways. To evaluate the long-term effect of translocation actions on bighorn sheep, we characterized statewide genetic structure and diversity using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data in 16 indigenous and translocated (supplemented or reintroduced) Arizona populations sampled between 2005 and 2012. Populations that were recipients of translocated animals showed no reduction in genetic diversity with allelic richness and heterozygosity estimates equivalent to, and in some cases greater than, indigenous source populations. The indigenous population occupying the Silver Bell Mountains population displayed the lowest indices of genetic diversity but shared mitochondrial DNA haplotypes with the Mohawk Mountains, Sierra Pinta, and Cabeza Prieta populations, indicating past connectivity and potential opportunities for genetic management if warranted. Bayesian clustering on genetic similarity and genetic divergence estimates corroborated previous work differentiating Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (O. c. canadensis) and 2 desert lineages corresponding with Nelson's (O. c. nelsoni) and Mexican desert bighorn sheep (O. c. mexicana). In northern Arizona, assignment tests confirmed the presence of 2 indigenous metapopulations of Nelson's desert bighorn sheep in the Black Mountains and Grand Canyon and indicated that gene flow from the Grand Canyon population has likely played a role in maintaining genetic diversity and mitigating founder effects among multiple translocated populations in the area. In southern Arizona, we detected genetic structure consistent with 2 metapopulations of Mexican desert bighorn sheep representing a departure from current management practices that consider this lineage to be a single genetic unit. Several lines of genetic evidence presented in this study suggest that the Bill Williams River area is the contemporary contact zone for the 2 desert lineages; however, the degree to which translocation has enhanced introgression is unknown. Despite relative isolation from other herds, the translocated Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep population in eastern Arizona had high levels of allelic richness and heterozygosity and a negative inbreeding coefficient, conceivably as a result of multiple translocation events from sources in Colorado and New Mexico, USA. Although translocation management has successfully contributed to the reestablishment of bighorn sheep populations in Arizona without diminishing genetic diversity, future translocation should proceed with caution to preserve the genetic integrity and potential local adaptation within the Nelson's and Mexican desert bighorn sheep metapopulations identified in this study.

Greater sage-grouse response to bentonite mining	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						bentonite mining; Bighorn Basin; Centrocercus urophasianus; greater sage-grouse; habitat selection; Montana; mortality risk; reproductive success; Wyoming	WYOMING BIG SAGEBRUSH; ENERGY DEVELOPMENT; HABITAT SELECTION; COMMON RAVEN; LAND-USE; DISTURBANCE; WINTER; CULTIVATION; EQUATIONS; PREDATION	The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) has undergone range contraction and population decline because of anthropogenic land surface disturbances; yet, there is little information on the effects of mining on sage-grouse populations. In the Bighorn Basin of Montana and Wyoming, USA, bentonite mining is a growing source of surface disturbance that contributes to loss of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitat. We evaluated the response of sage-grouse to active and reclaimed bentonite mining, relative to nesting, brood-rearing, adult breeding, and adult winter habitat, through resource selection and habitat-specific mortality risk analyses, based on female sage-grouse (n = 321) monitored with telemetry from 2011-2015. A greater proportion of our monitored sample was exposed to mining disturbance during winter (65%) than during other seasons (range = 25%-34%). We observed avoidance of all mining disturbance for selection of nesting habitat (n = 378 nests), adult breeding habitat (n = 1,978 locations), and adult winter habitat (n = 1,365 locations). Evidence was inconclusive for avoidance of mining for brood-rearing habitat (n = 754 locations). We also observed increased adult breeding season mortality risk (n = 62 mortality events; n = 285 female sage-grouse) associated with active mining disturbance but observed no effect on nest success (n = 207 mortality events; n = 378 nests). Evidence was inconclusive for increased mortality risk associated with broods (n = 48 mortality events; n = 157 broods) and adults during winter (n = 31 mortality events; n = 220 female sage-grouse). Stakeholders in the Bighorn Basin should be flexible and proactive to minimize the negative effects of bentonite mining on sage-grouse habitat use and demographic rates. Stakeholders should prioritize the conservation of winter habitats because of the influence on a greater proportion of the population and because of the lower regulatory priority given to winter habitat and they should strive to perfect mining reclamation to return disturbed sites back to pre-disturbance conditions to minimize long-term effects of the mines on sage-grouse.

Since the 1940s, coyotes (Canis latrans) have expanded into eastern North America where they are now the largest predator and prey on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). However, their effect on deer populations remains controversial. We tested the hypothesis that coyotes, as a novel predator, would affect deer population dynamics across large spatial scales, and the strongest effects would occur after a time lag following initial coyote colonization that allows for the predator populations to grow. We evaluated deer population trends from 1981 to 2014 in 384 counties of 6 eastern states in the United States with linear mixed models. We included deer harvest data as a proxy for deer relative abundance, years since coyote arrival in a county as a proxy of coyote abundance, and landscape and climate covariates to account for environmental effects. Overall, deer populations in all states experienced positive population growth following coyote arrival. Time since coyote arrival was not a significant predictor in any deer population models and our results indicate that coyotes are not controlling deer populations at a large spatial scale in eastern North America.

Feeding home ranges of pacific coast feeding group gray whales	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						anthropogenic risk; Eschrichtius robustus; gray whale; home ranges; Pacific Coast Feeding Group; satellite-telemetry	BALAENOPTERA-MUSCULUS; NORTH; OCEAN	There is a lack of detailed information about the range and habitat use of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) during their seasonal occupation off the Pacific Northwest (PNW) coast from northern California to southeast Alaska, USA. These data are important for management because of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., indigenous harvesting, fishing gear entanglements, ship strikes, naval exercises, siting of marine renewable energy facilities). We applied satellite tags to 35 gray whales in the eastern north Pacific (ENP) off the coasts of Oregon and northern California from September to December 2009, 2012, and 2013. These whales are members of the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG), a subset of gray whales in the ENP that feed off the PNW, during summer and fall. Tracking periods for the satellite-tagged whales in this study ranged from 3 days to 383 days. We applied a Bayesian switching state-space model (SSSM) to locations for each whale track to provide a regularized track with 2 estimated locations per day and associated movement behavior (either transiting or area-restricted searching [ARS]). We isolated the portion of the SSSM track in the feeding area for each whale by removing all southward and northward migration locations. We calculated home ranges (90% isopleths) and core areas (50% isopleths) for these non-migrating, feeding-area tracks with >50 SSSM locations using local convex hull utilization distributions. Feeding-area home ranges for the resulting 23 whales covered most of the near-shore waters from northern California to Icy Bay, Alaska, and ranged in size from 81 km(2) to 13,634 km(2). Core areas varied widely in size (11-3,976 km(2)) and location between individuals, with the highest-use areas off Point St. George in northern California, the central coast of Oregon, and the southern coast of Washington, USA. Nearshore waters off Point St. George were a hot spot for whales in the PCFG in late fall, close to where most of the whales were tagged; 19 whales had overlapping home ranges and 15 whales had overlapping core areas there. One whale, a male tracked for 383 days, did not migrate, spending the entire winter off Point St. George and the California-Oregon border. Residence times (portions of the track with a minimum of 3 successive locations in ARS behavioral mode) ranged from 1 day to 142.5 days; 19 whales had residencies >30 days in some areas. Because most of the whales in this study were tagged in the fall in the southern portion of the feeding area, off northern California, results are weighted toward fall and winter movements. Although some whales were tracked into the spring and summer, additional tagging earlier in the year and in more northerly locations would provide an even clearer picture of gray whale use of feeding areas in the PNW. Nevertheless, these results constitute valuable information about high-use areas for gray whales in this region, providing baseline home range data for future comparisons with regard to year-to-year variability, potential responses to climate change, and exposure to anthropogenic activities in the marine environment.

Age class dynamics of Canada geese in the central flyway	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						age class; Branta canadensis; Canada goose; Central Flyway; harvest; recovery; regulations; survival	RESIDENT POPULATION; HUNTING SEASONS; SURVIVAL; HARVEST; MOVEMENTS; MARK	Abundance of temperate-nesting Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in Central Flyway east-tier states (ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, USA) increased since the 1970s. Hunting regulations were liberalized since the mid-1990s in these states to increase harvest and reduce abundance of local populations. Because 2 age classes, juvenile and adult, are typically classified when banding, most dead-recovery band analyses of Canada geese have only considered 2 age classes to estimate survival and recovery probabilities, despite a delayed breeding life history. We evaluated recovery distributions and survival and recovery probabilities of Canada goose age classes (i.e., juvenile [first year], subadult [second and third year], and adult [>= fourth year]) among Central Flyway east-tier states relative to liberalized hunting regulations during 1990-2015. We also conducted simulations and evaluated bias in parameter estimates from 2-age-class dead-recovery models when a subadult age class was not modeled. Models including 3 age classes were more supported than models including only 2 age classes. Mean juvenile survival estimates among states from the top 2-age-class models were 9-50% greater than an equivalent 3-age-class model, whereas differences were less or negligible for adult survival (-4% to -1%), adult recovery (1-12%), and juvenile recovery (-3-6%). Geese were primarily recovered in the state they were banded (range among states = 59-86%), and 91% of all recoveries occurred in the Central Flyway east-tier states. Recovery distributions of subadults were broader and more northward than adults and juveniles. Recovery estimates (Brownie parameterization) of subadults among states (x over bar = 0.091 +/- 0.039 [SE] to 0.116 +/- 0.029) were also generally greater than adults (0.061 +/- 0.030 to 0.104 +/- 0.033) and juveniles (0.049 +/- 0.026 to 0.132 +/- 0.041). Survival estimates of adults (0.713 +/- 0.103 to 0.748 +/- 0.119) and subadults (0.621 +/- 0.197 to 0.801 +/- 0.154) exhibited some decrease through time concurrent with liberalized harvest regulations, but survival estimate of juveniles (0.492 +/- 0.093 to 0.686 +/- 0.164) increased or were stable. Of the 5 Central Flyway east-tier states, management actions to reduce local Canada goose populations were the most intensive in North Dakota and South Dakota, and these states had the greatest decrease in adult and subadult survival estimates. Our results provide some limited evidence that harvest regulations targeted at locally breeding Canada geese can affect their survival, have greatest effects when first implemented, and affect subadults from a broader spatial scale than adults and juveniles. More information is needed on how localized harvest regulations affect temperate-nesting Canada geese from other areas, particularly subadults and molt migrants, and, conversely, how such geese affect the ability to achieve management objectives at varying spatial scales. Lastly, to minimize bias when analyzing temperate-nesting Canada goose data, or other species with similar marking constraints and age-class structure, consideration should be given to evaluating >= 3 age classes and using recapture data and joint live-dead models when possible.

Urbanization and tick parasitism in birds of coastal southeastern Virginia	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						environmental constraint; foraging guild; host age; host sex; impervious surface	IXODES-SCAPULARIS ACARI; LAND-COVER CHANGE; LYME-DISEASE; BORRELIA-BURGDORFERI; BORNE PATHOGENS; HOST DIVERSITY; INFECTED TICKS; WILD BIRDS; IXODIDAE; URBAN	One of North America's major avian migratory pathways occurs along a large anthropogenically modified coastal region of southeastern Virginia, USA. Because hundreds of avian species migrate along the east coast of North America, understanding factors affecting birds and their health is of ecological and conservation interest. Within southeastern Virginia, 14 tick species have been documented, all of which may serve as vectors of vertebrate pathogens. We tested 5 hypotheses to understand how varying levels of urbanization within an urban matrix of a coastal region affected avian parasitism rates. We sampled resident and migratory birds for ticks across an urbanization gradient at 5 permanent and 6 ad hoc sites from August 2012 to August 2014 and determined parasitism rates at the landscape and site scales. At the landscape scale, the proportion of birds parasitized by ticks was reduced at more urbanized sites. Urbanized sites were largely associated with higher water and impervious surfaces in the surrounding area, which may have prevented dispersal of ticks or hosts to isolated urban locations, and lower tree cover, which likely reduced tick survival because of decreased leaf litter. At the site scale, properties associated with being on or near the ground (i.e., foraging guild and age) were the best predictors of tick parasitism. These findings demonstrate that the effects of urbanization are neither uniform nor straightforward. In addition to affecting avian species composition, anthropogenic changes to the landscape are affecting the relationship between avian hosts and their parasites, a finding that has important implications for avian conservation efforts and management practices.

The Debate About Bait: A Red Herring in Wildlife Research	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						animal movement; animal occurrence; attractants; bait; camera trap; Pekania pennanti; tortuosity	CAMERA-TRAP SURVEYS; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; ANIMAL MOVEMENTS; BEHAVIOR; RECOMMENDATIONS; CONSERVATION; MAMMALS; PATH	The use of bait (or attractants) to lure animals to a sampling site is common in wildlife research and important for optimizing species detection rates. The effect of bait on animal movement and space-use, however, is contested, fueled by concerns bait may affect animal movement and increase residency time. If founded, bait may bias parameter estimates from density, species distribution, resource selection, or behavioral models, produce spurious ecological inferences, and skew resulting management recommendations. To test whether animal movement varies with proximity to bait, we used high-resolution global positioning system telemetry data of 10 fishers (Pekania pennanti), temporally paired with 64 baited wildlife camera traps, to quantify the effect of bait on individual and population movement metrics. Although bait appeared to have a significant correlative effect on 1-hour movement segments, landscape characteristics had an effect 1.7 times greater, where the proportion of mixed forest and cultivation explained the majority of variability in animal movements. We contend that maximizing probability of detection and controlling or modeling local-scale landscape variability that could affect the probability of detection is a more important consideration in wildlife research than the effect of bait, which is eclipsed by differences incurred by natural habitat heterogeneity. Failing to maximize the probability of detection may obscure the modest bias potentially presented by the use of bait, or attractants, on ecological inference.

Population assignment reveals low migratory connectivity in a weakly structured songbird	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						ddRADseq; migratory connectivity; population assignment; population genetics; Protonotaria citrea; redundancy analysis	NEOTROPICAL MIGRANT; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; GENOMIC FOOTPRINTS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; WARBLER; LANDSCAPE; PATTERNS; MARKERS; CLIMATE; DNA	Understanding migratory connectivity is essential for determining the drivers behind population dynamics and for implementing effective conservation strategies for migratory species. Genetic markers provide a means to describe migratory connectivity; however, they can be uninformative for species with weak population genetic structure, which has limited their application. Here, we demonstrated a genomic approach to describing migratory connectivity in the prothonotary warbler, Protonotaria citrea, a Neotropical songbird of conservation concern. Using 26,189 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we revealed regional genetic structure between the Mississippi River Valley and the Atlantic Seaboard with overall weak genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST = 0.0055; 95% CI: 0.0051-0.0059). Genetic variation had a stronger association with geographic rather than environmental factors, with each explaining 14.5% and 8.2% of genetic variation, respectively. By varying the numbers of genomic markers used in population assignment models with individuals of known provenance, we identified a maximum assignment accuracy (89.7% to site, 94.3% to region) using a subset of 600 highly differentiated SNPs. We then assigned samples from nonbreeding sites to breeding region and found low migratory connectivity. Our results highlight the importance of filtering markers for informative loci in models of population assignment. Quantifying migratory connectivity for weakly structured species will be useful for expanding studies to a wider range of migratory species across taxonomic groups and may contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolution of migratory strategies.

Here, we use genomic data (restriction site-associated DNA sequencing) to test biologically informed models representing historical and contemporary demographic scenarios of population connectivity for the Iberian cross-backed grasshopper Dociostaurus hispanicus, a species with a narrow distribution that currently forms highly fragmented populations. All models incorporated biological aspects of the focal taxon that could hypothetically impact its geographical patterns of genomic variation, including (a) spatial configuration of impassable barriers to dispersal defined by topographic landscapes not occupied by the species; (b) distributional shifts resulting from the interaction between the species bioclimatic envelope and Pleistocene glacial cycles; and (c) contemporary distribution of suitable habitats after extensive land clearing for agriculture. Spatiotemporally explicit simulations under different scenarios considering these aspects and statistical evaluation of competing models within an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework supported spatial configuration of topographic barriers to dispersal and human-driven habitat fragmentation as the main factors explaining the geographical distribution of genomic variation in the species, with no apparent impact of hypothetical distributional shifts linked to Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Collectively, this study supports that both historical (i.e., topographic barriers) and contemporary (i.e., anthropogenic habitat fragmentation) aspects of landscape composition have shaped major axes of genomic variation in the studied species and emphasizes the potential of model-based approaches to gain insights into the temporal scale at which different processes impact the demography of natural populations.

Disease management at the wildlife-livestock interface: Using whole-genome sequencing to study the role of elk in Mycobacterium bovis transmission in Michigan, USA	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; bovine tuberculosis; interspecies transmission; spillover; whole genome sequencing; wildlife-livestock interface	WHITE-TAILED DEER; CERVUS-ELAPHUS; ONE HEALTH; TUBERCULOSIS; DYNAMICS; SURVEILLANCE; INFECTION; TIME; CATTLE; RATES	The role of wildlife in the persistence and spread of livestock diseases is difficult to quantify and control. These difficulties are exacerbated when several wildlife species are potentially involved. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, has experienced an ecological shift in Michigan, with spillover from cattle leading to an endemically infected white-tailed deer (deer) population. It has potentially substantial implications for the health and well-being of both wildlife and livestock and incurs a significant economic cost to industry and government. Deer are known to act as a reservoir of infection, with evidence of M. bovis transmission to sympatric elk and cattle populations. However, the role of elk in the circulation of M. bovis is uncertain; they are few in number, but range further than deer, so may enable long distance spread. Combining Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) for M. bovis isolates from exceptionally well-observed populations of elk, deer and cattle with spatiotemporal locations, we use spatial and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to show strong spatiotemporal admixture of M. bovis isolates. Clustering of bTB in elk and cattle suggests either intraspecies transmission within the two populations, or exposure to a common source. However, there is no support for significant pathogen transfer amongst elk and cattle, and our data are in accordance with existing evidence that interspecies transmission in Michigan is likely only maintained by deer. This study demonstrates the value of whole genome population studies of M. bovis transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface, providing insights into bTB management in an endemic system.

This large-scale invasion across a heterogeneous landscape allows examination of the genetic signatures of adaptation potentially associated with rapid geographical spread. We tested the hypothesis that spatially divergent natural selection has driven observed changes in three developmental traits that were measured in a common garden for 165 adult moths sampled from six populations across a latitudinal gradient covering the entirety of the range. We generated genotype data for 91,468 single nucleotide polymorphisms based on double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and used these data to discover genome-wide associations for each trait, as well as to test for signatures of selection on the discovered architectures. Genetic structure across the introduced range of gypsy moth was low in magnitude (F-ST = 0.069), with signatures of bottlenecks and spatial expansion apparent in the rare portion of the allele frequency spectrum. Results from applications of Bayesian sparse linear mixed models were consistent with the presumed polygenic architectures of each trait. Further analyses indicated spatially divergent natural selection acting on larval development time and pupal mass, with the linkage disequilibrium component of this test acting as the main driver of observed patterns. The populations most important for these signals were two range-edge populations established less than 30 generations ago. We discuss the importance of rapid polygenic adaptation to the ability of non-native species to invade novel environments.

Within Temnothorax ants, tandem-running is used within a variety of contexts, from foraging and nest relocation to-in the case of slavemaking species-slave raiding. Here, we elucidate the transcriptomic basis of scouting, tandem-leading and tandem-following behaviours across two species with divergent lifestyles: the slavemaking Temnothorax americanus and its primary, nonparasitic host T. longispinosus. Analysis of gene expression data from brains revealed that only a small number of unique differentially expressed genes are responsible for scouting and tandem-running. Comparison of orthologous genes between T. americanus and T. longispinosus suggests that tandem-running is characterized by species-specific patterns of gene usage. However, within both species, tandem-leaders showed gene expression patterns median to those of scouts and tandem-followers, which was expected, as leaders can be recruited from either of the other two behavioural states. Most importantly, a number of differentially expressed behavioural genes were found, with functions relating to learning and memory formation in other social and nonsocial insects. This includes a number of up-regulated receptor genes such as a glutamate and dopamine receptor, as well as serine/threonine-protein phosphatases and kinases. Learning and memory genes were specifically up-regulated within scouts and tandem-followers, not only reinforcing previous behavioural studies into how Temnothorax navigate novel environments and share information, but also providing insight into the molecular underpinnings of teaching and learning within social insects.

During daily mass raids with many thousand workers, army ants hunt live prey, likely exerting strong top-down control on prey species. Many tropical sites exhibit a high army ant species diversity (>20 species), suggesting that sympatric species partition the available prey niches. However, whether and to what extent this is achieved has not been intensively studied yet. We therefore conducted a large-scale diet survey of a community of surface-raiding army ants at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. We systematically collected 3,262 prey items from eleven army ant species (genera Eciton, Nomamyrmex and Neivamyrmex). Prey items were classified as ant prey or non-ant prey. The prey nearly exclusively consisted of other ants (98%), and most booty was ant brood (87%). Using morphological characters and DNA barcoding, we identified a total of 1,103 ant prey specimens to the species level. One hundred twenty-nine ant species were detected among the army ant prey, representing about 30% of the known local ant diversity. Using weighted bipartite network analyses, we show that prey specialization in army ants is unexpectedly high and prey niche overlap very small. Besides food niche differentiation, we uncovered a spatiotemporal niche differentiation in army ant raid activity. We discuss competition-driven multidimensional niche differentiation and predator-prey arms races as possible mechanisms underlying prey specialization in army ants. By combining systematic prey sampling with species-level prey identification and network analyses, our integrative approach can guide future research by portraying how predator-prey interactions in complex communities can be reliably studied, even in cases where morphological prey identification is infeasible.

Current damage estimations do not consider the uncertainties in a comprehensive way, and they are not consistent between spatial scales. Aggregated land use data are used at larger spatial scales, although detailed exposure data at the object level, such as openstreetmap.org , is becoming increasingly available across the globe. We present a probabilistic approach for object-based damage estimation which represents uncertainties and is fully scalable in space. The approach is applied and validated to company damage from the flood of 2013 in Germany. Damage estimates are more accurate compared to damage models using land use data, and the estimation works reliably at all spatial scales. Therefore, it can as well be used for pre-event analysis and risk assessments. This method takes hydrometeorological damage estimation and risk assessments to the next level, making damage estimates and their uncertainties fully scalable in space, from object to country level, and enabling the exploitation of new exposure data.

Plant trait variation along environmental indicators to infer global change impacts	FLORA			English	Article						Plant global spectrum; Ecological gradients; Landolt; Climate change; Land use change	COMMUNITY-LEVEL; LEAF-SIZE; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEMS; GRADIENTS; RESPONSES; PATTERNS	One of the key principles for modeling future impacts of anthropogenic and climate changes on vegetation is to identify clear patterns and trends between plant functional traits and ecological drivers. The global spectrum of plant form and function outlines the major axes of variation and coordination among plant traits. We hypothesized that inter-specific plant trait variation at the regional scale should match axes of plant adaptation highlighted by the global spectrum, and that plant trait-environmental associations should be evident over ranges of environmental indicators corresponding to key drivers of future climate and land use changes in Southern Europe. To test our hypotheses, we analyzed a sample of 1095 plant species from Northern Italy, also characteristic of Southern European vegetation. We analyzed trends for four plant traits (canopy height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content) along meso- (temperature, continentality) and micro-climatic (light) ranges, as well as along soil ranges (moisture, reaction and nutrient content), by means of Landolt's environmental indicators. At the regional scale, the inter-specific variation of mean plant traits over ranges of environmental indicators confirmed the main axes of plant adaptation emphasized by the plant global spectrum. Leaf area and specific leaf area showed the largest sensitivity over ranges of all environmental indicators, while canopy heights were the most responsive to temperature values. Temperature, light conditions and nutrients were associated with clear effects on plant traits, underlining that responses to changes in land use and increased soil nutrient loading (sudden and abrupt changes) could trigger and strengthen responses to climate alteration (gradual changes). Scenarios for the next few decades in Southern Europe indicate increased temperature, nutrient availability and forest coverage that, according to our findings, will favor more 'acquisitive and fast growing' plants, also represented by subtropical invasive species.

The question whether plant responses to changing precipitation are species-specific, or change over entire plant communities is still controversial. Our study focussed on intraspecific changes in the plant traits canopy height, plant width, specific leaf area, chlorophyll fluorescence, performance index, and individual biomass of three congeneric species pairs with changing precipitation in Mongolian rangelands, covering a gradient from the desert to the forest steppes. Using this trait data set, we focussed on three questions: (i) Is the replacement of congeneric species along an environmental gradient also reflected in their trait values? (ii) Can intraspecific trait variation patterns be derived from patterns in species abundances, i.e., are trait values optimal where species are most abundant? (iii) Is the within-population trait variability lowest in populations growing under very dry conditions, i.e., under highest environmental stress, caused by stronger filtering? We tested the responses of the six traits to changing precipitation according to species' identity and abundance. We found unimodal relationships between most of the species' traits and precipitation, and strong associations between species abundances and trait values, but not for all investigated species. Trait variability did not significantly differ between populations from different positions along the precipitation gradient. Our results highlight that species show multiple or even opposite trait responses along the precipitation gradient. It thus remains challenging to predict how plant distributions will shift under changing environmental conditions based on their trait composition.

Yet, there are few formal and robust quantification of such associations, which seriously impedes our capacity to predict how ecological systems respond to global changes, including climate. This study was designed to assess how differences in environmental conditions affect plant form and function in a wide array of species. Twelve traits were measured on 40 species in three Mediterranean sites differing in drought conditions. Some species being common among sites, 78 species belonging to four major Raunkiaer life form categories were studied. These traits correspond to: (i) plant size: vegetative and maximum plant height, (ii) seed mass, (iii) leaf morpho-anatomical traits: leaf area, specific leaf area, dry matter content and thickness, (iv) leaf chemical composition: mass based nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon contents, and carbon isotopic fraction. On average, there was a shift in the phenotypic space towards more resource conservative and taller species in the drier sites. These changes were not always consistent for hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes on the one hand, and for phanerophytes on the other hand. This is interpreted as different species responding to different aspects of complex changes in environmental factors. Intraspecific trait variation differed among species, and was lower than interspecific variation. Changes in site-average trait values were therefore mostly driven by species turnover among sites. The traits selected do not respond strongly to the differences in environmental conditions however, resulting in a moderate shift in the phenotypic space between sites. We argue that traits more directly related to plant water economy should be considered for an improved description of plant phenotypic response to the environmental factors at stake. The implications for the prediction of plant responses to climate changes likely to occur in the Mediterranean Region are discussed.

On the relevance of intraspecific trait variability-A synthesis of 56 dry grassland sites across Europe	FLORA			English	Article						Within population trait variability; Between population trait variability; n-dimensional trait niche; Dry grasslands; Climate-trait relationships; Hypervolumes	PLANT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; SEED MASS; DIVERSITY; GRADIENTS; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS; RESPONSES; HANDBOOK; LEAVES	The intraspecific plant trait variability (ITV) is key for many ecological processes, but large-scale analysis of co-occurring species are rare. Here we studied ITV of 14 plant traits for five co-occurring species across 56 European dry grassland sites - large parts of the species distribution ranges. We evaluated variation in ITV relative to between species trait variability (BTV) with a particular emphasis on how within versus between population variability contributes to ITV. We performed this analysis trait by trait (univariate) and by considering hypervolumes in the multi-variate trait space. We also tested whether climatic variables can be used to predict between population variation in traits. For the trait by trait analysis, for 9 out of 14 traits ITV exceeded BTV, which suggests an extraordinary large role of ITV. However, when considering all traits jointly the hypervolume occupied by ITV was only 23% of overall trait variability. We found comparatively small effects of within population variability in the uni- as well as in the multivariate analysis decreasing rapidly with increasing number of considered traits. The dominance of between population variability suggests that ITV is mainly driven by environmental effects rather than local biotic interactions and microsite effects. ITV of leaf chemical traits was related to precipitation and growing degree days until sampling ITV can be substantial compared to BTV, in particular when considering single traits, such that ITV should be considered in trait-based research. Since the importance of ITV appears to decrease when considering multiple traits jointly, using species mean trait values is more appropriate for multi-variate trait analysis. Because ITV varied mainly between populations rather than within populations, and was related to climatic conditions, we suggest that ITV could be accounted for in future trait based research by including environmental covariates in hierarchical models of trait variation	[Tautenhahn, S.; Gruen-Wenzel, C.; Roemermann, C.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Ecol & Systemat, Plant Biodivers, Philosophenweg 16, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Tautenhahn, S.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Funct Biogeog Grp, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Jung, M.] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Model Data Integrat Grp Grp, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Higgins, S.] Univ Bayreuth, Chair Plant Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Roemermann, C.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Halle, Germany	Tautenhahn, S (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Funct Biogeog Grp, Hans Knoll Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.	staut@bgc-jena.mpg.de	Higgins, Steven I/A-5138-2012	Higgins, Steven I/0000-0001-5695-9665	DFG [RO3842/1-1, RO3842/3-1]; TRY initiative on plant traits; DIVERSITAS/Future Earth; German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig	We are thankful to all cooperating scientists for support in field work and site selection in the different countries.

Functional responses of four Sahelian tree species to resource availability	FLORA			English	Article						Plant functional traits; Phenotypic plasticity; Relative growth rate; Root-to-shoot ratio; Specific leaf area; Resource-Use strategies; Water and nutrient availability	RELATIVE GROWTH-RATE; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; TROPICAL DRY FOREST; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; SEEDLING GROWTH; ROOT MORPHOLOGY; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; MINERAL-NUTRITION; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; SEASONAL DROUGHT	Plants experience a fluctuating environment in time and space that affects resource supply. As human impacts on the environment directly and indirectly alter resource availability, it is important to address plant responses to changing resources to be able to anticipate impacts of these changes on plant communities. We analyzed plant traits to assess responses to resource limitation in four Sahelian tree species of wide ecological and socio-economic importance. We used species already adapted to harsh conditions (high temperatures, low rainfall) to anticipate how climate change could affect their growth patterns and, indirectly, their spatial distribution and the services they provide. Seedlings grew under two levels of water and nutrient additions in a factorial design. Our results showed differences among species, watering regimes, and nutrient supply in three key functional traits related to the plant's resource-use strategy, relative growth rate (RGR), root-to-shoot ratio (R/S), and specific leaf area (SLA). On average, RGR was responsive to the amount of water and nutrients, with species with high RGR showing the largest response to resource supply. RGR in the species with a conservative resource-use strategy (evergreen leaves, lowest RGR) remained unchanged with different levels of water and nutrients. Overall, large RGR was supported by large SLA. All species allocated more biomass to roots than to shoots, particularly under low resource supply, reflecting adaptive strategies to keep RGR leveled to resource supply. Not all species showed similar plasticity in their functional traits responses; however, Acacia tortilis and Faidherbia albida showed the greatest plasticity, which may explain their large geographical distribution range in Africa. Our data suggest that the different Sahelian species will respond differently to future environmental changes, likely affecting their geographical distribution, the structure of plant communities, and the services they provide.

The objective of this study was to identify metabolic variations associated with exposure to 2,2'4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (PBB-153) and 2,2'4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) in two generations of participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry (http://pbbregistry.emory.edu/). Untargeted, high-resolution metabolomic profiling of plasma collected from 156 individuals was completed using liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry. PBB-153 and PCB-153 levels were measured in the same individuals using targeted gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and tested for dose-dependent correlation with the metabolome. Biological response to these exposures were evaluated using identified endogenous metabolites and pathway enrichment. When compared to lipid-adjusted concentrations for adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for years 2003-2004, PCB-153 levels were consistent with similarly aged individuals, whereas PBB-153 concentrations were elevated (p < 0.0001) in participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry. Metabolic alterations were correlated with PBB-153 and PCB-153 in both generations of participants, and included changes in pathways related to catecholamine metabolism, cellular respiration, essential fatty acids, lipids and polyamine metabolism. These pathways were consistent with pathophysiological changes observed in neurodegenerative disease and included previously identified metabolomic markers of Parkinson's disease. To determine if the metabolic alterations detected in this study are replicated other cohorts, we evaluated correlation of PBB-153 and PCB-153 with plasma fatty acids measured in NHANES. Both pollutants showed similar associations with fatty acids previously linked to PCB exposure. Thus, the results from this study show metabolic alterations correlated with PBB-153 and PCB-153 exposure can be detected in human populations and are consistent with health outcomes previously reported in epidemiological and mechanistic studies.

Zerovalent iron-sand filtration can reduce the concentration of multiple antimicrobials in conventionally treated reclaimed water	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Antimicrobial; Filtration; Irrigation; Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; Reclaimed water; Zerovalent iron	ZERO-VALENT IRON; PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; WASTE-WATER; DRINKING-WATER; PLANT UPTAKE; ANTIBIOTICS; REMOVAL; MUNICIPAL; TRANSFORMATION; TRICLOCARBAN	Irrigation with reclaimed water is increasing in areas that lack access to, and infrastructure for, high-level treatment and distribution. Antimicrobial residues are known to persist in conventionally treated reclaimed water, necessitating the investigation of reuse site-based mitigation options to further reduce these contaminants. We examined the effectiveness of a 50:50 volume/volume, particle matched, micro-scale zerovalent iron (ZVI)-sand filter in reducing concentrations of mixtures of antimicrobials present in pH-unadjusted conventionally treated reclaimed water. Twelve antimicrobials (azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, linezolid, oxacillin, oxolinic acid, penicillin G, pipemidic acid, sulfamethoxazole, triclocarban, tetracycline and vancomycin) were quantified using high performance-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in reclaimed water, and ZVI-sand filtered reclaimed water, in a two-month long greenhouse-based experiment. Data were analyzed using a non-parametric rank-based approach. ZVI-sand filtration significantly reduced concentrations of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, oxolinic acid, penicillin G, sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, pipemidic acid and vancomycin. Azithromycin, the antimicrobial with the highest median concentration (320 ng/L), was reduced to below the limit of detection after ZVI-sand filtration. Inorganic element (antimony, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, iron, lead, selenium and thallium) and water quality (free and total chlorine, nitrates, nitrites, pH and total dissolved solids) analyses showed that ZVI-sand filtered reclaimed water quality (nitrate, salinity, and inorganic elements) met the recommended guidelines for agricultural irrigation with reclaimed water. Based on our initial results, ZVI-sand filtration may be a promising basis for a point-of-use filtration system for reclaimed water irrigation on small-scale farms.

Our main objective was to investigate whether associations between biomarkers for prenatal MeHg exposure and maternal gut microbiota differed between early and late gestation. Methods: Maternal blood and stool samples were collected during early (8.3-17 weeks, n = 28) and late (27-36 weeks, n = 24) gestation. Total mercury and MeHg concentrations were quantified in biomarkers, and inorganic mercury was estimated by subtraction. The diversity and structure of the gut microbiota were investigated using 16S rRNA gene profiling (n = 52). Biomarkers were dichotomized, and diversity patterns were compared between high/low mercury concentrations. Spearman's correlation was used to assess bivariate associations between MeHg biomarkers (stool, blood, and meconium), and 23 gut microbial taxa (genus or family level, > 1% average relative abundance). Results: Within-person and between-person diversity patterns in gut microbiota differed between early/late gestation. The overall composition of the microbiome differed between high/low MeHg concentrations (in blood and stool) during early gestation, but not late gestation. Ten (of 23) taxa were significantly correlated with MeHg biomarkers (increasing or decreasing); however, associations differed, depending on whether the sample was collected during early or late gestation. A total of 43% of associations (69/161) reversed the direction of correlation between early/late gestation. Conclusions: The time point at which a maternal fecal sample is collected may yield different associations between gut microorganisms and MeHg biomarkers, which may be due in part to remodeling of maternal microbiota during pregnancy. Our results suggest the effectiveness of dietary interventions to reduce prenatal MeHg exposure may differ between early and late gestation.

Biological C, N, and P releases from soil organic matter by enzymes are essential components for biogeochemical cycles and are sensitive to the climate in drylands. However, how the ecoenzymatic C:N:P stoichiometry responds to environmental factors (i.e., climatic and edaphic factors) over broad geographical scales remains largely unclear. We examined the patterns of ecoenzymatic C:N:P ratios across a 3,700-km aridity gradient (0.43 < aridity < 0.97) in northern China. In wetter sites (aridity < 0.70), the relative C:N:P acquisition ratios via enzymes remained relatively constant with increasing aridity. In contrast, in drier sites (aridity > 0.70), the enzymatic C: nutrient (N and P) ratios declined as the aridity increased, while the enzymatic P:N ratios were mostly lower than those in the wetter sites. In drier sites with low C availability, the increasing carbon use efficiency and the increasing proportion of C converted to biomass (than the proportion of respiration) contributed to the declines of the enzymatic C:nutrient ratios as the aridity increased. The overall lower enzymatic P:N ratios were related to the higher soil P availability compared with N availability (higher organic P and lower soil NH4+:available P ratios) in drier sites. Overall, our findings indicate that intrinsic linkages of biological C, N, and P acquisitions and cycles were broken at the aridity threshold of 0.70, with higher acquisition efforts for N and P (particularly for N) with increasing aridity in drier sites with aridity > 0.70.

Consequently, there is a need to explain how dioecious and bisexual species coexist. Increased mean individual seed mass, fecundity, and population density have all been proposed as attributes of unisexual individuals or populations that may contribute to the persistence or resilience of dioecious species. To date, no studies have compared sympatric dioecious and cosexual species with respect to all three components of fitness. In this study, we sought evidence for these compensatory advantages (higher seed mass, greater seed production per unit basal area, and higher population density) in dioecious species. Location Five 20-25 ha forest dynamic plots spanning a latitudinal gradient in China, including two temperate, two subtropical, and one tropical forest. Methods We used a phylogenetically corrected generalized linear modelling approach to assess the phylogenetic dependence and joint evolution of sexual system, seed mass and production, and ecological abundances among 48-333 species and 32,568-136,237 individuals per forest. Results Across all five forests, we detected no consistent advantage for dioecious relative to sympatric cosexual species with respect to mean individual seed mass, seed production or the density of stems in any size class. Conclusions Our study suggests that seed traits may provide compensatory mechanisms in some forests, but most often the coexistence of sexual systems cannot be explained by advantages of dioecy related to seed quality and demographic parameters. Future investigations of the factors that promote coexistence may increase our understanding by expanding the search to include attributes such as lifespan and tolerance or resistance to herbivores.

Alternate successional pathway yields alternate pattern of functional diversity	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						community assembly; functional dispersion; functional homogenization; heath; succession; trait filtering	SPRUCE PICEA-MARIANA; PLANT DIVERSITY; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; TRAIT SPACE; BOREAL; TEMPERATE; COMMUNITIES; DISTURBANCE; OCCUPANCY; FRAMEWORK	Question In Eastern Canada, wildfires turn Picea mariana forests into Kalmia angustifolia dominated heath or P. mariana forest depending on burn severity. These alternate end-points of succession provide an opportunity to test assumptions concerning alternate successional trajectories dominated by distinct plant functional groups. Disturbance effects on functional diversity (FD) have been studied largely in single post-disturbance communities, but rarely applied to alternate successional pathways. Do post-fire Kalmia heaths have lower FD than forest communities, and does heath formation select for a narrow range of traits leading to biotic homogenization? Location Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland, Canada. Methods Based on five functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, seed mass, height, specific root length), we measured functional trait dispersion within (alpha FD) and between sites (beta FD). We calculated overall FD metrics in nine heath and four forest sites as well as metrics for three functional groups (trees, shrubs, and herbs) in each site. We also performed a complementary taxonomic diversity (TD) analysis to establish links between FD and TD. Results We could not detect a difference in overall alpha TD between the two successional communities but found significant loss of alpha and beta FD in heaths and within tree and herb groups. Overall beta FD was lower in heaths than forests. It was also lower for trees and herbs, indicating an increase in functional similarity (functional homogenization) of the majority of life forms. Conclusions Between the two successional pathways, trait space occupancy was lower in heaths than forests. Heath formation in post-fire communities consistently restricts functional dispersion (low alpha FD) of tree and herb traits leading to functional homogenization (low beta FD). When a successional trajectory leads to heath formation, it is accompanied by a loss of functional diversity.

Drivers of plant richness patterns of Mediterranean riparian forests at local and regional scales have bottom-up and top-down effects	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						community; diversity; modeling; riverbank; scales; SEM; southwestern Europe; species pool	SPECIES RICHNESS; COMMUNITY DIVERSITY; PRUNUS-LUSITANICA; VEGETATION; LANDSCAPE; CLIMATE; WOODY; RIVER; ENVIRONMENT; DISTURBANCE	Questions It has been long recognized that community species richness depends on factors operating at different spatial scales. Most frequently, across-scale studies have focused on the impact of regional factors on local richness (top-down effects) while few have analyzed the importance of local factors on regional richness (bottom-up) and even fewer have tried to integrate effects on both directions. Our objectives were to reveal the key factors shaping plant species richness of Mediterranean riparian forests and to test whether empirical models based on top-down or bottom-up relationships are able to explain the spatial scaling of richness.

Methods We designed two structural equation models integrating relationships between biotic and abiotic variables at two spatial scales, local and regional. Our models incorporated observed richness of 689 riparian woody communities. Results Local-scale richness depended mostly on local climate, lithology and sediment textures. Regional species richness was driven by climate, lithology and water regime. In the top-down model, regional to local effects were driven mostly by the influence of regional richness on local richness. However, we also detected several bottom-up effects linking local climate, abiotic habitat and vegetation structure with the regional richness. In the bottom-up model, results were very similar, adding an effect of regional climate on local richness. Conclusions Local, regional and across-scales factors are crucial for understanding species richness of Mediterranean riparian forests. Some factors are inherent to riparian habitats whereas others are already known as relevant for upland habitats. We provide support for the top-down models relying on the concepts of species pool and environmental filtering. However, we also stress that local-scale processes influence regional species richness. Bottom-up effects should not be underestimated when studying the spatial scaling of biodiversity.

(d) Is alien species occurrence linked to small-scale functional homogenization effects on the resident native species? Location N-Adriatic coastal ecosystems (Marano and Grado lagoon, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy). Methods We sampled coastal vegetation within two habitats (foredunes and saltmarshes) along nine belt transects in two sampling sites. Plant species richness and abundance were assessed in 128 plots along with a suite of plant functional traits. We tested for differences in community-weighted means between native and alien species within the two habitats, and Linear Mixed Models provided insights into traits fostering the invasion success among alien species. To check for potential functional homogenization driven by alien species invasion, we explored functional diversity patterns of native and alien species (beta and gamma functional diversity) and the relationship between alpha functional diversity and alien cover. Results Alien species had lower functional diversity than natives and were characterized by lower leaf construction costs coupled with lower drought resistance and higher water transport efficiency. The most abundant aliens were the ones minimizing carbon investment for leaf construction. In addition, we also found evidence for small-scale functional homogenization driven by alien invasion. Conclusions Our results suggested that native species adopt a resource conservative strategy whereas alien species are characterized by a higher resource acquisition capacity (i.e., acquisitive strategy). Our data also confirmed that alien species are less functionally diverse than natives, potentially driving the community towards small-scale functional homogenization, resulting in a loss of species and a reduction in the functional space.

Hence, they influence the composition and structure of plant communities. Since evidence strongly suggests that they are important filters operating in the system, we asked if fire, flood intensity, and their interaction could be related to variation in the functional traits of studied trees. Study Site Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods We sampled 14 individuals (totaling 280) of the 20 most representative trees in 24 forest patches along the flooding gradient and measured functional traits related to allocation of resources and protection in response to these filters. We also assessed leaf and soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels. Results Along the flooding gradient, the studied tree species showed a tendency toward decreasing specific leaf area (SLA), as well as leaf nitrogen concentrations, whereas leaf thickness and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) increased. In burned areas, LDMC and leaf nitrogen exhibited the opposite tendency and decreased along the flooding gradient. Leaf thickness (LT) showed less increase in burned areas, while SLA had less decrease. Relative Bark Thickness (RBT) increased along the flooding gradient only after fire. Soil nitrogen decreased along the flooding gradient without an effect of fire. Conclusions Since LDMC is a proxy of flammability, the probability of burning decreases after each fire event, while the most flooded environments become less fire-prone. In burned environments, the differences in the allocation of resources (SLA and LT) diminish along the flooding gradient, indicating that leaf behavior is almost the same post-fire. RBT increases with increased flooding only after a fire, contributing to oxygen exchange during floods to protect the bark against fire. The interaction between fire and flood causes tree species to invest in structures for protection and resistance to fire, as well as retain nutrients.

(b) Which plant traits characterize species dispersed by geese? (c) Which plant communities are likely to benefit from endozoochory by geese? Location Three Swedish Baltic archipelagos. Methods Goose droppings were collected on 45 islands. Plants germinating from the droppings represent the endozoochorous species pool (ESP). On 108 islands, the presence of vascular plants was recorded in each habitat. These species represent the island species pool (ISP). Differences in functional traits between ESP and ISP were expressed as effect sizes and tested using meta-regressions. Using indicator species analyses and indicator species for managed semi-natural grasslands, we identified the primary habitats of the ESP. Results Geese dispersed viable diaspores of 97 plant species, which represents 22% of the ISP. Most ESP species were typical for small islands. Geese dispersed a higher proportion of graminoids and less woody plants, higher proportions of chamaephytes and therophytes and less phanerophytes; annuals and bi-annuals were significantly overrepresented. On average, seed volume of the ESP was 95% smaller than that of the ISP. About 51% of all ESP species were dispersed in at least two archipelagos. Geese showed a bias towards species of rocky shore habitats. Conclusion Geese potentially disperse large amounts of diaspores of many terrestrial island plant species. Through their feeding behaviour, geese select species with certain suites of traits from the regional species pool. Plant dispersal by geese may benefit plants species of rocky shores, but species of formerly managed semi-natural grasslands may also find refuge sites on epilittoral shores after goose-mediated dispersal. The relative importance of geese as dispersal vectors may increase under on-going land-use changes and cessation of grazing networks.

Although the benefits of conspicuous colours for social signalling are well documented, evidence for their ecological cost, especially for dynamic colours, remains limited. We examined the riskiness of colour patterns of Psammophilus dorsalis, a species in which males express distinct colour combinations during social interactions. We first measured the conspicuousness of these colour patterns on different substrates based on the visual systems of conspecifics and predators (bird, snake, canid) and then quantified actual predation risk on these patterns using wax/polymer lizard models in the wild. The black and red male state exhibited during courtship was the most conspicuous to all visual systems, while the yellow and orange male aggression state and the brown female colour were least conspicuous. Models bearing the courtship colour pattern experienced the highest predator attacks, irrespective of the substrate they were placed on. Thus, social colours of males are not only conspicuous but also risky. Using physiological colours to shift in and out of conspicuous states may be an effective evolutionary solution to balance social signalling benefits with predation costs.

Their signature gigantism is thought to be a relatively recent phenomenon, resulting from a Plio-Pleistocene mode shift in their body size evolution. Here, we report the largest whale fossil ever described: an Early Pleistocene (1.5-1.25 Ma) blue whale from Italy with an estimated body length of up to 26 m. Macroevolutionary modelling taking into account this specimen, as well as additional material from the Miocene of Peru, reveals that the proposed mode shift occurred either somewhat earlier, or perhaps not at all. Large-sized mysticetes comparable to most extant species have existed since at least the Late Miocene, suggesting a long-term impact on global marine ecosystems.

We assembled a tripartite fungi-plant-disperser network in the Gorongosa National Park-Mozambique, to test (1) if diversity and importance of plant mutualists above- and belowground are correlated, and (2) whether biotically and abiotically dispersed plants are associated with distinct arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We quantified seed dispersal by animals for 1 year and characterized the AMF of 26 common plant species. Sixteen plant species were dispersed by 15 animals and colonized by 48 AMF virtual taxa (VT), while the remaining 10 plant species were not dispersed by animals and associated with 34 AMF VT. We found no evidence for a correlation between the number of plant partners above-and belowground or on plant specialization on both types of partners. We also found no evidence for differentiation of AMF communities between biotically and abiotically dispersed plants. Our results suggest that the establishmYent of plant interactions with seed dispersers and mycorrhizal fungi is largely independent and that both biotically and abiotically dispersed plants seem to associate with similar communities of AMF.

Increases in local richness (alpha-diversity) following invasion are offset by biotic homogenization in a biodiversity hotspot	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						biodiversity change; invasion impact; beta-diversity; Cerrado; species richness	BETA-DIVERSITY; IMPACTS; PLANTS; METAANALYSIS; COMMUNITIES; CERRADO; TIME	The world's ecosystems are experiencing unparalleled rates of biodiversity change, with invasive species implicated as one of the drivers that restructure local assemblages. Here we focus on the processes leading to biodiversity change in a biodiversity hotspot, the Brazilian Cerrado. The null expectation that invasion leads to increase in local species richness is supported by our investigation of the grass layer in two key habitats (campo sujo and campo umido). Our analysis uncovered a linear relationship between total richness and invasive richness at the plot level. However, because the invasive species-even though few in number-are widespread, their contribution to local richness (alpha-diversity) is offset by their homogenizing influence on composition (beta-diversity). We thus identify a mechanism that can help explain the paradox that species richness is not declining in many local assemblages, yet compositional change is exceeding the predictions of ecological theory. As such, our results emphasize the importance of quantifying both alpha-diversity and beta-diversity in assessments of biodiversity change in the contemporary world.

Fear-induced behavioural modifications in damselfishes can be diver-triggered	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Diver disturbance; Fish behaviour; Stegastes fuscus; Territoriality	CORAL COLONY SIZE; REEF FISHES; TERRITORIAL DAMSELFISH; BENTHIC ORGANISMS; TROPHIC STRUCTURE; ANIMAL BEHAVIOR; HABITAT USE; TOURISM; DETERMINANTS; COMMUNITIES	Fear is a short-term response arisen from the way an animal perceives its environment when some threat makes it insecure. Thus, the risk perception of predation shapes the cost-benefit decisions associated with food and safety in animal communities. Even non-consumptive human-related activities such as ecotourism may influence species behavioural traits. Marine wildlife tourism might produce different impacts on organisms, stressing and modifying (directly or indirectly) species behaviour, physiology and habitat use. Understand the effects of human presence on site-attached fish' behaviour is crucial to elucidate how dive-tourism could shape their limited-range seascape. Given the importance of the territorial damselfishes as reef farmers and 'ecosystems engineers', here we investigated if the presence of SCUBA divers and snorkelers can disrupt the foraging and territorial defence of the Dusky damselfish, Stegastes fuscus. Experimental approaches (diver presence and absence) were applied in 30 territories of S. fuscus using underwater remote video cameras. Behavioural responses were analysed by considering the frequency of refuge, foraging and chase behaviours. Both recreational dive activities had an analogous role in frighten and disturb the Dusky damselfish activities. Considering the frequency of behaviours displayed in diver's absence vs presence, S. fuscus increased its refuge times from approximately 2% to 50% on SCUBA diver presence and from 9% to 43% in snorkeler presence. It is directly linked to the missed feeding opportunities, which reduced by half during both diver's presence. Damselfish's aggressiveness proportionally dropped (0.3%) during SCUBA diver presence but increased (2.4%) while snorkeler was present. However, the average frequency of chase behaviour reduced with both divers' approach. Interruptions in damselfish behaviour may modify the resource monopolization and productivity inside their territories, affecting its relationships with other species beyond the boundaries of their territoriality, and leading a possible change on its functional role in the reef community. Territorial reef fish behaviour and their relationship with divers' presence can provide a more holistic comprehension regarding the seascape of fear concept and could be useful as an indicator of human disturbances.

Most of the species that have such migratory polymorphism switch their osmoregulatory mechanism in synchrony with the timing of migration, but in G. petschiliensis it is known that even individuals living in freshwater areas behaviourally prefer brackish water to freshwater conditions in a laboratory. To clarify whether this species lives in freshwater areas with high osmoregulatory cost, the relationship between physiological cost and salinity was investigated using adult fish of the species captured in a freshwater area. Adults were kept individually in 13 L tanks with various salinity levels under fasted conditions. Their loss of body weight in freshwater conditions was more rapid than in 2/3 seawater, whereas the frequencies of horizontal and vertical movement in 13 L tanks did not differ significantly between freshwater and 2/3 seawater conditions. This suggests that the weight loss reflects not behavioural performance but physiological cost. In addition, no adults died even when transferred from freshwater to seawater conditions, indicating that they have high tolerance to salinity change in estuarine areas even after migrating to freshwater areas. These results support the hypothesis that G. petschiliensis migrates to freshwater areas while maintaining high hypo-osmoregulatory ability and paying a high physiological cost. Because G. petschiliensis phylogenetically originates from the coastal species, this example of migration without completely switching the osmoregulatory mechanism may help us to understand the diverse processes of up-stream migration in marine fish.

Growth of pioneer beach plants is strongly driven by buried macroalgal wrack, whereas macroinvertebrates affect plant nutrient dynamics	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Wrack; Talitrus saltator; Cakile maritima; Elytrigia juncea; Beach pioneer vegetation; Nutrient cycling	ANNUALS CAKILE-MARITIMA; EXPOSED SANDY BEACHES; SEAGRASS WRACK; SALSOLA-KALI; DECOMPOSITION; MACROFAUNA; ECOLOGY; FOOD; COLONIZATION; GERMINATION	Sandy beach food webs depend heavily upon marine organic input, such as macroalgae, as internal organic matter productivity is low. The fate, however, of this marine organic material (termed wrack) after being deposited onto the beach and its relation to pioneer vegetation, consisting of annual and perennial beach plants, needs to be further elucidated. In particular, the effect of various drivers, such as wrack burial and macro invertebrate presence, on wrack decomposition is largely unknown on sandy beaches. Also, the subsequent effects of decomposition-driven nitrogen and phosphorus availability on beach pioneer plant growth are not yet understood. We performed a mesocosm experiment manipulating Fucus vesiculosus wrack access to the supratidal amphipod Talitrus saltator, and used Cakile maritima and Elytrigia juncea as phytometers to estimate decomposition-driven, wrack-derived nutrient supply. Buried wrack had a strong positive effect (2-3 fold increase) on plant mass, N and P content of C. maritima compared to surface wrack, while effects on E. juncea were largely absent. In addition, macroinvertebrate-facilitated decomposition was important for increasing nutrient availability, but this did not result in an increase in plant growth. We conclude that the burial of wrack by a thin layer of sand is a crucial driver of beach pioneer plant growth, which is most likely due to an increase in moisture availability. This supports the importance of management practices that allow deposited wrack to remain and be buried on the sandy beach for a long period of time, which will have positive effects on beach pioneer plant growth and possibly embryo dune formation.

Sea turtles have temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) and variation in the thermal reaction norm, which influences offspring sex ratio, has been suggested as a potential adaptive mechanism to rising global temperatures. Here, we investigate the sex ratio of green turtle Chelonia mydas offspring from nests on beaches with notable differences in their thermal properties, to look for evidence of localised adaptation. We compared pivotal temperatures and hatch success in both the laboratory and in situ using eggs laid on two nesting beaches (dark vs. pale sand) at Ascension Island that represent the extremes of the range of incubation temperatures experienced by this population. We found no effect of beach of origin on pivotal temperatures, hatch success, or hatchling size in the laboratory or the wild. This suggests that turtles from the same rookery are not locally adapted to different thermal conditions experienced during incubation. Under predicted climate change scenarios, this will result in reduced hatch success and an increased proportion of female offspring unless temporal or spatial range shifts occur.

Owing to their remoteness, however, ecological key-processes are less understood as in the tropical lowlands. Remote sensing allows modeling of variables related to spatial patterns of carbon stocks and fluxes (e.g., biomass) and ecosystem functioning (e.g., functional leaf traits). However, at a landscape scale most studies conducted so far are based on airborne remote sensing data which is often available only locally and for one time-point. In contrast, multispectral satellites at moderate spectral and spatial resolutions are able to provide spatially continuous and repeated observations. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of Landsat-8 imagery in modeling tropical montane forest biomass, its productivity and selected canopy traits. Topographical, spectral and textural metrics were derived as predictors. To train and validate the models, in-situ data was sampled in 54 permanent plots in forests of southern Ecuador distributed within three study sites at 1000 m, 2000 m and 3000 m a.s.l. We used partial least squares regressions to model and map all response variables. Along the whole elevation gradient biomass and productivity models explained 31%, 43%, 69% and 63% of variance in aboveground biomass, annual wood production, fine litter production and aboveground net primary production, respectively. Regression models of canopy traits measured as community weighted means explained 62%, 78%, 65% and 65% of variance in leaf toughness, specific leaf area, foliar N concentration, and foliar P concentration, respectively. Models at single study sites hardly explained variation in aboveground biomass and the annual wood production indicating that these measures are mainly determined by the change of forest types along with elevation. In contrast, the models of fine litter production and canopy traits explained between 8%-85% in variation depending on the study site. We found spectral metrics, in particular a vegetation index using the red and the green band to provide complementary information to topographical metrics. The model performances for estimating leaf toughness, biochemical canopy traits and related fine litter production all improved when adding spectral information. Our findings therefore revealed that differences in fine litter production and canopy traits in our study area are driven by local changes in vegetation edaphically induced by topography. We conclude that Landsat-derived metrics are useful in modeling fine litter production and biochemical canopy traits, in a topographically and ecologically complex tropical montane forest.

Paradoxically, in a warmer world the incidence and impact of frost is increasing because of earlier leaf unfolding and flowering as a response to warmer temperatures. In this regard, European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), a native tree species widely distributed in European forests, is considered particularly sensitive to changes in spring temperature regimes associated with climate change and thus especially subject to the risk of frost damage. Although several studies concerning F. sylvatica frost damage have been conducted in northern and central Europe, no extensive studies are available for the southern part of its range, i.e. central and southern Italy as well as Greece. In this paper the effect of a late spring frost occurring at the end of April 2016 is extensively documented with high spatial detail all along the Apennine Chain through satellite image data. Three different remote-sensing greenness indexes, namely the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the greenness index (GI) derived from Landsat-8 satellite images acquired from May to July in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 at a spatial resolution of 30 m, were used to gauge the spatial response of common beech forests to this late frost event with relation to latitude, altitude and slope exposure. Frost damage was evaluated as a difference (Delta) of NDVI, GI and EVI between the mean of years 2014 and 2015 (i.e. MRY, mean of reference years), and 2016 (i.e. FEY, frost reference year). The three satellite remote-sensing indexes were efficient at detecting leaf damage with detailed spatial resolution and proved consistent with one another. The greatest damage occurred in the middle altitudinal range between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. with a decreasing trend toward both lower and higher elevations due to warmer temperatures below, and delayed phenology above. Exposure also influenced frost injury, with south-facing slopes of the mountain more damaged than the north. This difference was due to earlier spring leaf phenology of southern beech trees in response to a greater heat sum in the warm weeks preceding. Less damage in the northern Apennines is consistent with the spatial extent of minimum freezing temperatures. To sum up, frost damage is strongly related to site-specific conditions, i.e. on the one hand to minimum temperatures, and on the other to the phonological stage of the trees involving both altitude and exposure. Hence focusing on detailed sub-regional studies can be helpful for predicting future consequences of climate change on forests.

Animals may perceive anthropogenic features and people as threats, exhibiting avoidance behavior, or may acclimate to human activities. As development expands globally, changes in the ecology of species in response to human phenomena may determine whether animals persist in these changing environments. We hypothesize that American black bears (Ursus americanus) persist within developed areas by effectively avoiding risky landscape features. We test this by quantifying changes in the movements of adult females from a population living within exurban and suburban development. We collected hourly GPS data from 23 individuals from 2012 to 2014 and used step-selection functions to estimate selection for anthropogenic features. Females were more avoidant of roads and highways when with cubs than without and were more responsive to increased traffic volume. As bears occupied greater housing densities, selection for housing increased, while avoidance of roads and responsiveness to traffic increased. Behavioral flexibility allowed bears in highly developed areas to alter selection and avoidance for anthropogenic features seasonally. These findings support the hypothesis that black bears perceive human activity as risky, and effectively avoid these risks while inhabiting developed areas. We document a high amount of individual variation in selection of anthropogenic features within the study population. Our findings suggest that initially, wildlife can successfully inhabit developed landscapes by effectively avoiding human activity. However, variation among individuals provides the capacity for population-level shifts in behavior over time.	[Evans, Michael J.; Rittenhouse, Tracy A.

Alarm calls or predator calls: which elicit stronger responses in ungulate communities living with and without lions?	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Anti-predator behaviour; Auditory cues; Predator-prey interactions; Vigilance	PREY PREFERENCES; PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS; RISK; BEHAVIOR; VIGILANCE; HERBIVORES; DECISIONS; CARNIVORA; DILUTION; INCREASE	Alarm calls and predator vocalizations convey information on predator presence and potential risk. Generally, prey employ anti-predator behaviours more in response to alarm calls. However, occasionally prey respond more to the vocalizations of specific predators. A key question is do prey still respond to alarm calls and predator vocalizations when a dangerous predator is absent? Additionally, would the prey species' response (e.g. vigilance) differ from prey already living with these predators? Using auditory playbacks, we tested whether four herbivore species living with lions responded more to alarm calls than lion vocalizations compared to a black cuckoo control call. Overall, red hartebeest, wildebeest and zebra had greater vigilance in response to the lion roars compared to the alarm calls. The differences in vigilance suggest that, despite the lion roars not being related to hunting, these herbivores perceived the predator vocalizations as a more immediate indicator of risk than the alarm calls. We then tested whether herbivores living with lions increased their vigilance more in response to the calls than conspecifics in a lion-free section. Despite greater overall vigilance in the lion section, gemsbok and zebra in the lion-free section significantly increased their vigilance in response to the lion roars. This indicates that species under the greatest threat from a predator (e.g. preferred prey) may maintain innate anti-predator responses to an absent but dangerous predator longer than less preferred prey. Ultimately, our results indicate that cues from dangerous predators can have greater effects on anti-predator behaviours than alarm calls for some prey species.

Social individuals can respond to risk by forming groups, benefiting from enhanced collective anti-predator behavior but suffering from increased conspicuousness to predators. Within groups, individuals exhibit variable foraging behavior. One important factor influencing risky foraging behaviour is current energetic state, and individuals must trade off food and safety by deciding when to leave a protected refuge in order to find food. We generated mixed groups of goldfish (Carassius auratus) containing equal numbers of underfed and well-fed individuals and examined individual refuge use and willingness to take risks venturing into risky foraging areas in the presence of an avian predator (little egretEgretta garzetta). Underfed fish exhibited higher levels of risky behaviour by participating in more foraging outings and emerging from the refuge in frontal group positions, compared with well-fed individuals. As expected, underfed fish benefitted by consuming more food, but surprisingly did not experience higher rates of mortality. This may be due to the fact that the egret predator rarely captured the first fish to emerge from the refuge, preferentially attacked groups of three or more fish, and often captured fish in the chaotic period following a failed initial strike. We demonstrate how differences in energetic condition can influence risk-taking behaviours among social individuals that subsequently influence relative levels of foraging success and group fission-fusion dynamics. Moreover, our results illustrate the risk associated with foraging in larger groups.	[Balaban-Feld, Jesse; Vijayan, Sundararaj; Elem, Lotan T.

Geographic variation in reproductive assurance of Clarkia pulchella	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Clarkia; Geographic variation; Pollinator exclusion; Range limits; Self-pollination	PLANT REPRODUCTION; POLLEN LIMITATION; FLORAL TRAITS; MATING SYSTEM; PERIPHERAL-POPULATIONS; SELF-COMPATIBILITY; EVOLUTION; CLIMATE; COMMUNITIES; POLLINATION	Climate can affect plant populations through direct effects on physiology and fitness, and through indirect effects on their relationships with pollinating mutualists. We therefore expect that geographic variation in climate might lead to variation in plant mating systems. Biogeographic processes, such as range expansion, can also contribute to geographic patterns in mating system traits. We manipulated pollinator access to plants in eight sites spanning the geographic range of Clarkia pulchella to investigate geographic and climatic drivers of fruit production and seed set in the absence of pollinators (reproductive assurance). We examined how reproductive assurance and fruit production varied with the position of sites within the range of the species and with temperature and precipitation. We found that reproductive assurance in C. pulchella was greatest in populations in the northern part of the species' range and was not well explained by any of the climate variables that we considered. In the absence of pollinators, some populations of C. pulchella have the capacity to increase fruit production, perhaps through resource reallocation, but this response is climate dependent. Pollinators are important for reproduction in this species, and recruitment is sensitive to seed input. The degree of autonomous self-pollination that is possible in populations of this mixed-mating species may be shaped by historic biogeographic processes or variation in plant and pollinator community composition rather than variation in climate.

Elevated cannibalism was not correlated with Disease and cannibalism are two strongly density-dependent processes that can suppress predator populations. Here we show that California populations of the omnivorous predatory bug Geocoris pallens are subject to infection by a pathogen, as yet unidentified, that elicits elevated expression of cannibalism. Laboratory experiments showed that the pathogen is moderately virulent, causing flattened abdomens, elevated nymphal mortality, delayed development, and reduced body size of adult females. Infection furthermore increases the expression of cannibalism. Field populations of Geocoris spp. declined strongly in association with sharp increases in the expression of egg cannibalism by adult G. pallens. Increased cannibalism was accompanied by a strongly bimodal distribution of cannibalism expression, with some females (putatively uninfected) expressing little cannibalism and others (putatively infected) consuming most or all of the eggs present. Highly cannibalistic females did not increase their consumption of Ephestia cautella moth eggs, suggesting that the high cannibalism phenotype reflected a specific loss of restraint against eating conspecifics. Highly cannibalistic females also often exhibited reduced egg laying, consistent with a virulent pathogen; less frequently, more cannibalistic females exhibited elevated egg laying, suggesting that cann reduced prey availability or elevated field densities of G. pallens. Geocoris pallens population crashes appear to reflect the combined consequences of direct virulenceadverse pathogen effects on the infected host's physiologyand indirect virulencemortality of both infected and uninfected individuals due to elevated cannibalism expression by infected individuals.

Differential reproductive investment in co-occurring oviparous and viviparous common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) and implications for life-history trade-offs with viviparity	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Reproductive investment; Live-bearing; Egg-laying; Oviparity; Viviparity; Reptile; Squamate; Body size; Fitness; Alternative life-history trade-offs	RELATIVE CLUTCH MASS; MATERNAL BODY-VOLUME; SQUAMATE REPTILES; FACILITATION HYPOTHESIS; EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT; LACERTA-VIVIPARA; OFFSPRING SIZE; LIVE-BIRTH; EGG SIZE; EVOLUTION	Live-bearing reproduction (viviparity) has evolved from egg-laying (oviparity) independently many times and most abundantly in squamate reptiles. Studying life-history trade-offs between the two reproductive modes is an inherently difficult task, as most transitions to viviparity are evolutionarily old and/or are confounded by environmental effects. The common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) is one of very few known reproductively bimodal species, in which some populations are oviparous and others viviparous. Oviparous and viviparous populations can occur in sympatry in the same environment, making this a unique system for investigating alternative life-history trade-offs between oviparous and viviparous reproduction. We find that viviparous females exhibit larger body size, smaller clutch sizes, a larger reproductive investment, and a higher hatching success rate than oviparous females. We find that offspring size and weight from viviparous females was lower compared to offspring from oviparous females, which may reflect space constraints during pregnancy. We suggest that viviparity in common lizards is associated with increased reproductive burden for viviparous females and speculate that this promoted the evolution of larger body size to create more physical space for developing embryos. In the context of life-history trade-offs in the evolution of viviparity, we suggest that the extent of correlation between reproductive traits, or differences between reproductive modes, may also depend on the time since the transition occurred.

How invasive oysters can affect parasite infection patterns in native mussels on a large spatial scale	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Invasive species; Parasite spillover; Parasite spillback; Transmission interference; Wadden Sea	MYTILICOLA-INTESTINALIS STEUER; MYTILUS-EDULIS L.; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; POLYDORA-CILIATA; TREMATODE LARVAE; SHELL STRENGTH; MARINE; DISEASE; ORIENTALIS; DIVERSITY	There are surprisingly few field studies on the role of invasive species on parasite infection patterns in native hosts. We investigated the role of invasive Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas) in determining parasite infection levels in native blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in relation to other environmental and biotic factors. Using hierarchical field sampling covering three spatial scales along a large intertidal ecosystem (European Wadden Sea), we found strong spatial differences in infection levels of five parasite species associated with mussels and oysters. We applied mixed models to analyse the associations between parasite prevalence and abundance in mussels and oysters, and 12 biological and environmental factors. For each parasite-host relationship, an optimal model (either a null, one-factor or two-factor model) was selected based on AIC scores. We found that the density of invasive oysters contributed to three of the 12 models. Other biological factors such as host size (six models), and the density of target or alternative host species (five models) contributed more frequently to the best models. Furthermore, for parasite species infecting both mussels and oysters, parasite population densities were higher in native mussels, attributed to the higher densities of mussels. Our results indicate that invasive species can affect parasite infection patterns in native species in the field, but that their relative contribution may be further mediated by other biological and environmental parameters. These results stress the usefulness of large-scale field studies for detailed assessments of the mechanisms underlying the impacts of invasive species on native host communities.	[Goedknegt, M.

Changes in land use and associated fragmentation have important consequences for biodiversity in the remaining fragments. Most studies so far have investigated the impact of land use change on macro-organisms, but little is known about how landscape fragmentation affects microbial communities. Here, we studied how changes in land use and abiotic conditions affected the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities in the roots of the forest herb Stachys sylvatica. Root samples were collected from 40 populations occurring in fragmented forest patches of varying age and size embedded within an agricultural landscape. Our results showed that forest age and isolation did not affect AMF diversity or community composition, suggesting that AMF disperse easily throughout the landscape and that AMF communities reassemble fast in recently established forest patches. On the other hand, AMF richness increased with increasing forest area, indicating that small forest sizes limit AMF richness. Additionally, AMF richness increased with increasing soil pH and decreased with soil nitrate content, while AMF community composition was affected plant-available phosphorus. Overall, these results show that landscape context is less important than local abiotic conditions for structuring AMF communities. However, the significant area effect indicates that further reductions in forest area will lead to impoverished AMF communities, potentially affecting long-term plant fitness and community structure.

However, less is known about mechanisms that determine the responses of different species to the same pulse. We hypothesized that these differences are related to the size of the species, as increasing size may be correlated with increasing competitive ability and decreasing tolerance to predation. A factorial experiment quantified the magnitude and timing of species' responses to a resource pulse using the aquatic communities found in the leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. We added prey to leaves and followed the abundances of bacteria and bacterivores (protozoa and rotifers) in the presence and absence of a top predator, larvae of the mosquito Wyeomyia smithii. Resource pulses had significant positive effects on species abundances and diversity in this community; however, the magnitude and timing of responses varied among the bacterivore species and was not related to body size. Larger bacterivores were significantly suppressed by predators, while smaller bacterivores were not; predation also significantly reduced bacterivore species diversity. There were no interactions between the effects of the resource pulse and predation on protozoa abundances. Over 67days, some species returned to pre-pulse abundances quickly, others did not or did so very slowly, resulting in new community states for extended periods of time. This study demonstrates that species-specific differences in responses to resource pulses and predation are complex and may not be related to simple life history trade-offs associated with size.

Here we examine how pesticides may influence community composition using the aquatic communities within bromeliad phytotelmata, and how adaptive responses to pesticides may influence community-level patterns. We first quantified the composition of macroinvertebrate communities from pesticide-free and pesticide-exposed locations. Complementary manipulative experiments where bromeliads were transplanted between pesticide-free and pesticide-exposed sites were then performed. Finally, pesticide bioassays on the most common predators (Mecistogaster modesta damselflies) and prey (Wyeomyia abebela mosquitoes) assessed a potential evolutionary mechanism that may influence community compositional differences. Our field survey revealed differences in W. abebela and M. modesta abundances between pesticide-free and pesticide-exposed areas. Our transplant experiment suggested compositional differences were not due to physical differences between bromeliads from different locations. Pesticide bioassays revealed that M. modesta from pesticide-free locations had higher innate pesticide tolerances than W. abebela from pesticide-free areas, but M. modesta larvae showed no evidence of adapted resistance as none were found where pesticides were used. Conversely, W. abebela larvae from pesticide-exposed locations had higher pesticide tolerances than individuals from pesticide-free sites, suggesting an adaptive response. This evolved resistance to pesticides may, therefore, allow W. abebela to colonize habitats free of the dominant predator in the system, explaining the higher W. abebela abundances in pesticide-exposed areas than in pesticide-free locations. We suggest that the total effect of novel stressors is driven by interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes.

Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F-ST=0.01 +/- 0.01; n=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (r(p)=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.

Modeling seasonal onset of coastal ice	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Coastal ice; Climate variability; Statistical model; Decision-making	GREAT-LAKES REGION; WINTER SEVERITY; SEA-ICE; EL-NINO; VARIABILITY; PACIFIC; COVER; TEMPERATURE; REGRESSION; IMPACT	To support regional management planning decisions, and to protect human health and safety, we developed a new statistical model that simulates the onset of seasonal ice cover along the shoreline of a US National Park (the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, or APIS). Our model encodes relationships between different modes of climate variability and regional ice cover from 1972 to 2015, and successfully simulates both the timing of ice onset and the probability that ice cover might form at all in a particular winter season. We simulate both of these endpoints using a novel combination of statistical hazard (or survival) and beta regression models. Our analysis of coastal ice cover along the APIS reinforces findings from previous research suggesting that the late 1990s signified a regime shift in climate conditions across North America. Before this period, coastal ice cover conditions at the APIS were often suitable for pedestrian access, while after this period coastal ice cover at the APIS has been highly variable. Our new model accommodates this regime shift, and provides a stepping stone towards a broad range of applications of similar models for supporting regional management decisions in light of evolving climate conditions.

Growth and Recruitment of Nonnative Smallmouth Bass Along the Upstream Edge of its Riverine Distribution	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article						secondary spread; range expansion; invasive species; headwater; young-of-the-year	LARGEMOUTH BASS; MICROPTERUS-DOLOMIEU; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; PATTERNS; HABITAT; RANGE; SIZE; ASSOCIATIONS; TEMPERATURE; MANAGEMENT	Nonnative species have been widely introduced, and once established, often exhibit secondary spread to new areas. For instance, after its initial introduction in the John Day River, Oregon, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) has expanded upstream into headwater habitats. Recruitment is a key component of successful range expansion and has been highlighted as a potential bottleneck to continued expansion by small mouth bass. We explored growth, body lengths, and survival of young-of-the-year (YOY) smallmouth bass in the North Fork John Day River to better understand the recruitment dynamics near its invasion boundary. In 2014-2015, we collected YOY across the upstream 63 km of smallmouth bass distribution at the end of the first growth season and after a winter starvation period. We found that growth, body length, and survival showed varied correspondence with patterns in water temperature. Specifically, body lengths matched temperature predictions in upstream sites (after accounting for spawning delays) where smallmouth bass density is low. By contrast, individuals achieved smaller than predicted body lengths in downstream sites where density is relatively high. Model selection revealed that temperature and age >= 1 density were the most important predictors of body length. Additionally, individuals predicted to be too small to survive a winter starvation period were present. Our findings reveal nuanced recruitment dynamics at the invasion boundary, where departures from temperature-based predictions point to multiple mechanisms affecting growth and survival. Understanding mechanisms operating at invasion boundaries may help develop management strategies to prevent future spread of smallmouth bass into headwater salmon habitat.

A Landscape Habitat Suitability Model for the Humboldt Marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis) in Coastal California and Coastal Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article						Humboldt marten; Martes; coastal forest; landscape habitat suitability; late-successional	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; AMERICAN MARTENS; FOREST DISTURBANCE; DETECTING TRENDS; GROWTH; SELECTION; PREDICTION; DISPERSAL; PATTERN; FISHER	Models that predict the distributions and habitat suitability for species of conservation concern can be useful for guiding survey, monitoring, and conservation planning efforts. The Humboldt marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis) has significantly declined throughout its historical range in coastal California and Oregon and this taxon is known from a few remnant populations. We developed a landscape habitat suitability model to identify areas of suitable habitat not yet surveyed, to provide a template for designing monitoring programs and research studies, and to inform the development of a conservation strategy. We used the results of 1,159 occupancy surveys to develop a predictive habitat model using Generalized Additive Modeling to relate Humboldt marten detections to combinations of environmental and habitat attributes hypothesized to influence marten distribution. We measured 30 candidate variables at three spatial scales, using 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 km, and although several models were competitive, each contained the same three core variables: old growth structural index measured at the 1-km scale, serpentine habitat measured at the 3-km scale, and annual precipitation measured at the 3-km scale. The final model had an overall correct classification rate of 91% for marten detections, 82% for non-detections and a true skill statistic of 0.73. Model predictions were stable when cross-validated, with the correct classification of marten detections (89%) varying little. The largest complexes of predicted suitable habitat occurred in the areas with the three extant marten populations (north coastal California, south coastal Oregon, and central coastal Oregon), however connectivity of suitable habitat to areas outside these three areas appears limited.

Early Spring and Early Vanishing Wetlands as Harbingers of the Future? The Climate Change Trap for Ephemeral Pond-Breeding Frogs	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article						Rana aurora; climate change; ephemeral wetlands; climate extremes; amphibian habitat	RED-LEGGED FROGS; RANA-PRETIOSA-PRETIOSA; AMPHIBIAN DECLINE; AURORA-AURORA; MODELS; PHENOLOGY; SURVIVAL; STRESS	The decline of the northern red-legged frog, Rana aurora, in the Pacific Northwest has been attributed to invasive species, habitat loss, and climate change. Rana aurora lay eggs on emergent vegetation, and larval development occurs in shallow; often ephemeral wetlands. In 2015 and 2016 we investigated how habitat and water quality parameters influence breeding productivity and development of R. aurora. Early season temperatures in southwestern British Columbia during both years were warmer than in the previous two decades and egg-laying occurred much earlier than any previous records, allowing us to follow the development of R. aurora under unusual climatic conditions. We monitored 43 wetlands in the Little Campbell River Watershed and nearby areas in 2015 and selected six sites to monitor tadpole metamorphosis. Peak egg mass abundance was inversely proportional to concentrations of nitrates and orthophosphates, and colder water appeared to support greater egg mass abundance. Although warmer ambient temperatures facilitated earlier onset of R. aurora breeding, we observed some egg mortality due to subsequent frost. Sites with earlier peak egg mass abundance dates did not exhibit earlier peak metamorph dates, nor did wanner water appear to facilitate quicker larval development. In 2015. one wetland dried up before tadpoles completed metamorphosis. The frog's reproductive cycle may adapt to warmer temperatures to some degree, but erratic precipitation or frost events could reduce R. aurora survivorship beyond recovery. The disruption of larval development we observed under unusually warm spring conditions provides a useful vantage point for predicting future impacts of climate change.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						neighbourhood; scale; built environment; physical activity; walking	WALKING BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; WALKABILITY; ACCESSIBILITY; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; UNIT; ACCELEROMETER; TRANSPORT; SUPPORT	Researchers investigating relationships between the neighbourhood environment and health first need to decide on the spatial extent of the neighbourhood they are interested in. This decision is an important and ongoing methodological challenge since different methods of defining and delineating neighbourhood boundaries can produce different results. This paper explores this issue in the context of a New Zealand-based study of the relationship between the built environment and multiple measures of physical activity. Geographic information systems were used to measure three built environment attributes-dwelling density, street connectivity, and neighbourhood destination accessibility-using seven different neighbourhood definitions (three administrative unit boundaries, and 500, 800, 1000- and 1500-m road network buffers). The associations between the three built environment measures and five measures of physical activity (mean accelerometer counts per hour, percentage time in moderate-vigorous physical activity, self-reported walking for transport, self-reported walking for recreation and self-reported walking for all purposes) were modelled for each neighbourhood definition. The combination of the choice of neighbourhood definition, built environment measure, and physical activity measure determined whether evidence of an association was detected or not. Results demonstrated that, while there was no single ideal neighbourhood definition, the built environment was most consistently associated with a range of physical activity measures when the 800-m and 1000-m road network buffers were used. For the street connectivity and destination accessibility measures, associations with physical activity were less likely to be detected at smaller scales (less than 800 m). In line with some previous research, this study demonstrated that the choice of neighbourhood definition can influence whether or not an association between the built environment and adults' physical activity is detected or not. This study additionally highlighted the importance of the choice of built environment attribute and physical activity measures. While we identified the 800-m and 1000-m road network buffers as the neighbourhood definitions most consistently associated with a range of physical activity measures, it is important that researchers carefully consider the most appropriate type of neighbourhood definition and scale for the particular aim and participants, especially at smaller scales.

Risk factors for scrub typhus include both individual-level factors and environmental drivers, and some are related to the increased density of vector mites and rodents, the natural hosts of the mites. In this regard, deforestation is a potential risk factor, because the deforestation-induced secondary growth of scrub vegetation may increase the densities of mites and rodents. To examine this hypothesis, this study investigated the association between scrub typhus and deforestation. Methods: We acquired district-level data for 2006-2017, including the number of cases of scrub typhus reported annually, deforestation level, and other covariates. Deforestation was assessed using preprocessed remote-sensing satellite data. Bayesian regression models, including Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson, and zero-inflated negative binomial models, were examined, and spatial autocorrelation was considered in hierarchical models. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using different accumulation periods for the deforestation level to examine the robustness of the association. Results: The final models showed a significant association between deforestation and the incidence of scrub typhus (relative risk = 1.20, 95% credible interval = 1.15-1.24). The sensitivity analysis gave consistent results, and a potential long-term effect of deforestation for up to 5 years was shown. Conclusion: The results support the potential public health benefits of forest conservation by suppressing the risk of scrub typhus, implying the need for strong engagement of public health sectors in conservation issues from a One Health perspective.

Available light (photosynthetically active radiation or PAR) for suspended algae (phytoplankton) may fluctuate greatly over time and space. Species-specific light acquisition traits capture important aspects of the ecophysiology of phytoplankton and characterize species growth at either limiting or saturating daily PAR supply. Efforts have been made to explain phytoplankton coexistence using species-specific light acquisition traits under constant light conditions, but not under fluctuating light regimes that should facilitate non-equilibrium coexistence. In the well-mixed, hypertrophic Lake TaiHu (China), we incubated the phytoplankton community in bottles placed either at fixed depths or moved vertically through the water column to mimic vertical mixing. Incubations at constant depths received only the diurnal changes in light, while the moving bottles received rapidly fluctuating light. Species-specific light acquisition traits of dominant cyanobacteria (Anabaena flos-aquae, Microcystis spp.) and diatom (Aulacoseira granulata, Cyclotella pseudostelligera) species were characterized from their growth-light relationships that could explain relative biomasses along the daily PAR gradient under both constant and fluctuating light. Our study demonstrates the importance of interspecific differences in affinities to limiting and saturating light for the coexistence of phytoplankton species in spatially heterogeneous light conditions. Furthermore, we observed strong intraspecific differences in light acquisition traits between incubation under constant and fluctuating light - leading to the reversal of light utilization strategies of species. This increased the niche space for acclimated species, precluding competitive exclusion. These observations could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms behind the Paradox of the Plankton.

The first study measured volatilization after banding in a loamy mixed frigid Typic Humaquept at 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 g kg(-1) gravimetric water content (WC). Study 2 measured volatilization from the same soil after covering the bands with soil clods that ranged from <2 to >24 mm in diameter, whereas Study 3 measured volatilization from transplanted, acidic soils with clay contents ranging from 5 to 57%. Cumulative 17-d NH3 losses for study one ranged from 8.3 to 20.8% of applied N, with the soil wetted to 200 g kg(-1) WC experiencing the greatest losses. For Study 2, cumulative NH3 volatilization losses ranged from 10.8 to 20.8% of applied N, with the greatest losses from the largest clod sizes. For Study 3, NH3 losses ranged from 2.5 to 51.7% of applied N, with the NH3 losses correlated to the maximum pH measured in the band (P < 0.001), and to the soil cation exchange capacity (P = 0.054), titratable acidity (P = 0.072), and clay content (P = 0.100). However, the soil with high silt, not sand, content had the highest volatilization losses, suggesting that high silt soils may have the greatest potential for NH3 volatilization.	[Pelster, D.

The Charosphere Promotes Mineralization of C-13-Phenanthrene by Psychrotrophic Microorganisms in Greenland Soils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; PETROLEUM-HYDROCARBONS; BIOCHAR AMENDMENT; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; CONTAMINATED SOIL; ACTIVATED CARBON; EBI METAGENOMICS; GENOME SEQUENCE; LOW-TEMPERATURE	When soil is frozen, biochar promotes petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) degradation, yet we still do not understand why. To investigate microbial biodegradation activity under frozen conditions, we placed 60-mu m mesh bags containing 6% (v/v) biochar created from fishmeal, bonemeal, bone chip, or wood into PHC-contaminated soil, which was then frozen to -5 degrees C. This created three soil niches: biochar particles, the charosphere (biochar-contiguous soil), and bulk soil outside of the bags. After 90 d, C-13-phenanthrene mineralization reached 55% in bonemeal biochar and 84% in bone chip biochar charosphere soil, compared with only 43% in bulk soil and 13% in bone chip biochar particles. Soil pH remained near neutral in bone chip and bonemeal biochar treatments, unlike wood biochar, which increased alkalinity and likely made phosphate unavailable for microorganisms. Generally, charosphere soil had higher aromatic degradative gene abundances than bulk soil, but gene abundance was not directly linked to C-13-phenanthrene mineralization. In bone chip biochar-amended soils, phosphate successfully predicted microbial community composition, and abundances of Bosea and Caulobacter increased in charosphere soil. Biochar effects on charosphere soil were dependent on feedstock material and suggest that optimizing the charosphere in bone-derived biochars may increase remediation success in northern regions.

Several studies highlighted their effects on organism physiology, although molecular studies remain scarce. NM behavior is strongly dependent on the environment but few data are available using complex exposure media, raising the question of its environmental impacts. The aim of the present work was to assess the toxic potential of three CeO2 NMs in Corbicula fluminea at a molecular level by RT-qPCR under a more realistic scenario of exposure, in a multistress context at two different salinities (1.5 and 15psu). C. fluminea was exposed for 28days to pulses of the three selected NMs (reference, manufactured, and aged manufactured). In bivalves, the gills and digestive gland are two key organs used for ecotoxicological studies. The expression change of 12 genes was measured in control organisms after 28days in both organs, allowing us to clearly separate the responses for both organs and salinities. As gills come in contact with the environment first, we monitored gene the expression at intermediate time points (7, 14, and 21days) for this organ in order to highlight clams responses to NM and salinity. Two genes (Se-GPx, MnSOD) had a salinity-dependent level of expression. HSP70, Se-GPx, and Trxr mRNAs presented significant changes in their expressions in the presence of NM. This study was completed using an integrated statistical approach. The exposed organisms differed more from control at field salinity than those exposed to hyper-saline conditions. At 15psu, salinity pressure seems to cause the first molecular impact. At 1.5psu, gene expression patterns allowed the effect of each NM to separate clearly. These results confirmed the usefulness of gene expression studies. Moreover, we highlighted the necessity to assess the environmental toxicity of the different forms of manufactured NM.

However, evidence on the effects of particulate matter pollution on cardiovascular mortality is still limited in Lanzhou, China. This research aimed to examine the associations of daily mean concentrations of ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PMC, and PM10) and cardiovascular mortality due to overall and cause-specific diseases in Lanzhou. Data representing daily cardiovascular mortality rates, meteorological factors (daily average temperature, daily average humidity, and atmospheric pressure), and air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2) were collected from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017, in Lanzhou. A quasi-Poisson regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was used to estimate the associations. Stratified analyses were also performed by different cause-specific diseases, including cerebrovascular disease (CD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart rhythm disturbances (HRD), and heart failure (HF). The results showed that elevated concentration of PM2.5, PMC, and PM10 had different effects on mortality of different cardiovascular diseases. Only cerebrovascular disease showed a significant positive association with elevated PM2.5. Positive associations were identified between PMC and daily mortality rates from total cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and ischemic heart diseases. Besides, increased concentration of PM10 was correlated with increased death of cerebrovascular diseases and ischemic heart diseases. For cerebrovascular disease, each 10g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 at lag4 was associated with increments of 1.22% (95% CI 0.11-2.35%). The largest significant effects for PMC on cardiovascular diseases and ischemic heart diseases were both observed at lag0, and a 10 g/m(3) increment in concentration of PMC was associated with 0.47% (95% CI 0.06-0.88%) and 0.85% (95% CI 0.18-1.52%) increases in cardiovascular mortality and ischemic heart diseases. In addition, it exhibited a lag effect on cerebrovascular mortality as well, which was most significant at lag6d, and an increase of 10g/m(3) in PMC was associated with a 0.76% (95% CI 0.16-1.37%) increase in cerebrovascular mortality. The estimates of percentage change in daily mortality rates per 10g/m(3) increase in PM10 were 0.52% (95% CI 0.05-1.02%) for cerebrovascular disease at lag6 and 0.53% (95% CI 0.01-1.05%) for ischemic heart disease at lag0, respectively. Our study suggests that elevated concentration of atmospheric PM (PM2.5, PMC, and PM10) in Lanzhou is associated with increased mortality of cardiovascular diseases and that the health effect of elevated concentration of PM2.5 is more significant than that of PMC and PM10.

In our previous study, we showed the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in maternal serum from the Chiba Study of Mother and Child Health (C-MACH) cohort and their relationships between PCB levels in cord serum with birth weight of newborn. Various reports on the relationship between chemical exposure and birth status have been published; however, studies that analyze the effects of both PCB and metal exposure together in one cohort are still limited. In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship of maternal serum levels of PCBs and toxic and essential trace elements [mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and cadmium (Cd)], with birth weight and head circumference, in the C-MACH cohort. The median concentration of total PCBs in maternal serum around 32 gestational weeks (n=62) was 360pgg(-1) wet wt (41ngg(-1) lipid wt). The levels of Hg, Mn, Se, and Cd in maternal serum were 0.89, 0.84, 100, and 0.024ngg(-1), respectively. In this study, the Bayesian linear model determined the relationships of the birth weight and head circumference with combinations of PCB levels, toxic and essential trace elements, and questionnaire data. We found that PCB concentrations in maternal serum were weakly and negatively related to birth weight, whereas trace elements were not associated with birth weight. Serum PCB and Mn levels were negatively associated with head circumference, whereas other trace elements were not associated with head circumference. These results showed that maternal exposure to PCBs may be related to birth weight and head circumference, while maternal exposure to Mn is related to head circumference, even when adjusted based on the exposure levels of other contaminants, and maternal and fetal characteristics. Therefore, our findings indicate that maternal exposure to PCBs and Mn might be negatively related with birth weight and head circumference.

Evaluation of key meteorological determinants of wintering and flowering patterns of five rubber clones in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	33rd International Geographical Congress (IGC) of the International-Geographic-Union (IGU)	AUG, 2016	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Geog Union		Defoliation; Refoliation; Temperature; Sunshine; Precipitation; Partial least squares (PLS) regression	MAINLAND SOUTHEAST-ASIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOLOGICAL RESPONSE; TREE; EXPANSION; PLANTS	All rubber tree clones (Hevea brasiliensis) exhibit regular annual wintering characterized by senescence and abscission of leaves. After 3-4weeks, this is followed by the onset of new leaves. It is likely that the timing of leaf onset affects the susceptibility of rubber trees to rubber powdery mildew disease, as this predominantly infests young leaves. However, little information is available on the phenological behavior of different rubber clones, or how meteorological factors affect such behavior. We assessed the wintering and flowering patterns of five rubber clones in Xishuangbanna, southwest China, based on observations made from 1978 to 2011, and evaluated how these patterns responded to different meteorological factors. Partial least squares regression was used to analyze the timing of defoliation, refoliation, and flowering. Our results showed that the two clones RRIM 600 and GT1 defoliated during the last week of December and refoliated in the last week of January, and clones Yunyan 277-5, Yunyan 34-4, and PR 107 defoliated during the first week of January and refoliated in the second week of February. The number of hours of sunshine during both the rainy season and the cold dry period in the dry season were important determinants of phenological changes in the rubber trees. Similarly, higher temperatures tended to delay the onset of defoliation and refoliation, and were a triggering factor for the onset of flowering. These results may help rubber cultivators to schedule appropriate disease control measures, as well as to design hybridization programs aiming at the production of clones which are resistant to foliar disease.

An analysis of the impacts of Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events on global molluscan diversity dynamics	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							ORGANIC-CARBON BURIAL; PHANEROZOIC BIODIVERSITY CRISES; CENOMANIAN-TURONIAN BOUNDARY; WESTERN INTERIOR BASIN; ISOTOPE STRATIGRAPHY; MASS EXTINCTIONS; SPECIES-LEVEL; DIAZOTROPHIC CYANOBACTERIA; ECOLOGICAL RANKING; GEOGRAPHIC RANGE	Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are contemporaneous with 11 of the 18 largest Phanerozoic extinction events, but the magnitude and selectivity of their paleoecological impact remains disputed. OAEs are associated with abrupt, rapid warming and increased CO2 flux to the atmosphere; thus, insights from this study may clarify the impact of current anthropogenic climate change on the biosphere. We investigated the influence of the Late Cretaceous Bonarelli event (OAE2; Cenomanian/Turonian stage boundary; similar to 94 Ma) on generic- and species-level molluscan diversity, extinction rates, and ecological turnover. Cenomanian/Turonian results were compared with changes across all Cretaceous stage boundaries, some of which are coincident with less severe OAEs. We found increased generic turnover, but not species-level turnover, associated with several Cretaceous OAEs. The absence of a species-level pattern may reflect species occurrence data that are too temporally coarse to robustly detect patterns. Five hypotheses of ecological selectivity relating anoxia to survivorship were tested across stage boundaries with respect to faunality, mobility, and diet using generalized linear models. Interestingly, benthic taxa were consistently selected against throughout the Cretaceous regardless of the presence or absence of OAEs. These results suggest that: (1) the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary (OAE2) was associated with a decline in molluscan diversity and increase in extinction rate that were significantly more severe than Cretaceous background levels; and (2) no differential ecological selectivity was associated with OAE-related diversity declines among the variables tested here.

Studying the early Toarcian succession in the Lusitanian Basin of Portugal, we tested whether the shell size of benthic marine communities of bivalves and brachiopods changed at and before the global, warming-related Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE). Statistical analyses of shell size over time show that the mean shell size of communities decreased significantly before the T-OAE. This trend is distinct in brachiopods and is caused by larger-sized species becoming less abundant over time, whereas it is not significant in bivalves, suggesting a decoupled response to environmental stress. Reductions in shell size precede the decline in standardized sample-level species richness associated with the early Toarcian extinction event. Such decreases in the shell size of marine invertebrates, well before the onset of biodiversity change, suggest that reductions in body size more generally may be a precursor of a subsequent loss of species and turnover at the community level caused by climate change. Sedimentological evidence is against hypoxia as a driver of extinction and the preceding size decrease in the brachiopod fauna in the studied succession, although low oxygen levels are widely held responsible for elevated early Toarcian extinction rates globally. Reduction of mean shell size in brachiopods but stasis in bivalves is difficult to explain with ocean acidification, because experimental work shows that brachiopods can be resilient to lowered pH, albeit long-term metabolic costs and potential evolutionary adaptations are unknown. Rising early Toarcian temperatures in the Lusitanian Basin seem to be a plausible factor in both diversity decline associated with the T-OAE and the preceding reductions in mean shell size, because thermal tolerances in modern bivalves are among the highest within marine invertebrates.

We analyzed the bone histology of Azendohsaurus laaroussii. Stylopodial and zeugopodial bones show three tissue types: (1) avascular lamellar zonal bone formed at low growth rates; (2) a scaffold of parallel-fibered bone containing either small primary osteons or simple vascular canals; and (3) fibrolamellar bone formed at high growth rates. We used quantitative histology to infer the thermometabolic regime of this taxon. We define endothermy as the presence of any mechanism of nonshivering thermogenesis that increases both body temperature and resting metabolic rate. Thus, estimating the resting metabolic rate of an extinct organism may be a good proxy to infer its thermometabolic regime (endothermy vs. ectothermy). High resting metabolic rates have been shown to be primitive for the clade Prolacerta-Archosauriformes. Therefore, we inferred the resting metabolic rates of A. laaroussii, a sister group of this clade, and of 14 extinct related taxa, using phylogenetic eigenvector maps. All the inferences obtained are included in the range of variation of resting metabolic rates measured in mammals and birds, so we can reasonably assume that all these taxa (including Azendohsaurus) were endotherms. A parsimony optimization of the presence of endothermy on a phylogenetic tree of tetrapods shows that this derived character state was acquired by the last common ancestor of the clade Azendohsaurus-Archosauriformes and that there is a reversion in Crocodylia.

During the Late Cretaceous, 100 to 66 million years ago, hadrosaurids had high diversity, rapid speciation rates, and wide geographic distribution. Most hadrosaurids were large bodied and had similar postcranial skeletons. However, they show important innovations in the skull, including disparate crests that functioned as socio-sexual display structures, and a complex feeding apparatus, with specialized jaws bearing dental batteries. Little is known about the macroevolutionary processes that produced these evolutionary novelties. Here we provide novel perspectives using evolutionary rate and disparity analyses. Our results show that hadrosaurid cranial evolution was complex and dynamic, but their postcranial skeleton and body size were conservative. High cranial disparity was achieved through multiple bursts of phenotypic innovation. We highlight contrasting evolutionary trends within hadrosaurids between the disparate facial skeleton and crests, which both showed multiple high-rate shifts, and the feeding apparatus, which had low variance and high rates on a single phylogenetic branch leading to the diverse Saurolophidae. We reveal that rapid evolutionary rates were important for producing the high disparity of exaggerated crests and present novel evidence that the hadrosaurid diversification was linked to both a key adaptive innovation in the feeding apparatus and multiple bursts of innovation in socio-sexual displays.

They coexist and compete with native plants, disrupting a wide range of trophic interactions, and must cope with a new array of herbivores. We examined factors influencing the occurrence of invertebrate herbivores on two invasive alien plant species, Acacia dealbata and Carpobrotus edulis, and surrounding native vegetation in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. The aims were to assess the accumulation of herbivorous insects, including the distribution and frequency of herbivorous insects at different invasion levels (low, medium and high), and to evaluate whether introduced plants favour native or exotic, and generalist or specialist herbivorous insects in newly evolving plant-herbivore networks. To achieve these objectives, we surveyed A. dealbata along transects in five mixed pine forests and four shrublands, and C. edulis in nine coastal areas using quadrats. We identified nine herbivore species feeding on one or both of these species and determined that herbivore species composition in forest and coastal areas is directly tied to host preference, as well as related to invasion levels of A. dealbata in forest areas. On average, the introduced species in both the forest and coastal areas had approximately threefold more herbivore species (50% of them exotics) than native plants. The introduced plants in forest areas had approximately eightfold more species interaction strength between herbivores and plants (a measure of the importance of each plant species to each herbivore). Overall, generalist herbivores were favoured by the invasion of the introduced plants. The results also demonstrate that exotic insects are supported by introduced plants, increasing the local occurrence and range of insect pests. Considering our observations, management strategies should be implemented to favour the restoration and protection of native areas for conserving biodiversity.

To determine the effects of shoreline modification on the expansion of alien aquatic plants, we compared the relative occurrence of alien aquatic plants in varying shoreline conditions modified by shoreline hardening and wave breakers. The distribution of alien aquatic species increased continually in Lake Kasumigaura over the study period, although the rate of expansion differed among years. Furthermore>64.6% of the vegetative fragments were found within 2km of the nearest patch. The construction of artificial wave breakers, which were installed parallel to the shoreline, had a positive influence on alien aquatic plant patch establishment. Especially, parallel wave breakers increased the patch establishment of G. spilanthoides by about 2.27-fold compared to the natural environment. Perpendicular wave breakers increased alien patch establishment by about 1.63-fold. For lakeshore management, it is important to consider both alien plant suppression and levee protection. We further suggest prompt action to prevent the expansion of alien aquatic species around pumping stations, which can also result in the relocation and expansion of invasive species.

This study documents the expansion of the invasive range of this species, calculates the invasion spread rate, and provides estimates of toad abundance and habitat preferences. Updates of the distribution range revealed a fivefold increase of the invaded area over 3 years, and a doubling of the rate of spread, showing a shift of the invasion towards the North-West, most probably because of the absence of ecological barriers. We used N-mixture models to estimate toad abundance on the basis of repeated count data of six areas in Toamasina and its surrounding countryside. Toad distribution shows heterogeneous density across the distribution range, with an average abundance of 184 toads ha(-1) (95% CI 132-263). The toad's abundance was highest in sites with the presence of organic waste, and was negatively related to the density of road networks in the proximity of study sites. The rapid expansion of the Asian toad in the Toamasina region suggests that this toad is an increasing threat for Madagascar. We propose immediate management actions that could limit the spread of alien toads in this megadiverse country.

Spatial patterns and drivers of invasive rodent dynamics in New Zealand forests	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Biotic interactions; Spatiotemporal clustering; Pulsed resources; Rodent irruptions; Forest ecosystem	RATS RATTUS-RATTUS; MICE MUS-MUSCULUS; SHIP RATS; MAMMALIAN PREDATORS; HOUSE MICE; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES	Populations of invasive ship rat (Rattus rattus) and house mouse (Mus musculus) vary greatly over both time and space in New Zealand's indigenous forests. Both species threaten endemic fauna, and their spatiotemporal variation over short time scales and steep environmental gradients present substantial challenges for conservation management. We fitted models to 18years of 3-monthly records from a large-scale tracking-tunnel network to (1) predict, classify and describe forest-wide spatial patterns of temporal dynamics of unmanaged rat and mouse populations, and (2) understand the population-limiting roles of environment and biotic interactions. We distinguish six classes of forest rodent dynamics by classifying deciles of predicted rat-tracking rates. Classes form sequences across broad latitudinal and elevation gradients, and grade from irruptive', with low median but synchronous high maximum rat and mouse tracking rates in colder forests, to continuously ratty', with high median rat and low unsynchronised mouse tracking rates in warmer forests. Mice irrupt alone more frequently in colder forests, and their tracking rates are spatially reciprocal with rat tracking rate minima but not maxima. We conclude that predictable spatial patterns of rodent population dynamics arise from stronger low-temperature limitations on rats than mice, biotic limitation of mice by rats, and spatiotemporal food resource patterns affecting both species. Practical implications are that native species conservation in New Zealand forests requires spatially-differentiated predator management regimes; ship rats are likely to become increasingly prevalent at higher elevations as climate warms; and suppression of ship rats alone will release house mouse populations, especially in warmer forests.

Population density contributes to the higher functional response of an invasive fish	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Aquatic invasive species; Intraspecific competition; Laurentian Great Lakes; Spatial sorting; Spatio-temporal gradient	ROUND GOBY; NEOGOBIUS MELANOSTOMUS; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; MOTTLED SCULPIN; PREDATOR; HISTORY; INTERFERENCE; EXPANSION; GOBIES; DEPENDENCE	Invasive species often have higher functional responses than native analogs. A better understanding of the functional response of invasive species could help explain the effect of these species on native prey communities, and aid in the development of tools for predicting invasion impact. We investigated the role of population density and location along the invasion pathway in determining the functional response of an invasive fish. We used invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) collected from the Trent-Severn Waterway in Ontario, Canada to test for differences in the functional response of fish from high and low density sites, and from different locations along the invasion pathway. We also compared the functional response of round goby with that of northern logperch (Percina caprodes), a native species occupying the same niche. The density of the invasive predator population influenced its functional response, with attack rate being significantly higher for fish from high-density sites compared to fish from low-density sites. Functional response of individuals living at the invasion front was not significantly different from those living in established areas. The higher functional response of round goby compared to its native analog was associated with shorter handling time. Patterns in functional response curves were not explained by differences in diet among wild populations. Our research demonstrates that population density influences the functional response of an invasive species, and therefore should be accounted for when evaluating the functional response of a potential invader.

Intra- and intercontinental variation in the functional responses of a high impact alien invasive fish	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Topmouth gudgeon; Alien species; Pseudorasbora parva; Impact assessment; Functional response	ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; PSEUDORASBORA-PARVA; TOPMOUTH GUDGEON; METAANALYSIS; PREDATOR; PREY; POPULATION; PATTERNS; PRIORITY; BIOLOGY	Recently, a body of literature has indicated the utility of comparisons among introduced and native species of their functional responses, that is, the relationship between resource use (e.g. predator consumption rate) and resource availability (e.g. prey density) to predict their impact. However, a key feature of this methodology, that has not yet been examined, is the degree to which the functional response curves of an introduced species differ within and between its native and introduced geographical ranges. Information on the variation in functional responses is key to make robust assessments on the ecological impact and to assess possible differences between native and invasive species. Here, we examine the predatory functional responses in multiple native and introduced populations of a globally high impact alien invasive fish, the topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva). In standardised aquaria and with two prey species, significant differences in the functional responses among and between different populations occurring in the native and the invaded range were found. Among populations in the native range, the functional response indicated little variation, and fish always showed a Type II response, irrespective of the type of prey used. In the introduced range, populations showed a Type II response when fed chironomid larvae as prey, while a Type III response was observed when feeding Daphnia magna. Populations in the invaded range consumed overall more prey when fed D. magna compared to the populations in the native range. When feeding chironomid larvae, no consistent trend was observed. Context dependencies as well as species-specific traits and fish density most likely play an important role when comparing the functional response between populations occurring in their native and invaded ranges.

However, invasion can also impact native plants through recruitment limitation mechanisms. We examined the effects of Cenchrus ciliaris L. (buffel grass, an alien pasture species) on the seed viability and germination of two native perennial shrubs (Acacia tetragonophylla and A. victoriae) in arid woodlands of central Australia. Dormancy, germination rate and seed viability were assessed using laboratory-based germination assays on seeds collected from the soil and mature shrubs in: (1) woodland invaded by buffel grass and (2) areas in which buffel grass had been removed and reinvasion prevented for at least 7years. There was a twofold increase in viability of A. victoriae seeds in buffel grass-removed compared with invaded sites, and a faster germination rate (T-50) for A. tetragonophylla in buffel grass-removed sites. Acacia victoriae seed mass was reduced by approximately 25% in invaded areas, associated with decomposed or absent embryos. Invasion may limit native recruitment by reducing the viability and germination rate of native seeds prior to dispersal from parent plants. Reduced seed viability would reduce seed bank accumulation and total available seed for A. victoriae, while slower germination rates would minimise the efficiency by which A. tetragonophylla responds to sporadic rainfall events. Both mechanisms could lead to long term declines in native plant populations. Reduced seed viability would compound interference of buffel grass on recruiting plants.

Non-native species dominate herpetofaunal community patterns in both native and non-native habitat patches in urban Miami-Dade County	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Amphibian; Conservation; Florida; Fragmentation; Invasive species; Reptile	PLANT INVASION; RICHNESS; REPTILES; AMPHIBIANS; DIVERSITY; FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPE; IMPACTS; ISLANDS	Land use change and invasive species are two of the leading causes of native biodiversity loss, yet our understanding of how these interact in urban centers is limited. In South Florida (USA), urbanization and increased anthropogenic pressure has led to massive land conversion and species introductions. South Florida has the largest number of established non-native reptile and amphibian species in the world, while detection of many native species has decreased. Native species may be adapted to the unique and rare habitats of South Florida such as the pine rocklands, which have been reduced to 2% of their original extent. We conducted surveys for reptiles and amphibians in 15 pairs of native/non-native parks to examine the interaction between habitat modification and herpetofaunal invasion. Less than 10% of the individuals recorded were native, and we found no difference in the relative abundance or richness of native species between native and non-native parks. Community analyses indicate that only 9% of the total variance in herpetofaunal community composition is between native and non-native parks, and that even this difference is driven by non-native species. The brahminy blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus), the most widely introduced snake species in the world, is the best indicator of native habitat patches, and two invasive lizards from the Caribbean (Anolis sagrei and A. equestris) are the best indicators of non-native habitat. These results demonstrate that non-native reptiles and amphibians dominate both non-native and native habitat patches in Miami-Dade County.	[Clements, Stephanie L.; Catania, Shantel V.

Here, using paired measurements, we compared the temperatures under the canopy versus in the open at 98 sites across 5 continents. We show that forests function as a thermal insulator, cooling the understory when ambient temperatures are hot and warming the understory when ambient temperatures are cold. The understory versus open temperature offset is magnified as temperatures become more extreme and is of greater magnitude than the warming of land temperatures over the past century. Tree canopies may thus reduce the severity of warming impacts on forest biodiversity and functioning.

Dubois at Trinil in 1891, over 200 hominid dentognathic remains have been collected from the Early to Middle Pleistocene deposits of Java, Indonesia, forming the largest palaeoan-thropological collection in South East Asia. Most of these fossils are currently attributed to H. erectus. However, because of the substantial morphological and metric variation in the Indonesian assemblage, some robust specimens, such as the partial mandibles Sangiran 5 and Sangiran 6a, were formerly variably allocated to other taxa (Meganthropus palaeojavanicus, Pithecanthropus dubius, Pongo sp.). To resolve the taxonomic uncertainty surrounding these and other contentious Indonesian hominid specimens, we used occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA) to reconstruct their chewing kinematics; we also used various morphometric approaches based on microtomography to examine the internal dental structures. Our results confirm the presence of Meganthropus as a Pleistocene Indonesian hominid distinct from Pongo, Gigantopithecus and Homo, and further reveal that Dubois's H. erectus paratype molars from 1891 are not hominin (human lineage), but instead are more likely to belong to Meganthropus.

However, there are no global analyses that have quantitatively assessed if global crop production has actually tended towards synchronized failure historically. We show that synchronization in production within major commodities such as maize and soybean has declined in recent decades, leading to increased global stability in production of these crops. In contrast, synchrony between crops has peaked, making global calorie production more unstable. Under the hypothetical event of complete synchronized failure we estimate simultaneous global production losses for rice, wheat, soybean and maize to lie between -17% and -34%. We find that offsetting these losses by reducing variation in production across all growing locations, and raising production ceilings in breadbaskets, are far more effective than strategies focused on reducing variability in breadbaskets alone or closing production gaps in low productive locations. Our findings suggest that maintaining asynchrony in the food system requires a central place in discussions of future food demand under mean climate change, population growth and consumption trends.

Natural and sexual selection on cuticular hydrocarbons: a quantitative genetic analysis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						sexual signals; costs; cuticular hydrocarbon; desiccation; female choice; Teleogryllus oceanicus	DESICCATION RESISTANCE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; WATER-BALANCE; TRADE-OFFS; DROSOPHILA; EVOLUTION; CRICKETS; POPULATION; DIVERGENCE; TRAITS	While the reproductive benefits of sexual displays have been widely studied, we have relatively limited evidence of the fitness costs associated with most display traits. Insect cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles are sexually' selected traits that also protect against desiccation. These two functions are thought to oppose each other, with investment in particular compounds believed to increase attractiveness at the expense of compounds that protect against water loss. We investigated this potential trade-off in a quantitative genetic framework using the Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. Several compounds were significantly genetically correlated with either attractiveness or desiccation resistance. Of these compounds, one was negatively genetically correlated with attractiveness but positively genetically' correlated with desiccation resistance. Furthermore, scoring each individual's overall CHC profile for its level of attractiveness and desiccation resistance indicated a negative genetic correlation between these multivariate phenotypes. Together, our results provide evidence for a genetic trade-off between sexually and naturally selected functions of the CHC profile. We suggest that the production of an attractive CHC profile may be costly for males, but highlight the need for further work to support this finding experimentally. Genetic covariation between the CHC profile and attractiveness suggests that females can gain attractive sons through female choice.

Habituation underpins preference for mates with novel phenotypes in the guppy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						habituation; sexual selection; mate choice; sensory bias; genetic diversity; frequency dependence	SEXUAL SELECTION; POECILIA-RETICULATA; FEMALE GUPPIES; CHOICE; EVOLUTION; TRAITS; MALES; RESPONSIVENESS; POLYMORPHISM; FAMILIARITY	Populations harbour enormous genetic diversity in ecologically important traits. Understanding the processes that maintain this variation is a long-standing challenge in evolutionary biology. Recent evidence indicates that a mating preference for novel sexual signals can be a powerful force maintaining genetic diversity. However, the proximate underpinnings of this preference, and its generality, remain unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that preference for novel sexual signals is underpinned by habituation, a nearly ubiquitous form of learning whereby individuals become less responsive to repetitive stimuli. We use the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), in which male colour patterns are diverse yet heritable. We show that repeated exposure to males with a given colour pattern reduces female interest in males with that pattern, and that interest recovers following brief isolation. These results fulfil two core criteria of habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation and fatigue, we also demonstrate stimulus specificity and dishabituation. These results provide the first evidence that habituation causes a preference for novel sexual signals, addressing the mechanistic underpinnings of this mating preference. Given the pervasiveness of habituation among taxa and sensory contexts, our findings suggest that preference for novelty may play an underappreciated role in mate choice and the maintenance of genetic variation.

Prey body mass and richness underlie the persistence of a top predator	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						allometric functional response; generalist predator; competition; diversity; body mass; Jensen's inequality	FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES; FOOD WEBS; STABILITY; SIZE; COMPETITION; VALUES; LINKS	Predators and prey often differ in body mass. The ratio of predator to prey body mass influences the predator's functional response (how consumption varies with prey density), and therefore, the strength and stability of the predator-prey interaction. The persistence of food chains is maximized when prey species arc neither too big nor too small relative to their predator. Nonetheless, we do not know if (i) food web persistence requires that all predator-prey body mass ratios are intermediate, nor (ii) if this constraint depends on prey diversity. We experimentally quantified the functional response for a single predator consuming prey species of different body masses. We used the resultant allometric functional response to parametrize a food web model. We found that predator persistence was maximized when the minimum prey size in the community was intermediate, but as prey diversity increased, the minimum body size could take a broader range of values. This last result occurs because of Jensen's inequality: the average handling time for multiple prey of different sizes is higher than the handling time of the average sized prey. Our results demonstrate that prey diversity mediates how differences between predators and prey in body mass determine food web stability.

Adaptive responses and local stressor mitigation drive coral resilience in warmer, more acidic oceans	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						climate change; ocean acidification; adaptation; acclimatization; super corals; resilience	CLIMATE-CHANGE; MONTIPORA-CAPITATA; KANEOHE BAY; REEF; ACIDIFICATION; RECRUITMENT; DIVERSITY; CHEMISTRY; HAWAII; CARBON	Coral reefs have great biological and socioeconomic value, but are threatened by ocean acidification, climate change and local human impacts. The capacity for corals to adapt or acclimatize to novel environmental conditions is unknown but fundamental to projected reef futures. The coral reefs of Kane'ohe Bay, Hawai'i were devastated by anthropogenic insults from the 1930s to 1970s. These reefs experience naturally reduced pH and elevated temperature relative to many other Hawaiian reefs whiCh are not expected to face similar conditions for decades. Despite catastrophic loss in coral cover owing to human disturbance, these reefs recovered under low pH and high temperature within 20 years after sewage input was diverted. We compare the pH and temperature tolerances of three dominant Hawaiian coral species from within Kaneohe Bay to conspecifics from a nearby control site and show that corals from Kane'ohe are far more resistant to acidification and warming. These results show that corals can have different pH and temperature tolerances among habitats and understanding the mechanisms by which coral cover rebounded within two decades under projected future ocean conditions will be critical to management. Together these results indicate that reducing human stressors offers hope for reef resilience and effective conservation over coming decades.

However, ecological processes are subject to contemporary evolutionary change, and the degree to which predation affects diversity ultimately depends on the interplay between evolution and ecology. Furthermore, ecological interactions that influence species coexistence can be altered by reciprocal coevolution especially in the case of antagonistic interactions such as predation or parasitism. Here we used an experimental evolution approach to test for the role of initial trait variation in the prey population and coevolutionary hisory of the predator in the ecological dynamics of a two-species bacterial community predated by a ciliate. We found that initial trait variation both at the bacterial and ciliate level enhanced species coexistence, and that subsequent trait evolutionary trajectories depended on the initial genetic diversity present in the population. Our findings provide further support to the notion that the ecology-centric view of diversity maintenance must be reinvestigated in light of recent findings in the field of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

A phylogenomic rodent tree reveals the repeated evolution of masseter architectures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						convergence; hystricomorphy; parallel evolution; Rodentia; stochastic character mapping; ultraconserved elements	MASTICATORY MUSCLE ARCHITECTURE; AVIAN TREE; RADIATION; THOUSANDS; LAONASTES; MAMMALIA; ANATOMY; PACKAGE	Understanding the number of times a trait has evolved is a necessary foundation for comprehending its potential relationships with selective regimes, developmental constraints and evolutionary diversification. Rodents make up over 40% of extant mammalian species, and their ecological and evolutionary success has been partially attributed to the increase in biting efficiency that resulted from a forward shift of one or two portions of the masseter muscle from the zygomatic arch onto the rostrum. This forward shift has occurred in three discrete ways, but the number of times it has occurred has never been explicitly quantified. We estimated an ultrametric phylogeny, the first to include all rodent families, using thousands of ultraconserved elements. We examined support for evolutionary relationships among the five rodent suborders and then incorporated relevant fossils, fitted models of character evolution, and used stochastic character mapping to determine that a portion of the masseter muscle has moved forward onto the rostrum at least seven times (with one reversal) during the approximately 70 Myr history of rodents. Combined, the repeated evolution of this key innovation, its increasing prevalence through time, and the species diversity of clades with this character underscores the adaptive value of improved biting efficiency and the relative ease with which some advantageous traits arise.

Using a factorial experimental design, we tested whether tank fish density, local hatchery standard (150 fish . m(-2)) vs. reduced (50 fish . m(-2)) and structural enrichment, a bundle of submerged plastic stripes, had effects on the size of the cerebellar region of the brain. Fish reared at reduced density had smaller cerebella, while structural enrichment had no detectable effects. The density effect on cerebellum, which is involved in locomotion and cognition, confirms previous results from hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon. The lack of detectable positive effects of enrichment, which contrasts some previous studies, provide further evidence for a complex relationship between environmental complexity and brain growth.

Floodplains are typically heterogeneous, creating a situation where environmentally similar habitat patches are more distant geographically than environmentally different ones, what aids the understanding of the importance of each distance to assemblage similarity. Furthermore, flow type and macrophyte presence are important habitat features that influence both environmental conditions and dispersion of species. Thus, we aimed to investigate the influence of these distances on fish assemblage similarity in a Neotropical floodplain, controlling for macrophyte presence and habitat flow. We tested our predictions using three rivers in Upper Parana River floodplain (Baia, Ivinhema and Parana rivers). First, we tested the difference in fish assemblage similarity considering the three factors (flow, macrophyte presence and river) with a PERMANOVA on presence-absence data. We then correlated assemblage similarity (indexed by Jaccard similarity) to environmental distance (indexed by Gower dissimilarity) and geographic distances between sites (in km). Regarding the importance of the environmental heterogeneity, the presence of the macrophytes in lentic environments changed significantly the fish fauna while in semilotic environments, assemblages in sites with and without macrophytes were similar. Both geographic and environmental distances were correlated with similarity in lentic sites and in the absence of macrophytes. With macrophytes and in semilotic environments, the effects of these distances were not significant, because these factors act like environmental filters to pre-adapted species, independently of the dispersal distance.

Access to FW resulted in significantly lower brown trout growth rates over the study period from late summer to early winter as water temperatures declined from 17 degrees C to 1 degrees C. Access to FW resulted in minor differences in occurrence of the most common taxa found in brown trout diets, except for chironomid larvae which were found in c. 60% of the brown trout guts from control treatments but in only 30% of the guts from FW treatments in early winter. Diet consisted primarily of case-bearing and free-living Trichoptera larvae, Asellus, chironomid and Ephemeroptera larvae. Brown trout gut fullness was not significantly affected by access to FW bundles. Brown trout aggregated among FW but were more evenly distributed in channels lacking it. Our results suggest that juvenile brown trout use FW as a shelter at a wide range of water temperatures, and that this behaviour may result in reduced growth rates during their first fall and the onset of their first winter. We also show that prey availability and the composition of brown trout diet changes from late summer to early winter and that FW has a small but significant effect on brown trout diet composition.

We expected that the trophic patterns would be explained by ecomorphological variations among fishes and the availability of food resources. Sampling was conducted quarterly from May 2015 to April 2016 using electrofishing. The stomach contents of 599 individuals belonging to nine species were analyzed using the volumetric method. Thirty-two morphological measures related to trophic ecology and body morphology were then converted into 10 ecomorphological indices. The fish assemblage consumed aquatic (Diptera, Ephemeroptera) and terrestrial (Hymenoptera) insects, other aquatic invertebrates, plants, and detritus/sediment. Therefore, the consumption frequencies of these food items were considered representative of their environmental availability. Furthermore, the fish fauna presented wide trophic niche breadths and little diet overlap. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to classify the fishes' ecomorphological variations into three ecomorphotypes. The benthonic ecomorphotype comprised species with more depressed bodies that eat detritus/algae and dipteran larvae (Ancistrus mullerae and Corydoras carlae). The nektobenthic ecomorphotype included species with elongated bodies and wider heads and mouths that eat aquatic insects and Aeglidae (Trichomycterus stawiarski and Rhamdia spp.). The nektonic ecomorphotype contained species with more compressed bodies and terminal mouths, which are generalist consumers of allochthonous and autochthonous resources. Morphology was significantly correlated with diet, which suggests that ecomorphological variations together with the availability of food in the environment are the main mechanisms underlying trophic segregation and coexistence among species.

Behavioral responses of juvenile white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) to manipulations of nutritional state and predation risk	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Juvenile sturgeon; Behavioral trade-offs; Predation; Foraging	EARLY-LIFE STAGES; HABITAT USE; AVOIDANCE-BEHAVIOR; COLUMBIA RIVER; LAKE STURGEON; COHO SALMON; SHOAL SIZE; VULNERABILITY; CHOICE; HUNGER	Predation and reduced energetic intake have been highlighted as potential mechanisms of recruitment failure in sturgeon populations. These two factors may interact, as foraging carries with it costs of increased predation risk, requiring behavioral trade-offs. We expect that juvenile sturgeon should express predator avoidance behaviors while they are within vulnerable size ranges, yet these behaviors should be modified by nutritional state. To evaluate behavioral trade-offs of juvenile white sturgeon, we designed an experiment to test the interacting effects of acute nutritional state and predation risk on the spatial distribution and movement of small groups (n=6). Groups were assigned to one of four treatments, designed as a full factorial of nutritional state (well-fed or starved 24-h) and predation risk (largemouth bass present or absent), and eight replicates were conducted for each treatment. Juvenile sturgeon displayed a predicted and adaptive response to predation risk and predator aggression levels by reducing activity levels and displaying marked freezing behavior. Sturgeon responded strongly to nutritional deprivation through increased activity and increased near-neighbor distance, which was likely an adaptive response to increase encounter rates with benthic food items. Both of these responses to starvation were suppressed in the presence of predators. This study has provided experimental evidence that predators can abruptly reduce the foraging activity of white sturgeon, possibly reducing growth rates and extending the period of juvenile vulnerability. Future conservation planning should consider the interacting effects of multiple stressors experienced by sturgeon at early life-stages, as introduced predators and degraded foraging habitats may have interacting effects.

Although isolation of marine-derived actinomycete strains is now common, understanding their distribution in the oceans and their adaptation to this environment can be helpful in the selection of isolates for further novel secondary metabolite discovery. This study explores the taxonomic diversity of marine-derived actinomycetes from distinct environments in the coastal areas of the Yucatan Peninsula and their adaptation to the marine environment as a first step towards novel natural product discovery. The use of simple ecological principles, for example, phylogenetic relatedness to previously characterized actinomycetes or seawater requirements for growth, to recognize isolates with adaptations to the ocean in an effort to select for marine-derived actinomycete to be used for further chemical studies. Marine microbial environments are an important source of novel bioactive natural products and, together with methods such as genome mining for detection of strains with biotechnological potential, ecological strategies can bring useful insights in the selection and identification of marine-derived actinomycetes for novel natural product discovery.

Many surveys concerning the fungal grapevine community have been conducted. Nevertheless, exactly how the fungal community arises within the plant and develops from young shoots to mature vines is still unknown. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to investigate the early development of endophytic fungal communities in healthy grapevine branches from 2months to 8years old. More than 3800 fungi belonging to 86 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were isolated from wood samples and assigned to eight age groups. The community composition within the age groups changed and significant differences between young (1year) and old (>1year) branches were found. The former were primarily dominated by ubiquitous, fast-growing fungi like Alternaria spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Cladosporium spp., or Epicoccum nigrum, while communities of perennial branches additionally harbored many grapevine trunk disease (GTD)-associated fungi such as Diplodia seriata or Eutypa lata. This work gives an insight into the early development of fungal communities in grapevine, the nature and composition of primary settlers and core communities, as well as the emergence of GTD-associated fungi in perennial wood. This information may help grapevine growers to better estimate the risk in relation to the applied training system, producing mainly old branches or young shoots.

The two strains were very similar in their core genome but one strain, Pf4, contained three gene clusters for the production of secondary metabolites, i.e., pyoluteorin (plt), pyrrolnitrin (prn), and rhizoxin (rzx), that were missing in the other strain, Pf11. The difference between the two strains was not due to simple insertion events, but to a relatively complex differentiation focused on the accessory genomes. In dual culture assays, both strains inhibited nearly all tested fungal strains, yet Pf4 exerted a significantly stronger fungal growth inhibition than Pf11. In addition to the differences in the secondary metabolite production associated genes abundance, the genome of Pf4 was more stable, smaller in size and with a lower number of transposons. The preservation of a dynamic equilibrium within natural populations of different strains comprised in the same species but differing in their secondary metabolite repertoire and in their genome stability may be functional to the adaptation to environmental changes.

We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effects of changes in the mite culture growth and population of two HDM species on HDM microbiome composition and fitness. Growing cultures of laboratory and industrial allergen-producing populations of Dermatophagoides farinae (DFL and DFT, respectively) and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DPL and DPT, respectively) were sampled at four time points. The symbiotic microorganisms of the mites were characterized by DNA barcode sequencing and quantified by qPCR using universal/specific primers. The population growth of mites and nutrient contents of mite bodies were measured and correlated with the changes in bacteria in the HDM microbiome. The results showed that both the population and culture age significantly influenced the microbiome profiles. Cardinium formed 93% and 32% of the total sequences of the DFL and DFT bacterial microbiomes, respectively, but this bacterial species was less abundant in the DPL and DPT microbiomes. Staphylococcus abundance was positively correlated with increased glycogen contents in the bodies of mites, and increased abundances of Aspergillus, Candida, and Kocuria were correlated with increased lipid contents in the bodies of mites. The xerophilic fungus Wallemia accounted for 39% of the fungal sequences in the DPL microbiome, but its abundance was low in the DPT, DFL, and DFT microbiomes. With respect to the mite culture age, we made three important observations: the mite population growth from young cultures was 5-8-fold higher than that from old cultures; specimens from old cultures had greater abundances of fungi and bacteria in their bodies; and yeasts predominated in the gut contents of specimens from young cultures, whereas filamentous mycelium prevailed in specimens from old cultures. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mites derive nutrients through associations with microorganisms.

NOV.; MICROBIOTA; SEQUENCE; SEARCH	The digestive tract of medicinal leeches from commercial suppliers has been investigated previously and comprises of a relatively simple bacterial community. However, the microbiome of medicinal leeches collected directly from the natural habitat has not been examined. In this study, we characterized the bacterial community in the digestive tract (anterior crop, posterior crop, and intestine) of the European medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, collected from the Danube river using culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches. Culture-independent approach confirmed that the digestive tract of H. verbana carries a relatively simple bacterial community with species richness in the individual samples ranging from 43 to164. The dominant bacterial taxon was Mucinivorans sp. (49.7% of total reads), followed by Aeromonas sp. (18.7% of total reads). Several low abundance taxa, new for H. verbana, such as Phreatobacter, Taibaiella, Fluviicola, Aquabacterium, Burkholderia, Hydrogenophaga, Wolinella, and unidentified Chitinophagia, were also detected. The aerobic culturing approach showed Aeromonas veronii (Proteobacteria), the known leech symbiont, as the most dominant taxon followed by several Pseudomonas and Acidovorax spp. No significant differences in the bacterial community composition were detected among different parts of the digestive tract of individual leeches. However, the overall composition of the bacterial community among individual specimen varied significantly and this is possibly due to differences in leech age, feeding status, and blood source. Our results showed that the core bacterial community of H. verbana collected from the natural habitat is similar to that reported from the digestive tract of commercially supplied leeches maintained in the laboratory.

Seasonal and spatial variability in total and active bacterial communities from desert soil	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Ribosome; Next generation sequencing; Soil; Arid; Illumine; Ecosystem engineer; Fertility island	RIBOSOMAL-RNA; RESOURCE ISLANDS; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; MICROORGANISMS; ABUNDANCE; MOISTURE; ARCHAEA	Studies describing the diversity of microorganisms in drylands are based mainly on the total (DNA), and seldom on the metabolically active (RNA) portion of the bacterial communities. We predicted that in desert environments, the majority of bacteria would display low activity during the hot and dry season, resulting in comparable diversity of the total and active communities. But during the wet periods, when rain activates certain bacterial groups, the total and active communities would differ. To test our predictions, the rDNA and rRNA extracted from desert soil, were analysed in samples collected during the dry and wet seasons from three patches: under the canopy of the dominant shrub, near ant nests and in open patches. The results disproved our predictions because the RNA- and DNA-based communities significantly differed in the dry season but matched very well in the wet season samples. Further comparative analysis of the rRNA/rDNA ratio revealed the composition and structure of metabolically active members within the patches' communities. Our results suggest that in desert environments, the activity of soil bacterial communities is not restricted by water availability or patch types and could be fully described only, by concomitant analysis of the total and active members.

Scale dependency of dispersal limitation, environmental filtering and biotic interactions determine the diversity and composition of oribatid mite communities	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Body size; Community assembly; Deglaciation; Grain size; Spatial scale	SOIL MICROARTHROPODS; SPECIES COOCCURRENCE; ASSEMBLY PROCESSES; ACARI; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; ARTHROPODS; INVASION; ARBOREAL; RULES	It has long been established that the spatial scale of inquiry affects the ecological patterns that are revealed. However, studies of the ecological drivers underlying the assembly of soil animal communities rarely adopt a mull-scale perspective. Here, we quantified the distribution of oribatid richness along a chronosequence of temperate hardwood forests in a deglaciated region of eastern North America and analyzed variation in oribatid community structure at two grain sizes: 0.1 m(2) and 900 m(2), and two spatial extents: 20-150 m and 80-420 km. At the largest spatial scale, oribatid richness was similar among sites in the chronosequence. This suggests that oribatid mites faced minimal dispersal limitation during recolonization of deglaciated regions, likely due to long-distance passive dispersal events enabled by their small body size. However, dispersal limitation affected the community assembly at the spatial scale of 80-420 km, whereby the magnitude of dispersal limitation varied with body size and habitat type. Specifically, large-bodied mites in the litter layer experienced a stronger dispersal limitation than did small-bodied ones; and small-bodied mites were limited by dispersal in the mineral soil but not in the litter layer. Environmental filtering, particularly water content in litter and soil, played an important role in shaping oribatid mite communities at both spatial scales. In contrast, competition among oribatid species and biotic interactions with other soil microarthropods appeared to have little influence on oribatid mite community assembly, even within the smallest spatial scale. A majority of the local oribatid assemblages exhibited random coexistence patterns, with a small fraction (14%) of the assemblages exhibiting patterns of segregation consistent with competition among oribatid species. Overall, our study highlights the scale dependency of dispersal limitation during oribatid community assembly, and calls for future comparative studies to encompass a wider range of body size and habitat types.

Neither species geographic range size, climatic envelope, nor intraspecific leaf trait variability capture habitat specialization in a hyperdiverse Amazonian forest	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						climatic envelope; functional traits; geographic range; habitat association; intraspecific trait variability; topographic gradient; tropical trees	DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; SPATIAL SCALES; NICHE BREADTH; ASSOCIATIONS; EVOLUTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; PHYLOGENIES; PLASTICITY; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES	Many plant species exhibit strong association with topographic habitats at local scales. However, the historical biogeographic and physiological drivers of habitat specialization are still poorly understood, and there is a need for relatively easy-to-measure predictors of species habitat niche breadth. Here, we explore whether species geographic range, climatic envelope, or intraspecific variability in leaf traits is related to the degree of habitat specialization in a hyperdiverse tropical tree community in Amazonian Ecuador. Contrary to our expectations, we find no effect of the size of species geographic ranges, the diversity of climate a species experiences across its range, or intraspecific variability in leaf traits in predicting topographic habitat association in the similar to 300 most common tropical tree species in a 25-ha tropical forest plot. In addition, there was no phylogenetic signal to habitat specialization. We conclude that species geographic range size, climatic niche breadth, and intraspecific variability in leaf traits fail to capture the habitat specialization patterns observed in this highly diverse tropical forest.

Therefore, it is of vital importance to understand how carbon stocks and community assembly recover after slash-and-burn events in tropical second growth forests. We inventoried a chronosequence of 15 1-ha plots in lowland tropical forest of the central Congo Basin and evaluated changes in aboveground and soil organic carbon stocks and in tree species diversity, functional composition, and community-weighted functional traits with succession. We aimed to track long-term recovery trajectories of species and carbon stocks in secondary forests, comparing 5 to 200 + year old secondary forest with reference primary forest. Along the successional gradient, the functional composition followed a trajectory from resource acquisition to resource conservation, except for nitrogen-related leaf traits. Despite a fast, initial recovery of species diversity and functional composition, there were still important structural and carbon stock differences between old growth secondary and pristine forest, which suggests that a full recovery of secondary forests might take much longer than currently shown. As such, the aboveground carbon stocks of 200 + year old forest were only 57% of those in the pristine reference forest, which suggests a slow recovery of aboveground carbon stocks, although more research is needed to confirm this observation. The results of this study highlight the need for more in-depth studies on forest recovery in Central Africa, to gain insight into the processes that control biodiversity and carbon stock recovery.

Here, we explore geographic variation in floodplain forest avifaunas, specifically regarding one of the most striking aspects of the Amazon: the diversity of river "colors" (i.e., types, based on the color of the water). We sampled the avifauna at 30 sites, located in 17 different rivers (nine black- and eight whitewater), in the Rio Negro basin, northwestern Brazil. Our sampling comprised ten 15-min point-counts per site, distributed every 500-1000 m along the river. We recorded a total of 352 bird species, many of which occurred in both river types. Although bird species richness was similar among rivers, we found significant differences in species composition. Nearly 14 percent of the species were significantly associated with one or the other river type. Most floodplain forest specialists occurred predominantly in whitewater rivers, whereas species that are typically associated with white-sand habitats occurred in blackwater. Despite significant distinctions between river types, occurrence patterns and levels of habitat association differed among indicator species and may vary in the same species throughout its global distribution. There were also "intermediate" avifauna in some of our sites, suggesting that continuous parameters characterizing river types structure species turnover. The water color-based classification of Amazonian rivers represents a simple and powerful predictor of the floodplain forest avifauna, offering a stimulating starting point for understanding patterns of floodplain bird distributions and for prioritizing conservation efforts in these overlooked habitats. in Portuguese is available with online material.

Here, we determine the effects of forest disturbance and succession on selected soil chemical properties using two different approaches, before-after-control-impact (BACI) and space-for-time (SFT) substitution, and the threatened Atlantic Forest biome as model. We assessed with BACI the long-term (37-year) effects of clear cutting on soil properties by comparing data from two topsoil surveys (1978-2017) divided into two treatments: a preserved old growth forest (control) and an adjacent forest that was experimentally cleared with full tree removal (clear-cut). We examined with SFT the relationship between stand age and soil properties using soil data from three old growth and 13 s growth forests ranging from 7 to 33 years. We found no significant differences between treatments for any soil property or significant changes in phosphorus, potassium, and calcium + magnesium over time. In contrast, pH increased and aluminum decreased in both areas. No relation was found between forest age and most of soil properties, with the exception of potassium which returned to old growth forest levels after 20 years of natural succession, and pH. BACI indicated that deforestation of old growth forest caused no significant effects on soil chemical properties after 37 years of regeneration. SFT demonstrated that soil properties did not change significantly during forest regeneration on formerly disturbed lands. Our findings indicate that natural nutrient-depleted lowland forests were overall resistant to deforestation followed by passive regeneration at landscape scale. in Portuguese is available with online material.

The evolutionary processes that allowed these lineages to disperse and adapt into new environments are far from being resolved. To better understand these processes, we propose an integrated approach, based on the eco-physio-morphological traits of two sister species with adjacent distributions along a rainfall gradient. We used wood anatomical traits, plant hydraulics (vulnerability to cavitation, wood volumetric water content, and hydraulic capacitance), and growth data from the natural habitat, in a common garden, to compare species with known phylogeny, very similar morphologically, but occupying contrasting habitats: Erythrophleum ivorense (wet forest) and Erythrophleum suaveolens (moist forest and forest gallery). We identified some slight differences in wood anatomical traits between the two species associated with strong differences in hydraulics, growth, and overall species distribution. The moist forest species, E. suaveolens, had narrower vessels and intervessel pits, and higher vessel cell-wall reinforcement than E. ivorense. These traits allow a high resistance to cavitation and a continuous internal water supply of the xylem during water shortage, allowing a higher fitness during drought periods, but limiting growth. Our results confirm a trade-off between drought tolerance and growth, controlled by subtle adaptations in wood traits, as a key mechanism leading to the niche partitioning between the two Erythrophleum species. The generality of this trade-off and its importance in the diversification of the African tree flora remains to be tested. Our integrated eco-physio-morpho approach could be the way forward.

Canopy tree preference by insectivorous birds in shade-coffee farms: Implications for migratory bird conservation	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						coffee agroforestry; Colombia; foraging; Nicaragua; pest control; plant-animal interactions; tropical conservation	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; PLANTATIONS; HABITAT; FOREST; WINTER; SILVOPASTURES; AGROFORESTRY; POPULATIONS	Land converted to coffee agriculture occupies >5 million hectares of what was once prime overwintering natural habitat in the American Neotropics for migrating birds. When tree canopy is retained or restored (i.e., shade-grown), coffee farms can serve as habitat refuge for wildlife. Yet few studies have examined whether canopy tree identity impacts habitat quality for biodiversity. Specifically, whether or not certain tree species are disproportionately important for foraging insectivorous birds remains unclear. In this study, we quantified bird foraging activity on 22 tree species in two Latin American Bird Friendly (c) coffee farms. Specifically, we conducted timed observations on focal trees to determine 1) tree preferences, 2) foraging bird abundance, 3) foraging time, and 4) species richness of birds using each canopy tree species. We found that birds did not forage randomly, and instead exhibited preferences for particular native tree species. Nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae were consistently used more frequently, supported more resident and migratory birds for longer periods of time, and supported more bird species than trees in other families. We posit that the potential mechanism contributing to tree preferences is the increase in insect abundance and diversity that provide high-quality food for insectivores but do not present pest problems for coffee. Thus, tree species that support insects may provide multiple benefits for farmers in the form of bottom-up soil fertilization and top-down pest control. This study provides evidence that agroforestry land can be improved for birds of conservation concern by prioritizing canopy tree species that help birds and farm productivity.

Studies on mountain ecosystems are increasingly needed, as mountains are highly threatened despite providing ecosystem services, such as water supply for half of the human population. We aimed to understand the patterns and drivers of alpha and beta diversities of aquatic invertebrates in headwater streams along an altitudinal gradient in the second largest South American mountain range, the Espinhaco mountains. Headwater streams were selected at each 100 m of elevation along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 800 to 1400 m asl, where three substrate types per stream were sampled: leaf litter, gravel, and cobbles. Environmental variables were sampled to represent local riparian canopy cover, instream physical habitat, water quality, climatic data, and land use. Generalized linear models and mixed models were used to test relationships between altitude and the richness and abundance of invertebrates and to assess the influence of environmental variables on the same metrics. Patterns of spatial variation in aquatic invertebrate assemblages along the altitudinal gradient were assessed using multiplicative beta diversity partitioning. The richness and abundance of aquatic invertebrates decreased with increasing altitude, whereas beta diversity increased with increasing altitude. Significant differences in assemblage composition and in relative abundance of invertebrates were observed for both substrates and altitude. We thus show that the high regional beta diversity in aquatic ecosystems in the studied site is due to the high turnover among areas. in Portuguese is available with online material.

However, little is known about the extent of road edge effects or their influence on the movements of tropical understory animal species. Here, we used forest rats to address the following questions: (a) Does the occupancy of rats differ from road edges to forest interior within logged forests? (b) Do roads inhibit the movements of rats within these forests? We established trapping grids along a road edge-to-forest interior gradient at four roads and in three control sites within a logged forest in Sabah, Malaysia. To quantify the probability of road crossing, rats were captured, translocated across a road, and then recaptured on subsequent nights. We caught 216 individuals of eight species on 3,024 trap nights. Rat occupancy did not differ across the gradient from road edge to interior, and 48 percent of the 105 translocated individuals crossed the roads and were recaptured. This proportion was not significantly different from that of rats returning in control sites (38% of 60 individuals), suggesting that small roads were not barriers to rat movements within logged forests. Subadults were significantly more likely to return from translocation than adults in both road and control sites. Our results are encouraging for the ecology of small mammal communities in heavily logged forests, because small logging roads do not restrict the movements of rats and therefore are unlikely to create an edge effect or influence habitat selection.

Migration can rapidly alter the relative influence of stochastic processes, species interactions, or environmental factors in shaping communities across seasons. Here, we describe seasonal dynamics in the phylogenetic and functional diversity of waterbirds in Mai Po Wetland, a subtropical region with significant and predictable temporal variation in climate and migratory bird density. Phylogenetic alpha diversity varied seasonally, exhibiting a clustered structure (indicative of environmental filtering) in summer, and over-dispersed structure (indicative of biotic filtering) in winter. Phylogenetic diversity in spring and autumn exhibited a more intermediate, random structure, consistent with stochastic arrivals and departures of migrants. Functional diversity was clustered in spring but showed over-dispersion in the other three seasons. Phylogenetic beta diversity in summer and winter assemblages was characterized by two distinct groups, while spring and autumn assemblages were mixed. Our results suggest that waterbird assemblages were primarily shaped by interspecific competition in winter, while random processes tended to shape assemblages in spring and fall. Environmental factors played a more important role in summer, during periods of high heat stress. In addition, species co-occurrence patterns were significantly more strongly related to phylogenetic similarity in winter than in summer. Our results suggest that the relative importance of assemblage mechanisms can vary seasonally in response to changing environmental conditions, suggesting that studies attempting to infer a single dominant assembly mechanism may ignore important assembly processes. Temporal shifts in assembly mechanisms may play an important role in maintaining diversity in subtropical and temperate wetlands and perhaps also in other dynamic systems.

The infestation probability, prevalence, and intensity of mites vary among species and habitats. Mites of the genus Endotrombicula are known to infest African and Malagasy frogs. However, the factors leading to an increase in the probability of mite infestation are unknown. To test for inter- and intraspecific differences in infestation probability and its potential correlation with sex, age, habitat preferences, and/or season within a species-rich West African leaf-litter frog assemblage, we examined more than 6,800 individual frogs for the presence of mites throughout two independent time increments, 1999-2000 and 2016-2017. We found only members of the leaf-litter frog genus Phyrnobatrachus to be infested, while other syntopically occurring genera were not affected. Within Phrynobatrachus, only four out of eight species were infested. Mites prevalence differed between species (highest P. phyllophilus, followed by P. alleni), sex (males higher than females in P. alleni and P. phyllophilus), and age (adults higher than juveniles in P. alleni), as well as season (more mites during wet than dry season in P. phyllophilus). The prevalence of mite infestation did not influence mate choice in P. alleni. Increased humidity showed a clear positive effect on infestation prevalence. We also detected a marked decrease in the prevalence of mites from 1999-2000 to 2016-2017, a period during which climatological changes within the study area have been reported with a tendency toward drier conditions. The decrease in mite infestation prevalence over time might be a signal of increasingly drier conditions.

In this paper, we examined YouTube (YT) videos featuring the behaviour of red (Sciurus vulgaris) and grey (Sciurus carolinensis) squirrels in Europe, in both urban and forest habitats. Our study shows that specific behaviours of these squirrels, such as aggression, grooming and calling, have frequently been recorded on YT videos. The present paper uses this open data for the first time to compare differences between the frequency of some types of behaviour in two habitats. Based on detrended correspondence analysis, we show a significant difference in sets of behaviours between two squirrel species. Our investigation show that YT can be a source for monitoring the behaviour of wild species, especially in urban habitats, thus affording insights into the species plasticity of urban individuals. YT, as part of citizen science, is a potential source of information in behavioural ecology.

Distribution models of estuarine fish species: The effect of sampling bias, species ecology and threshold selection on models' accuracy	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Species distribution models; Fish species; Estuaries; Model accuracy; Ensemble; Threshold	PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE; HABITAT MODELS; USE PATTERNS; R-PACKAGE; UNCERTAINTY; RICHNESS; CLIMATE; SIZE; CONSERVATION; SUITABILITY	Species distribution models (SDMs) relate presence/absence data to environmental variables, allowing to predict species environmental requirements and potential distribution. They have been increasingly used in fields such as ecology, biogeography and evolution, and often support conservation priorities and strategies. Thus, it becomes crucial to understand how trustworthy and reliable their predictions are. Different approaches, such as using ensemble methods (combining forecasts of different single models), or applying the most suitable threshold to transform continuous probability maps into species presences or absences, have been used to reduce model-based uncertainty. Taking into account the influence of biased sampling imprecision in species location, small datasets and species ecological characteristics, may also help to detect and compensate for uncertainty in the model building process. To investigate the effect of applying an ensemble approach, several threshold selection criteria and different datasets representing seasonal and spatial sampling bias, on models' accuracy, SDMs were built for four estuarine fish species with distinct use of the estuarine systems. Overall, predictions obtained with the ensemble approach were more accurate. Variability in accuracy metrics obtained with the nine threshold selection criteria applied was more pronounced for species with low prevalence and when sensitivity was calculated. Higher values of accuracy measures were registered with the threshold that maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity, and the threshold where the predicted prevalence equals the observed, whereas the 0.5 cut-off was unreliable, originating the lowest values for these metrics. Accuracy of models created from a spatially biased sampling was overall higher than accuracy of models created with a seasonally biased sampling or with the multi-year database created and this pattern was consistently obtained for marine migrant species, which use estuaries as nursery areas, presenting a seasonally and regular use of these ecosystems. The ecological dependence between these fish species and estuaries may add difficulties in the model building process, and needs to be taken into account, to improve their accuracy. The present study highlights the need for a thorough analysis of the critical underlying issues of the complete model building process to predict the distribution of estuarine fish species, due to the particular and dynamic nature of these ecosystems.

An EM-type approach for classification of bivariate MALDI-MS data and identification of high fertility markers	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						biomarkers; bivariate beta distribution; latent labels; mass spectrometry; repeated measures	TOF MASS-SPECTROMETRY; DESORPTION IONIZATION; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; LASER-DESORPTION; SINGLE-EMBRYO; MANIPULATION; ENDOMETRIAL; PROTEINS; SPECTRA; OOCYTE	Dairy cows are responsible for a fair amount of gas emissions in the atmosphere (mainly methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide), as well as waste outputs. Therefore, identifying high-fertility breeding cows and increasing fertility rates can diminish pollution and help minimize the effect of global warming and improve the environmental impact of the farming system. As a step to achieve this goal, changes in the lipid composition of the bovine uterus exposed to greater (LF-LCL group) or lower (SF-SCL group) concentrations of progesterone during postovulation were investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Two measurements were made for each cow, and after preprocessing the data, the measurements available to analysis consist of relative intensities at significant 76 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values identifying specific ions in the spectra. Due to the small sample size, seven cows in the LF-LCL group and 10 cows in the SF-SCL group, the usual methods could not discriminate between groups. A model-based approach was therefore proposed, and due to the discrete nature of the data, a truncated mixture of bivariate beta distributions was fitted to the data using an expectation-maximization algorithm. However, unlike the usual approach for mixture density estimation problems, to each 76 m/z value, we assign an unobserved label shared by all cows in the same group. The role of these labels is similar to the frailty effect in survival models in which all cows in a given group would share some random effect due to group effect. These labels will be used to identify m/z values, which could potentially account for different fertility rates.	[Garcia, N.

Nonetheless, it is still unclear how local movements are related to resource availability and the spatial arrangement of resources. Using resident bird species and migratory bird species outside the migratory period, we examined how the distribution of resources affects the movement patterns of both large terrestrial birds (e.g., raptors, bustards and hornbills) and waterbirds (e.g., cranes, storks, ducks, geese and flamingos). Location Global. Time period 2003-2015. Major taxa studied Birds. Methods We compiled GPS tracking data for 386 individuals across 36 bird species. We calculated the straight-line distance between GPS locations of each individual at the 1-hr and 10-day time-scales. For each individual and time-scale, we calculated the median and 0.95 quantile of displacement. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine the effect of the spatial arrangement of resources, measured as enhanced vegetation index homogeneity, on avian movements, while accounting for mean resource availability, body mass, diet, flight type, migratory status and taxonomy and spatial autocorrelation. Results We found a significant effect of resource spatial arrangement at the 1-hr and 10-day time-scales. On average, individual movements were seven times longer in environments with homogeneously distributed resources compared with areas of low resource homogeneity. Contrary to previous work, we found no significant effect of resource availability, diet, flight type, migratory status or body mass on the non-migratory movements of birds. Main conclusions We suggest that longer movements in homogeneous environments might reflect the need for different habitat types associated with foraging and reproduction. This highlights the importance of landscape complementarity, where habitat patches within a landscape include a range of different, yet complementary resources. As habitat homogenization increases, it might force birds to travel increasingly longer distances to meet their diverse needs.

Exploring potential establishment of marine rafting species after transoceanic long-distance dispersal	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biological invasions; introduced species; Japanese tsunami; long-distance dispersal; marine debris; marine rafting; MaxEnt; species distribution modelling	PLASTIC DEBRIS; INVASIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS; MODELS; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; ECOLOGY; MAXENT	Aim On 11 March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that resulted in the largest known rafting event in recorded history. By spring 2012, marine debris began washing ashore along the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada with a wide range of Asian coastal species attached. We used this unique dataset, where the source region, date of dislodgment and landing location are known, to assess the potential for species invasions by transoceanic rafting on marine debris. Location Northeast Pacific from 20 to 60 degrees N. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Forty-eight invertebrate and algal species recorded on Japanese tsunami marine debris (JTMD). Methods We developed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution models for 48 species recorded on JTMD to predict establishment potential along the Pacific coast from 20 to 60 degrees N. Models were compared within the context of historical marine introductions from Japan to this region to validate the emergence of marine debris as a novel vector for species transfer. Results Overall, 27% (13 species) landed with debris at locations with suitable environmental conditions for establishment and survival, indicating that these species may be able to establish new populations or introduce greater genetic diversity to already established non-native populations. A further 21 species have an environmental match to areas where tsunami debris likely landed, but was not extensively sampled. Nearly 100 Japanese marine species previously invaded the northeastern Pacific, demonstrating this region's environmental suitability for rafting Japanese biota. Historical invasions from Japan are highest in California and largely known from bays and harbours. Main conclusions Marine debris is a novel and growing vector for non-native species introduction. By utilizing a unique dataset of JTMD species, our predictive models show capacity for new transoceanic invasions and can focus monitoring priorities to detect successful long-distance dispersal across the world's oceans.

Systematic variation in North American tree species abundance distributions along macroecological climatic gradients	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						climate; compound distribution; gambin; macroecology; sampling effects; species abundance distributions	MULTIMODEL INFERENCE; RICHNESS; MODEL; ECOSYSTEMS; PATTERNS	Aim The species abundance distribution (SAD) is a fundamental pattern in macroecology. Understanding how SADs vary spatially, and identifying the variables that drive any change, is important from a theoretical perspective because it enables greater understanding of the factors that underpin the relative abundance of species. However, precise knowledge on how the form of SADs varies across large (continental) scales is limited. Here, we use the shape parameter of the gambin distribution to assess how meta-community-scale SAD shape varies spatially as a function of various climatic variables and dataset characteristics. Location Eastern North America (ENA). Time period Present day. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods Using an extensive continental-scale dataset of 863,930 individual trees in plots across ENA sampled using a standardized method, we use a spatial regression framework to examine the effect of temperature and precipitation on the form of the SAD. We also assess whether the prevalence of multimodality in the SAD varies spatially across ENA as a function of temperature and precipitation, in addition to other sample characteristics. Results We found that temperature, precipitation and species richness can explain two-thirds of the variation in tree SAD form across ENA. Temperature had the largest effect on SAD shape, and it was found that increasing temperature resulted in more logseries-like SAD shapes (i.e. SADs with a relatively higher proportion of rarer species). We also found spatial variation in SAD multimodality as a function of temperature and species richness. Main conclusions Our results indicate that temperature is a key environmental driver governing the form of ENA tree meta-community-scale SADs. This finding has implications for our understanding of local-scale variation in tree abundance and suggests that niche factors and environmental filtering are important in the structuring of ENA tree communities at larger scales.

The selection of ornamental garden plants is not random, and certain plant characteristics related to adaptive plant strategies are preferred by horticulture and may promote invasion. We examined the direct and indirect interactions between horticultural use, species adaptive strategies (competitive (C), stress-tolerant (S), and ruderal (R)), native range size and naturalization success. Location Global. Time period From 1492 to the present. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We compiled a dataset of 3,794 plant species including their C-, S- and R-scores, native range size, cultivation in botanic and domestic gardens and whether the species is naturalized in at least one region globally (naturalization incidence). For the 1,711 naturalized species, we also calculated naturalization extent, that is, the number of regions where the species has naturalized. We used phylogenetic path analysis to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of all variables on both naturalization incidence and extent, and the relationships between variables. Results Approximately 87 and 94% of the 1,711 naturalized species were cultivated in botanic or domestic gardens, respectively, compared to c. 55 and 50% of the 2,083 non-naturalized species, respectively. We found a cascading structure among the examined variables: (a) species exhibiting C- or R-selected strategies and having large native ranges tended to be cultivated in domestic and botanic gardens, became naturalized outside their native ranges and occupied more regions in their naturalized ranges; (b) C-, S- and R-scores also had indirect effects on naturalization success, which were mediated by horticultural use and native range size; and (c) cultivation in domestic gardens was the strongest factor examined that could explain plant species' naturalization success. Main conclusions We show that horticulture is not only the major introduction pathway of alien plants, but also that in particular domestic gardens select species predisposed to invade and naturalize.

Soil ejecta from these disturbances can enhance surface nutrients and the resulting depressions accrue organic matter and develop into biological hotspots. Here, we describe a global meta-analysis of studies that assessed the impacts of vertebrate soil disturbance on both biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Location Global land surface. Time period 1941-2016. Major taxa studied Vertebrates. Methods After conducting a systematic literature search, we quantitatively synthesized the findings of 149 published studies that compared disturbed and undisturbed surfaces. Our meta-analysis included 64 engineer species, primarily comprised of rodents and a subset of other mammals. Results We found that vertebrate soil disturbance significantly enhanced soil nitrogen (by 77%) and phosphorus (35%), and the productivity (32%) and recruitment (32%) of vascular plants. Disturbances had a greater cover of bare soil (126%) than undisturbed controls, and higher abundances of secondary vertebrates (1,233%), that use pre-constructed burrows as shelter and foraging grounds. Soil disturbance significantly reduced water run-off (63%) and the abundance of biocrusts (82%). Soil disturbance effects generally intensified with increasing aridity, and the magnitude of soil disturbance effects was not moderated by the area of the disturbance. Disturbances older than 12 months were more distinct from the surrounding matrix than fresh disturbances. The phylogeny of engineers was unrelated to their ecosystem effects, indicating that the same functionality could readily evolve in different taxa. Main conclusions In general, disturbances become localized patches of elevated functioning, providing strong evidence that vertebrate engineers, especially those in drylands, are an important source of environmental heterogeneity.

However, there is growing recognition that risks may be lower and rewards higher at highly disturbed sites isolated from remnant populations, especially when considering support for pollinators, wildlife, and other ecosystem functions. We developed the first decision support tool using expert opinion to assess suitability of different native plant sources, including horticultural cultivars, in two different planting contexts. We assessed the suitability of 761 sources for 72 commonly sold native species in two different planting contexts (small, isolated, highly disturbed sites vs. large, undisturbed sites near remnant populations). Information on genetic and adaptive backgrounds of sources was strikingly lacking, forcing us to exclude one-third of sources from our assessment. While only 3% of cultivars received high suitability scores for use in large, undisturbed sites near remnant populations, 52% received high suitability scores in small, isolated, highly disturbed sites. However, nearly 25% of cultivars had floral or leaf traits that differed from wild plants in ways that may compromise their ability to support pollinators and other wildlife. Forbs and cultivars lacking genetic diversity and source information were most likely to have altered traits. We recommend that native plant breeders and sellers work together to ensure ecosystem function, adaptation, and diversity information is available to consumers, that consumers request this information to drive demand, and that researchers further investigate how context influences risks and benefits of different sources.

In an era of rapid climatic change and continuous widespread clearing, revegetation projects need to focus on producing resilient and long-term self-sustaining populations. Restore and Renew expands current knowledge of genetic provenance via genome-scan data, environmental niche modeling (ENM), and site-specific climate information. The sampling strategy is to obtain leaf tissue representing the distributions of over 100 species commonly used in restoration. We apply generalized dissimilarity modeling to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism datasets from hundreds of samples. Species-specific local provenances are obtained using a model that represents observed patterns of genetic variation across the landscape. Climate modeling is implemented to interpret genetic provenance boundaries in the context of current and future climatic conditions at the specified site. Results are presented in an easy-to-use webtool ( ), where the user simply selects their site of interest and a target species to obtain the size and distribution of local genetic provenance. Although Restore and Renew is not prescriptive, it allows restoration practitioners to make informed decisions on where to source material from, to fulfill their restoration scenario of choice. Two examples, Westringia fruticosa and Acacia suaveolens, are presented to demonstrate how the analytical pipeline responds to different ecological and evolutionary patterns. The webtool has multiple applications for biodiversity management and will continue to evolve with new species and analytical/interpretative outputs.

Here, we integrated two approaches to (1) assess the resilience of pristine dry and wet cerrado grasslands after removal of plants and topsoil and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of different treatments based on the material extracted from pristine grasslands to restore degraded dry and wet grasslands after pine invasion. We used old-growth cerrado grasslands in southeastern Brazil as donor ecosystems and assessed their resilience after the removal of all plants and the upper 5-cm soil layer. To restore both wet and dry grasslands, we tested topsoil translocation, plant transplantation, direct seeding, topsoil translocation + direct seeding, and needle layer removal. Both wet and dry grasslands were resilient to plants and topsoil removal, as evidenced by their fast recovery. The major mechanisms promoting resilience were seed germination in the wet grasslands and resprouting from underground organs in the dry grasslands. Transplantation was the most successful treatment to restore vegetation cover, species richness, and composition in both wet and dry grasslands, especially for herbaceous species. Restoration of the herbaceous layer of cerrado grasslands can be successful using natural ecosystems as donor sites without impairing their resilience in the studied scale. Improving the resilience of degraded dry and wet cerrado grasslands depends on reestablishing the condition to seed germination in the wet grasslands and reintroducing species with the ability to resprout after disturbance in the dry grasslands, attributes that explained the quick recovery of the donor ecosystems.

Effectiveness of passive restoration on density and diversity of regenerating tree species in mixed Dipterocarp forests of Nepal	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						disturbance exclusion; natural regeneration; seedlings and saplings; Shorea robusta	NATURAL REGENERATION; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; GRAZING EXCLUSION; PLANT; LITTER; GROWTH; DYNAMICS; SOIL; ESTABLISHMENT	In many developing countries, the only affordable approach to recover ecosystem structure and function is through passive restoration. We conducted a 3year study of passive restoration in mixed Dipterocarp forests dominated by Shorea robusta to examine the effectiveness of exclusion (fencing and fire suppression) on diversity, density, and richness of regenerating tree seedlings and saplings. We analyzed excluded and disturbed paired sites. We observed exclusion was effective in increasing seedling richness and occurrence of S. robusta and Syzygium cumini. A significant improvement in sapling strata (diversity, density, and richness) from excluding the disturbances was observed. Mean sapling density estimated was about 500% higher in excluded compared to disturbed sites. Probability of occurrence of S. robusta and Dalbergia latifolia saplings increased due to exclusion. That said, presence of exotic species Chromolaena odorata was higher in excluded sites reflecting the need for assisted natural regeneration in forests. This study has demonstrated passive restoration as an effective approach for improving natural regeneration in mixed Dipterocarp forest ecosystems and possibly other similar forest types, and will serve as a reference document for future restoration interventions.

In 2015, vegetation cover of all vascular plant species was determined in 63 plots located on sites that emerged in 2011-2012. The sites had been planted and/or seeded, or were permitted to revegetate spontaneously. The plots were further classified by substrate texture: coarse sediments on the valley bottom and fine ones on the valley slopes. Plots were located randomly along random transects perpendicular to the former lake shore that extended into coarse sediment terraces perched above the floodplain. Additionally, 32 plots were sampled in surrounding native forests near these transects. Data were analyzed by detrended correspondence analysis and by canonical correspondence analysis. Substrate texture, that is whether fine or coarse, appeared to explain most of the variability in vegetation. The distance to forest and successional age, that is time since the site had been drained, were also significant explanatory variables, while assisted restoration by planting and seeding appeared to be insignificant to date. Spontaneous succession on fine sediments led to a species composition approaching that of adjacent natural forests. Invasive species were much less abundant than expected. Spontaneous restoration of vegetation on fine sediments in drained lake bottoms can rapidly produce a desirable vegetation composition and structure. On coarse sediments, active restoration may be useful to accelerate the development of native vegetation communities.

Informing native plant sourcing for ecological restoration: cold-hardiness dynamics, flowering phenology, and survival of Eriogonum umbellatum	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						cold hardiness; common garden; LT50; native plant sourcing; population variability; sulfur-flower buckwheat	GREAT-BASIN DESERT; CHEATGRASS BROMUS-TECTORUM; COASTAL DOUGLAS-FIR; CRESTED WHEATGRASS; GENETIC-VARIATION; FREEZING TOLERANCE; SEED PRODUCTION; BUD-BURST; FROST; PROVENANCE	Despite advances in restoration of degraded lands around the world, native plants are still underutilized. Selection of appropriate plant materials is a critical factor in determining plant establishment and persistence. To better inform decision-making, we examined cold-hardiness dynamics, flowering phenology, and survival among five geographically distinct sulfur-flower buckwheat (Polygonaceae: Eriogonum umbellatum Torr.) populations in a common garden. LT50 (a measure of freezing injury) was determined every 6 weeks across a complete year; one population was also evaluated at the source. Cold-hardiness dynamics were similar across populations, with annual fluctuations in mean LT50 exceeding 40 degrees C. Rate of deacclimation (i.e. loss of cold tolerance) in spring varied across populations and was not related to the elevation from which a population came. Plants were less cold hardy in October 2014 compared to October 2013, likely reflecting a response to colder local conditions in 2013. Although the range of LT50 was similar for a single comparison of common garden versus wild-grown plants, wild-grown plants acclimated and deacclimated earlier than common garden-grown plants. Plants derived from a low-elevation population showed delayed flowering phenology, while high-elevation populations showed earlier flowering phenology, with one high-elevation population having the lowest survival rate in the common garden. These results suggest that while considerable plasticity in seasonal cold-hardiness dynamics occur, population variability in deacclimation and flowering phenology have implications for selection and movement of sulfur-flower buckwheat for ecological restoration.

A cultural approach to wetlands restoration to assess its public acceptance	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						coastal wetlands; cultural ecosystem services; cultural values; ecological restoration; landscape assessment; visitor perception	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; COSTA BRAVA; PERCEPTIONS; VALUES; PREFERENCES; BENEFITS; CHALLENGES; VALUATION; FRAMEWORK	Ecological restoration (ER) of coastal wetlands is extremely important because they provide a huge variety of ecosystem services (ES), but they are the most degraded ecosystems in the world. However, coastal wetlands are usually located in largely modified and densely populated landscapes. Hence their restoration may conflict with cultural values. Therefore, considering the cultural dimension of ER is a way of increasing public acceptance of restoration projects. In this study, we assessed the public acceptance of a restoration project in a coastal wetland of Costa Brava (Spain). We combined the ES framework with a cultural approach, which is capable of considering interdisciplinarity, introducing barely assessed services like tranquility and facilitating further integration of the human dimension in the ES framework. We administered an open-ended questionnaire to 232 visitors and the answers were submitted to a content analysis to get a post hoc classification of services and values. Our results show that visitors undervalue environmental values, while tranquility is the most commonly stated value. Moreover, place attachment is found to be the main driver to influence the perception of the ER. The study concluded that the project enjoys a high public acceptance. However, some disengagement exists between the goals of restoration and visitors' perceptions, and this needs to be addressed. Sharing the decision-making power with stakeholders and informing visitors about ES that are not easily perceived could be appropriate steps to take.

Various Cu concentrations (ranging from 0.05 to 0.25mg/L) were used to assess the sensitivity of L. minor to this metal, using one common strain previously acclimatized to two different levels of light intensity, nutrient enrichment and Cu pre-exposure. Our results showed a phenotypic plastic response of the relative growth rates based on frond number and fresh mass production, and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m). Growth was affected by the three environmental conditions both prior and during Cu exposure, whereas F-v/F-m was mostly affected during Cu exposure. Copper significantly influenced all the parameters measured in the three experiments. Environmental conditions significantly modified L. minor sensitivity to Cu in all experiments, with up to twofold difference depending on the treatment. Growth rate was the parameter that was most impacted. Our study revealed for the first time the existence of phenotypic plasticity in L. minor sensitivity to chemical contamination, and implies that environmental context needs to be taken into account for a relevant risk assessment.

Improved enrichment factor calculations through principal component analysis: Examples from soils near breccia pipe uranium mines, Arizona, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Compositional data analysis; Geoaccumulation index; Incremental sampling methodology; Pollution index; Trace elements; Centered log ratio transformation	METAL POLLUTION; BASE-LINE; GEOCHEMISTRY; ENVIRONMENT; SEDIMENTS; ELEMENTS; DUST; DAM; CD; CU	The enrichment factor (EF) is a widely used metric for determining how much the presence of an element in a sampling media has increased relative to average natural abundance because of human activity. Calculation of an EF requires the selection of both a background composition and a reference element, choices that can strongly influence the result of the calculation. Here, it is shown how carefully applied, classical principal component analysis (PCA) examined via biplots can guide the selections of background compositions and reference elements. Elemental data were treated using the centered log ratio (CLR) transformation, and multiple subsets of major and trace elements were examined to gain different perspectives. The methodology was applied to a dataset of elemental soil concentrations from around breccia pipe uranium mines in Arizona, U.S.A., with most samples collected via incremental sampling methodology. Storage of ore at the surface creates the potential for wind dispersal of ore derived material. Uranium was found to be the best individual tracer of dispersal of ore-derived material to nearby soils, with EF values up to 75. Sulfur, As, Mo, and Cu were also enriched but to lesser degrees. The results demonstrate several practical benefits of a PCA in these situations: (1) the ability to identify one or more elements best suited to distinguish a specific source of enrichment from background composition; (2) understanding how background compositions vary within and between sites; (3) identification of samples containing enriched or anthropogenic materials based upon their integrated, multi-element composition. Calculating the most representative EF values is useful for numerical assessment of enrichment, whether anthropogenic or natural. As shown here, however, the PCA and biplot method provide a visual approach that integrates information from all elements for a given subset of data in a manner that yields geochemical insights beyond the power of the EF.

However, the ecological basis and mechanisms that result in marine animal ingestion of plastic debris are still relatively unknown, despite recent advances. We investigated the relationship between scavenging behavior and plastic ingestion using green turtles, Chelonia mydas, as a model. Diet analysis of C mydas showed that sea turtles engaging in scavenging behavior ingested significantly more plastic debris than individuals that did not engage in this foraging strategy. We argue that opportunistic scavenging behavior, an adaptive behavior in most marine ecosystems, may now pose a threat to a variety of marine animals due to the current widespread plastic pollution found in oceans.

Many pesticides are indeed more toxic at higher mean temperatures. Yet, we know next to nothing about the effect of another key component of climate change, the increase of daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs), on pesticide toxicity. Therefore, we tested the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos under different levels of DTF (constant = 0 degrees C, low = 5 degrees C (current maximum level) and high = 10 degrees C (predicted maximum level under global warming)) around the same mean temperature on key life history and physiological traits of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae in a common-garden experiment. At all levels of DTF, chlorpyrifos exposure was stressful: it reduced energy storage (fat content) and the activity of its target enzyme acetylcholinesterase, while it increased the activity of the detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Notably, chlorpyrifos did not cause mortality or reduced growth rate at the constant temperature (0 degrees C DTF), yet increased mortality 6x and reduced growth rate with ca. 115% in the presence of DTF. This indicates that daily short-term exposures to higher temperatures can increase pesticide toxicity. Our data suggest that when 5 degrees C DTF will become more common in the studied high-latitude populations, this will increase the toxicity of CPF, and that a further increase from 5 degrees DTF to 10 degrees C DTF may not result in a further increase of pesticide toxicity. Our results highlight the biological importance of including daily temperature fluctuations in ecological risk assessment of pesticides and as an extra dimension in the climate-induced toxicant sensitivity concept.

Associations between environmental pollutants and larval amphibians in wetlands contaminated by energy-related brines are potentially mediated by feeding traits	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Amphibian; Metals; Brines; Prairie Pothole Region; Wetland; Energy development	DIETARY MERCURY EXPOSURE; ROAD DEICING SALT; HEAVY-METALS; WILLISTON BASIN; RAINBOW-TROUT; FOOD WEBS; TADPOLES; WATER; FROG; BIOACCUMULATION	Energy production in the Williston Basin, located in the Prairie Pothole Region of central North America, has increased rapidly over the last several decades. Advances in recycling and disposal practices of saline wastewaters (brines) co-produced during energy production have reduced ecological risks, but spills still occur often and legacy practices of releasing brines into the environment caused persistent salinization in many areas. Aside from sodium and chloride, these brines contain elevated concentrations of metals and metalloids (lead, selenium, strontium, antimony and vanadium), ammonium, volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, and radionuclides. Amphibians are especially sensitive to chloride and some metals, increasing potential effects in wetlands contaminated by brines. We collected bed sediment and larval amphibians (Ambystoma mavortium, Lithobates pipiens and Pseudacris maculata) from wetlands in Montana and North Dakota representing a range of brine contamination history and severity to determine if contamination was associated with metal concentrations in sediments and if metal accumulation in tissues varied by species. In wetland sediments, brine contamination was positively associated with the concentrations of sodium and strontium, both known to occur in oil and gas wastewater, but negatively correlated with mercury. In amphibian tissues, selenium and vanadium were associated with brine contamination. Metal tissue concentrations were higher in tadpoles that graze compared to predatory salamanders; this suggests frequent contact with the sediments could lead to greater ingestion of metal-laden materials. Although many of these metals may not be directly linked with energy development, the potential additive or synergistic effects of exposure along with elevated chloride from brines could have important consequences for aquatic organisms. To effectively manage amphibian populations in wetlands contaminated by saline wastewaters we need a better understanding of how life history traits, species-specific susceptibilities and the physical-chemical properties of metals co-occurring in wetland sediments interact with other stressors like chloride and wetland drying.

Baseline and power analyses for the assessment of beach litter reductions in the European OSPAR region	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Beach litter; Baseline value; Reduction target; Non-parametrical power analysis; litteR	FULMAR FULMARUS-GLACIALIS; MARINE LITTER; PLASTIC INGESTION; DEBRIS POLLUTION; TIME-SERIES; SYSTEM; TRENDS; COAST	Marine litter pollution is a global environmental problem. Beach litter is a part of this problem, and is widely monitored in Europe. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires a reduction of beach litter. A reduction of 30% has been proposed in the European Plastics Strategy. The aims of this study are to develop (a) a method to calculate sufficiently stable and precise baseline values for beach litter, and (b) to derive a method of power analysis to estimate the number of beach litter surveys, necessary to detect a given reduction, using these baseline values. Beach litter data from the OSPAR (Oslo Paris Convention) region were used, and tailor-made statistical methods were implemented in open source software, litteR. Descriptive statistics and Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall trend analyses were calculated for the most abundant beach litter types, for 14 survey sites. The length of a baseline period necessary to obtain a specified precision of the mean baseline value, expressed as Coefficient of Variation (CV), was calculated. Power analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulations combined with Wilcoxon tests to determine significant deviations of the simulated datasets from the baseline mean values, For most survey sites, the mean length of monitoring periods necessary to achieve a CV < 10% amounts to four to five years with four surveys a year. The mean number of surveys necessary to detect a statistically significant reduction of 30% with 80% power ranges from 14 to 20. Power analyses show that a reduction of 10% is difficult to detect, because more than 24 surveys are needed. In contrary, a reduction of 40-50% can be detected easily with a small (<12) number of surveys. The new methods could also be applied to other areas where similar beach litter surveys are performed.

A synthesis of ecosystem management strategies for forests in the face of chronic nitrogen deposition	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Nitrogen deposition; Soil nitrogen availability; Soil acidity; Plant diversity; Forest management	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; SOIL SOLUTION CHEMISTRY; UNDERSTOREY PLANT-COMMUNITIES; NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; SCOTS PINE FOREST; ACIDIC DEPOSITION; PONDEROSA PINE; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; RESTORATION TREATMENTS; EUTROPHICATION SIGNAL	Total nitrogen (N) deposition has declined in many parts of the U.S. and Europe since the 1990s. Even so, it appears that decreased N deposition alone may be insufficient to induce recovery from the impacts of decades of elevated deposition, suggesting that management interventions may be necessary to promote recovery. Here we review the effectiveness of four remediation approaches (prescribed burning, thinning, liming, carbon addition) on three indicators of recovery from N deposition (decreased soil N availability, increased soil alkalinity, increased plant diversity), focusing on literature from the U.S. We reviewed papers indexed in the Web of Science since 1996 using specific key words, extracted data on the responses to treatment along with ancillary data, and conducted a meta-analysis using a three-level variance model structure. We found 69 publications (and 2158 responses) that focused on one of these remediation treatments in the context of N deposition, but only 29 publications (and 408 responses) reported results appropriate for our meta-analysis. We found that carbon addition was the only treatment that decreased N availability (effect size: -1.80 to -1.84 across metrics), while liming, thinning, and prescribed burning all tended to increase N availability (effect sizes: +0.4 to +1.2). Only liming had a significant positive effect on soil alkalinity (+10.5%-82.2% across metrics). Only prescribed burning and thinning affected plant diversity, but with opposing and often statistically marginal effects across metrics (i.e., increased richness, decreased Shannon or Simpson diversity). Thus, it appears that no single treatment is effective in promoting recovery from N deposition, and combinations of treatments should be explored. These conclusions are based on the limited published data available, underscoring the need for more studies in forested areas and more consistent reporting suitable for meta-analyses across studies.

Sampling design and analytical advances allow for simultaneous density estimation of seven sympatric carnivore species from camera trap data	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Camera trap; Spatially explicit models; Multispecies; Population density; Sampling design	SPATIAL CAPTURE-RECAPTURE; MARK-RESIGHT; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; PATTERNS; OCCUPANCY; PREDATORS; FARMLAND; RICHNESS; MODELS	Population density is a fundamental parameter needed to assess wildlife populations but is difficult to obtain given species are often wide-ranging and elusive. Photographic capture-recapture techniques do not require direct observations and thus, have become a common approach for estimating wildlife densities. To date, however, these studies have typically focused on single species. Our research explores study design- and analytical-based approaches for expanding photographic capture-recapture studies to assess multiple species simultaneously. We developed a hybrid-sampling scheme that varied inter-camera distances and used simulations to test the efficacy of this design versus a systematically spaced grid in estimating densities of species with varied space use. Through simulations we found the hybrid design facilitated density estimates for a wider range of species with little or no cost in accuracy for most species. We implemented a hybrid camera design across a 1154-km(2) area in northern Botswana to estimate densities of lions, spotted hyenas, leopards, wild dogs, servals, civets, and aardwolves. We estimated densities of these small- to wide-ranging carnivores, where all or some portion of the population was individually identifiable, using spatially explicit capture-recapture and mark-resight models. Mean estimates ranged from 1.2 (95% CI = 0.72-1.99) lions to 10.1 (95% CI = 8.69-11.63) spotted hyenas/100 km(2) and provided empirical information needed for the conservation of these species in Botswana. Our research demonstrates how photographic capture-recapture studies can be expanded to estimate the densities of multiple species versus just a single species within a community, thus increasing the conservation value of this globally implemented approach.

Prospects for freshwater turtle population recovery are catalyzed by pan-Amazonian community-based management	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Adaptive management; Community based management; Lefkovitch matrix; Life history; Natural resource management; Podocnemis unifilis; Population recovery; Protected area effectiveness	PODOCNEMIS-UNIFILIS; RIVER TURTLES; CONSERVATION; TESTUDINES; PROGRAM; NESTS	Sustainable use as a mechanism for the conservation and recovery of exploited wildlife populations remains intensely debated, including for freshwater turtles, a diverse and imperiled group of aquatic reptiles that are an important food source for many residents of tropical regions. Here we evaluated the geographical extent of recovery options for a heavily exploited tropical freshwater turtle fauna across 8.86 M km(2) of South American river catchments under scenarios of Business-as-Usual (BAU), Protection (Pr) and Community-Based Management (CBM). For the widespread indicator species, Podocnemis unifilis, demographic analysis showed that populations subject to moderate levels of female harvest (<= 10%) can recover over broad areas if concurrent headstarting of hatchlings is practiced more widely. With regional strengthening of the protected area network unlikely, CBM developed with harvest frameworks derived from demographic rates appropriate to tropical species could catalyze a rapid continental scale recovery of Amazonian freshwater turtles within a few decades.

No safe haven: Protection levels show imperilled South African reptiles not sufficiently safe-guarded despite low average extinction risk	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Africa; Biodiversity; Conservation; Global Reptile Assessment; Habitat loss; Reptilia	CONSERVATION STATUS; DECLINE; POPULATION; WEST	Compared to the global average, extinction risk for mainland African reptiles, particularly for South Africa, appears to be relatively low. Despite this, African reptiles are under threat primarily due to habitat loss as a result of agriculture, resource extraction, and urbanisation, and these pressures are expected to increase into the future. South Africa's reptile fauna is relatively well-studied, allowing an investigation of whether threat status assessment limitations are driving the comparably low threat status for the country, a large component of Africa's reptile fauna (ca. 25% of mainland African reptiles are found in South Africa). Extinction risk of South African reptiles was assessed as of 2018 using IUCN criteria and we 'backcast' these assessments to infer extinction risk circa 1990. A Red List Index (RLI: a measure of the extinction risk for a group of species) for 1990 and 2018 was estimated, and the protection level afforded to South African reptiles was investigated by intersecting reptile distributions with the network of protected areas. Finally, a coarse estimate of extinction rate was made. Level of extinction risk for South African reptiles (ca. 5.4%) is lower than the global average, and most currently threatened species would have already been at risk by 1990. The RLI was slightly lower for 2018 than for 1990, and the decrease was more prominent for endemic reptiles than for all reptiles combined. Most South African reptiles fall into the Well Protected category, implying that the protected area network has substantial conservation impact. However, many threatened reptile species are Poorly Protected or Not Protected. The current extent of the protected area network therefore, does not adequately mitigate extinction risk for reptiles. Furthermore, the protected area expansion plan for South Africa would not capture any additional threatened species within its boundaries. Despite the lower level of extinction risk indicated by IUCN assessments, it would be premature to assume that South African reptiles are faring better than reptiles globally based only on this one measure. Notably, two South African reptiles are Critically Endangered and theses are not found in protected areas, two others are already classified as Extinct, and rough estimates of extinction rates are similar to values estimated for other vertebrates. By considering additional metrics that are directly guided by our in-depth knowledge of the species, their distributions and the threats, we demonstrate that South African reptiles are under pressure and that risk of extinction is tangible for several species.

Both natural fluctuations in environmental conditions and habitat management measures can temporarily cause adverse environmental effects. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the invasive parasitic fly Philornis downsi, control of invasive plants and precipitation on the breeding success of Darwin's finches. Introduced plant species have invaded a unique forest on the Galapagos island of Santa Cruz, which is a key habitat for Darwin's finches. The Galapagos National Park Directorate applies manual control and herbicides to combat this invasion. We hypothesized that these measures led to a reduction in the arthropod food supply during chick rearing, which in turn caused mortality in chicks that were already weakened by parasitism. We compared food availability in three study sites of varying degrees of weed management. To assess the interaction of parasitism and weed management, we experimentally reduced P. downsi abundance in nests in all three study sites. The key result suggests that there is an increase in the adverse effect of parasitism under unfavourable habitat conditions. As predicted, we found a negative additive effect of parasitism and weed management on the breeding success of the insectivorous warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea), but not on the omnivorous small tree finch (Camarhynchus parvulus), which was strongly affected by parasitism independently of weed management. Management measures can temporarily decrease environmental quality and reduce resistance/tolerance to invasive species. This should be considered when applying management measures to habitats of vulnerable species.

Detecting 'poachers' with drones: Factors influencing the probability of detection with TIR and RGB imaging in miombo woodlands, Tanzania	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						UAV; Drone; Thermal; TIR; RGB; Comparison; Contrast; Distance; Centerline; Poachers; People; Time of day; Poaching; Conservation; Canopy; Density	UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS; AUTOMATED DETECTION; AERIAL VEHICLES; ALGORITHM	Conservation biologists increasingly employ drones to reduce poaching of animals. However, there are no published studies on the probability of detecting poachers and the factors influencing detection. In an experimental setting with voluntary subjects, we evaluated the influence of various factors on poacher detection probability: camera (visual spectrum: RGB and thermal infrared: TIR), density of canopy cover, subject distance from the image centreline, subject contrast against the background, altitude of the drone and image analyst. We manually analysed the footage and marked all recorded subject detections. A multilevel model was used to analyse the TIR image data and a general linear model approach was used for the RGB image data. We found that the TIR camera had a higher detection probability than the RGB camera. Detection probability in TIR images was significantly influenced by canopy density, subject distance from the centreline and the analyst. Detection probability in RGB images was significantly influenced by canopy density, subject contrast against the background, altitude and the analyst. Overall, our findings indicate that TIR cameras improve human detection, particularly at cooler times of the day, but this is significantly hampered by thick vegetation cover. The effects of diminished detection with increased distance from the image centreline can be improved by increasing the overlap between images although this requires more flights over a specific area. Analyst experience also contributed to increased detection probability, but this might cease being a problem following the development of automated detection using machine learning.

We present a framework for identifying locations that are likely to increase the capacity of biota to withstand disturbances ('resistance') and to recover when adverse conditions abate ('resilience'). Our study ecosystem was the river red-gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) floodplain forests of the Murray River, southeastern Australia. We tracked forest-stand condition of river red-gum forests during and after a prolonged drought (the Big Dry) using models based on remotely sensed data and ground-truthed vegetation measurements of forest-stand condition. Native birds and small mammals respond positively to stand condition. We used spatial optimization to rank the region based on forest-stand condition at multiple time-points during a 13 yr drought and 2 yr after the drought ceased. We identified areas that ranked in the top portion of the landscape in either period to identify `resistance havens' and 'resilience havens' respectively and assessed the extent to which these overlapped. Although there was overlap in the top ranked areas, there were differences in the areas identified as havens (top 25% ranking) in both periods, with a 55.5% overlap between areas identified as havens in either period. This overlap was lower (40.1%) when considering the most highly ranked (top 10%) areas. Concentrating only on locations that provide protection from adverse conditions (i.e. refugia) is likely to be ineffective for conservation management in increasingly changeable environmental conditions because areas that facilitate resistance will not necessarily be the same as areas that support recovery. Acknowledging and incorporating the concepts of ecological resistance and resilience into landscape management is vital if managers are to lessen the ecological effects of intensified disturbance regimes associated with climate change.

Responses to risk include increased vigilance and reduced foraging, movement to safe habitats, increases or decreases in group size, and changes in patterns of movement. While we know that prey can detect and respond to both long term (LT) and short term (ST) variation in risk, field studies have only recently begun to consider how these responses might differ. Here, we hypothesize that prey movement patterns should respond differently to cues of LT and ST variation in risk. Specifically, cues of elevated LT risk might lead to decreased movement to improve the assessment of ST risk, while elevated ST risk might favor increased movement to reduce the proximity or duration of risks that are already assessed to be acute. We further hypothesize that decreases in movement are likely to be a general response to LT risk, while responses to ST risk are likely to vary in a manner that depends on the type of predator. In Liuwa Plain National Park, we found that wildebeest movements responded to the local intensity of predator use (LT risk), after controlling for other seasonal, diurnal and bottom-up effects. Speed decreased considerably and turning angles increased considerably, combining to markedly decrease linear movements. In contrast, immediate encounters with predators (ST risk) typically provoked fast, linear flight, and this effect was stronger for encounters with coursing predators. The effect of long term risk was to cause wildebeest to move more slowly and less linearly, i.e. to slow down and turn around, as part of a suite of behavioral responses, which also includes increased vigilance, that promote cautious assessment of ST risks when in locations with high levels of LT risk. This result has broad implications of understanding the influence of predation risk on foraging patterns of ungulates as this relationship is much more complex than simple avoidance of areas of 'high risk'.

Grassland disturbance increases monarch butterfly oviposition and decreases arthropod predator abundance	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Butterfly conservation; Disturbance; Grasslands; Monarch butterfly; Predation	CONSERVATION; POPULATION; LEPIDOPTERA; SURVIVAL; REPRODUCTION; MILKWEEDS; MOVEMENT; RECOVERY; DIAPAUSE; HABITAT	Many species of conservation concern depend on disturbance to create or maintain suitable habitat. We evaluated effects of disturbance on the eastern migratory monarch butterfly (Denaus plexippus L.), which has declined markedly in recent decades, primarily attributed to the loss of milkweed host plants from annual crop fields in the US Midwest. Currently, remaining milkweeds in this region primarily occur in perennial grasslands, where disturbance is infrequent, predatory arthropods are abundant, and seasonal patterns of plant phenology differ from crop fields. In a two-year study in Michigan, USA, we applied three treatments to 23 patches of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.); one-third of each patch was left undisturbed, while the remaining thirds were mowed in either mid-June or mid-July, respectively, and allowed to regenerate. We subsequently measured effects on monarch oviposition, predator abundance, survival of sentinel eggs and larvae, and tested how milkweed phenology and aphid colonization-both of which are reset by disturbance-structure predation risk for immature monarchs. Monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating versus undisturbed stems under both mowing regimes. Predators were strongly suppressed by mowing treatments, requiring 2-4 weeks to recolonize milkweed after disturbance, and were more abundant on flowering or aphid-infested stems. We found no significant differences in monarch egg/larval survival, although it tended to be higher in mowed plots. Overall, monarchs laid more eggs on regenerating stems where their offspring may also experience enemy-free space. Future work should focus on testing grassland disturbance as a management tool to improve productivity of existing monarch breeding habitat.

This is particularly true for the vast part of soil biodiversity, which rarely can be observed directly. Metabarcoding of DNA extracted from the environment (eDNA) has become state-of-the-art in assessing soil biodiversity. For assessing fungal communities, eDNA metabarcoding is seen as an attractive alternative to classical surveying based on fruitbodies. However, it is unknown whether eDNA metabarcoding provides a representative sample of fungal diversity and census of threatened species. Therefore conservation planning and assessment are still based on fruitbody inventories. Based on a dataset of large ecological width, representing both soil eDNA metabarcoding and expert inventories of fungal fruitbodies in Denmark, we document for the first time the validity of eDNA sampling and metabarcoding as a practical inventory method and a measure of conservation value for fungi. Fruitbody data identified fewer species in total and per site, and had larger variance in site richness. Focusing on macrofungi - the class Agaricomycetes, and in turn the order Agaricales - metrics of total richness and compositional similarity converged between the methods. eDNA was suboptimal for recording the non-soil dwelling fungi such as lichens and polypores. 13 Diversity was similar between methods, but more variation in community composition could be explained by environmental predictors in the eDNA data. The fruitbody survey was slightly better at finding red listed species. We find a better correspondence between biodiversity indices derived from fungal fruitbodies and DNA-based approaches than indicated in earlier studies. We argue that (historical) fungal community data based on fruit body forays - with careful selection of taxonomic groups - may be interpreted together with modern DNA-based approaches to obtain a richer picture of the full mycobiota of the site, and for addressing historical changes. We estimated the costs of the two inventory approaches to be approximately similar for practical applications.

Insect population declines are a major facet of the global biodiversity crisis, yet even in Europe they remain poorly understood. Here we identify traits linked to population trends in 'common and widespread' UK moths. Population trend data from the Rothamsted Research Insect Survey spanning 40 years was subject to classification and regression models to identify common traits among species experiencing a significant change in occurrence. Our final model had an accuracy of 76% and managed to predict declining species on 90% of occasions, but was less successful with increasing species. By far the most powerful predictor associated for declines was moth wingspan with large species declining more frequently. Preference for woody or herbaceous larval food sources, nocturnal photoperiod activity, and richness of habitats occupied also proved to be significantly associated with decline. Our results suggest that ecological traits can be reliably used to predict declines in moths, and that this model could be used for Data Deficient species, of which there are many.

This study disentangles the connection of light characteristics, which potentially influence the reaction of nocturnally migrating passerines to artificial illumination under different cloud cover conditions. In a spotlight experiment on a North Sea island, birds were exposed to combinations of light colour (red, yellow, green, blue, white), intensity (half, full) and blinking mode (intermittent, continuous) while measuring their number close to the light source with thermal imaging cameras. We found that no light variant was constantly avoided by nocturnally migrating passerines crossing the sea. The number of birds did neither differ between observation periods with blinking light of different colours nor compared to darkness. While intensity did not influence the number attracted, birds were drawn more towards continuous than towards blinking illumination, when stars were not visible. Red continuous light was the only exception that did not differ from the blinking counterpart. Continuous green, blue and white light attracted significantly more birds than continuous red light in overcast situations. Our results suggest that light sources offshore should be restricted to a minimum, but if lighting is needed, blinking light is to be preferred over continuous light, and if continuous light is required, red light should be applied.

Participatory monitoring reveals village-centered gradients of mammalian defaunation in central Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Hunting; Citizen science; Road; Village; Access; Transect; Disturbance; Hunt; Game; Diversity; Population; Density; Encounter rate; Hill numbers; Participatory monitoring	TROPICAL FORESTS; CITIZEN SCIENCE; BUSHMEAT; CONSEQUENCES; SUSTAINABILITY; CONSERVATION; DECLINES; WILDLIFE	Tropical areas are facing a bushmeat crisis involving the systematic over-exploitation of large-bodied mammals for both subsistence and commercial purposes. We hypothesize that because hunting generally originates from villages, it will create "halos of defaunation" where abundances of large mammals increase with distance away from villages. Whilst such patterns have been well characterized at the landscape scale, examining how de-faunation halos vary between different villages has received considerably less attention. Forests immediately surrounding villages are of considerable importance to the people residing within them and the factors hypothesized to influence local defaunation halos (e.g. village size, hunting practices and access to local markets) may affect local livelihoods and the ecological integrity of nearby forests. To address this, we adopted a participatory approach to establish and monitor sixty transects across ten village-distance gradients (1-8 km) in Gabon. Trained paraecologists, recruited from local villages, walked each transect twice monthly to determine the encounter rates of medium and large mammals across the village distance gradient and monitored village level bushmeat availability. We found that overall rates of mammal observation and estimated species richness were constant across the village-distance gradient, however the total number of individuals encountered and bushmeat biomass were lower close to villages consistent with local depletion of wildlife. These general trends were underpinned by depleted mammal species diversity with increasing proximity to villages and a marked shift in mammal community composition: small, non-hunted species were encountered most frequently near villages, whereas large, hunted species were encountered most frequently away from villages. We found some evidence for inter-village variation in the strength and depth of defaunation halos, which may be driven in part by the village-level hunting intensity. Several of the key parameters identified in landscape-scale bushmeat studies did not detectably influence village-level defaunation (e.g. road or market distance). Despite the prevalence of bushmeat hunting in the region, the conservation value of forests immediately surrounding villages was demonstrated through the detection of large-bodied species of conservation concern (e.g. chimpanzee and gorilla) at a high proportion of survey locations. The compositional shifts in mammal communities detailed here will ultimately lead to the altered composition and diversity of forests around villages, with potential implications for human livelihoods, health and transmission of zoonotic disease. This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of engaging paraecologists to answer focused ecological questions - the first step in facilitating effective natural resource management by local communities.

Real-time thermal imagery from an unmanned aerial vehicle can locate ground nests of a grassland songbird at rates similar to traditional methods	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Drone; Field; Infrared; Monitoring; Reproduction; Sparrow; UAV	BIRDS; VEGETATION; SURVIVAL; SUCCESS	Monitoring songbird reproductive output is a well-established method for assessing population persistence, but reproductive studies on grassland songbirds often suffer from low sample sizes, high labor costs, and high levels of disturbance due to the difficulty of finding nests. However, technological advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) might improve our ability to locate these hidden nests with minimal intrusion. We compared the effectiveness and efficiency of locating grassland songbird nests with a thermal camera mounted on a UAV versus traditional nest searching techniques. We used a paired experimental design to determine whether UAV-assisted searches could replicate the results from traditional search methods. Two independent teams surveyed field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) territories with active ground nests for up to 2 h on consecutive days. Each team recorded the outcome and time it took to locate the nest. Both methods were highly successful at locating ground nests. UAV-assisted searches located nests 28% faster than traditional methods, but the results from a survival-style analysis indicated that the methods were not significantly different. Although UAVs may temporarily increase stress and alter the behavior of animals, UAV-assisted searches are generally less invasive than traditional methods because piloting the aircraft from the territory edge drastically reduces the need to traverse and trample vegetation within the territory. Thus, UAV-assisted nest searches represent a promising technique for locating grassland bird nests. Continued advances in UAV and thermal technology are likely to increase the efficiency of UAV-assisted nest searches and may eventually remove the need for humans to enter target territories when monitoring nest success.

Divergent population trends following the cessation of legal grizzly bear hunting in southwestern British Columbia, Canada	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Population recovery; Brown bear; Pradel robust design; Small population; Ursus arctos; Spatial capture-recapture	BROWN BEAR; MARK-RECAPTURE; URSUS-ARCTOS; VITAL-RATES; GROWTH; SIZE; DISPERSAL; ABUNDANCE; MONTANA; DENSITY	We conducted DNA capture-recapture monitoring of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) from 5 to 17 years after hunting was stopped in two adjacent but genetically distinct populations in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. We used spatial capture-recapture and non-spatial Pradel robust design modelling to estimate population density, trends, and the demographic components of population change for each population. The larger population had 21.5 bears/1000 km(2) and was growing (lambda(pradel) = 1.02 +/- 0.02 SE; lambda(secr) = 1.01 +/- 4.6 x 10(-5) SE) following the cessation of hunting. The adjacent smaller population had 6.3 bears/1000 km(2) and was likely declining (lambda(pradel) = 0.95 +/- 0.03 SE; lambda(secr) = 0.98 +/- 0.02 SE). Estimates of apparent survival and apparent recruitment indicated that lower recruitment was the dominant factor limiting population growth in the smaller population. Factors limiting reproductive rates and population density could include poor habitat quality, particularly the abundance of high-energy foods, genetic Allee effects due to a long period of population isolation, or demographic effects affecting infanticide rates. The cessation of hunting was insufficient to promote population recovery for the low density, isolated population. Our research highlights the importance of considering mortality thresholds in addition to small population effects and habitat quality when recovering large carnivore populations.

Reconsidering biodiversity hotspots based on the rate of historical land-use change	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biodiversity hotspot; Biodiversity; Land-use change; Conservation; Endemic species	GLOBAL PATTERNS; BIRD COMMUNITIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RANGE SHIFTS; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; DISTURBANCE; ECOREGIONS; RESILIENCE; ENDEMISM	Biodiversity hotspots are conservation priority areas that meet two criteria: they must have lost >= 70% of their primary vegetation, and they must contain >= 1500 endemic vascular plant species. Given the limited time and resources available for conservation and predicted future land-use change, it is necessary for conservation efforts in biodiversity hotspots to become more effective. In this study, we identified regions that have lost 70% of their primary vegetation and in which the past endemic vascular plant species richness was estimated to be higher than the biodiversity hotspot threshold of 1500 species (i.e., regions that were possible biodiversity hotspots). Next, we compared historical land-use change data from 1500 to 2010 between the identified regions and biodiversity hotspots. We found that the rate of land-use change in the biodiversity hotspots was significantly lower than that in the identified regions, suggesting that rapid land-use change poses an increased threat to endemic plants and is associated with the loss of endemic plant diversity. Biodiversity hotspots thus likely maintain many species that are vulnerable to rapid land-use change. Fortunately, some identified regions have not experienced rapid land-use change and thus have the potential to be newly recognized as biodiversity hotspots: the Altai-Sayan Montane Forests, the Amur-Heilong River Basin, and the Southeast China Subtropical Forests. Our findings reinforce the importance of prioritizing biodiversity hotspots for conservation and emphasize the need to develop efficient conservation strategies specialized to mitigate the effects of rapid land-use change on biodiversity.

These strategies aim to manage different, often taxonomically distant species under a single regime based on shared habitat associations and/or co-occurrence in the landscape. We tested the efficacy of multi-species management in the context of creating and maintaining early-successional forest cover types using two species of migratory birds that breed in eastern North America and are each the focus of intensive, concurrent, and overlapping management. American woodcock (Scolopax minor) and golden-winged warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) breed in similar diverse-forest landscapes. Each species purportedly benefits from management for the other species and both are often used as flagship species for the creation of young forest and the conservation of associated avian communities. However, the landscape-species relationships that drive reproductive success and population stability in these species have not been explicitly compared. Here, we use previously published spatially-explicit models of productivity (the number of juveniles raised to a biologically significant milestone) to identify the relationship(s) between productivity of American woodcock and golden winged warblers across a shared landscape. We found productivity to be negatively associated between these species on the same landscape at all spatial scales we modelled (1 m(2)-100 ha). Our results suggest that, with regards to productivity, American woodcock and golden-winged warblers have opposing relationships with the composition of the landscapes in which they coexist and therefore should not be assumed to benefit similarly from any individual management action at any relevant spatial scale.

Despite the increasing focus on the validation of sampling strategies, few studies have empirically related diversity in seed bank collections with variation in wild-provenance populations. By using a set of nuclear microsatellites, we investigated genetic diversity in British populations of Taxus baccata (European yew tree). We used our findings as a baseline for the quantification of genetic diversity captured in the germplasm collections maintained by the Millennium Seed Bank (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew), in terms of allelic richness and allelic capture. We observed that genetic differentiation in wild populations of yew is compatible with highly effective gene flow, with no geographic patterns. Heterozygosity is lower than expected for a dioecious obligate out breeder. Seed collections are representative of wild populations in terms of allelic capture, including rare and locally common variants, indicating that the current sampling protocol implemented by the UK National Tree Seed Project is appropriate. Specific sampling strategies might be improved by including more populations at the edge of the range and in remote localities, even at the expense of contiguous populations. Our methods may be applied to evaluate allelic capture in other germplasm collections for which a baseline exists, i.e. in which genetic diversity in the wild-provenance populations is known. Our recommendations related to sampling strategies can be extended to other tree species with continuous distributions and effective gene flow.

Using Daphnia magna and a microsporidian gut parasite, we conducted two experiments across a wide thermal range and fitted transmission models that utilize MTE submodels for transmission parameters. We decomposed transmission into contact rate and probability of infection and further decomposed probability of infection into a product of gut residence time (GRT) and per-parasite infection rate of gut cells. Contact rate generally increased with temperature and scaled positively with body size, whereas infection rate had a narrow hump-shaped thermal response and scaled negatively with body size. GRT increased with host size and was longest at extreme temperatures. GRT and infection rate inside the gut combined to create a 3.5 times higher probability of infection for the smallest relative to the largest individuals. Small temperature changes caused large differences in transmission. We also fit several alternative transmission models to data at individual temperatures. The more complex models-parasite antagonism or synergism and host heterogeneity-did not substantially improve the fit to the data. Our results show that transmission rate is the product of several distinct thermal and allometric functions that can be predicted continuously across temperature and host size using the MTE.

Higher Nest Predation Favors Rapid Fledging at the Cost of Plumage Quality in Nestling Birds	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						development time; nestling; plumage quality; predation; time in the nest; trade-off	DEVELOPMENTAL RATES; REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; GROWTH-RATES; BODY DRAG; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; FEATHERS; FITNESS; TRAITS; RISK	High predation risk can favor rapid offspring development at the expense of offspring quality. Impacts of rapid development on phenotypic quality should be most readily expressed in traits that minimize fitness costs. We hypothesize that ephemeral traits that are replaced or repaired after a short period of life might express trade-offs in quality as a result of rapid development more strongly than traits used throughout life. We explored this idea for plumage quality in nestling body feathers, an ephemeral trait. We found a strong trade-off whereby nestlings that spend less time in the nest produced lower-quality plumage with less dense barbs relative to adults across 123 temperate and tropical species. For a subset of these species (n=67), we found that variation in the risk of nest predation explained additional variation in plumage quality beyond development time. Ultimately, the fitness costs of a poor-quality ephemeral trait, such as nestling body feathers, may be outweighed by the fitness benefits of shorter development times that reduce predation risk. At the same time, reduced resource allocation to traits with small fitness costs, such as ephemeral traits, may ameliorate resource constraints from rapid development on traits with larger fitness impacts.

Bioconcentration of Cd and Zn in the soils of an uncontaminated forest in the Quebec Laurentians	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Betula alleghaniensis; Biological cycling; Organic horizons; Throughfall; Trace elements		Fine-scale trace element (TE) concentration patterns exist in soils that were never exposed to the direct deposition of TE in the past. We aimed to understand the role of vegetation, in particular trees, in defining these spatial patterns in the soil horizons of an uncontaminated forest ecosystem. Living tree leaves and surface soil samples (L, F, and B horizons) were collected from a ca. 1400m(2) plot in the Hermine watershed where a strong gradient in the abundance of Yellow birches (Betula alleghaniensisBA) exists. TE analysis showed that BA leaves had up to 13 times more Cd and Zn than the other tree species. Significantly similar spatial patterns were detected between the density of BA trunks, the abundance of BA leaves in the litter (L) layer, and Cd and Zn concentrations in the F horizon. The opposite trend was found in the upper B horizon, where Cd and Zn were depleted under a denser BA canopy. We submit that soil depletion could be associated with the preferential phytoextraction of Cd and Zn by BA over a period of several decades. Our study stresses the role of biological cycling by trees on the profile redistribution and the generation of patterns of soil TE in quasi-pristine forests.

Predicting the influence of cropping systems on SOC under diverse scenarios requires a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes driving SOC accumulation and loss. We used a density fractionation technique to isolate three SOC fractions that are conceptualized to vary in SOC protection from decomposition. The free light fraction (FLF) is particulate SOC that is present in the inter-aggregate soil matrix, the occluded light fraction (OLF) is contained within aggregates, and the heavy fraction (HF) is associated with minerals. We evaluated surface (0 to 10cm depth) SOC fraction changes from baseline conditions5years after biofuel cropping system establishment at two temperate sites with contrasting soil textures. The biofuel cropping systems included no-till maize, switchgrass, prairie, and hybrid poplar. The FLF concentration (g fraction C g bulk soil(-1)) did not change significantly from baseline levels under any of the cropping systems at either site after 5years. Except for poplar, OLF concentrations were reduced in all systems at the site with coarse-textured soils and maintained at the site with fine-textured soils. In poplar systems, OLF concentrations were maintained on coarse-textured soils and increased on fine-textured soils. The HF concentrations also increased under poplar on the coarse-textured soil. A structural equation model indicated that OLF concentrations increased with lower litter C:N, and HF concentrations increased with greater litter quantity and lower litter C:N mass ratios. C:N increased over time within all SOC fractions, suggesting that all pools are sensitive to land-use change on sub-decadal timescales. In agreement with modern SOC theory, our empirical results indicate that increasing litter input quantity and promoting plant species with low C:N litter may improve SOC storage in aggregate and mineral-associated soil fractions.

Species coexistence theory suggests that it could be tightly linked to the type of nutrient limitation (no limitation, single-nutrient limitation, colimitation by several nutrients). Yet, the effects of nutrient limitation on the species richness-productivity relationship have been rarely studied at the regional and continental scales. Combining the predictions of the humped-back model and the niche dimension hypothesis, we hypothesized that an increase in plant species richness with the number of different limiting nutrients is detectable only at higher productivity levels, at which competition for nutrients is more intense. Therefore, we expected the shape of the diversity-productivity relationship to differ between sites colimited by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), sites limited by a single nutrient (either N or P), and sites not limited by any of these nutrients. To test this hypothesis, we used species richness data collected in 10 m x 10 m plots at 694 temperate dry grassland sites across eight regions in northern Eurasia. Productivity ranged from 10 to similar to 500 g/m(2) of above-ground standing biomass. The type of nutrient limitation was identified by critical nutrient ratios alone and their combination with critical nutrient concentrations measured in the plant tissue. Relationships were analysed using generalized linear and mixed-effect models. In line with our expectations, species richness of Eurasian temperate dry grasslands increased more steeply and peaked higher under higher productivity levels at N&P-colimited sites. When nutrient limitation was assessed by both ratios and concentrations, species richness at N&P-colimited sites continued to increase monotonically until the maximum productivity sampled in this study. In contrast, at sites with a single-nutrient limitation or no limitation, the peak in species richness was lower and occurred at a lower productivity of about 300-400 g/m(2). Synthesis. We provide the first evidence that the species richness-productivity relationship may depend on the type of nutrient limitation as predicted by the species coexistence theory. To generalize these findings, the role of nutrient limitation needs to be tested in other ecosystems, including more productive plant communities.

A hyper-arid environment shapes an inverse pattern of the fast-slow plant economics spectrum for above-, but not below-ground resource acquisition strategies	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Aridity gradient; Atacama Desert; functional traits; functional trait variation; leaf; root; shrub communities; stem	ROOT TRAITS; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; ATACAMA DESERT; ENCELIA-CANESCENS; WITHIN-COMMUNITY; WATER-DEFICIT; WOOD DENSITY; LEAF; GRADIENT; STEM	The fast-slow plant economics spectrum predicts that because of evolutionary and biophysical constraints, different plant organs must be coordinated to converge in a unique ecological strategy within a continuum that shifts from fast to slow resource acquisition and conservation. Therefore, along a gradient of aridity, taxa with different strategies will be expected to be successful because selection pressures for slow resource acquisition become stronger as the environment becomes drier. In extremely arid and seasonal environments, however, a slow strategy may become disadvantageous because slow traits are costly to maintain. Additionally, as the availability of water decreases, selection pressures increase, reducing the variation in ecological strategies. Using shrub assemblages along an aridity gradient in the Atacama Desert, we test the hypothesis that selection pressures imposed by hyper-aridity act simultaneously on the variation and coordination of trait attributes, leading to an inverse pattern in the fast-slow plant economics spectrum, where strategies shift from slow to fast as the environment becomes drier. We established 20-22 plots at each of four sites along the gradient to estimate plant community structure and functional variation. For all species recorded, we quantified a set of leaf, stem, and root traits. Results revealed an inverse pattern of the fast-slow economics spectrum for leaf and stem traits, but not for root traits; that is, as aridity further increased, above-ground traits exhibited a shift from a slow to a fast strategy with some level of coordination. Below-ground traits, however, did not shift accordingly with our prediction, rather they showed more complex pattern of shift and coordination with above-ground traits along the gradient. We also found that trait variation showed an idiosyncratic pattern of variation along the gradient, indicating that ecological strategies are driven by local processes within sites. Synthesis. Our results increase our understanding of the fast-slow plant economics spectrum by showing that environmental gradients, as well as local process can simultaneously shape different below- and above-ground resource acquisition strategies in extremely poor resource environments.

Seed moisture content as a primary trait regulating the lethal temperature thresholds of seeds	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						aseasonal burning; Banksia woodlands; fire; prescribed burning; seed survival; seeds	PHYSICALLY DORMANT SEEDS; SOIL TEMPERATURES; GERMINATION ECOLOGY; FIRE MANAGEMENT; HEAT-SHOCK; WATER-GAP; CLIMATE; SEASON; PLANTS; FUEL	Fire has long shaped biological responses of plants and plant communities in many ecosystems; yet, uncontrolled wildfire frequently puts people and infrastructure at risk. Fuel or hazard reduction burning outside of the historic fire season is a common and widespread practice aimed at reducing the risk of high-severity fires, which ideally also considers biodiversity values. Within fire-prone systems, seed banks are critical for plant species' regeneration, and seeds are typically adapted to survive the passage of fire and to regenerate in response to cues associated with historic fire regimes. However, species-specific tolerances to the heat from fire exist; likely influenced by a range of physical, physiological, and morphological seed traits, which may differ between seasons. The identification of these tolerances and associated seed traits may inform fire and species management. We determined the lethal temperatures for seeds in relation to their moisture content, and other key traits that we hypothesised may be associated with survival. Seeds from 14 native species and 4 species non-native to fire-prone Mediterranean climate Banksia woodlands of south-west Western Australia were exposed to temperatures between 50 and 180 degrees C for 3 min at three different moisture contents. The temperature at which half the seeds were killed (T-50) was estimated using nonlinear modelling. Seed mass, seed shape, embryo type, plant resprouting ability, seed storage syndrome, and native/non-native status were quantified and modelled for their relationship with T-50. Increased moisture content was a significant predictor of elevated seed mortality. Seeds with higher moisture (95% relative humidity [RH]) content perished at much lower temperatures. Seeds with low moisture content (15% or 50% RH) were able to survive significantly higher temperatures (median increase of 38 and 31 degrees C higher respectively). Seeds with basal embryos showed significantly lower T-50 than other embryo types. Synthesis. Seeds with elevated moisture contents have lower lethal temperature thresholds, leading to increased seed mortality during fire events when seeds (and soils) are moist. Thermal tolerance varied among coexisting species within this fire-prone system. These data suggest potential concern for the impacts of aseasonal burning practices (i.e., cool/wet season burning), and highlight the importance of taking seed moisture content into account when planning and implementing prescribed burning.

Most described BPRs so far are based on relatively small grain sizes (typically smaller than 1ha), and understanding how the BPRs scale up from individual trees to communities of different sizes, a mission critical for biodiversity conservation and forest management, still remains elusive. Based on a unique 54.12-ha large-scale forest observational site in Northeastern China, where we georeferenced and measured approx. 90,000 trees in two consecutive inventories, we studied BPRs across a cascade of spatial scales using geostatistical analysis and bootstrapping. To explore the underlying mechanisms of the scale dependency of BPR, we further investigated the scale gradient in biodiversity and productivity, respectively, and assessed neighbourhood influences on individual trees. Across all the spatial scales, we found a consistent positive concave-down effect of tree species richness on forest productivity. The elasticity of substitution (theta) represented the degree to which species can substitute for each other in contributing to forest productivity. At the community level, the curvature of BPRs in terms of the elasticity of substitution (theta) declined from around 0.50 and converged at around 0.15, as the grain size increased from 0.01 to 1.00 ha, all else being equal. Similarly, at the individual tree level, neighbourhood diversity coefficient, a linear proxy of theta, declined from around 0.08 and converged at around 0.03, as neighbourhood size increased from 0.01 to 1.00 ha, all else being equal. Synthesis. Our study found a pronounced scale dependency of biodiversity-productivity relationship and quantified, for the first time, how biodiversity-productivity relationship scale up from 0.01 to 1.00 ha. Our findings suggest that biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship can be generally scale-dependent and, hence, one must factor in this effect in biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration projects. Our findings also indicate that biodiversity-productivity relationship, predominantly determined by biological processes (i.e. complementarity and diminishing marginal productivity) at a small scale, can be increasingly influenced by statistical (i.e. spatial central limit theorem) and other (such as species-area relationship) processes as the scale increases.

Here, we examine the effects of one of the most pervasive threats to marine biodiversity, ocean warming, on the early life stages of the habitat-forming macroalga Cystoseira zosteroides, its long-term consequences for population resilience, and its combined effect with physical stressors. First, we performed a controlled laboratory experiment exploring the impacts of warming on early life stages. Settlement and survival of germlings were measured at 16 degrees C (control), 20 degrees C, and 24 degrees C, and both processes were affected by increased temperatures. Then, we integrated this information into stochastic, density-dependent integral projection models. Recovery time after a major disturbance significantly increased in warmer scenarios. The stochastic population growth rate (lambda(s)) was not strongly affected by warming alone, as high adult survival compensated for thermal-induced recruitment failure. Nevertheless, warming coupled with recurrent physical disturbances had a strong impact on lambda(s) and population viability. Synthesis. The impact of warming effects on early stages may significantly decrease the natural ability of habitat-forming algae to rebound after major disturbances. These findings highlight that, in a global warming context, populations of deep-water macroalgae will become more vulnerable to further disturbances, and stress the need to incorporate abiotic interactions into demographic models.

Insect outbreaks facilitated by climate warming could potentially drive transitions from high to low tree cover states. We investigated whether two key premises for such outbreak-induced transitions-critical thresholds (tipping points) and positive feedbacks that could maintain alternative states-are present in the northern-boreal mountain birch forest of Fennoscandia. Here, climate warming has promoted range expansions of defoliating geometrid moths, resulting in novel, severe multispecies outbreaks, most recently during 2002-2010. We conducted regional-scale field surveys of forest damage and recovery in 280 mountain birch stands in a northeast Norway immediately after the outbreak (2010) and 6 years later (2016). Satellite-derived time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provided an index of stand defoliation during the outbreak period. The proportion of dead stems per stand displayed a bimodal distribution, with stands generally being either lightly or severely damaged. This was due to a critical threshold in the relationship between defoliation and stem mortality, with mortality rates increasing abruptly in stands experiencing a mean drop in NDVI of more than 4% during the outbreak. The two key forest regenerative pathways-basal sprouting and sapling production-both displayed positive feedbacks with surviving stems and trees, so that regeneration success declined with increasing damage to the mature tree layer. These feedbacks imply that stands which have been forced across critical defoliation thresholds and suffered collapses of living tree cover may struggle to recover, especially if the loss of positive regenerative feedbacks is compounded by ungulate browsing on birch recruits. Synthesis. The north Fennoscandian mountain birch forest displays critical thresholds and positive feedbacks that conform to theoretical expectations for a system that could be vulnerable to abrupt and persistent changes of state in the face of novel, climatically facilitated insect outbreaks. These findings deepen the understanding of the persistent losses of tree cover that have occasionally been observed after outbreaks in this system in the past, and add to the list of mechanisms that could help explain the bistability of tree cover across the boreal biome.

These snow-rich treeless ecosystems are affected by delayed snowmelt, causing shorter growing seasons. Snow-tolerant plants occupy the centre of subarctic snowpatches, whereas black spruce trees grow at the margins. Snowpatches have shown sporadic expansion and shrinkage phases from tree establishment and mortality linked to climatic trends. Field surveys in the subarctic of eastern Canada are showing an afforestation process occurring in snowpatches. The origin and nature of this afforestation were investigated based on the hypothesis that tree colonization and growth were closely associated with recent changes in climate. Snowpatches were categorized into three types based on border trees: forested, semi-forested and tundra-like. In eight randomly selected snowpatches of each type, snowpatch borders and areas covered by deciduous shrubs or trees were mapped and chionophilous plants and frost-associated soil disturbances were recorded. Radial (tree-ring) and vertical growth were measured on stems to evaluate the impact of climate and local factors on snowpatch black spruce populations. Two waves of spruce colonization occurred in all forested and semi-forested snowpatches in the 1960s and in the 1980s to present. Spruce establishment was more frequent and abundant in recent years, near the forest margins and on moss and barren seedbeds. Expanding shrub (dwarf birch) cover inhibited spruce seedling establishment. Tree establishment and growth were positively correlated with growing season temperature and negatively correlated with annual maximum snow depth. More recently established spruce seedlings exhibited faster vertical growth than those established in the 20th century. Synthesis. Due to warmer conditions and earlier snowmelt in eastern Canada, black spruce trees and dwarf birch shrubs are racing through subarctic snowpatches. This afforestation could change biodiversity in the subarctic and affect watershed dynamics through a change in snowmelt pattern. Subarctic snowpatches are climate-sensitive ecosystems of the forest-tundra landscape, forming ideal biotopes for snow-tolerant, arctic-alpine species. Further tree encroachment in snowpatches in this century is potentially a threat to plant diversity, especially chionophilous species that have no corridors to migrate towards arctic ecosystems.

We use a modelling framework for Mediterranean-type ecosystems to assess the effects of fire-drought interactions on long-term vegetation dynamics and to identify disturbance-driven changes in trait composition (tree seeder vs. tree resprouter prevalence) and ecosystem state (forest vs. non-forest). Changes in tree seeder and the tree resprouter dominance show nonlinear, threshold-type trends over gradients of increasing compound disturbance frequency. Vegetation composition thresholds mostly occur in a narrow range of the compound fire-drought disturbance space. Additionally, trait compositional switches and the likelihood of sudden changes in ecosystem state are promoted by fire-drought interactions. Distinct sequences of disturbance events cause vegetation transitions, disrupting ecosystem resilience, even under moderate recurrence of individual disturbances. An extreme drought year followed by one or two large fire events promotes shifts from resprouter- to seeder dominance. Contrastingly, a large crown fire followed by an extreme drought promotes changes from seeder to resprouter dominance. This disturbance sequence is also a mechanism strong enough to trigger sudden shifts in ecosystem state (from forest to non-forest). Synthesis. Thresholds of change in vegetation composition occur over a narrow range of the modelled gradients of compound fire-drought recurrence, and the loss of ecosystem resilience is contingent on particular sequences of disturbance events. Overall, our findings highlight that disturbance interactions define the relative location of tipping points in ecosystem state, and that effects and feedbacks of compound disturbance regimes increase the long-term likelihood of sudden ecosystem shifts and, therefore, uncertainty in predicting vegetation state.

However, the effects of this tree decline on soil food webs are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of Quercus suber decline on soil food webs of Mediterranean mixed forests invaded by the exotic oomycete pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, using soil nematodes as bioindicator taxa. We used a spatially explicit neighbourhood approach to predict the characteristics of the nematode community (diversity, trophic structure, and several indices indicative of soil food web conditions) as a function of the characteristics of the tree and shrub community (species composition, size, and health status). Our results indicate that the process of defoliation and mortality of Q. suber caused significant alterations in the nematode trophic structure increasing the abundance of lower trophic levels (bacterivores, fungivores, and herbivores) and decreasing the abundance of higher levels (predators and omnivores). Furthermore, Q. suber decline altered the functional composition of soil communities, producing a setback of the ecological succession in the soil food web to an earlier stage (decrease in the maturity index and increase in the plant parasitic index), simplified soil food webs (decrease in the structure index), and shifts in the predominant decomposition channel (increase in the fungivores/bacterivores ratio). We also detected contrasting characteristics of the nematode community in neighbourhoods dominated by coexisting woody species, which suggests potential for long-term indirect effects on soil food webs due to the substitution of Q. suber by non-declining species. Synthesis. Our study provides novel results that show the major impacts that ongoing health deterioration of dominant tree species can have on the structure and composition of soil food webs in forest systems invaded by exotic pathogens, with cascading consequences for soil biogeochemical processes in both the short- and long term.

Regeneration after disturbance is quite slow and secondary succession can be delayed to the point of nearly stop. This is exacerbated when the community is strongly dominated by a single species able to quickly respond after disturbance. One example of such monospecific dominance is the colonization of abandoned fields in SE Spain by an early successional and native tussock grass, Lygeum spartum, that seems to halt succession. Here we tested the competitive ability of Lygeum against Salsola oppositifolia, a shrub species that can be found interspersed with Lygeum in mid-successional stages, and assessed how plant-soil interactions mediate the outcome of plant-plant competition. To do so, we sowed seeds and grew plants of Lygeum and Salsola in either intra- or interspecific competition under controlled conditions using sterile field soils inoculated with either live (i.e., with micro-organisms) or sterile soil extracts from the understories of either Lygeum or Salsola. Soil nutrient content, seed germination rate, and shoot mass growth were determined after 5 months, and soil bacterial communities were characterized by sequencing. Lygeum soil micro-organisms and soil properties, such as the high content of N and organic matter, enhanced seed germination rate of Lygeum individuals. By contrast, Salsola adults outperformed Lygeum when growing in interspecific competition. Synthesis. The enhanced competitive ability of Lygeum, which was mediated by soil micro-organisms, may lead to complete dominance of Lygeum in the plant community right after abandonment of agricultural fields. However, when the plant community is already developed, Lygeum would be unable to enforce such dominance. We conclude that positive plant-soil feedbacks combined with certain plant traits such as clonal growth support the strong resilience of Lygeum and allow for its dominance in extreme habitats.

In plant communities, some studies show that rare plant species are rare because they suffer stronger negative density-dependent effects from pathogens compared to abundant plant species. Moreover, such pathogen effects are also suggested to be related to phylogenetic distance among plant species. However, the importance of pathogens has been commonly inferred by treating the entire pathogen community as a "black box" without explicitly characterizing pathogen richness and community composition. Here, we test two predictions. First, if rare plant species are more susceptible to pathogens, we predict that rare plant species are associated with a higher richness of specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack only a single plant species) and/or the total pathogen community. If phylogenetically distinct plant species are less susceptible to pathogens, we predict that plant species with higher phylogenetic distinctiveness (i.e., a measure of how phylogenetically distant a species is from other co-occurring species) are associated with a lower richness of phylogenetic specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack closely related plant species) and/or the total pathogen community. We conducted a survey of the root-associated pathogen communities from 45 plant species in a subtropical forest. We showed that approximately 40% and 25% of the pathogens were specialists and phylogenetic specialists respectively. In contrast to our first prediction, the richness of the total pathogen community but not the richness of the specialists was found to be positively related to plant species abundance, indicating that rare plant species suffer less from pathogens. Consistent with our second prediction, both the richness of the phylogenetic specialists and the total pathogen community were found to be negatively related to plant species phylogenetic distinctiveness. Furthermore, these correlations were stronger at the earlier plant life stages examined. Synthesis. We found that the root-associated pathogen communities were less diverse in rare plant species and plant species with few close relatives. These associations varied across multiple plant life stages, suggesting that the strength of the above-ground-below-ground interactions change dynamically across plant life span.

Declining demographic performance and dispersal limitation influence the geographic distribution of the perennial forb Astragalus utahensis (Fabaceae)	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						abundant centre hypothesis; Astragalus utahensis; biogeography and macroecology; dispersal limitation; integral projection model; metapopulation model; niche limit; population growth; range limit; transplant	INTEGRAL PROJECTION MODELS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; RANGE BOUNDARY; SPECIES RANGE; CLIMATE; SEED; ABUNDANCE; ECOLOGY; FITNESS; LIMITS	A central goal of ecology is understanding the determinants of species' distributions. "Metapopulation" models for the existence of distributional boundaries predict that species' geographic ranges arise from the landscape-scale deterioration of habitat suitability towards the range edge (i.e., niche mechanisms), which simultaneously hinders demographic performance and limits dispersal to suitable habitat beyond the edge (i.e., dispersal limitation). However, few studies have examined both of these mechanisms for the same species by examining abundance and comprehensive measures of demographic performance across the distribution and beyond its boundary. We tested the predictions of metapopulation models for range limits by contrasting abundance, demographic performance, and population growth (lambda) of the perennial forb Astragalus utahensis in central and northern range edge populations. We tested for dispersal limitation by transplanting individuals at and beyond the northern range boundary and monitoring their demographic performance. Astragalus abundance and stochastic lambda decreased from the range centre to the northern range edge, with stochastic lambda falling to or below replacement in range edge populations. However, transplants at some sites beyond the northern range edge survived and reproduced at levels similar to transplants within the range. Thus, in addition to deteriorating conditions at the range edge, dispersal limitation appears to contribute to limiting A. utahensis' northern distribution. Synthesis. Our results support metapopulation models for range limits by suggesting that decreased demographic performance constrains the viability of range edge populations while contributing to dispersal limitation of Astragalus utahensis' distribution. Thus, the tandem action of niche and dispersal processes appears to play an important role in constraining this species' northern latitudinal range.

Disentangling the processes that underlie the demographic dynamics of species is fundamental to understanding how biodiversity is organized and will be re-organized at multiple scales. To provide new insights on multispecies demographic dynamics, I designed the present study to focus on local and biogeographic influences on mortality and recruitment rates for tree populations in forest biomes throughout the Japanese archipelago. Most populations exhibited mortality that fell within the 95% confidence intervals of a neutral model (i.e. the expectation of demographic stochasticity). However, there were also important determinants that make population dynamics to deviate from the neutral expectation. Interspecific niche differentiation was important to reduce the mortality rate, regardless of the local rarity or ubiquity of a species. Although intraspecific aggregation that caused density-dependent mortality was only significant for locally abundant species, the degree of isolation from a species' central or optimal range determined mortality only for locally rare species. These differences between rare and common species provide important empirical quantification of aspects of population dynamics that have been less accounted for in ecology and biogeography studies. Synthesis. Unifying different theories such as those rooted in local-scale community ecology and macro-scale biogeography is important. At this juncture, this study emphasizes that disentangling the interactive roles of demographic stochasticity and determinism that operate at different scales would be a clue to advance the field of ecology both in theory and practice.

Underground plant adaptations to environmental gradients have received relatively little attention. We studied plant nutrient-acquisition strategies and nutrient-use efficiency at three stages of pedogenesis in infertile soils from campos rupestres and on less infertile soil from cerrado sensu stricto in Brazil. All soils support very high plant diversity with high species turnover between soil types at small spatial scales (metres). We expected that differences in nutrient-acquisition and -use strategies would be associated with this high species turnover. With severely decreasing phosphorus (P) availability, we expected the effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses for plant P acquisition to decrease, and reliance on nonmycorrhizal strategies (NM) to increase, while maintaining efficient nutrient use. Concentrations of total soil P and nitrogen (N) were greater in soils in cerrado than in those from campos rupestres, and the more weathered soils from campos rupestres were severely P and N impoverished. The proportion of the root length colonized by AM fungi was 71% in the soils from the cerrado and campos rupestres. Conversely, the proportion of species with nonmycorrhizal P-acquisition strategies such as rhizosheaths was greater in the most P-impoverished soils. Leaf [P] and [N] were very low and decreased with decreasing soil [P] and [N]. Leaf N:P ratios suggest P limitation of plant productivity in the campos rupestres but N-P colimitation in the cerrado. Photosynthetic rates decreased with increasing P impoverishment, but photosynthetic P-use efficiency was very high and photosynthetic N-use efficiency moderately high on all soils. Most species had very high P-remobilization efficiency during leaf senescence (>70%), but only moderate N-remobilization efficiency (similar to 50%). Synthesis. We observed very high P-use efficiency and moderately high N-use efficiency in campos rupestres and cerrado species, consistent with plant productivity being more strongly limited by P than by N. Our findings demonstrate that different soil characteristics (nutrient availability and soil texture) select for species differing in nutrient-acquisition and -use strategies (especially below-ground traits) which is likely key for the very high species turnover at a very small scale between soil types (i.e., beta-diversity) in campos rupestres and cerrado.

Life in interstitial space: Biocrusts inhibit exotic but not native plant establishment in semi-arid grasslands	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						biological soil crusts; biotic resistance; disturbance; establishment; exotic plants; germination; grasslands; invasion	BIOLOGICAL SOIL CRUSTS; BROMUS-TECTORUM L; 2 ANNUAL GRASSES; VASCULAR PLANTS; SEED PREDATION; ALIEN PLANTS; DISTURBANCE; GERMINATION; INVASION; GROWTH	Exotic plant species commonly exploit disturbances more successfully than native plants. This outcome is widely attributed to the fact that disturbance reduces biotic resistance from native plant competitors. However, biocrusts, communities of mosses, lichens, and micro-organisms, are a prominent component of semi-arid grasslands occurring in the interstitial spaces between vascular plants. Biocrusts may provide an important source of biotic resistance to invaders, different from native plant competition, but poorly understood. We established a large-scale field experiment to examine how intact versus disturbed biocrusts influenced the emergence and establishment of four native and four exotic plant species in intermountain bunchgrass systems over 2 years-one wet and one dry. We also conducted a complementary greenhouse experiment to explore how differences in moisture might influence biocrust effects on germination. In the greenhouse, biocrusts inhibited the germination of both native and exotic plants in the high moisture treatment only. In field experiments, biocrusts inhibited the overall emergence of exotic seedlings in the wetter of the 2 years and inhibited the establishment of exotic seedlings in both years, but they had no overall effect on the emergence or establishment of native seedlings. We found that intact biocrusts in intermountain grasslands can suppress the establishment of some exotic plants, but have much weaker effects on natives. They also suggest that water availability may influence biocrust effects on seed germination. Synthesis. Our results indicate that intact biocrusts may provide an important source of biotic resistance to exotic plant invasions in intermountain grasslands. Furthermore, precipitation inputs may mediate biocrust effects on plant establishment.

Still, most alien garden plants have not naturalized yet, probably due in part to inadequate climatic conditions. Climate change may alter this, but few experimental studies have addressed this for non-naturalized alien garden plants, and those that have, addressed only singular aspects of climate change. In a greenhouse experiment, we examined the performance of nine non-naturalized alien herbaceous garden plants of varying climatic origins in response to simulated climate warming and reduced water availability, in a factorial design, as projected for southern Germany. To assess their invasion potential, we grew the species in competition with resident native and already-naturalized alien species. Reduced watering negatively affected non-naturalized garden plants, as well as the native and naturalized competitors, particularly at higher temperatures. However, non-naturalized aliens performed better relative to competitors when temperatures increased. Naturalized and native resident competitor responses to climate change were both negative, but across climate treatments, non-naturalized aliens, irrespective of their climatic origins, performed better against native than against naturalized competitors. Synthesis. We conclude that relative performance compared to resident species may increase for non-naturalized alien garden plants under climate change, as resident species become less competitive. Ongoing climate change is therefore likely to promote naturalization of commonly planted alien herbaceous species.

Trophic ecology of large herbivores in a reassembling African ecosystem	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						community assembly; herbivory; individual specialization; intraspecific niche variation; molecular diet analysis; restoration ecology; species coexistence; trophic rewilding	NICHE VARIATION HYPOTHESIS; FOOD SELECTION; INDIVIDUAL SPECIALIZATION; GRAZING ECOSYSTEM; HABITAT SELECTION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; DIET VARIATION; NATIONAL-PARK; RESOURCE; COMPETITION	Megafauna assemblages have declined or disappeared throughout much of the world, and many efforts are underway to restore them. Understanding the trophic ecology of such reassembling systems is necessary for predicting recovery dynamics, guiding management, and testing general theory. Yet, there are few studies of recovering large-mammal communities, and fewer still that have characterized food-web structure with high taxonomic resolution. In Gorongosa National Park, large herbivores have rebounded from near-extirpation following the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992). However, contemporary community structure differs radically from the prewar baseline: medium-sized ungulates now outnumber larger bodied species, and several apex carnivores remain locally extinct. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition of Gorongosa's 14 most abundant large-mammal populations. We tested five hypotheses: (i) the most abundant populations exhibit greatest individual-level dietary variability; (ii) these populations also have the greatest total niche width (dietary diversity); (iii) interspecific niche overlap is high, with the diets of less-abundant species nested within those of more-abundant species; (iv) partitioning of forage species is stronger in more structurally heterogeneous habitats; and (v) selectivity for plant taxa converges within guilds and digestive types, but diverges across them. Abundant (and narrow-mouthed) populations exhibited higher among-individual dietary variation, but not necessarily the greatest dietary diversity. Interspecific dietary overlap was high, especially among grazers and in structurally homogenous habitat, whereas niche separation was more pronounced among browsers and in heterogeneous habitat. Patterns of selectivity were similar for ruminants-grazers and browsers alike-but differed between ruminants and non-ruminants. Synthesis. The structure of this recovering food web was consistent with several hypotheses predicated on competition, habitat complexity, and herbivore traits, but it differed from patterns observed in more intact assemblages. We propose that intraspecific competition in the fastest-recovering populations has promoted individual variation and a more nested food web, wherein rare species use subsets of foods eaten by abundant species, and that this scenario is reinforced by weak predation pressure. Future work should test these conjectures and analyse how the taxonomic dietary niche axis studied here interacts with other mechanisms of diet partitioning to affect community reassembly following wildlife declines.

Testing the Distraction Hypothesis: Do extrafloral nectaries reduce ant-pollinator conflict?	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						ant-pollinator conflict; Distraction Hypothesis; extrafloral nectaries; fitness; myrmecophile; Turnera velutina	EXTRA-FLORAL NECTARIES; INDIRECT DEFENSE; SELECTIVE ABORTION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; MULTIPLE PARTNERS; PLANT DEFENSE; SEED-SET; FLOWERS; BENEFITS; PROTECTION	Ant guards protect plants from herbivores, but can also hinder pollination by damaging reproductive structures and/or repelling pollinators. Natural selection should favour the evolution of plant traits that deter ants from visiting flowers during anthesis, without waiving their defensive services. The Distraction Hypothesis posits that rewarding ants with extrafloral nectar could reduce their visitation of flowers, reducing ant-pollinator conflict while retaining protection of other structures. We characterised the proportion of flowers occupied by ants and the number of ants per flower in a Mexican ant-plant, Turnera velutina. We clogged extrafloral nectaries on field plants and observed the effects on patrolling ants, pollinators and ants inside flowers, and quantified the effects on plant fitness. Based on the Distraction Hypothesis, we predicted that preventing extrafloral nectar secretion should result in fewer ants active at extrafloral nectaries, more ants inside flowers and a higher proportion of flowers occupied by ants, leading to ant-pollinator conflict, with reduced pollinator visitation and reduced plant fitness. Overall ant activity inside flowers was low. Preventing extrafloral nectar secretion through clogging reduced the number of ants patrolling extrafloral nectaries, significantly increased the proportion of flowers occupied by ants from 6.1% to 9.7%, and reduced plant reproductive output through a 12% increase in the probability of fruit abortion. No change in the numbers of ants or pollinators inside flowers was observed. This is the first support for the Distraction Hypothesis obtained under field conditions, showing ecological and plant fitness benefits of the distracting function of extrafloral nectar during anthesis. Synthesis. Our study provides the first field experimental support for the Distraction Hypothesis, suggesting that extrafloral nectaries located close to flowers may bribe ants away from reproductive structures during the crucial pollination period, reducing the probability of ant occupation of flowers, reducing ant-pollinator conflict and increasing plant reproductive success.

This knowledge gap is significant given that currently forest ecosystems are expanding in Europe as a consequence of global change. Annually laminated sediments were extracted from two small lowland lakes (Moossee 521 m a.s.l.; Burgaschisee 465 m a.s.l.) on the Swiss Plateau. We combine high-resolution palaeoecological and quantitative analyses to assess changes in vegetation during the Neolithic. We test for regionally synchronous land-use phases and plant successional patterns that may originate from complex interactions between human and climatic impacts. Mixed Fagus sylvatica forests dominated the Swiss Plateau vegetation over millennia. During the period 6,500-4,200 cal year bp, pronounced forest disruptions accompanied by increased fire and agricultural activities occurred at c. 6,400-6,000 cal year bp, 5,750-5,550 cal year bp, around 5,400 cal year bp and at 5,100-4,600 cal year bp. Biodiversity increased during these land-use phases, likely in response to the creation of new open habitats. After decades to centuries of land-use, arboreal vegetation re-expanded. In a first succession stage, heliophilous Corylus avellana shrubs were replaced by pioneer Betula trees. These open arboreal communities were out-competed within 150-200 years by late-successional F. sylvatica and Abies alba forests. Most strikingly, cross-correlations show that these successions occurred synchronously (+/- 11 years) and repeatedly over large areas (>1,000 km(2)) and millennia. Synthesis. First notable human impact shaped the primeval mixed Fagus sylvatica forests in Central Europe from c. 6,800-6,500 cal year bp on. Agrarian societies were susceptible to climate changes and we hypothesize that climate-induced, simultaneous agricultural expansion and contraction phases resulted in synchronous regional forest successions. Currently, forests are expanding in Central Europe as a result of land abandonment in marginal areas. Our results imply that mixed Fagus sylvatica forests with Abies alba and Quercus may re-expand rapidly in these areas, if climate conditions will remain within the range of the mid-Holocene climatic variability (with summers c. +1-2 degrees C warmer than today).

This study evaluates age variation in multiple traits of a short-lived perennial herb using a manipulative field experimental design. Two different-aged cohorts were followed in a field plot for over a year to evaluate trait expression in response to a competition treatment and seasonal stress. Traits measured included size, mortality, reproduction, and physiology, including photosynthetic efficiency and chlorophyll content (SPAD). We hypothesized that the stress of competition and seasonal changes would accentuate age-dependent trait declines in older plants. The results highlight consistent age differences in plant size, mortality, and seed size with older plants being smaller, more likely to die, and producing smaller seeds. Some of the ageing declines were sensitive to environmental conditions such that it was only during certain seasons when older plants had higher mortality, lower photosynthetic efficiency, and lower chlorophyll content than young plants. Age-dependent trait expression also varied in response to competition such that age differences in size were only present in the "no competition treatment," and old individuals in the competition treatment had a higher mortality than all other age-environment combinations. Synthesis. These findings show that ageing in plants is a complex phenotype where declines in traits are uncoordinated and can be, but are not always, sensitive to environmental conditions. This study shows age-dependent maternal effects on offspring quality which, together with the decline in performance of older individuals, may have impacts on an individual's fitness and on natural population demography.

Phylogenetic diversity correlated with above-ground biomass production during forest succession: Evidence from tropical forests in Southeast Asia	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						abiotic and biotic factors; above-ground biomass; biodiversity; community assembly; ecosystem function; phylogenetic diversity; succession; tropical forest	ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS; SPECIES COOCCURRENCE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TREE BIOMASS; BIODIVERSITY; EVOLUTIONARY; RICHNESS; MODELS; LAND; DYNAMICS	Enhancing knowledge on the role of evolutionary history during forest succession and its relationship with ecosystem function is particularly relevant in the context of forest landscape restoration for climate change mitigation and adaptation. We used fine resolution vegetation and environmental data (soil, elevation and slope) from two large-scale surveys (320 x 1000 m(2) plots in two 10 km x 10 km blocks) in the Upper Mekong to quantify (1) the role of abiotic and biotic (species interactions) factors in community assembly processes and (2) the effect of biodiversity, environmental factors and forest succession on above-ground biomass (AGB). We found strong correlation between soil fertility and community structure in the early successional seres, while species interactions played an increasingly important role in older seres, presumably due to species complementary. We detected a significant relationship between AGB and phylogenetic diversity, elevation and soil fertility across successional gradients. Within successional stages, soil fertility was not significantly associated with AGB, while elevation was significantly associated with AGB only in forest <100 years old. Phylogenetic diversity was positively correlated with AGB in the young secondary forest (< 15 years old) but not significantly associated with AGB in older seres. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that abiotic filtering influences species assembly in the initial stages of forest succession, while biotic interactions dominate community assembly processes in older seres. We found that phylogenetic diversity, soil fertility and elevation gradients were strongly predictive of AGB in a secondary tropical montane forest in Southeast Asia. However, elevation may reflect other underlying abiotic gradients, such as water availability. Phylogenetic diversity was significantly associated with AGB only in youngest seres (<15 years old). Considering phylogenetic diversity in restoration plantings and the management of forests younger than 15 years old could enhance forest biomass and the climate mitigation function forest landscape restoration.

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						biotic homogenization; environmental changes; forest management; habitat filter; light availability; plant species diversity; soil disturbance; vegetation resurvey	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; TAXONOMIC HOMOGENIZATION; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; DECIDUOUS FOREST; ANCIENT FOREST; VEGETATION; TURNOVER	Managing ecosystems effectively for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services requires to understand how these ecosystems are changing and what are the drivers behind these changes. The resurvey of plant communities sampled some decades ago is increasingly used for this purpose. We used a life-history trait-based approach to test a number of hypothesized drivers behind decadal changes (1970-2015) in the herb layer of an ancient broadleaved lowland forest exhibiting contrasted soil and management types, while minimizing potential relocation and observer errors. Process-based hypotheses were tested using paired comparisons (old vs. new records) of community-weighted means and conditional inference classification trees for a number of traits across soil and management types. We then investigated how these processes impacted species composition and diversity within stands, among stands and at the entire forest scale, using metrics of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Though they have been continuously managed as regular high forest, managed stands experienced more pronounced vegetation changes than those left unmanaged. This could be directly or indirectly related to modifications in forest harvesting practices since 1970, via light availability at the forest floor, soil disturbance and local N deposition. While forest specialists increased their abundance over the entire forest, managed stands showed the strongest compositional changes, especially on the soil types that were more susceptible to compaction. Increasingly heavy forestry vehicles that drive more frequently across forest stands likely generate microhabitats suitable for ferns, graminoids and N-demanding forbs and also act as dispersal agents. Species richness of vascular plants increased at both stand (alpha-diversity) and forest (gamma-diversity) scales, due to the non-random, directional colonization by the same suite of species, causing compositional, functional and phylogenetic homogenization among habitats (i.e. decreased beta-diversity). Synthesis. Forest management, via the repeated passing of heavy forestry vehicles, emerged as the key driver of local vegetation changes. By altering canopy structure, it also increased the vulnerability of understories to climate warming and atmospheric deposits. Changes were not only taxonomic, but also functional, suggesting long-term effects on ecosystem functioning and thus deserve attention from forest managers and conservationists.

How do lianas and vines influence competitive differences and niche differences among tree species? Concepts and a case study in a tropical forest	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						climbing plants; fitness differences; host-parasite interactions; modern coexistence theory; natural enemies; plant population and community dynamics; shade-tolerance; tree species coexistence	BARRO-COLORADO ISLAND; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; RAIN-FOREST; EVERGREEN FOREST; HOST PREFERENCE; SEED DISPERSAL; GROWTH-RATES; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; ASSOCIATIONS	Lianas and other climbing plants are structural parasites of trees, generally reducing host tree survival, growth, and reproduction, yet their influences on the outcome of competition among tree species have remained largely unexplored. We propose that there are three distinct components to liana-tree interactions: prevalence, defined as the proportion of infested trees; load, defined as the mean liana cover on infested trees; and tolerance, defined as the effect of a given level of infestation on tree population growth rates. We introduce a new metric that integrates these components, the liana burden, defined as the total effect of lianas on per capita population growth rates given current prevalence, load, and tolerance. Using these metrics, we quantify variation among 33 co-occurring tropical tree species in liana-tree interactions and its relation with shade-tolerance. The focal tree species vary strongly in liana prevalence, load, tolerance, and burden. Interspecific variation in tolerance is the largest contributor to interspecific variation in burden. Species rankings of per capita population growth rates under current liana infestation levels differ somewhat from rankings under liana-free conditions, and differ strongly from rankings under uniformly high liana infestation. Thus, lianas alter competitive hierarchies to benefit tree species that are relatively tolerant of and/or resistant to lianas. Among the focal tree species, shade-tolerance is positively correlated with liana tolerance and prevalence, but largely unrelated to load and burden, meaning shade-tolerance does not predict which species are competitively disadvantaged by lianas. We describe a variety of mechanisms by which lianas may potentially increase or decrease niche differences among tree species, including interactions with spatial and temporal environmental niche partitioning, and potential differences among tree species in relative vulnerability to different liana species. Synthesis. Lianas, like other natural enemies, can in principle alter competitive hierarchies and niche structure of co-occurring tree species, and our analyses suggest such influences are substantial in our focal tropical tree community and likely many other tree communities as well. Quantifying these effects requires a more comprehensive approach including analyses and modelling of dynamics of liana-tree interactions and their variation with tree and liana species identities.

Although rodents are primary seed dispersers in habitat subjected to defaunation, changes in seed dispersal effectiveness of rodents along mammalian defaunation gradients, and empirical support for mechanisms underlying alteration of this ecological process, are unclear. We assessed the direct and indirect effects of forested area and isolation on seed dispersal effectiveness of rodents on 21 study islands with varying levels of defaunation in the Thousand Island Lake, China. We used camera sampling, live traps and semi-quantitative acorn counts to assess occurrence of large-bodied mammal species, relative abundance of small rodent species and seed crop size respectively. Seed dispersal, post-dispersal seed survival, seedling emergence, and seedling survival were estimated by tracking fates of tagged acorns and by planting acorns in exclosures. Forested area had positive indirect effects on seed dispersal effectiveness through defaunation and rodent competition for acorns, whereas isolation had negative direct and weaker positive indirect effects on seed dispersal effectiveness mediated by loss of large-bodied mammals and rodent competition for acorns. Loss of large-bodied mammals negatively affected seed dispersal effectiveness indirectly by virtue of its impact on rodent competition for acorns. Seed dispersal effectiveness exhibited a unimodal relationship with intensity of rodent competition for acorns, peaking at intermediate levels. Synthesis. Indirect effects of island attributes mediated by defaunation of large-bodied mammals on small or isolated islands appear to drive altered competition for food among rodents and decreased seed dispersal effectiveness. Altered interactions between acorns and their rodent consumers/dispersers can substantially affect oak population demography in the Thousand Island Lake system. More broadly, our findings highlight the importance to the seed dispersal process of multiple interwoven effects between habitat fragmentation and defaunation of large-bodied mammals.

CRANTZ; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POLLEN-FLOW; GENE-FLOW; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; NATURAL-SELECTION; WILDSERVICE TREE; EVOLUTION	Sexual selection may contribute to the evolution of plant sexual dimorphism by favoring architectural traits in males that improve pollen dispersal to mates. In both sexes, larger individuals may be favored by allowing the allocation of more resources to gamete production (a "budget" effect of size). In wind-pollinated plants, large size may also benefit males by allowing the liberation of pollen from a greater height, fostering its dispersal (a "direct" effect of size). To assess these effects and their implications for trait selection, we measured selection on plant morphology in both males and females of the wind-pollinated dioecious herb Mercurialis annua in two separate experimental common gardens at contrasting density. In both gardens, selection strongly favored males that disperse their pollen further. Selection for pollen production was observed in the high-density garden only, and was weak. In addition, male morphologies associated with increased mean pollen dispersal differed between the two gardens, as elongated branches were favored in the high-density garden, whereas shorter plants with longer inflorescence stalks were favored in the low-density garden. Larger females were selected in both gardens. Our results point to the importance of both a direct effect of selection on male traits that affect pollen dispersal, and, to a lesser extent, a budget effect of selection on pollen production.

Here, we use experimental evolution to investigate the spread of self-compatibility from one such population of the perennial plant Linaria cavanillesii into self-incompatible (SI) populations that still have high inbreeding depression. We introduced self-compatible (SC) individuals at different frequencies into replicate experimental populations of L. cavanillesii that varied in access to pollinators. Our experiment revealed a rapid shift to self-compatibility in all replicates, driven by both greater seed set and greater outcross siring success of SC individuals. We discuss our results in the light of computer simulations that confirm the tendency of self-compatibility to spread into SI populations under the observed conditions. Our study illustrates the ease with which self-compatibility can spread among populations, a requisite for species-wide transitions from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility.

This pattern among extant species suggests that ancestral shifts between forest and open habitats may have coincided with changes in leaf shape or size. We tested relationships between habitat, climate, photosynthetic pathway, and leaf shape and size in a phylogenetic framework to evaluate drivers of leaf shape and size variation over the evolutionary history of the family. We also estimated the ancestral habitat of Poaceae and tested whether forest margins served as transitional zones for shifts between forests and grasslands. We found that grass leaf shape is converging toward different shape optima in the forest understory, forest margins, and open habitats. Leaf size also varies with habitat. Grasses have smaller leaves in open and drier areas, and in areas with high solar irradiance. Direct transitions between linear and ovate leaves are rare as are direct shifts between forest and open habitats. The most likely ancestral habitat of the family was the forest understory and forest margins along with an intermediate leaf shape served as important transitional habitat and morphology, respectively, for subsequent shifts across forest-grassland biome boundaries.

We used a quantitative genetics approach to investigate constraints on the evolution of secondary metabolites in a wild mustard, Boechera stricta. Much of the genetic variation in chemical composition of glucosinolates in B. stricta is controlled by a single locus, BCMA1/3. In a large-scale common garden experiment under natural conditions, we quantified fitness and glucosinolate profile in two leaf types and in fruits. We estimated genetic variances and covariances (the G-matrix) and selection on chemical profile in each tissue. Chemical composition of defenses was strongly genetically correlated between tissues. We found antagonistic selection between defense composition in leaves and fruits: compounds that were favored in leaves were disadvantageous in fruits. The positive genetic correlations and antagonistic selection led to strong constraints on the evolution of defenses in leaves and fruits. In a hypothetical population with no genetic variation at BCMA1/3, we found no evidence for genetic constraints, indicating that pleiotropy affecting chemical profile in multiple tissues drives constraints on the evolution of secondary metabolites.

We demonstrated that the phenotypic covariance structure remained conserved on a broader phylogenetic scale but also showed a substantial divergence between interclade comparisons. Most of the phylogenetic structure in the integration space can be explained by splits at the beginning of the diversification of major clades. Our results provide evidence for a multiple peak adaptive landscape in the evolution of cranial covariance structure and morphological differentiation, based upon diet and roosting ecology. In this scenario, the successful radiation of phyllostomid bats was triggered by the diversification of dietary and roosting strategies, and the invasion of these new adaptive zones lead to changes in phenotypic covariance structure and average morphology. Our results suggest that intense natural selection preceded the invasion of these new adaptive zones and played a fundamental role in shaping cranial covariance structure and morphological differentiation in this hyperdiverse clade of mammals. Finally, our study demonstrates the power of combining comparative methods and quantitative genetic approaches when investigating the evolution of complex morphologies.

Female cuticular hydrocarbons can signal indirect fecundity benefits in an insect	EVOLUTION			English	Article						CHCs; fecundity; genetic correlations; male mate choice; Teleogryllus oceanicus	AUSTRALIAN FIELD CRICKET; SEXUAL SELECTION; MATE CHOICE; DROSOPHILA; EVOLUTION; HERITABILITY; DIMORPHISM; MALES; BIOSYNTHESIS; EVOLVABILITY	Male choosiness of prospective female mating partners provides an increasingly recognized pathway through which males can increase their fitness. For example, males may increase their number of offspring by targeting more fecund females as mating partners. If fecundity is heritable, males that mate with more fecund females can also receive the indirect benefit of more fecund daughters. In species where female fecundity is not directly assessable, female ornaments may act as signals of fecundity. However, whether female ornaments reliably signal the indirect benefit of more fecund daughters is not well understood. We investigated this question using the field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. Previous work had identified the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile as a female sexual display trait in T. oceanicus. To examine whether CHCs can provide a reliable signal of fecundity, we tested whether individual CHC compounds and the first principal axis of CHC variation (PC1) are genetically correlated with ovary mass, a reliable proxy for fecundity in this species. We found significant genetic correlations between ovary mass and three individual CHC compounds, as well as PC1. This result indicates that by targeting females as mating partners based on their CHC profile, males can sire more fecund daughters.

This ongoing process takes place within tangled networks of species interactions. In microbial communities, evolutionary change between hosts and parasites occurs at the same time scale as ecological change. Yet, we still lack experimental evidence of the role of coevolution in driving changes in the structure of such species interaction networks. Filling this gap is important because network structure influences community persistence through indirect effects. Here, we quantified experimentally to what extent coevolutionary dynamics lead to contrasting patterns in the architecture of bacteria-phage infection networks. Specifically, we look at the tendency of these networks to be organized in a nested pattern by which the more specialist phages tend to infect only a proper subset of those bacteria infected by the most generalist phages. We found that interactions between coevolving bacteria and phages become less nested over time under fluctuating dynamics, and more nested under arms race dynamics. Moreover, when coevolution results in high average infectivity, phages and bacteria differ more from each other over time under arms race dynamics than under fluctuating dynamics. The tradeoff between the fitness benefits of evolving resistance/infectivity traits and the costs of maintaining them might explain these differences in network structure. Our study shows that the interaction pattern between bacteria and phages at the community level depends on the way coevolution unfolds.

Plasticity in parental care might be especially effective in facilitating adaptive radiations if it allows populations to persist in novel environments. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral plasticity by parents in response to predation risk facilitated the adaptive radiation of three-spine sticklebacks. We compared the behavior of fathers across multiple ancestral (marine) and derived (freshwater) stickleback populations that differ in time since establishment. We measured behavioral plasticity in fathers in response to a predator found only in freshwater environments, simulating conditions marine males experience when colonizing freshwater. The antipredator behavior of males from newly established freshwater populations was intermediate between marine populations and well-established freshwater populations. In contrast to our predictions, on average, there was greater behavioral plasticity in derived freshwater populations than in ancestral marine populations. However, we found greater individual variation in behavioral reaction norms in marine populations compared to well-established freshwater populations, with newly established freshwater populations intermediate. This suggests that standing variation in behavioral reaction norms within ancestral populations might provide different evolutionary trajectories, and illustrates how plasticity can contribute to adaptive radiations.

Stream Conditions after 18 Years of Passive Riparian Restoration in Small Fish-bearing Watersheds	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Forest recovery; Riparian; Olympic Peninsula; Second-growth forests; Passive restoration; Active restoration	LARGE WOODY DEBRIS; JUVENILE COHO SALMON; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CARNATION CREEK; FOREST HARVEST; HEADWATER STREAMS; BUFFER STRIPS; ABUNDANCE; GROWTH; TEMPERATURE	Many of the ecological processes in the riparian forests and streams across the Pacific Northwest have become impaired through production forestry practices common prior to the 1990s. Some of these practices included forest harvest without stream buffers, removal of instream wood, road construction and use, and harvesting large proportions of watersheds. Passive ecological restoration (the use of natural processes of succession and disturbance to alleviate anthropogenic impacts over time) is a common practice used in the management of riparian forests previously subjected to production forestry. Eighteen years after the implementation of passive restoration of riparian forests, we used four common stream indicators (stream temperature, canopy closure, instream wood, and salmonid densities) to assess the effects of restoration in small fish-bearing streams. Summer stream temperatures have decreased below unmanaged reference levels, whereas riparian forest canopy closure has increased beyond that in reference watersheds. Instream wood and age-1 or older salmonids appear to be either stable at reduced levels or declining, compared with production forestry and unmanaged reference watersheds. Overall, second-growth riparian forests need more time to develop allowing more light into streams (increasing primary productivity), while also allowing for the continuous recruitment of larger pieces of instream wood (improving habitat for salmonids). Using only passive restoration, stream conditions in second-growth forests are unlikely to increase salmonid production in the near future.

Activity budgets for the sedentary Argentine sea bass Acanthistius patachonicus inferred from accelerometer data loggers	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						accelerometer; behaviour; ethogram; rocky-reef fish; Serranidae	GROUPER EPINEPHELUS-MARGINATUS; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; TRIAXIAL ACCELEROMETER; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; TEMPERATURE; ACCELERATION; FISH; MOVEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; CONSUMPTION	The amount of energy an animal uses to move may constitute a significant fraction of its energy budget, so detailed descriptions of wild animal activity budgets can help to understand the ecology of a species, both at the individual and at the population levels. The rocky-reef fishes inhabiting the northern Patagonian gulfs of Argentina are important economic and recreational resources for which no activity or energy budgets are available. This fish assemblage may reach high aggregated biomasses (exceeding several hundreds of kilogrammes of fish distributed along a few hundred metres of linear reef ledges) and is not clear how such biomasses can be supported by the low productivity of the Patagonian coastal waters. We used animal-attached accelerometers to characterise the behaviours and activity budgets for the most abundant and ubiquitous species of this assemblage, the Argentine sea bass or Mero' Acanthistius patachonicus (Jenyns, 1840; Osteichthyes: Serranidae). Sixteen individuals were tagged (two in captivity and 14 free-living) and an ethogram was generated from acceleration recordings in varying environmental conditions. Two algorithms were used to classify the behaviours of wild fish. Both showed generally similar results during the cold-water season (8-10 degrees C), but differed slightly in the warm-water season (16-18 degrees C). Overall, sea bass were more active during warm season (mean time spent engaged in active behaviours; 46%, range; 24-60%). In contrast, during cold season fish only spent a mean of 29% of their time in active behaviours (range; 15-49%). No clear response to tidal state or ambient light was found, but some fish were more active during the night in the cold water season. Here, we provide the first activity budgets for the conspicuous Argentine sea bass, which contribute to our understanding of rocky-reef fish behaviour in Patagonia.

Herein we describe a new species of parasitic mite from the genus Ophiomegistus (Parasitiformes: Mesostigmata: Paramegistidae) of an endangered South Australian skink; the pygmy bluetongue lizard (Tiliqua adelaidensis). Adult mites were observed on lizard hosts in three different host populations, among which prevalence varied. No temporal trend in prevalence was evident over two spring-summer seasons of monitoring. We hypothesise that the reliance on burrows as refuges by T.adelaidensis may be essential for the completion of the mite life cycle and also for horizontal transmission. The conservation implications of not only its effect on the host, but also its potential status as an endangered species itself, are considered.
