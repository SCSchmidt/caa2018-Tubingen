However, few experimental studies have explicitly tested this. Our multispecies experiment tested whether global naturalization success of plant species native to Central Europe is related to a high N-acquisition ability. 2 We selected 41 common herbaceous species native to Germany that have all become naturalized, and thus been introduced, elsewhere. Twenty-two of these species are widely naturalized and 19 are less widely naturalized. We grew the 41 grassland species, sampled in Germany, under low and high N-conditions in a greenhouse experiment, and assessed their N-acquisition abilities. 3 Although the widely naturalized species grew faster on average, they had a significantly lower N-uptake rate than the less widely naturalized ones. The widely naturalized species, however, had a marginally significantly higher root-mass fraction. Despite these differences, the total plant N-content did on average not differ between the two groups of species. However, N-addition tended to increase the total plant N-content more for the widely naturalized species than for the less widely naturalized species. Nitroge addition also increased biomass production and N-uptake rate, and decreased the root-mass fraction of plants, but these responses did not differ between widely and less widely naturalized species. 4 We conclude that although fast-growing species tend to have a higher global naturalization success than slow-growing species, the naturalization success of plants is not necessarily related to a high N-acquisition ability.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) influence plant nutrient uptake, including nitrogen (N) acquisition. Under low N and phosphorus conditions, AMF delivery of N from organic sources not immediately available to the plant can have large impacts on plant N status, a limiting nutrient in the aphid diet. This study investigated the effect of AMF colonisation upon aphid number and determined the consequences of AMF directly accessing an organic nutrient patch that the plant cannot. We hypothesised that AMF colonisation of plants will increase plant and aphid N status, plant performance and aphid number, but only when the AMF had direct access to the added organic patch. Barley plants hosting the grain aphid Sitobion avenae were colonised by the AMF, Funneliformis mosseae, or no AMF. A two-compartment microcosm was used to separate the plant roots from a N-15-labelled organic patch in a second compartment. AMF-colonised plants, but without access to the second compartment, were used to examine the effect of AMF colonisation on aphid number. In a separate treatment, and to determine whether AMF access to a plant inaccessible N source modified the effect of AMF colonisation on aphid number, AMF hyphae were permitted access to the second compartment containing an organic patch. As a control for AMF accessing a larger substrate volume, AMF were allowed access to a second compartment without an organic patch. When the AMF accessed the organic patch, more N from the patch was delivered to the plant resulting in a higher grain N concentration although plant growth was depressed. More N from the patch was also delivered to the aphids, but the N status of the aphid remained unchanged. Regardless of the level of access to the organic patch, AMF colonisation did not affect aphid number. Our data show that by accessing N sources not readily available to plants, AMF can indirectly deliver N to above-ground organisms, a finding which has major implications for N-transfer between higher trophic levels.

To predict such distributional changes, simple and comparable measures of heat tolerance are needed and these measures should ideally correlate with the characteristics of the species current thermal environments. A recent model (thermal tolerance landscapes-TTLs) uses the exponential relation between temperature and knockdown time to describe the thermal tolerance of ectotherms across time/temperature scales. Here, we established TTLs for 11 Drosophila species representing different thermal ecotypes by measuring knockdown time at 9-17 stressful temperatures (0.5 degrees C intervals). These temperatures caused knockdown times ranging from 12 hrs and all species displayed the expected exponential relation between temperature and knockdown time (average R-2 = 0.98). Previous studies using TTLs have reported a trade-off between tolerance to acute and chronic heat stress in ectotherms. The present study did not find evidence to support this trade-off in drosophilids. Instead, we show how this "trade-off" can arise as an analytical artefact caused by insufficient data collection and excessive data extrapolation. Dynamic assays represent an alternative method to describe heat tolerance of ectotherms, where animals are exposed to gradually increasing temperatures until knockdown. The comparability of static and dynamic assays has previously been questioned, but here we show that static and dynamic assays give comparable information on heat tolerance. Using the constants derived from static TTLs, we mathematically model the expected dynamic knockdown temperature and subsequently confirm this model by comparison to empirically obtained knockdown temperatures from all 11 species. Characterisation of heat tolerance in laboratory settings is an important tool in thermal biology, but more so if the measures correlate with the environmental gradients that characterise the fundamental niche of species. Here, we show that both static and dynamic assays were characterised by strong correlations to precipitation of the driest month and maximum temperature of the warmest month combined (R-2 = 0.68-0.71). This demonstrates that both assay types offer simple measures of heat tolerance that are ecologically relevant for the tested drosophilids.

In addition, corals are predicted to experience large fluctuations in seawater nutrient concentrations, following water column stratification or eutrophication problems, which can further alter their nutritional capacities and ultimately their resilience to global change. We investigated the effect of thermal stress and dissolved inorganic nutrient (DINUT) availability on the auto- and heterotrophic nutritional capacities of corals. In particular, we assessed the effect of nitrogen enrichment or DINUT depletion (both in nitrogen and in phosphorus) on the assimilation of heterotrophic nutrients and on the heat-stress tolerance of the reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata. Here, we show that DINUT depletion enhanced coral bleaching under thermal stress and more importantly, significantly impaired rates of heterotrophic nutrient assimilation, inducing coral starvation. In contrast, corals grown under nitrogen enrichment maintained high rates of heterotrophic nutrient assimilation and avoided bleaching, although nutrient uptake rates were lowered. We therefore observed a positive coupling between auto- and heterotrophy within the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis, indicating that heterotrophic processes require a minimum of autotrophically acquired nutrients to be functional. These findings show that the trophic plasticity of corals directly depends on the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients in seawater. The lack of a shift towards greater heterotrophy under DINUT depletion may lead to substantial modifications of the role that feeding plays in the response of reef-building corals to climate change.

Space use is a fundamental component of an animal's ecology, and the extent of an animal's home range has consequences for individual distributions, community structure and ecosystem function. As ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of global warming, determining the effects of temperature on space use and movement patterns of important fisheries species is vital. Our aim was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in space use by a tropical fisheries species, the leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus), from two latitudinally distinct locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the potential response of large-bodied tropical fishes to ocean warming through behavioural modification. Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Taken together, our findings indicate that higher ambient temperature may elicit a sustained and significant decline in space use by a commercially important reef fish. Given projected increases in ocean temperature due to global climate change, large-bodied reef fishes may be increasingly constrained in their movement and space use, which will have ramifications for individual fitness, population viability, fisheries productivity and ecological function.

Sexual conflict frequently leads to behavioural adaptations that allow males to displace their rivals, but in doing so harm those same females they are competing to access, which can decrease population viability and facilitate extinction. We are far from understanding what factors modulate the intensity of sexual conflict and particularly the role of ecology in mediating underlying behavioural adaptations. In this study, we show that, in Drosophila melanogaster, variations in environmental temperature of +/- 4 degrees C decrease male harm impact on female fitness by between 45% and 73%. Rate-sensitive fitness estimates indicate that such modulation results in an average rescue of population productivity of 7% at colder temperatures and 23% at hotter temperatures. Our results: (a) show that the thermal ecology of social interactions can drastically modulate male harm via behavioural plasticity, (b) identify a potentially crucial ecological factor to understand how sexual conflict operates in nature and (c), along with recent studies, suggest that behaviourally plastic responses can lessen the negative effect of sexual conflict on population viability in the face of rapid environmental temperature changes.

However, while effects of AGW on resource-consumer interactions at the first and second trophic level have been well studied, little is known about effects on interactions at higher trophic levels at the terminal end of food chains (e.g. in the third and fourth trophic levels). Here, we examined the effects of temperature variability by simulating heatwaves on functional responses of two species at the fourth trophic level (hyperparasitoids) that parasitize host species at the third trophic level (parasitoid cocoons). We found that host cocoons developed faster under simulated heatwave conditions, decreasing the temporal window of susceptibility of the host cocoons to parasitism by the two hyperparasitoids, and consequently parasitism declined with temperature. However, the effects of a simulated heatwave markedly differed among the two hyperparasitoid species; temperature and host quality had a much stronger effect on early reproduction in the less fecund hyperparasitoid Gelis agilis, than in the more fecund species Acrolyta nens. Our results suggest that exposure to heatwaves, that are expected to increase in frequency, will affect the ability of species at higher trophic levels to exploit transient resources whose suitability is temperature-dependent. In turn, the observed effects of AGW on the functional responses of the hyperparasitoids may disrupt trophic interactions and have profound impact on population dynamics and ecological processes.

Using commonly measured traits such as leaf mass per area (LMA) and wood density (WD), and additional traits related to water transport, gas exchange and resource economics, including leaf vein, stomatal and wilting traits, we tested hypotheses for Hawaiian wet montane and lowland dry forests (MWF and LDF, respectively): (1) Forests would differ in a wide range of traits as expected from contrasting adaptation; (2) trait values would be more convergent among dry than wet forest species due to the stronger environmental filtering; (3) traits would be intercorrelated within "modules" supporting given functions; (4) relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality rate (m) would correlate with a number of specific traits; with (5) stronger relationships when stratifying by tree size; and (6) RGR and m can be strongly explained from trait-based models. The MWF species' traits were associated with adaptation to high soil moisture and nutrient supply and greater shade tolerance, whereas the LDF species' traits were associated with drought tolerance. Thus, on average, MWF species achieved higher maximum heights than LDF species and had leaves with larger epidermal cells, higher maximum stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rate, lower vein lengths per area, higher saturated water content and greater shrinkage when dry, lower dry matter content, higher phosphorus concentration, lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, high chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio, high carbon isotope discrimination, high stomatal conductance to nitrogen ratio, less negative turgor loss point and lower WD. Functional traits were more variable in the MWF than LDF, were correlated within modules, and predicted species' RGR and m across forests, with stronger relationships when stratifying by tree size. Models based on multiple traits predicted vital rates across forests (R-2 = 0.70-0.72; p < 0.01). Our findings are consistent with a powerful role of broad suites of functional traits in contributing to forest species' distributions, integrated plant design and vital rates.

Few studies have examined the role of environmental factors in controlling species interaction networks across time. We examined variation in plant-grasshopper network structural properties in response to three major grassland drivers: periodic fire, ungulate grazing and climate. We sequenced a plant barcoding gene from extracted grasshopper gut contents to characterize diets of 26 grasshopper species. Resulting grasshopper species' diets were combined with long-term plant and grasshopper surveys to assemble plant-grasshopper networks across 13-19 years for six watersheds subjected to varying fire and grazing treatments. Network modularity, generality and predicted grasshopper community robustness to plant species loss all increased in grazed watersheds. Temperature decreased predicted grasshopper community robustness to plant species loss. Grasshopper communities were found to be vulnerable to climatic warming due to host plant loss. However, intermediate disturbance from ungulate grazers may maintain grasshopper diversity and buffer community robustness to species loss. Our results suggest that climate and disturbance shape the structure of ecological interaction networks and thus have many indirect effects on species persistence though direct effects on interaction partners.

Recent research has shown that marine mammals often make use of tidally energetic locations for foraging, yet data are generally limited to observations of animals at the water surface. Such areas are also of interest to the renewable energy industry for the deployment of tidal-stream energy turbines; this has led to concerns about potential impacts on marine mammals. Methods for measuring animal movements underwater are limited; however, active sonar can image marine mammals and could potentially measure three-dimensional movements in tidally energetic locations. Here, a dual 720 kHz sonar system was developed to investigate the three-dimensional movements of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in a tidally energetic channel. Estimated mean depth (distance from the surface) of seals was 12.0 m (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 11.6-12.4 m), and the majority of time was spent at the surface and at approximately 10-12 m distance from the surface. When expressed as distances from the sea bed, mean distance was 18.5 m (95% CI: 18.0-18.9 m), and the majority of time was spent at 14 m from the sea bed. Seal movements were generally in the same direction as the tidal flow with mean horizontal speeds of between 0.51 and 3.13 m s(-1) (95% CIs = 1.24-1.54 m s(-1)). Mean vertical velocities (where negative and positive values represent a descent and ascent respectively) for each seal track ranged between -1.76 and +0.88 m s(-1) (95% CIs: -0.23 to +0.03 m s(-1)). These results provide a basis for understanding how seals utilize a dynamic tidal environment and suggest that harbour seal behaviour can be markedly different to less tidally energetic habitats. The results also have important implications for the prediction of risk associated with interactions between diving seals and tidal turbines in these dynamic habitats.

A primary step in identifying diversity losses is the comparison between historical and contemporary states of landscapes and fish assemblages, but uncertainty remains regarding the appropriate spatial scales of investigation. Historical data collected in 1976 were paired with two years of contemporary replication (2015, 2016) to assess fish diversity change at 10 sites in Blackburn Fork, TN, USA. Analyses focused on a nested hierarchy of spatial scales, including sampling sites (fine scale), nested within stream orders (intermediate scale), nested within the entire catchment (broad scale). Diversity change between 1976 and 2015-16 was assessed using traditional diversity metrics (site scale) and rarefaction (stream-order scale), whereas spatial variation in contemporary diversity (2015-16) was assessed with nonmetric multidimensional scaling (catchment scale). At the site scale, locations on the east side of Blackburn Fork and in close proximity to developed land experienced diversity loss. At the stream-order scale, the effective number of species declined in first-order streams where land development was concentrated, but no consistent species losses occurred in other stream orders. At the catchment scale, assemblages responded significantly to stream size but not land use, perhaps because diversity was already homogenized by 2015-16. Mapping 40 years of land-use change across the catchment underscored a pattern of spatial alignment between developed lands and stream fish diversity loss. This study highlights the benefits of considering multiple spatial scales when assessing historical change in stream fish assemblages, and highlights stronger inference derived from historical comparisons relative to contemporary space-for-time substitutions. This framework combines recent analytical advances in rarefaction with a riverscape perspective, and can be applied to conserve streams, and their biota, in riverscapes around the world.

A survey of local communities around the two lakes was conducted to investigate fishing activities and their potential impacts. Using a series of six scenarios derived from our data, we suggest that enhanced daytime patrols may have driven fishers to conduct compensatory night-time fishing when the patrols are absent. Night-time fishing activities overlap temporally with the main period of Yangtze finless porpoise foraging, so the potential intensification of night-time fishing with the use of illegal gears could pose an increased threat to porpoises. In addition to increasing law enforcement management efforts, helping fishers to secure alternative livelihoods may provide a more practical and sustainable long-term method for reducing illegal fishing and its impacts on porpoises. This study also provides important lessons for conservation policy-making and implementation for other cetacean species threatened by illegal fishing.

A Stochastic Model for Ice Core Time Series	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Ice core; Vostok; EPICA; NGRIP; Fractional differencing; FARIMA; Volatility; GARCH; Directionality	CLIMATE	Ice cores provide a proxy for climatic records over a period of nearly half a million years, and are a valuable source of information about past climate changes. The deuterium content in the 1999 Lake Vostok and 2004 EPICA Dome C ice cores, and the Delta-O-18 measurement in the 2003 NGRIP ice core, are analysed and time series models are fitted. The procedure is to fit Milankovitch cycles in regression models and take residuals from these models as cycle adjusted (decycled) time series; interpolate the decycled series from Lake Vostok and EPICA to obtain evenly spaced data, at 50 and 100years respectively (the NGRIP series is evenly spaced at 50years); fit a fractionally differenced autoregressive moving average (FARIMA) model to the three decycled time series; and investigate the residuals. The Milankovitch cycles account for 65% of the variance in the Vostok series, 59% of the variance in the EPICA series and 74% of the variance of the NGRIP series. The spectra of the decycled time series provide evidence that fractional differencing is appropriate, and fractional differencing is followed by fitting autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models according to a minimum AIC criterion, to give FARIMA models. The fitted ARMA models were of low order (up to six coefficients), and the residuals from these FARIMA models are consistent with their being a realisation of independent random variation. However, the distribution of the residuals is noticeably non-Gaussian, which accounts for a small degree of directionality, and there is evidence of volatility. The analysis is discussed in the context of known environmental disturbances.	[Isa, Farah L.

Based on data on the density of host-seeking Ixodes ricinus ticks and pathogen prevalence and using a variety of environmental data, we have created an acarological risk model for a region where both diseases are endemic (Czech RepublicSouth Bohemia and GermanyLower Bavaria, Upper Palatinate). The data on tick density were acquired by flagging 50 sampling sites three times in a single season. Prevalence of the causative agents of LB and TBE was determined. Data on environmental variables (e.g., altitude, vegetation cover, NDVI, land surface temperature) were obtained from various sources and processed using geographical information systems. Generalized linear models were used to estimate tick density, probability of tick infection, and density of infected ticks for the whole area. A significantly higher incidence of human TBE cases was recorded in South Bohemia compared to Bavarian regions, which correlated with a lower tick density in Bavaria. However, the differences in pathogen prevalence rates were not significant. The model outputs were made available to the public in the form of risk maps, indicating the distribution of tick-borne disease risk in space.

It arrived in several Chinese cities from imported cases and then spread as people travelled domestically by all means of transportation, among which road traffic was the most commonly used for daily commuting. Spatial variation in socioeconomic status not only accelerates migration across regions but also partly induces the differences in epidemic processes and in responses to epidemics across regions. However, the roles of both road travel and socioeconomic factors have not received the attention they deserve. Here, we constructed a national highway network for and between 333 cities in mainland China and extracted epidemiological variables and socioeconomic factors for each city. We calculated classic centrality measures for each city in the network and proposed two new measures (SumRatio and Multicenter Distance). We evaluated the correlation between the centrality measures and epidemiological features and conducted a spatial autoregression to quantify the impacts of road network and socioeconomic factors during the outbreak. The results showed that epidemics had more significant relationships with both our new measures than the classic ones. Higher population density, higher per person income, larger SumRatio and Multicenter Distance, more hospitals and college students, and lower per person GDP were associated with higher cumulative incidence. Higher population density and number of slaughtered pigs were found to advance epidemic arrival time. Higher population density, more colleges and slaughtered pigs, and lower Multicenter Distance were associated with longer epidemic duration. In conclusion, road transport and socioeconomic status had significant impacts and should be considered for the prevention and control of future pandemics.

In recent years, a new generation of low- cost air pollution sensors has emerged. Poor or unknown data quality, resulting from the intrinsic properties of the sensor as well as the lack of a consensus on data processing methodologies for these sensors, has, among other factors, prevented widespread adoption of these sensors. To contribute to the creation of this consensus, we reviewed the available methodologies for quality control, outlier detection and gap filling and applied two outlier detection methodologies and five gap filling methodologies to a case study ( consisting of an 11- month long air quality data set from a low- cost sensor). We showed that erroneous data can be detected in a fully automated way, and that point and contextual outlier detection methodologies can be applied to low- cost air pollution data and yield meaningful results. The linear interpolation showed the best performance for gap filling for low- cost air pollution sensors. In conclusion, data cleaning procedures are important, and the presented methods can form part of a generalised data processing methodology for low- cost air pollution sensors.

The South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis)-hookworm (Uncinaria sp.) interaction offers an ideal system to overcome these difficulties and study the behavioral and physiological effects of parasites in their hosts. Hookworms cause stunted growth and anemia in pinniped pups, which could affect early life active behaviors such as swimming. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of hookworms (Uncinaria sp.) on the development of swimming capabilities in A. australis through physiological and ethological analyses. Higher parasite burden was associated with reduced growth rates and lower blood hemoglobin concentrations, whereas scaled body mass and blood hemoglobin levels had an important positive effect on the water activity of the pups. However, antihookworm treatment did not affect the level of water activity of the pups, and pups with high hookworm burden increased their time budget in water. This was probably related to lower maternal attendance in heavily parasitized pups, leaving these pups more time to perform water activities. Therefore, pups with heavy hookworm burden, despite having decreased growth rates and blood hemoglobin concentrations, compensated for their handicap in physiological traits related to swimming by spending more time in the water. This work offers new insights to understand the contrasting effects of parasites on aquatic organisms, and the compensatory mechanisms employed by infected animals to avoid the worst consequences of parasitism.

Diet and macronutrient niche of Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) in two regions of Nepal during summer and autumn	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Asiatic black bear; diet; macronutrients; niche breadth; nutritional ecology; Ursus thibetanus	DHORPATAN HUNTING RESERVE; NUTRITIONAL ECOLOGY; CONSERVATION; NUTRIENTS; CONFLICT; PATTERNS	Relatively little is known about the nutritional ecology of omnivorous Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) in Nepal. We characterized the diet of black bears in two seasons (June-July, "summer"; and October-November "autumn") and two study areas (Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve [DHR]; and Kailash Sacred Landscape [KSL]). We then conducted nutritional analysis of species consumed by black bears in each study area, in combination with nutritional estimates from the literature, to estimate the proportions of macronutrients (i.e., protein [P], lipid [L], and carbohydrate [C]) in the seasonal bear foods and diets, as well as their macronutrient niche breadth. We found that bamboo (Arundinaria spp.) had the highest relative frequency in both study areas and seasons. Ants and termites were found in DHR diets, but not KSL diets. One anthropogenic crop was found in DHR summer diets (Zea mays) and two were found in KSL summer diets (Z. mays; and Kodo millet [Paspalum scrobiculatum]). Other than insects, no animal prey was found in either diet. The proportions of macronutrients in diets (i.e., realized macronutrient niches) were relatively high in carbohydrate for both study areas and seasons: DHRsummer 24.1P:8.7L:67.2C; KSLsummer 16.7P:8.2L:75.1C; DHRautumn 21.1P:10.5L:68.4C; KSHautumn 19.0P:11.0L:70.0C. Macronutrient niche breadth was 3.1 x greater in the DHR than KSL during summer, and 4.0 x greater in the autumn, primarily due to the higher proportion of lipid in ants and termites relative to plant foods. Within-study area differences in niche breadth were greater during summer than autumn; in the KSH the macronutrient breadth was 1.4 x greater in summer, while in the DHR it was 1.1 x greater in summer. Similarity in dietary macronutrient proportions despite differences in foods consumed and niche breadth are suggestive of foraging to reach a preferred macronutrient balance.

Most of the materials were collected in Italy and France. High-resolution melting curves were compared each other computing their Euclidean distances and estimating the differences within their principal component as a measure of genetic diversity. Mantel correlation results combined to linear discriminant analysis allowed examined populations to be divided in four principal groups corresponding to four geographic areas, with few interesting and discussed exceptions. As rosemary propagates by seeds coming from insect mediated pollination, steady wild populations can be expected to be in panmictic equilibrium. Gained results confirmed and extended precedent characterization of rosemary genotypes and are compatible with the distribution of other Mediterranean species, as well as with the presence of a glacial refugium in the north-east area of Sardinia previously described. As the officinal use of this aromatic shrub is spreading, characterization and conservation of wild Mediterranean germplasm is gaining strategic importance. A core collection of 100 genotypes was pointed out as suitable for a cheaper biodiversity ex situ preservation as well as for subsequent metabolic and linkage disequilibrium analyses.

The magnitude of ecotypic differentiation versus phenotypic plasticity can vary depending on the traits under study. Using reciprocal transplant-common gardens along steep elevation gradients, we evaluated patterns of ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity of several growth and defense-related traits for two coexisting but unrelated plant species, Cardamine pratensis and Plantago major. For both species, we observed ecotypic differentiation accompanied by plasticity in growth-related traits. Plants grew faster and produced more biomass when placed at low elevation. In contrast, we observed fixed ecotypic differentiation for defense and resistance traits. Generally, low-elevation ecotypes produced higher chemical defenses regardless of the growing elevation. Yet, some plasticity was observed for specific compounds, such as indole glucosinolates. The results of this study may suggest that ecotypic differentiation in defense traits is maintained by costs of chemical defense production, while plasticity in growth traits is regulated by temperature-driven growth response maximization.

Seasonal climate effects on the survival of a hibernating mammal	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						capture-mark-recapture; climate change; fitness; ground squirrel; phenology; survival	BODY-MASS; PHENOLOGY; HISTORY; PLASTICITY; REDUCTION; DURATION; ECOLOGY; BIOLOGY; TORPOR; SHIFTS	Global climate change and associated regional climate variability is impacting the phenology of many species, ultimately altering individual fitness and population dynamics. Yet, few studies have considered the effects of pertinent seasonal climate variability on phenology and fitness. Hibernators may be particularly susceptible to changes in seasonal climate since they have a relatively short active season in which to reproduce and gain enough mass to survive the following winter. To understand whether and how seasonal climate variability may be affecting hibernator fitness, we estimated survival from historical (1964-1968) and contemporary (2014-2017) mark-recapture data collected from the same population of Uinta ground squirrels (UGS, Urocitellus armatus), a hibernator endemic to the western United States. Despite a locally warming climate, the phenology of UGS did not change over time, yet season-specific climate variables were important in regulating survival rates. Specifically, older age classes experienced lower survival when winters or the following springs were warm, while juveniles benefited from warmer winter temperatures. Although metabolic costs decrease with decreasing temperature in the hibernacula, arousal costs increase with decreasing temperature. Our results suggest that this trade-off is experienced differently by immature and mature individuals. We also observed an increase in population density during that time period, suggesting resources are less limited today than they used to be. Cheatgrass is now dominating the study site and may provide a better food source to UGS than native plants did historically.

Estimating the impact of divergent mating phenology between residents and migrants on the potential for gene flow	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						assisted gene flow; assortative mating; evolutionary rescue; flowering time; hybridization; temporal reproductive isolation	FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; FLOWERING TIME; LOCAL ADAPTATION; POLLEN SIZE; HERBICIDE RESISTANCE; POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR; HYBRIDIZATION; CONSEQUENCES; SELECTION	Gene flow between populations can allow the spread of beneficial alleles and genetic diversity between populations, with importance to conservation, invasion biology, and agriculture. Levels of gene flow between populations vary not only with distance, but also with divergence in reproductive phenology. Since phenology is often locally adapted, arriving migrants may be reproductively out of synch with residents, which can depress realized gene flow. In flowering plants, the potential impact of phenological divergence on hybridization between populations can be predicted from overlap in flowering schedules-the daily count of flowers capable of pollen exchange-between a resident and migrant population. The accuracy of this prospective hybridization estimate, based on parental phenotypes, rests upon the assumptions of unbiased pollen transfer between resident and migrant active flowers. We tested the impact of phenological divergence on resident-migrant mating frequencies in experiments that mimicked a single large gene flow event. We first prospectively estimated mating frequencies two lines of Brassica rapaselected or early and late flowering. We then estimated realized mating frequencies retrospectively through progeny testing. The two estimates strongly agreed in a greenhouse experiment, where procedures ensured saturating, unbiased pollination. Under natural pollination in the field, the rate of resident-migrant mating, was lower than estimated by phenological divergence alone, although prospective and retrospective estimates were correlated. In both experiments, differences between residents and migrants in flowering schedule shape led to asymmetric hybridization. Results suggest that a prospective estimate of hybridization based on mating schedules can be a useful, although imperfect, tool for evaluating potential gene flow. They also illustrate the impact of mating phenology on the magnitude and symmetry of reproductive isolation.

The core model of the theory, the equilibrium model of island biogeography, predicts that species diversity on an island is positively related to the size of the island, but negatively related by the island's distance to the mainland. In recent years, ecologists have begun to apply this model when investigating genetic diversity, arguing that genetic and species diversity might be influenced by similar ecological processes. However, most studies have focused on oceanic islands, but knowledge on how the theory applies to islands located on the mainland (e.g., mountain islands, forest islands) is scarce. In this study, we examined how the size and degree of isolation of mountain islands would affect the genetic diversity of an alpine bird, the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta). Within our study area, we defined the largest contiguous mountain area as the mainland, while smaller mountains surrounding the mainland were defined as islands. We found that the observed heterozygosity (H-o) was significantly higher, and the inbreeding coefficient (F-is) significantly lower, on the mainland compared to islands. There was a positive significant relationship between the unbiased expected heterozygosity (H-n.b.) and island size (log km(2)), but a negative significant relationship between H-o and the cost distance to the mainland. Our results are consistent with the equilibrium model of island biogeography and show that the model is well suited for investigating genetic diversity among islands, but also on islands located on the mainland.

We studied host plants used by non-swarming R. differens for 15 months, in central Uganda. In particular, we assessed the use of host plant species with respect to host cover in the field and host parts used by R. differens, also recording their sex, developmental stages, and colour morph. Ruspolia differens were found on 19 grass and two sedge species and they were observed predominantly (99% of 20,915 observations) on seven grasses (namely, Panicum maximum, Brachiaria ruziziensis, Chloris gayana, Hyparrhenia rufa, Cynodon dactylon, Sporobolus pyramidalis, and Pennisetum purpureum). Ruspolia differens was most frequently observed on the most common grass of each study site but P. maximum, and S. pyramidalis were used more frequently than expected from their cover in the field. Furthermore, R. differens were observed predominantly on inflorescences (97% of feeding observations) and much less frequently on the leaves (3.0%), stems (0.1%), and inflorescence stalks (0.1%) of grasses and sedges. Host use was not independent of sex, developmental stage, or colour morph. Panicum maximum was the preferred host of the youngest nymphs of R. differens. Overall, our findings indicate that a continuous supply of diverse grass resources with inflorescences is necessary for the management and conservation of wild populations of R. differens.

We assessed the influences of an island area and distance from the mainland on species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic composition of snakes on coastal islands. Location Coastal islands of the megadiverse Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. Methods We compiled the species composition of 17 coastal islands in southeastern Brazil. Species richness and phylogenetic diversity were calculated for each island. Phylogenetic composition was measured using principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure. We then employed generalized linear models to test the influence of area and distance from the mainland on the diversity metrics. Results We found a prominent influence of area on species richness, whereas phylogenetic diversity was more affected by distance from the mainland. Snake clades were distinctly associated with area and distance. The Boidae family was associated with nearer and larger islands, whereas Elapidae was broadly distributed. Distance from the mainland was associated with the distribution of Dipsadidae, whereas Colubridae was influenced by both the area and distance. The Viperidae family attained higher values of phylogenetic diversity in smaller and more remote islands. Main conclusions This island system conserved a considerable piece of snake richness from southeastern Brazil, including island endemic species. Area and distance from the mainland were important drivers of snake diversity in the Atlantic Forest coastal islands. However, these predictors affected the different components of diversity in different ways. Phylogenetic composition analysis enables us to understand how basal nodes contributed to high levels of phylogenetic diversity on smaller and farther islands regardless of the decrease in species richness.

A practical tool for assessing ecosystem services enhancement and degradation associated with invasive alien species	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						alternative management; expert judgment; Great Britain; non-native; novel approach	IMPACT CLASSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; SCIENCE; THREAT; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; DRIVERS; PLANTS	Current approaches for assessing the effects of invasive alien species (IAS) are biased toward the negative effects of these species, resulting in an incomplete picture of their real effects. This can result in an inefficient IAS management. We address this issue by describing the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) that enables expert elicitation for rapidly assessing the ecological consequences of IAS using the ecosystem services (ES) framework. INSEAT scores the ecosystem service "gains and losses" using a scale that accounted for the magnitude and the reversibility of its effects. We tested INSEAT on 18 IAS in Great Britain. Here, we highlighted four case studies: Harmonia axyridis (Harlequin ladybird), Astacus leptodactylus (Turkish crayfish), Pacifastacus leniusculus (Signal crayfish) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam). The results demonstrated that a collation of different experts' opinions using INSEAT could yield valuable information on the invasive aliens' ecological and social effects.

Availability of food resources and habitat structure shape the individual-resource network of a Neotropical marsupial	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Cerrado; modularity; nestedness; population; seasonality	INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; INSECT ABUNDANCE; GALLERY FOREST; SMALL MAMMALS; NESTEDNESS; MODULARITY; PATTERNS; NICHE; WEBS	Spatial and temporal variation in networks has been reported in different studies. However, the many effects of habitat structure and food resource availability variation on network structures have remained poorly investigated, especially in individual-based networks. This approach can shed light on individual specialization of resource use and how habitat variations shape trophic interactions. To test hypotheses related to habitat variability on trophic interactions, we investigated seasonal and spatial variation in network structure of four populations of the marsupial Gracilinanus agilis in the highly seasonal tropical savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado. We evaluated such variation with network nestedness and modularity considering both cool-dry and warm-wet seasons, and related such variations with food resource availability and habitat structure (considered in the present study as environmental variation) in four sites of savanna woodland forest. Network analyses showed that modularity (but not nestedness) was consistently lower during the cool-dry season in all G. agilis populations. Our results indicated that nestedness is related to habitat structure, showing that this metric increases in sites with thick and spaced trees. On the other hand, modularity was positively related to diversity of arthropods and abundance of fruits. We propose that the relationship between nestedness and habitat structure is an outcome of individual variation in the vertical space and food resource use by G. agilis in sites with thick and spaced trees. Moreover, individual specialization in resource-rich and population-dense periods possibly increased the network modularity of G. agilis. Therefore, our study reveals that environment variability considering spatial and temporal components is important for shaping network structure of populations.

Spatiotemporal variability in the structure of seagrass meadows and associated macrofaunal assemblages in southwest England (UK): Using citizen science to benchmark ecological pattern	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						coastal biodiversity; foundation species; monitoring; Seagrass beds; Zostera marina	SPATIAL VARIATION; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; ZOSTERA-CAPRICORNI; FISH; BEDS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; DENSITY; INVERTEBRATES; IMPACTS	Seagrass meadows underpin a variety of ecosystem services and are recognized as globally important habitats and a conservation priority. However, seagrass populations are currently impacted by a range of biotic and abiotic stressors, and many are in decline globally. As such, improved understanding of seagrass populations and their associated faunal assemblages is needed to better detect and predict changes in the structure and functioning of these key habitats. Here, we analyzed a large dataset-collected by recreational scuba divers volunteering on a citizen science project-to examine spatiotemporal patterns in ecological structure and to provide a robust and reliable baseline against which to detect future change. Seagrass (Zostera marina) shoot density and the abundance of associated faunal groups were quantified across 2 years at 19 sites nested within three locations in southwest UK, by collecting in situ quadrat samples (2,518 in total) during 328 dives. Seagrass shoot density and meadow fragmentation was comparable across locations but was highly variable among sites. Faunal abundance and assemblage structure varied between areas with or without seagrass shoots; this pattern was largely consistent between locations and years. Overall, increased seagrass density was related to increased faunal abundance and explained shifts in faunal assemblage structure, although individual faunal groups were affected differently. More broadly, our study shows that well-funded and orchestrated citizen science projects can, to some extent, gather fundamental information needed to benchmark ecological structure in poorly studied nearshore marine habitats.

Temperate grasslands, managed at low intensities over centuries harbored a high species diversity, which is increasingly threatened by the management intensification over the last decades. This includes key taxa like ants. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to a decrease in ant abundance and species richness as well as changes in functional community composition are not well understood. We sampled ants on 110 grassland plots in three regions in Germany. The sampled grasslands are used as meadows or pastures, being mown, grazed or fertilized at different intensities. We analyzed the effect of the different aspects of land use on ant species richness, functional trait spaces, and community composition by using a multimodel inference approach and structural equation models. Overall, we found 31 ant species belonging to 8 genera, mostly open habitat specialists. Ant species richness, functional trait space of communities, and abundance of nests decreased with increasing land-use intensity. The land-use practice most harmful to ants was mowing, followed by heavy grazing by cattle. Fertilization did not strongly affect ant species richness. Grazing by sheep increased the ant species richness. The effect of mowing differed between species and was strongly negative for Formica species while Myrmica and common Lasius species were less affected. Rare species occurred mainly in plots managed at low intensity. Our results show that mowing less often or later in the season would retain a higher ant species richness-similarly to most other grassland taxa. The transformation from (sheep) pastures to intensively managed meadows and especially mowing directly affects ants via the destruction of nests and indirectly via loss of grassland heterogeneity (reduced plant species richness) and increased soil moisture by shading of fast-growing plant species.

Tadpole assemblages offer an excellent system to understand the relative influence of intraspecific and interspecific variability on community assembly, due to their high phenotypic plasticity, and the strong influence that environmental variables have on their spatial distribution and individual performance. Here, we quantified the intraspecific and interspecific components of tadpoles' trait variability in order to investigate their relative role in shaping tadpole communities. We selected eight functional traits related to microhabitat use, foraging strategies, and swimming ability. We measured these traits on 678 individuals from 22 species captured in 43 ponds in the Atlantic Forest. We used single- and multitrait analyses to decompose trait variability. To explore the action of external and internal filtering on community assembly, we used a variance decomposition approach that compares phenotypic variability at the individual, population, community and regional levels. On average, 33% of trait variability was due to within-species variation. This decomposition varied widely among traits. We found only a reduced effect of external filtering (low variation in the height of the ventral fin within ponds in comparison to the total variation), whereas the internal filtering was stronger than expected. Traits related to the use of different microhabitats through the water column were generally less variable than traits related to swimming ability to escape of predators, with tail traits being highly variable within species. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating both intraspecific and interspecific, trait differences and of focusing on a diversity of traits related to both stabilizing niche and fitness differences in order to better understand how trait variation relates to species coexistence.

The impacts on alpine plant species may be particularly profound due to a potential lack of availability of future suitable habitat. To identify how alpine species have responded to climate change during the past century as well as to predict how they may react to possible global climate change scenarios in the future, we investigate the climatic responses of seven species of Meconopsis, a representative genus endemic in the alpine meadow and subnival region of the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains. We analyzed past elevational shifts, as well as projected shifts in longitude, latitude, elevation, and range size using historical specimen records and species distribution modeling under optimistic (RCP 4.5) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) scenarios across three general circulation models for 2070. Our results indicate that across all seven species, there has been an upward shift in mean elevation of 302.3 m between the pre-1970s (1922-1969) and the post-1970s (1970-2016). The model predictions suggest that the future suitable climate space will continue to shift upwards in elevation (as well as northwards and westwards) by 2070. While for most of the analyzed species, the area of suitable climate space is predicted to expand under the optimistic emission scenario, the area contracts, or, at best, shows little change under the pessimistic scenario. Species such as M. punicea, which already occupy high latitudes, are consistently predicted to experience a contraction of suitable climate space across all the models by 2070 and may consequently deserve particular attention by conservation strategies. Collectively, our results suggest that the alpine high-latitude species analyzed here have already been significantly impacted by climate change and that these trends may continue over the coming decades.

Experimental removals reveal dietary niche partitioning facilitates coexistence between native and introduced species	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						coexistence; diet; introduced species; niche; wildlife	ISOTOPE MIXING MODELS; RED SQUIRRELS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; SCIURUS-ABERTI; GREY SQUIRRELS; MIXED-CONIFER; POPULATION; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; ORGANIZATION	Niche overlap between native species and ecologically similar invaders can lead to competitive exclusion of threatened native species, but if two such species also co-occur naturally elsewhere, interactions between native and introduced populations may mirror coevolved niche partitioning that reduces competition and promotes coexistence. A single, insular population of Fremont's squirrel (Tamiasciurus fremonti) the Mount Graham red squirrel (MGRS; T. f. grahamensis) in the Pinaleno Mountains, Arizona, USA, is critically endangered and resource competition with introduced Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti) may threaten its long-term persistence. The species are naturally synoptic in other mountain sites, and both consume diets comprised primarily of conifer seeds and fungi. We conducted experimental removals of introduced Abert's squirrels and used stable isotope analysis of diets before and after removals, and of diets in naturally syntopic populations to test the hypothesis that dietary niche partitioning can facilitate coexistence between native and introduced species. We also developed a novel approach to determine the influence of fluctuating food availability on carbon enrichment in consumers. Mount Graham red squirrels and introduced Abert's squirrels partitioned the dietary niche similarly to naturally syntopic populations. Removals had no apparent effect. Diet of MGRS was more closely linked to availability of resources than to presence of Abert's squirrels. Flexible dietary niche of introduced Abert's squirrels may have allowed them to exploit a resource opportunity in syntopy with MGRS. Variable food production of MGRS habitat may intensify competition in poor years, and territorial defense against non-native Abert's squirrels likely imposes fitness costs on individual MGRS. Similarity in our model species' diets may make MGRS more vulnerable to competition if climate change eliminates the advantages of larder-hoarding. Where introduced populations of ecologically similar species are better adapted to changing conditions, they may ultimately replace southern peripheral populations of native species.

Vineyards may be inhabited by plant and animal species, especially when the inter-row space is vegetated with spontaneous vegetation or cover crops. Wild bees depend on floral resources and suitable nesting sites which may be found in vineyard inter-rows or in viticultural landscapes. Inter-row vegetation is managed by mulching, tillage, and/or herbicide application and results in habitat degradation when applied intensively. Here, we hypothesize that lower vegetation management intensities, higher floral resources, and landscape diversity affect wild bee diversity and abundance dependent on their functional traits. We sampled wild bees semi-quantitatively in 63 vineyards representing different vegetation management intensities across Europe in 2016. A proxy for floral resource availability was based on visual flower cover estimations. Management intensity was assessed by vegetation cover (%) twice a year per vineyard. The Shannon Landscape Diversity Index was used as a proxy for landscape diversity within a 750 m radius around each vineyard center point. Wild bee communities were clustered by country. At the country level, between 20 and 64 wild bee species were identified. Increased floral resource availability and extensive vegetation management both affected wild bee diversity and abundance in vineyards strongly positively. Increased landscape diversity had a small positive effect on wild bee diversity but compensated for the negative effect of low floral resource availability by increasing eusocial bee abundance. We conclude that wild bee diversity and abundance in vineyards is efficiently promoted by increasing floral resources and reducing vegetation management frequency. High landscape diversity further compensates for low floral resources in vineyards and increases pollinating insect abundance in viticulture landscapes.

Estimating the energy expenditure of free-ranging polar bears using tri-axial accelerometers: A validation with doubly labeled water	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						dynamic body acceleration; energetics; field metabolic rate; oxygen consumption; polar bear; Ursus maritimus	FIELD METABOLIC-RATES; HEART-RATE; BODY ACCELERATION; DYNAMIC ACTION; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; URSUS-MARITIMUS; ENERGETICS; COST; MOVEMENT; ANIMALS	Measures of energy expenditure can be used to inform animal conservation and management, but methods for measuring the energy expenditure of free-ranging animals have a variety of limitations. Advancements in biologging technologies have enabled the use of dynamic body acceleration derived from accelerometers as a proxy for energy expenditure. Although dynamic body acceleration has been shown to strongly correlate with oxygen consumption in captive animals, it has been validated in only a few studies on free-ranging animals. Here, we use relationships between oxygen consumption and overall dynamic body acceleration in resting and walking polar bears Ursus maritimus and published values for the costs of swimming in polar bears to estimate the total energy expenditure of 6 free-ranging polar bears that were primarily using the sea ice of the Beaufort Sea. Energetic models based on accelerometry were compared to models of energy expenditure on the same individuals derived from doubly labeled water methods. Accelerometer-based estimates of energy expenditure on average predicted total energy expenditure to be 30% less than estimates derived from doubly labeled water. Nevertheless, accelerometer-based measures of energy expenditure strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.70) with measures derived from doubly labeled water. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations in dynamic body acceleration as a measure of total energy expenditure while also further supporting its use as a proxy for instantaneous, detailed energy expenditure in free-ranging animals.

Spatial variation in anuran richness, diversity, and abundance across montane wetland habitat in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						community composition; elevational gradient; frogs; species-area relationship; wetland desiccation	AMPHIBIAN POPULATION DECLINES; SPECIES-RICHNESS; ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT; CLIMATIC-CHANGE; AREA; FROGS; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS; DEGRADATION	The spatial distribution of species has long sparked interest among ecologists and biogeographers, increasingly so in studies of species responses to climate change. However, field studies on spatial patterns of distribution, useful to inform conservation actions at local scales, are still lacking for many regions, especially the tropics. We studied elevational trends and species-area relationships among anurans in wetland habitats within Volcanoes National Park (VNP) in Rwanda, part of the biodiverse Albertine Rift region. In VNP, wetlands are key sites for anuran reproduction, and anurans are likely threatened by wetland desiccation which has occurred for the last few decades. Between 2012 and 2017, we sampled anuran communities in ten VNP wetlands located along an elevational gradient of c. 600 m (from 2,546 to 3,188 m a.s.l.) and found at least eight species, including at least two Albertine Rift Endemics. We show that species richness, diversity, and abundance likely decline with a decrease in wetland size and with an increase in elevation, though additional sampling (e.g., at night) might be needed to derive definite conclusions. Larger wetlands at lower elevations contained most species and individuals, which indicates the potential threat of wetland size reduction (through desiccation) for anuran conservation. However, we also found that wetlands differed in species composition and that some species (e.g., Sclerophrys kisoloensis) were likely restricted in distribution to only a few of the smaller wetlands-suggesting that the conservation of each individual wetland should be prioritized, regardless of size. We propose that all wetlands in VNP require additional conservation measures, which should be based on knowledge gathered through long-term monitoring of anuran communities and research on drivers of wetland decline. Only such extended research will allow us to understand the response of anurans in VNP to threats such as climate change and wetland desiccation.

Decline in abundance and apparent survival rates of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						abundance; capture heterogeneity; capture-recapture; fin whale; site fidelity; survival rate; terminal bias	CAPTURE-RECAPTURE DATA; DOLPHINS TURSIOPS SP.; TEMPORARY EMIGRATION; ATLANTIC; CONSERVATION; TRENDS; SIZE; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; CETACEANS	Estimates of abundance and survivorship provide quantifiable measures to monitor populations and to define and understand their conservation status. This study investigated changes in abundance and survival rates of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence in the context of anthropogenic pressures and changing environmental conditions. A long-term data set, consisting of 35 years of photo-identification surveys and comprising more than 5,000 identifications of 507 individuals, formed the basis of this mark-recapture study. Based on model selection using corrected Akaike Information Criterion, the most parsimonious Cormack-Jolly-Seber model included a linear temporal trend in noncalf apparent survival rates with a sharp decline in the last 5 years of the study and a median survival rate of 0.946 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.910-0.967). To account for capture heterogeneity due to divergent patterns of site fidelity, agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to categorize individuals based on their annual and survey site fidelity indices. However, the negative trend in survivorship remained and was corroborated by a significant decline in the estimated super-population size from 335 (95% CI 321-348) individuals in 2004-2010 to 291 (95% CI 270-312) individuals in 2010-2016. Concurrently, a negative trend was estimated in recruitment to the population, supported by a sharp decrease in the number of observed calves. Ship strikes and changes in prey availability are potential drivers of the observed decline in fin whale abundance. The combination of clustering methods with mark-recapture represents a flexible way to investigate the effects of site fidelity on demographic variables and is broadly applicable to other individual-based studies.

Genome streamlining via complete loss of introns has occurred multiple times in lichenized fungal mitochondria	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						genome reduction; homing endonucleases; introns; lichen; parasitic genetic elements; symbiosis	GROUP-I; SPLICEOSOMAL INTRONS; HOMING ENDONUCLEASES; EVOLUTION; GENE; DNA; ELEMENTS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; RNA	Reductions in genome size and complexity are a hallmark of obligate symbioses. The mitochondrial genome displays clear examples of these reductions, with the ancestral alpha-proteobacterial genome size and gene number having been reduced by orders of magnitude in most descendent modern mitochondrial genomes. Here, we examine patterns of mitochondrial evolution specifically looking at intron size, number, and position across 58 species from 21 genera of lichenized Ascomycete fungi, representing a broad range of fungal diversity and niches. Our results show that the cox1gene always contained the highest number of introns out of all the mitochondrial protein-coding genes, that high intron sequence similarity (>90%) can be maintained between different genera, and that lichens have undergone at least two instances of complete, genome-wide intron loss consistent with evidence for genome streamlining via loss of parasitic, noncoding DNA, in Phlyctis boliviensisand Graphis lineola. Notably, however, lichenized fungi have not only undergone intron loss but in some instances have expanded considerably in size due to intron proliferation (e.g., Alectoria fallacina and Parmotrema neotropicum), even between closely related sister species (e.g., Cladonia). These results shed light on the highly dynamic mitochondrial evolution that is occurring in lichens and suggest that these obligate symbiotic organisms are in some cases undergoing recent, broad-scale genome streamlining via loss of protein-coding genes as well as noncoding, parasitic DNA elements.

A long-term monitored semi-natural forest site subject to intense combined storm and bark beetle damage beginning in 2005 provided an opportunity to investigate the postdisturbance development of the vegetation community. Previous studies suggest that a shift from Picea abies to Fagus sylvatica domination was possible. We analyzed pre- and postdisturbance vegetation data to investigate to what extent vascular plant species abundances, diversity, traits, and community composition have changed. We were particularly interested in differences between remaining apparently unaffected areas (potential refugia) and disturbed areas, and in signs of consistent change over time in community composition in response to disturbance that could indicate an impending regime shift. We found that the vegetation community present in the refuge areas has remained substantially intact through the period of disturbance. Nonrefuge areas diverged from the refuges in community composition and showed increased taxonomic and functional diversity. Despite this, and an increase in deciduous tree species (particularly F. sylvatica), P. abies has shown strong postdisturbance regeneration. The refuges may be important in the apparent ongoing recovery of the disturbed areas to a P. abies-dominated state similar to that found predisturbance. This fast recovery is interpreted as evidence of a system resilient to a potential shift to a deciduous-dominated state. Synthesis: Our results show that even powerful combined disturbances in a system with multiple stable states can be insufficient to initiate a regime shift. Resilience of the P. abies-dominated forest community is increased by the survival of refuge areas functioning as a form of ecological memory of the previous ecosystem state. The results also demonstrate the value of data generated by long-term monitoring programs.

While researchers have examined the impact of stream burial on groundwater budgets, field studies examining the influence of urbanization on groundwater dynamics are relatively scarce. This study analyzes tidal patterns in water-level data from shallow groundwater monitoring wells located next to a legacy sewer line within the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The coupling of historic records, sewer network maps, and well bore hydrogeology explains spatial patterns in groundwater elevations. Furthermore, a synthesis of early twentieth century United States census data, and continental scale GIS data demonstrates the potential for groundwater inundation in coastal United States cities that are served by aging sewer infrastructure. Altered groundwater flow dynamics caused by sea level rise, coupled with climatic shifts will likely stress aging sewer infrastructure, and can lead to increased discharge of combined sewer overflow systems and flooding.

Shifts in the Skin-Associated Microbiota of Hatchery-Reared Common Snook Centropomus undecimalis During Acclimation to the Wild	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Common snook; Centropomus undecimalis; Microbiota; Stock enhancement; Immunity	RNA GENE DATABASE; EDWARDSIELLA-TARDA; OXIDATIVE STRESS; GUT MICROBIOTA; SP NOV.; BACTERIA; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; INFECTION; COMMUNITY	The skin-associated microbiota of fish competes against pathogens for space and nutrients, preventing colonization by harmful bacteria encountered during environmental transitions such as those faced during stock enhancement. Thus, alterations in bacterial community structure during release of cultured fish have important implications for health of these individuals. This study investigated microbiota structure during acclimation of juvenile hatchery-reared common snook Centropomus undecimalis to the wild by comparing skin-associated microflora among snook in captivity, after 48 h of acclimation at release sites, and from the wild. After two days of acclimation, the microbiota of hatchery-reared snook mirrored that observed on wild snook. Relative abundances of potential pathogens were higher in captive fish, whereas acclimated and wild fish harbored bacterial taxa influenced by geographical factors and water quality at release sites. Predicted microbiota function of acclimated and wild fish showed higher production of protective amino acids and antimicrobials, identifying a mechanism for microbial supplementation of the immune defense of these fish. The two-day transition to wild-type microbiota suggests a temporal scale of hours associated with bacterial succession indicating that the microbiota, whose structure is vital to fish health, aids in acclimation of fish to new environments during stock enhancement efforts.

Intra-household agreement of urinary elemental concentrations in Tanzania and Kenya: potential surrogates in case-control studies	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Micronutrients; Trace elements; Urine; Cancer epidemiology	BIOMONITORING EQUIVALENTS; ARSENIC EXPOSURE; SELENIUM STATUS; DIETARY-INTAKE; CANCER; ESOPHAGEAL; RISK; RESPONDENTS; DEFICIENCY; SUPPLIES	Element deficiencies and excesses play important roles in non-communicable disease aetiology. When investigating their roles in epidemiologic studies without prospective designs, reverse-causality limits the utility of transient biomarkers in cases. This study aimed to investigate whether surrogate participants may provide viable proxies by assessing concentration correlations within households. We obtained spot urine samples from 245 Tanzanian and Kenyan adults (including 101 household pairs) to investigate intra-household correlations of urinary elements (As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cs, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, S, Se, Sr, Tl, V and Zn) and concentrations (also available for: Bi, Ce, Sb, Sn and U) relative to external population-levels and health-based values. Moderate-strong correlations were observed for As (r = 0.65), Cs (r = 0.67), Li (r = 0.56), Mo (r = 0.57), Se (r = 0.68) and Tl (r = 0.67). Remaining correlations were <0.41. Median Se concentrations in Tanzania (29 mu g/L) and Kenya (24 mu g/L) were low relative to 5738 Canadians (59 mu g/L). Exceedances (of reference 95th percentiles) were observed for: Co, Mn, Mo, Ni and U. Compared to health-based values, exceedances were present for As, Co, Mo and Se but deficiencies were also present for Mo and Se. For well correlated elements, household members in East African settings provide feasible surrogate cases to investigate element deficiencies/excesses in relation to non-communicable diseases.

In this perspective, our previous studies revealed deleterious effects of the juvenoid fenoxycarb at 5 mu g L-1 on the embryogenesis and at 50 mu g L-1 on the reproductive behavior of the amphipod Gammarus fossarum. In the present study, to determine whether data generated with one amphipod species can be extended to other gammarid species, we tested the effects of a 5 mu g L-1 fenoxycarb exposure on three European amphipod species: G. fossarum, Gammarus roeseli, and Echinogammarus longisetosus. We exposed individually 60 freshly fertilized females to fenoxycarb throughout the entire oogenesis/embryogenesis cycle (i.e., 19 days). In newborn individuals from exposed embryos, we measured both pigmentation and lipid reserve impairments while in exposed females, we observed reproductive behavior. At 5 mu g L-1 fenoxycarb, reproductive behavior was only altered in G. fossarum. This study demonstrates the variability of the toxic response among the three gammaridae species, underlining the need for acquiring data with a broad phylogenetic representation to better predict toxic effects on freshwater ecosystems.

This study was conducted in 13 villages in central Nepal at different altitudes to document the views of small holder farmers and compare their perception with trends of climatic variables, finger millet yield, natural disasters, plant phenology (flowering and fruiting), status of forest and wild life, as well as the spread of diseases and pests. Analysis on the climatic data of stations for 36-41 years between 1975 and 2016 showed significant increases in the minimum temperature in lower tropical climatic region (<500 m), upper tropical to subtropical climatic region (500-2000 m) and temperate climatic region (2000-3000 m) by 0.01, 0.026 and 0.054 degrees C/year, respectively, and an increase of maximum temperature by 0.008, 0.018, and 0.019 degrees C/year, respectively. Rainfall showed a strongly significant decreasing trend in all elevation regions. This result matches with the views of respondents except 38% respondent from temperate climatic region. People from the temperate climatic region also mentioned that current onset of snowfall is delayed but amount of snowfall remained the same. From the documented records, except events of wild fire, frequency of natural disasters events have increased in the recent years, which was in harmony with the views of local people. Multi-linear regression analysis showed that contribution of climatic variables on finger millet yield in lower tropical climatic region and upper tropical to subtropical regions was 23% and 57.3%, respectively, which was supported by increasing trend on average growing degree day (GDD) temperature at the rate of 0.01 degrees C in upper tropical to subtropical region and 0.007 degrees C in lower tropical climatic region yearly. Finger millet yield has been increasing at the rate of 7.39 and 36.9 kg/ha yearly in lower tropical climatic region and upper tropical to subtropical climatic region, respectively. This result provides deeper understanding of people's perception of causes and effects of climate change on diverse variables along different elevation and related magnitude which can contribute to policy making in Nepal.

There are few comprehensive, species-specific, community-level observations of parasitoid-flower interactions. Observing flower visitation by parasitoid species is challenging because most parasitoids are small and visit flowers infrequently. Further, the extreme diversity of parasitoids poses challenges for identification, and only a few experts can identify parasitoids to species. To explore the potential for a flower-visitor network approach to improve our understanding of parasitoid foraging ecology, we utilized published and publicly available flower-visitor datasets from the Interaction Web Database. Parasitoid species were present in almost half of the flower-visitor datasets in the Interaction Web Database but constituted a very small proportion of all flower visiting species. We analyzed the only parasitoid-flower subnetwork that was both speciose and documented heterogeneity in the number of flowering plant species visited by parasitoids. On average, parasitoids were more generalized in flower visitation than predicted under null expectations, given their prevalence in the network. Further, many individual flower and parasitoid species might be more generalized than they appeared as evidenced by a specialization metric less biased by sampling effects. These plant and parasitoid species might therefore be more useful for conservation biological control efforts than initially expected. Finally, the nested structure of the network indicates the potential for a subset of the flower community to support generalized, and any potential specialized, parasitoid nectar foragers in the field.

Trade-offs between defenses against herbivores in goldenrod (Solidago altissima)	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Allelochemical; Aphid; Ducking; Goldenrod; Plant defense; Terpenoids	TALL GOLDENROD; PLANT-RESISTANCE; DUCKING; COSTS; VOLATILES; JASMONATE; TERPENES; GROWTH	In the goldenrod Solidago altissima, most stems are erect, but "ducking" genotypes bend the tip of the apical stem downward for much of the growing season, and this morphology protects against at least two gall-forming herbivore species. Despite this advantage to defense, ducking remains a rare strategy in goldenrod, yet the costs that prevent ducking genotypes from outcompeting erect genotypes remain unclear. We tested whether ducking (an architectural defense) trades off with chemical defense against aphids (Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum). We hypothesized that signaling related to the ducking defense might interfere with investment in chemical defenses, making ducking plants more susceptible to some herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we compared aphid survival and preference on ducking and erect genotypes. We also measured terpenoid concentration in S. altissima leaf tissue to determine whether plant investment in these compounds correlated with either ducking or aphid performance. Aphids had higher survival on all three ducking genotypes than their erect counterparts and preferred ducking to erect plants in two of three genotype pairings. However, terpenoid concentrations did not track with either ducking or aphid performance and cannot therefore explain the differences between ducking and erect host-plants. Although the mechanism remains unknown, the data supported the predicted trade-off in defenses against different herbivores, which may contribute to the distribution and abundance of these two defensive strategies.

Rapid evolution of testis size relative to sperm morphology suggests that post-copulatory selection targets sperm number in Anolis lizards	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						comparative method; midpiece; rate of evolution; sexual selection; sperm competition	SEXUAL SELECTION; EJACULATE QUALITY; EVOLVE FASTER; COMPETITION; TRAITS; COEVOLUTION; STORAGE; PATTERNS; MIDPIECE; RATES	Post-copulatory sexual selection is thought to be responsible for much of the extraordinary diversity in sperm morphology across metazoans. However, the extent to which post-copulatory selection targets sperm morphology versus sperm production is generally unknown. To address this issue, we simultaneously characterized the evolution of sperm morphology (length of the sperm head, midpiece and flagellum) and testis size (a proxy for sperm production) across 26 species of Anolis lizards, a group in which sperm competition is likely. We found that the length of the sperm midpiece has evolved 2-3 times faster than that of the sperm head or flagellum, suggesting that midpiece size may be the most important aspect of sperm morphology with respect to post-copulatory sexual selection. However, testis size has evolved faster than any aspect of sperm morphology or body size, supporting the hypothesis that post-copulatory sexual selection acts more strongly upon sperm production than upon sperm morphology. Likewise, evolutionary increases in testis size, which typically indicate increased sperm competition, are not associated with predictable changes in sperm morphology, suggesting that any effects of post-copulatory selection on sperm morphology are either weak or variable in direction across anoles. Collectively, our results suggest that sperm production is the primary target of post-copulatory sexual selection in this lineage.

Losing the trait without losing the signal: Evolutionary shifts in communicative colour signalling	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						colouration; phylogenetic comparative methods; Sceloporus lizard; sexual selection; signal evolution; visual communication	SEXUALLY SELECTED TRAITS; VISUAL SIGNAL; NUPTIAL COLOR; FENCE LIZARD; FEMALE; SELECTION; VISION; GASTEROSTEUS; SENSITIVITY; DIVERGENCE	Colour signalling traits are often lost over evolutionary time, perhaps because they increase vulnerability to visual predators or lose relevance in terms of sexual selection. Here, we used spectrometric and phylogenetic comparative analyses to ask whether four independent losses of a sexually selected blue patch are spectrally similar, and whether these losses equate to a decrease in conspicuousness or to loss of a signal. We found that patches were lost in two distinct ways: either increasing reflectance primarily at very long or at very short wavelengths, and that species with additional colour elements (UV, green and pink) may be evolutionary intermediates. In addition, we found that patch spectral profiles of all species were closely aligned with visual receptors in the receiver's retina. We found that loss of the blue patch makes males less conspicuous in terms of chromatic conspicuousness, but more conspicuous in terms of achromatic contrast, and that sexual dimorphism often persists regardless of patch loss. Dorsal surfaces were considerably more cryptic than were ventral surfaces, and species in which male bellies were the most similar in conspicuousness to their dorsal surfaces were also the most sexually dimorphic. These results emphasize the consistent importance of sexual selection and its flexible impact on different signal components through evolutionary time.

During interaction with conspecifics, the interaction partner becomes a part of the environment from the perspective of the focal individual. If the interaction effects have a genetic basis, they are called indirect genetic effects (IGEs) and can evolve along with direct genetic effects. Sexual reproduction is a classic context where potential conflict between males and females can arise from trade-offs between current and future investments. We studied five female fecundity traits, egg length and number, egg pod length and number and latency to first egg pod, and estimated the direct and IGEs using a half-sib breeding design in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus. We found that the male IGEs were an order of magnitude lower than the direct genetic effects and were not significantly different from zero. However, there was some indication that IGEs were larger shortly after mating, consistent with the idea that IGEs fade with time after interaction. Female direct heritabilities were moderate to low. Simulation shows that the variance component estimates can appear larger with less data, calling for care when interpreting variance components estimated with low power. Our results illustrate that the contribution of male IGEs is overall low on the phenotypic variance of female fecundity traits. Thus, even in the relevant context of sexual conflict, the influence of male IGEs on the evolutionary trajectory of female reproductive traits is likely to be small.

Co-inheritance of sea age at maturity and iteroparity in the Atlantic salmon vgll3 genomic region	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Atlantic salmon; co-inheritance; iteroparity; life-history evolution; sea age at first maturity	LIFE-HISTORY; GENETIC CORRELATIONS; WILD POPULATION; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; MIRAMICHI RIVER; NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CLUTCH SIZE; SELECTION; PLEIOTROPY	Co-inheritance in life-history traits may result in unpredictable evolutionary trajectories if not accounted for in life-history models. Iteroparity (the reproductive strategy of reproducing more than once) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a fitness trait with substantial variation within and among populations. In the Teno River in northern Europe, iteroparous individuals constitute an important component of many populations and have experienced a sharp increase in abundance in the last 20 years, partly overlapping with a general decrease in age structure. The physiological basis of iteroparity bears similarities to that of age at first maturity, another life-history trait with substantial fitness effects in salmon. Sea age at maturity in Atlantic salmon is controlled by a major locus around the vgll3 gene, and we used this opportunity demonstrate that these two traits are co-inherited around this genome region. The odds ratio of survival until second reproduction was up to 2.4 (1.8-3.5 90% CI) times higher for fish with the early-maturing vgll3 genotype (EE) compared to fish with the late-maturing genotype (LL). The L allele was dominant in individuals remaining only one year at sea before maturation, but the dominance was reversed, with the E allele being dominant in individuals maturing after two or more years at sea. Post hoc analysis indicated that iteroparous fish with the EE genotype had accelerated growth prior to first reproduction compared to first-time spawners, across all age groups, whereas this effect was not detected in fish with the LL genotype. These results broaden the functional link around the vgll3 genome region and help us understand constraints in the evolution of life-history variation in salmon. Our results further highlight the need to account for genetic correlations between fitness traits when predicting demographic changes in changing environments.

The life history of the invasive mullet, Osteomugil engeli (Bleeker, 1858) in Hawaiian estuaries	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Mullet; Invasive species; Life history; Estuaries	FISH; SURMULETUS; PLASTICITY; DEMOGRAPHY; MATURITY; BIOLOGY; TRAITS; LENGTH; SIZES	Although mullets (Mugilids) are important estuarine fishes across the world, the biology of many species of mullet have yet to be determined. This is of concern for mullets that are introduced species with unknown impacts on native ecosystems. Here we assess the life history of Osteomugil engeli, an introduced species in Hawai'i. Two populations (Hilo Bay estuary, Hawai'i Island and Maunalua Bay estuary, Oahu) were compared to determine population demographics, spawning season, and size and age at maturity. There were no differences observed between life history metrics between populations sampled. O. engeli had year round spawning with recruits and adults co-occurring in similar habitats throughout the year. There was no difference in size (L-50) and age (A(50)) at sexual maturity for females and males (L-50: (2)=0.39, p value =0.53; A(50): (2)=0.29, p value=0.59), with O. engeli reaching sexual maturity at 140.1mm (CI: 139.5-141.6mm) and 208days (CI: 204.2-220.9days). We observed a 4:1 female to male sex ratio and females were found to be on average 23mm larger than males (t=7.19, p value<0.01). O. engeli life history is compared to native species in Hawai'i and among other Mugilids that have been introduced elsewhere. Life history comparisons suggest that introduced mullet populations are better able to respond and adapt to changing habitat and environmental conditions than the native mullet.

They coexist in assemblages of up to five species in pools with variable connection to permanent water bodies and complete their entire life cycle within 1year, terminated by summer desiccation of their habitat. To quantify community and population characteristics of Austrolebias assemblages, we sampled a set of 18 pools in the lowlands of the confluence of Rio Negro and Rio Uruguay in western Uruguay, with 16 sampling trips conducted over the entire seasonal cycle in 2015. Austrolebias bellottii was a ubiquitous and generalist species, A. nigripinnis was more common in pools influenced by active floodplain, A. elongatus (a large predatory species) was rare overall, and four A. alexandri was found only in two pools. Unexpectedly, many pools desiccated in winter (mid season) and some of them supported a second cohort after their re-inundation. Fish abundance and fish density declined steadily prior to pool desiccations. There were indications that adult A. bellottii can survive a short period of habitat desiccation in wet mud, leading to coexistence of an older A. bellottii cohort with a younger A. nigripinnis cohort. Males disappeared from populations at a higher rate, especially towards the end of the season. The overall lifespan of both common species was up to 7months in pools that did not experience mid-season desiccation. This study provides fundamental demographic parameters for the annual fish in this region.

Stream characteristics associated with feeding type in silver (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis) and northern brook (I. fossor) lampreys and tests for phenotypic plasticity	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Ecotypes; Paired species; Common garden experiment; Habitat characteristics; Lamprey culture	PETROMYZON-MARINUS; SEA LAMPREY; ARCTIC CHAR; GENE FLOW; POPULATION; HISTORY; RIVER; PACIFIC; CULTURE	In most lamprey genera, paired species exist in which the larvae are morphologically indistinguishable but adult feeding type differs. The lack of diagnostic genetic differences in many pairs has led to suggestions that they constitute a single gene pool with environmentally influenced feeding types. To investigate whether stream characteristics are correlated with feeding type in the parasitic silver lamprey Ichthyomyzon unicuspis and non-parasitic northern brook lamprey I. fossor, eight variables (pH, alkalinity, conductivity, discharge, total dissolved solids, and density of larval sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, Ichthyomyzon spp., and total larval density) were compared among eight streams with only silver lamprey, 10 with only northern brook lamprey, and 13 with both species, using classification tree analysis. The most parsimonious model had a 24% misclassification rate, with silver lamprey tending to inhabit streams with higher sea lamprey larval density and northern brook lamprey tending to inhabit streams with higher Ichthyomyzon larval density. We then conducted a pilot study investigating phenotypic plasticity in a lab-based common garden experiment and an in situ transplant experiment. These studies encountered myriad difficulties and were unable to demonstrate plasticity, but did identify challenges associated with culturing Ichthyomyzon larvae. Development of effective rearing procedures for Ichthyomyzon lampreys is essential for any future similar studies.

Age interpretation in eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) as suggested by otolith microchemical signatures	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Eulachon; Otoliths; Trace elements; Forage fish; Microchemistry; Age determination	EASTERN BERING-SEA; DISSOLVED BARIUM; PHYSIOLOGICAL INFLUENCES; ELEMENTAL CHEMISTRY; FISH OTOLITHS; VALIDATION; GROWTH; OCEAN; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY	Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) are forage fish that play an important role in the ecosystem as prey for many species. Given their continuing population decline, determining accurate ages is necessary for age-structured stock assessments. This study employed microchemistry analysis to identify group differences and help interpret growth zone patterns on otolith surfaces. Specimens were collected off the coast of Oregon, in the coastal areas of Southeast Alaska, and in the southeastern Bering Sea. Laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was used to measure elemental ratios in the otoliths along a continuous track from the core to the proximoventral margin. Ba:Ca, Sr:Ca, Zn:Ca, and Mg:Ca signatures suggested that eulachon specimens from three geographic regions are different based on their elemental profiles. For the Oregon specimens, fluctuations in Ba:Ca and Zn:Ca signatures appeared consistent with otolith growth zones and most likely were the result of seasonal coastal upwelling events. Variations in Ba:Ca and Zn:Ca were useful as annual markers for eulachon otoliths from the Bering Sea. For the Southeast Alaska specimens, analysis of the Ba:Ca and Zn:Ca oscillations was not straightforward. Further work is needed to understand the link between otolith microchemistry, fish physiology, and regional environmental factors.

Drought cuts back regeneration in logged tropical forests	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						forest disturbance; forest recovery; community assembly; leaf trait; plant strategy; plant functional types	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; RAIN-FORESTS; RESTORATION; SEEDLINGS; RECOVERY; IMPACT	Logged tropical forests represent a major opportunity for preserving biodiversity and sequestering carbon, playing a large role in meeting global forest restoration targets. Left alone, these ecosystems have been expected to undergo natural regeneration and succession towards old growth forests, but extreme drought events may challenge this process. While old growth forests possess a certain level of resilience, we lack understanding as to how logging may affect forest responses to drought. This study examines the drought-logging interaction in seedling dynamics within a landscape of logged and unlogged forests in Sabah Malaysia, based on 73 plots monitored before and after the 2015-16 El Nino drought. Drought increased seedling mortality in all forests, but the magnitude of this impact was modulated by logging intensity, with forests with lower canopy leaf area index and above-ground biomass experiencing greater drought induced mortality. Moreover, community traits in more heavily logged forests shifted towards being more ruderal after drought, suggesting that the trajectory of forest succession had been reversed. These results indicate that with reoccurring strong droughts under a changing climate, logged forests that have had over half of their biomass removed may suffer permanently arrested succession. Targeted management interventions may therefore be necessary to lift the vulnerable forests above the biomass threshold.

Time Explains Regional Richness Patterns within Glades More Often than Diversification Rates or Area	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						area; biogeography; diversification; species richness; time for speciation	LATITUDINAL DIVERSITY GRADIENT; GEOGRAPHIC RANGE EVOLUTION; SPECIES RICHNESS; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; NICHE CONSERVATISM; ECOLOGICAL CAUSES; EXTINCTION; SPECIATION; BIODIVERSITY; PHYLOGENY	Most groups of organisms occur in multiple regions and have different numbers of species in different regions. These richness patterns are directly explained by speciation, extinction, and dispersal. Thus, regional richness patterns may be explained by differences in when regions were colonized (more time for speciation in regions colonized earlier), differences in how often they were colonized, or differences in diversification rates (speciation minus extinction) among regions (with diversification rates potentially influenced by area, climate, and/or many other variables). Few studies have tested all three factors, and most that did examined them only in individual clades. Here, we analyze a diverse set of 15 clades of plants and animals to test the causes of regional species richness patterns within clades. We find that time was the sole variable significantly explaining richness patterns in the best-fitting models for most clades (10/15), whereas time combined with other factors explained richness in all others. Time was the most important factor explaining richness in 13 of 15 clades, and it explained 72% of the variance in species richness among regions across all 15 dades (on average). Surprisingly, time was increasingly important in older and larger clades. In contrast, the area of the regions was relatively unimportant for explaining these regional richness patterns. A systematic review yielded 15 other relevant studies, which also overwhelmingly supported time over diversification rates (13 to 1, with one study supporting both diversification rates and time). Overall, our results suggest that colonization time is a major factor explaining regional-scale richness patterns within dades (e.g., families).

Grow Where You Thrive, or Where Only You Can Survive? An Analysis of Performance Curve Evolution in a Clade with Diverse Habitat Affinities	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						performance curves; tolerance curves; phenotypic plasticity; fundamental niche; Bayesian	NICHE EVOLUTION; REACTION NORMS; POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; THERMAL SENSITIVITY; SPECIES RANGE; PLASTICITY; SELECTION; ECOLOGY; TRAITS	Performance curves are valuable tools for quantifying the fundamental niches of organisms and testing hypotheses about evolution, life-history trade-offs, and the drivers of variation in species' distribution patterns. Here, we present a novel Bayesian method for characterizing performance curves that facilitates comparisons among species. We then use this model to quantify and compare the hydrological performance curves of 14 different taxa in the genus Lasthenia, an ecologically diverse dads of plants that collectively occupy a variety of habitats with unique hydrological features, including seasonally flooded wetlands called vernal pools. We conducted a growth chamber experiment to measure each taxon's fitness across five hydrological treatments that ranged from severe drought to extended flooding, and we identified differences in hydrological performance curves that explain their associations with vernal pool and terrestrial habitats. Our analysis revealed that the distribution of vernal pool taxa in the field does not reflect their optimal hydrological environments: all taxa, regardless of habitat affinity, have highest fitness under similar hydrological conditions of saturated soil without submergence. We also found that a taxon's relative position across flood gradients within vernal pools is best predicted by the height of its performance curve. These results demonstrate the utility of our approach for generating insights into when and how performance curves evolve among taxa as they diversify into distinct environments. To facilitate its use, the modeling framework has been developed into an R package.

This uncertainty for example, about the duration of conditions favorable for growth- can favor bet-hedging strategies. Here, we investigated the causes of life cycle variation in Osmia iridis, a bee exhibiting a possible bethedging strategy with co-occurring 1- and 2-year life cycles. One-year bees reach adulthood quickly but die if they fail to complete pupation before winter 2-year bees adopt a low-risk, low-reward strategy of postponing pupation until the second summer. We reared larval bees in incubators in various experimental conditions and found that warmer-but not longer-summers and early birthdates increased the frequency of 1-year life cycles. Using in situ temperature measurements and developmental trajectories of laboratory- and field-reared bees, we estimated degree-days required to reach adulthood in a single year. Local long-term (1950-2015) climate records reveal that this heat requirement is met in only similar to 7% of summers, suggesting that the observed distribution of life cycles is adaptive. Warming summers will likely decrease average generation times in these populations. Nevertheless, survival of bees attempting 1-year life cycles particularly those developing from late-laid eggs-will be <100%; consequently, we expect the life cycle polymorphism to persist.

Using 24 years of data on age-specific common tern (Sterna hirundo) chick mortality, best described by the Gompertz function, and estimates of energy consumption per age of mortality, we investigated how energy wasted on nonfledged chicks depends on brood size, hatching order, and annual abundance of herring (Clupea harengus), the main food source. We found mortality directly after hatching (Gompertz baseline mortality) to be high and to increase with decreasing herring abundance. Mortality declined with age at a rate relatively insensitive to herring abundance. The sensitivity of baseline mortality to herring abundance reduced energy wasted on nonfledged chicks when herring was in short supply. Among chicks that did not fledge, last-hatched chicks were less costly than earlier-hatched chicks because of their earlier mortality. However, per hatchling produced, the least energy was wasted on chicks without siblings because their baseline mortality was most sensitive to herring abundance. We suggest that earlier mortality of offspring when food is short facilitates economic adjustment of posthatching parental investment to food abundance but that such economic brood reduction may be constrained by sibling competition.

However, mate preferences limit gene flow only when expressed as mate choice, and numerous factors might be more important than preferences in nature. In the extremely color polytypic strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio), female mate preferences have codiverged with color in most allopatric populations tested. Whether these lab-assayed preferences predict mating (gene flow) in the wild remains unclear. We observed courting pairs in a natural contact zone between red and blue lineages until oviposition or courtship termination. We found color-assortative mating in a disturbed habitat with high population density but not in a secondary forest with lower density. Our results suggest color-assortative O. pumilio mate choice in the wild but also mating patterns that do not match those predicted by lab-assayed preferences.

Morphological Polymorphism Associated with Alternative Reproductive Tactics in a Plethodontid Salamander	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs); morph A; mate guarding; amphibian; Eurycea wilderae	SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; EURYCEA-AQUATICA; BEHAVIOR; MALES; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; AMPHIBIA; COMPLEX	Understanding polymorphism is a central problem in evolution and ecology, and alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) provide compelling examples for studying the origin and maintenance of behavioral and morphological variation. Much attention has been given to examples where "parasitic" individuals exploit the reproductive investment of "bourgeois" individuals, but some ARTs are instead maintained by environmental heterogeneity, with alternative tactics exhibiting differential fitness in discontinuous reproductive niches. We use genomic, behavioral, karyological, and field observational data to demonstrate one such example in plethodontid salamanders. These ARTs ("searching" and "guarding" males) are associated with different reproductive niches and, unlike most other examples in amphibians, demonstrate substantial morphological differences and inflexibility within a reproductive season. Evidence suggests the existence of these ARTs within three putative species in the two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) species complex, with other members of this clade fixed for one of the two tactics. We highlight directions for future research in this system, including the relationship between these ARTs and parental care.

The aim of our study was to track the influence of long-term climate change (i.e. temperature fluctuations) on past dynamics of aquatic primary producers. Sedimentary pigments were separated and quantified in 182 samples that span the last ca. 10,000 years. There was an increasing trend in sedimentary pigment concentrations from basal to upper sediment layers, suggesting a gradual increase in lake trophic status through time. Using additive models, our results suggested that primary producer dynamics in Lake Peipsi were closely related to temperature fluctuations. We, however, identified two periods (early Holocene and after ca. 2.5 cal ka BP) when the relationship between primary producer composition and temperature was weak, suggesting the influence of additional drivers on the primary producer community. We postulate that: (a) the increase of primary producer biomass in the early Holocene could have been caused by input of allochthonous organic matter and nutrients from the flooded areas when water level in Lake Peipsi was increasing, and (b) changes in the abundance and structure of primary producer assemblages since ca. 2.5 cal ka BP was related to widespread agricultural activities in the Lake Peipsi catchment. These results suggest that human activities can disrupt the relationship between the primary producer community and temperature in large, shallow lakes.

We investigated human activity in a low-human-impact region of Poland, taking advantage of varved sediments from Lake Szurpily, which span the last 8200 years. Multiple sediment variables indicated that catchment evolution and lacustrine responses, mainly to changes in forest cover, were divided into four phases. Because of sparse or only seasonal occupation of settlements in NE Poland, human impact in the region was insignificant until ca. 939 +/- 55 BC (lacustrine phase I). During Phase II (939 +/- 55 BC-AD 1392 +/- 38), we recorded an increase in human indicators, reflecting the direct influence of a Yatvingian community. Afterwards, between AD 1392 +/- 38 and 1770 +/- 30 (phase III), permanent settlements and agricultural land use stabilized. The beginning of the last period (phase IV) was clearly identified by all sediment variables, which responded simultaneously to local human activities. Disappearance of laminae from AD 1858 +/- 22 until about AD 1997 indicated disturbance of pre-existing, stable depositional conditions, followed by environmental recovery in the last 20 years. Such recovery may have been related to recent socio-economic changes and establishment of a park that reduced human influence on the lake.

However, drivers of biodiversity patterns and interactions between drivers are often only measured and modeled at a single scale. In this study, we assessed bee community composition at three time periods in 20 grassland and 20 agriculture sites located across two major metroplexes. We examined how local environmental variables and surrounding landscape composition impact bee abundance, richness, and evenness, including comparisons between groups with different nesting strategies and body sizes. We collected nearly 13,000 specimens and identified 172 species. We found that levels of regional land use differentially impacted bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management. Specifically, within agriculture sites, bee richness was greater with increasing landscape-level seminatural habitat, while in grassland sites, bee richness was similar across landscapes regardless of seminatural habitat cover. Bee evenness at both site types declined with increasing landscape-level habitat heterogeneity, due to an increase of rare species at the grassland sites, but not in the agricultural sites, further indicating that diversity is driven by the interaction of local habitat quality and landscape-level habitat composition. We additionally found that agriculture sites supported higher abundances, but not richness, of small-bodied and below-ground nesting bees, while grassland sites supported higher abundances of aboveground nesting bees, and higher richness of large-bodied species. Increased levels of local bare ground were significantly related to multiple metrics of bee diversity, including greater belowground nesting bee abundance and richness. Local floral richness was also significantly related to increases of overall bee abundance, as well as the abundance and richness of small bees. Overall, we suggest that local land managers can support bee abundance and diversity by conserving areas of bare soil and promoting native floral diversity, the latter especially critical in highly urban agricultural spaces. Our results provide the first documentation of significant interactions between local habitat management and landscape composition impacting insect communities in urban systems, indicating that bee conservation practices depend critically on land use interactions across multiple spatial scales.

Ectomycorrhizas and tree seedling establishment are strongly influenced by forest edge proximity but not soil inoculum	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cytisus scoparius; Douglas-fir; Pseudotsuga menziesii; reforestation; Scotch broom; soil transplanting	DOUGLAS-FIR; CLEAR-CUT; CYTISUS-SCOPARIUS; MYCORRHIZAL NETWORKS; FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; SPECIES RICHNESS; HYDRAULIC LIFT; PINUS-MURICATA; GROWTH; PATTERNS	Reforestation is challenging when timber harvested areas have been degraded, invaded by nonnative species, or are of marginal suitability to begin with. Conifers form mutu-alistic partnerships with ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) to obtain greater access to soil resources, and these partnerships may be especially important in degraded areas. However, timber harvest can impact mycorrhizal fungi by removing or compacting topsoil, removing host plants, and warming and drying the soil. We used a field experiment to evaluate the role of EMF in Douglas-fir reforestation in clearcuts invaded by Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) where traditional reforestation approaches have repeatedly failed. We tested how planting distance from intact Douglas-fir forest edges influenced reforestation success and whether inoculation with forest soils can be used to restore EMF relationships. We used an Illumina DNA sequencing approach to measure the abundance, richness and composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi on Douglas-fir roots, and assessed differences in Douglas-fir seedling survival and growth near to and far from forest edges with and without forest soil inoculum. Planting Douglas-fir seedlings near forest edges increased seedling survival, growth, and EMF root colonization. Edge proximity had no effect on EMF richness but did change fungal community composition. Inoculations with forest soil did not increase EMF abundance or richness or change community composition, nor did it improve seedling establishment. With Illumina sequencing, we identified two to three times greater species richness than described in previous edge effects studies. Of the 95 EMF species we identified, 40% of the species occurred on less than 5% of the seedlings. The ability to detect fungi at low abundance may explain why we did not detect differences in EMF richness with distance to hosts as previous studies. Our findings suggest that forest edges are suitable for reforestation, even when the interiors of deforested areas are not. We advocate for timber harvest designs that maximize edge habitat where ecto-mycorrhizal fungi contribute to tree establishment. However, this study does not support the use of inoculation with forest soil as a simple method to enhance EMF and seedling survival.

Past tree influence and prescribed fire exert strong controls on reassembly of mountain grasslands after tree removal	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						community convergence; conifer encroachment; ecological restoration; grassland restoration; legacy effects; prescribed burning; priority effects; regime shift; woody-plant invasion	WOODY PLANT ENCROACHMENT; ALTERNATIVE STABLE STATES; NORTH-AMERICAN GRASSLANDS; OREGON COAST RANGE; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; REGIME SHIFTS; SEED BANK; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; CONIFER ENCROACHMENT; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY	Woody-plant encroachment represents a global threat to grasslands. Although the causes and consequences of this regime shift have received substantial attention, the processes that constrain reassembly of the grassland state remain poorly understood. We experimentally tested two potentially important controls on reassembly, the past influence of trees and the effects of fire, in conifer-invaded grasslands (mountain meadows) of western Oregon. Previously, we had reconstructed the history of tree invasion at fine spatial and temporal resolution. Using small subplots (10 x 10 m) nested within larger (1-ha) experimental plots, we characterized the fine-scale mosaic of encroachment states, ranging from remnant meadow openings (minimally altered by trees) to century-old forests (lacking meadow species). Subsequently, we removed trees from six plots, of which three were broadcast burned and three remained unburned (except for localized burn piles). Within each plot, subplots were sampled before and periodically after tree removal to quantify the individual and interactive effects of past tree influence and fire on grassland community reassembly. Adjacent, uninvaded meadows served as reference sites. "Past tree influence" was defined as the multivariate (structural or compositional) distance of subplots to reference meadows prior to tree removal. "Reassembly" was defined as the distance, or change in distance, to reference meadows at final sampling. Consistent with theory, we observed greater reassembly of plant community structure than of composition, as loss of meadow specialists was offset by establishment of disturbance-adapted meadow generalists of similar growth form. Nevertheless, eight years after tree removal, most subplots remained structurally and compositionally distinct from reference meadows. Furthermore, fire had both destabilizing and inhibitory effects: it reduced survival of meadow specialists across the range of encroachment states and, where past tree influence was greater, it stalled reassembly by promoting expansion of a highly competitive native meadow sedge. The slow pace of reassembly, despite abundant open space, suggests strong seed limitation: a condition exacerbated by burning. We present a novel test of the importance of past tree influence and fire for restoration of tree-invaded grasslands, offering insights into how constraints on community reassembly vary along a continuum of tree-altered states.

Studies of habitat selection provide a lens into such mechanisms, but are often limited by unrealistic assumptions. For example, most studies assume that habitat selection is constant with respect to the availability of resources, such that habitat use remains proportional to availability. To the contrary, a growing body of work has shown the fallacy of this assumption, indicating that animals modify their behavior depending on the context at broader scales. This has been termed a functional response in habitat selection. Furthermore, a diversity of methods is employed to model functional responses in habitat selection, with little attention to how methodology might affect scientific and conservation conclusions. Here, we first review the conceptual and statistical foundations of methods currently used to model functional responses and clarify the ecological tests evaluated within each approach. We then use a combination of simulated and empirical data sets to evaluate the similarities and differences among approaches. Importantly, we identified multiple statistical issues with the most widely applied approaches to understand functional responses, including: (1) a complex and important role of random- or individual-level intercepts in adjusting individual-level regression coefficients as resource availability changes and (2) a sensitivity of results to poorly informed individual-level coefficients estimated for animals with low availability of a given resource. Consequently, we provide guidance on applying approaches that are insensitive to these issues with the goal of advancing our understanding of animal habitat ecology and management. Finally, we characterize the management implications of assuming similarity between the current approaches to model functional responses with two empirical data sets of federally threatened species: Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) in the United States and woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Canada. Collectively, our assessment helps clarify the similarities and differences among current approaches and, therefore, assists the integration of functional responses into the mainstream of habitat ecology and management.

Ringed seal demography in a changing climate	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate change; general circulation models; matrix population model; monitoring; power analysis; Pusa hispida; sea ice; snow depth	PRINCE-ALBERT-SOUND; WESTERN HUDSON-BAY; PHOCA-HISPIDA; BEAUFORT SEA; NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; REPRODUCTIVE RATES; LIFE-HISTORIES; AMUNDSEN GULF; BARROW STRAIT	Climate change is affecting species' distributions and abundances worldwide. Baseline population estimates, against which future observations may be compared, are necessary if we are to detect ecological change. Arctic sea ice ecosystems are changing rapidly and we lack baseline population estimates for many ice-associated species. Provided we can detect them, changes in Arctic marine ecosystems may be signaled by changes in indicator species such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida). Ringed seal monitoring has provided estimates of survival and fertility rates but these have not been used for population-level inference. Using matrix population models, we synthesized existing demographic parameters to obtain estimates of historical ringed seal population growth and structure in Amundsen Gulf and Prince Albert Sound, Canada. We then formalized existing hypotheses about the effects of emerging environmental stressors (i.e., earlier spring ice breakup and reduced snow depth) on ringed seal pup survival. Coupling the demographic model to ice and snow forecasts available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project resulted in projections of ringed seal population size and structure up to the year 2100. These projections showed median declines in population size ranging from 50% to 99%. Corresponding to these projected declines were substantial changes in population structure, with increasing proportions of ringed seal pups and adults and declining proportions of juveniles. We explored if currently collected, harvest-based data could be used to detect the projected changes in population stage structure. Our model suggests that at a present sample size of 100 seals per year, the projected changes in stage structure would only be reliably detected by mid-century, even for the most extreme climate models. This modeling process revealed inconsistencies in existing estimates of ringed seal demographic rates. Mathematical population models such as these can contribute both to understanding past population trends as well as predicting future ones, both of which are necessary if we are to detect and interpret future observations.

Patterns of rangeland productivity and land ownership: Implications for conservation and management	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ecosystem services; land tenure; net primary production; private land; public land; rangelands	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; COVER DATABASE; COMPLETION; SERVICES; SCIENCE	Rangelands cover 40-50% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. While often characterized by limited, yet variable resource availability, rangelands are vital for humans, providing numerous ecosystem goods and services. In the conterminous United States (CONUS), the dominant component of rangeland conservation is a network of public rangelands, concentrated in the west. Public rangelands are interspersed with private and tribal rangelands resulting in a complex mosaic of land tenure and management priorities. We quantify ownership patterns of rangeland production at multiple scales across CONUS and find that both total production and average productivity of private rangelands is more than twice that of public and tribal rangelands. At finer scales, private rangelands are consistently more productive than their public counterparts. We also demonstrate an inverse relationship between public rangeland acreage and productivity. While conserving acreage is crucial to rangeland conservation, just as critical are broad-scale ecological patterns and processes that sustain ecosystem services. Across CONUS, ownership regimes capture distinct elements of these patterns and services, demonstrated through disparate production dynamics. As ownership determines the range of feasible conservation actions, and the technical and financial resources available to implement them, understanding ownership-production dynamics is critical for effective and sustained conservation of rangeland ecosystem services.

Drought-mediated extinction of an arid-land amphibian: insights from a spatially explicit dynamic occupancy model	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bayesian state-space model; climate; colonization; extinction; Lithobates yavapaiensis; lowland leopard frog; metapopulation dynamics; sedimentation; stream network	LOWLAND LEOPARD FROGS; METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PATCH CHARACTERISTICS; POPULATION DECLINES; CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSES; WILDFIRE; SPACE; COLONIZATION	Understanding how natural and anthropogenic processes affect population dynamics of species with patchy distributions is critical to predicting their responses to environmental changes. Despite considerable evidence that demographic rates and dispersal patterns vary temporally in response to an array of biotic and abiotic processes, few applications of metapopulation theory have sought to explore factors that explain spatiotemporal variation in extinction or colonization rates. To facilitate exploring these factors, we extended a spatially explicit model of metapopulation dynamics to create a framework that requires only binary presence-absence data, makes few assumptions about the dispersal process, and accounts for imperfect detection. We apply this framework to 22 yr of biannual survey data for lowland leopard frogs, Lithobates yavapaiensis, an amphibian that inhabits arid stream systems in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for factors that govern temporal variation in transition probabilities, as both extinction and colonization rates varied with hydrologic conditions. Specifically, local extinctions were more frequent during drought periods, particularly at sites without reliable surface water. Colonization rates increased when larval and dispersal periods were wetter than normal, which increased the probability that potential emigrants metamorphosed and reached neighboring sites. Extirpation of frogs from all sites in one watershed during a period of severe drought demonstrated the influence of site-level features, as frogs persisted only in areas where most sites held water consistently and where the amount of sediment deposited from high-elevation wildfires was low. Application of our model provided novel insights into how climate-related processes affected the distribution and population dynamics of an arid-land amphibian. The approach we describe has application to a wide array of species that inhabit patchy environments, can improve our understanding of factors that govern metapopulation dynamics, and can inform strategies for conservation of imperiled species.

In this study, we aimed to understand the role of intraspecific trait variation on species occupation in a sharp ecotone. For this, we used, as a model, a dominant tree species of forest-savanna transitions in Brazil's Southwest and focused on stem architecture and allometries and leaf functional traits. Our results showed that trait variability improves plant performance along the ecotonal gradient. In fact, trees in forest optimize the light-interception and -use by the production of tall and slender stems and more acquisitive, smaller, and thinner leaves. On the other hand, trees in savannas had the opposite morpho-functional pattern, enhancing their resistance to wind, drought, continuous light incidence, and nutrient-poor soils. Surprisingly, trees right at the forest-savanna transition resembled forest tress regarding shoot morphology and savanna trees regarding leaf functional traits. However, displaced crowns were a singularity of transition trees. Taken together, our study shows that intraspecific variability is crucial for a dominant plant to successfully occupy contrasting habitats along the forest-savanna transition. Our study thus highlights the importance to investigate the role of intraspecific trait variation to better understand species dominance and community assembly in ecotonal zones.

Cerrado is a fire-prone ecosystem, but less is known about fire-related germination cues compared to Mediterranean-like ecosystems. Here, we hypothesize that seeds with a permeable tegument (Melastomataceae) respond positively to smoke (increase in germination), while species with physical dormancy (Fabaceae) have dormancy broken by exposure to high temperatures. We exposed seeds from Fabaceae and Melastomataceae species to high temperatures and smoke solution to simulate fire. Finally, we combined the two treatments (heat shock + smoke). Our results showed that seeds of two legumes (Harpalyce sp. and Mimosa leiocephala) had their physical dormancy broken when exposed to high temperatures, while one Fabaceae (Mimosa somnians) and two Melastomataceae showed an increase in germination when exposed to smoke solution. Lastly, four Fabaceae and two Melastomataceae species responded when combining heat shock and smoke. Contrary to our predictions, the responses to fire stimuli in Cerrado species did not show a clear response pattern, as those found in Mediterranean vegetation, probably due to differences in fire regime. However, we showed novel results about smoke stimulation for some species and positive effects of combined treatments. Thus, Cerrado seeds differ in response to fire, showing that cues for germination are more complex than previously thought, differing from other fire-prone ecosystems.

Although Transcaucasia is hypothesised to be a centre of diversity for many taxa, relatively few studies have investigated its potential role as such, or as a Pleistocene refugium. Using AFLP and sequence data (ITS, matK, trnL-F) from samples collected across the entire range of Microthlaspi perfoliatum, from the Iberian peninsula to Kazakhstan, and including the Mediterranean Basin and Central Europe, in this study it is examined how the interplay of Pleistocene climatic oscillations and historical demography may have shaped the current genetic structure of the species. The results of this study provide evidence that M. perfoliatum survived Pleistocene glaciation in five major refugia, Iberia, southwestern France, Italy, the Balkans and Anatolia/Transcaucasia and a sixth, unknown refugium in the disjunct distribution area in Central Asia. Our analyses support an ancient colonisation of M. perfoliatum towards the western and central Palearctic, perhaps, during the early Pleistocene or late Pliocene, likely starting from Transcaucasia. However, postglacial recolonisation of western and Central Europe has taken place from two distinct refugia, namely southwestern France/northern Italy, and Anatolia/Southern Balkans, respectively. The Iberian populations apparently did not contribute to postglacial recolonisation of Europe, perhaps because the Pyrenees acted as a significant barrier to dispersal. It is also conceivable that a rapidly expanding population from southwestern France and the southeastern part of the range effectively blocked the establishment of latecomers. The present study thus reveals a complex pattern of colonisation of Europe from Transcaucasia, with an interplay of climate and physical geography as main factors shaping the present-day genetic structure of M. perfoliatum.

Monthly data of dissolved Cd, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cu, and Zn concentrations in three different roadside soils (sandy loam, gravel (0-32mm) and a mixture of sandy loam and gravel) were measured during a 2-year lysimeter field study at different depths. The data was used to assess the variation of trace elements and how they were affected by environmental factors. For data interpretation, generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to explore the complex behavior of metals in heterogeneous soils by detecting linear and nonlinear trends of metal concentrations in the soil solution. As a result, the modeling approach showed that Cd, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cu, and Zn concentrations are functions of different environmental variables, which have either linear or nonlinear behavior. All investigated metals showed that pH could explain their variation. With exception of precipitation, Ni and Cr variations can nearly be explained by the same environmental factors used in this study (time, pH, infiltration volume, roadside soil type, runoff concentrations, and depth). During the study period, we found that Zn variation can be explained by its nonlinear relationship with all the significant studied environmental factors. As the depth increases from the surface to 30cm of depth, the metal concentration of Cd, Ni, Cr, Pb, and Zn increases. Surprisingly, the roadside soil consisting of gravel has the lowest organic carbon and showed the lowest median concentration of Cd, Ni, Pb, Cu, and Zn at 30cm. Moreover, the model showed that the surface runoff volume has no effect on the metal variation in the soil solution.

Status of Mysis diluviana in Lake Ontario in 2013: Lower abundance but higher fecundity than in the 1990s	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Production; Growth; Great Lakes; P/B	LIFE-HISTORY; PROFUNDAL ZONE; WATER CLARITY; HYNES METHOD; RELICTA; FOOD; GROWTH; ALEWIFE; ZOOPLANKTON; DYNAMICS	Mysis diluviana is a major component of prey fish diets in the Great Lakes, so annual production of M. diluviana is important for understanding and modeling energy flow through Great Lakes food webs. However, only three lake-wide measurements of M. diluviana annual production in Lake Ontario are currently available (1971, 1990, 1995). During 2013, lake-wide coverage of Lake Ontario was achieved during four periods from April to November. Annual mean density and biomass of M. diluviana in 2013 were 99 #/m(2) (SE: 8) and 318 mg dw/m(2) (SE: 28) - approximately half of values observed in 1990s. M. diluviana comprised 13-30% of offshore zooplankton biomass in each period. Reproduction peaked in fall, with mean brood size of 32 embryos (range: 11-49), at least 10% larger than in 1990s. Generation time was two years from embryo to initial reproduction. Growth rates were 0.052 mm/d for the age-0 cohort and 0.027 mm/d for the age-1 cohort. Age-0 growth rate was significantly higher than in 1980s-90s (0.035 mm/d). Annual production in 2013 was 0.85 g dw/m(2)/yr (SE: 0.03) which was 30-40% of values observed in 1990 and 1995 (2.23 and 2.53 g/m(2)/yr). Annual production to biomass ratio (P/B) in 2013 was 2.65/yr which was 80-85% of values observed in 1990 and 1995 (324 and 3.11 /yr), but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results suggest that changes in annual production over time can be estimated using changes in biomass over time and a mean P/B ratio. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Pond sediments on nesting islands in eastern Lake Ontario provide insights into the population dynamics and impacts of waterbird colonies	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Double-crested ormorants; Ring-billed gulls; Paleolimnology; Diatoms; Stable nitrogen isotopes; Lake Ontario	DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS; GREAT-LAKES; PHALACROCORAX-AURITUS; TRENDS; MANAGEMENT; GULLS; CONTAMINANTS; MOVEMENTS; POLLUTION; RESPONSES	Marked increases in ring-billed gulls and double-crested cormorants in the Laurentian Great Lakes during the last century have garnered attention over their ecological impacts, sparking debates about management strategies. However, monitoring data are generally sparse and of short duration for these colonies, hampering the ability to place recent changes within long-term context. Sediment records from ponds immediately surrounded by colonies on nesting islands can be used to track past bird populations, as they release wastes with geochemical signals that can be tracked using traditional paleolimnological methods, such as diatoms and stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15). Here, we provide new information about waterbird nesting histories on islands in eastern Lake Ontario that are of interest to wildlife managers. In all bird-impacted ponds, eutrophic diatom assemblages and elevated sediment chlorophyll-a coincided with high signatures of delta N-15 in the recent sediments, signifying bird influence. An absence of significant bird impacts in the oldest portion of one sediment core indicates that the current cormorant colony size (>2000 birds) is unprecedented over the similar to 150-year record. Diatoms and sediment chlorophyll-a also responded to even a small, short-duration cormorant nesting event on an actively managed reference island. Collating our findings with those from four previously studied sediment cores from nearby islands, we show that cormorants are unlikely to have occupied eastern Lake Ontario in their current numbers within the past similar to 150 years. However, ring-billed gulls have likely used several islands in the area for most of the 20th century (and perhaps earlier) until present. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

We report the resilience of aquatic community to a 100-year record-high flood, and how it varies depending on levels of water pollution, in a fourth-order gravel-bed river in northern Japan. We used data on riparian landscape structure, channel morphology, and community structure of aquatic fauna, which were collected in sites with and without effluent before (1 month-3 years) and after (10 months) the flood. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of consumers and basal resources were measured only before (1 year) the flood. We observed aquatic food web with introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the top predator, with variable relative contributions of basal resources and their pathways to the rainbow trout, under the effects of water pollution. Biofilm-originating dietary carbon became the more dominant resource, with a slightly shorter food-chain length in the polluted sites. The flood led to a loss of riparian forest and a substantial increase in the proportion of exposed gravel bars (5-24%). While the average river-bed elevation changed a little, the localized scours of river bed down to > 2 m were observed with lateral shifts of channel thalweg. Despite the landscape-level physical and structural changes of ecosystem, aquatic community showed a remarkably high resilience exhibiting negligible changes in abundance, except in the polluted site where only fish abundance showed a slight decrease. This study suggests that the abundance of aquatic organisms in gravel-bed rivers is resilient to a flood of unprecedented magnitude in recent history.

Previous studies have indicated that diverse garden landscapes and their maintenance as well as garden microclimates can be related to high bryophyte diversity, although it has not been examined how these microclimates differ from those in other land use types and how they affect bryophyte diversity. Therefore, this study analyzed the relationships among microclimate, garden landscape, and bryophyte diversity. The study sites comprised the renowned Saihoji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, and surrounding residential areas and forests. Seventeen 1-m-radius circular plots were established within the study sites, and bryophyte species richness and cover, landscape elements, and microclimates (temperature and relative humidity) were recorded in these plots. Sixty-seven species were identified, including four endangered species, and garden plots showed higher species richness and cover than surrounding areas. Garden microclimates were characterized by significantly lower temperature and higher relative humidity, which can be attributed to a combined influence of garden elements such as large vegetation cover and water surface. Notably, these microclimates can significantly and positively affect bryophyte diversity by mitigating drought stress. Thus, Japanese gardens featuring large vegetation cover and water surface can function as conservation sites for drought-sensitive species, increasing urban bryophyte diversity. Conservation of bryophytes might be beneficial to urban biodiversity and resilience reinforcement by promoting biological interactions among several species and improving ecological functions.

The impact of UHIs on Japanese gardens are of particular concern because these gardens use moss as a ground cover, and moss can be strongly affected by UHIs due to their sensitivity to drought stress. We studied 17 historical gardens in Kyoto, Japan, and propose an effective management strategy for moss gardens that takes into account the influence of UHIs on these gardens. The study sites included gardens covered by large patches of hygrophilous moss, gardens covered by mosses including small patches of hygrophilous moss, gardens covered by relatively drought-resistant moss, and gardens with small patches of mosses. We measured temperature and relative humidity within the gardens and determined the surrounding land-use types. A comparison of microclimates showed significant differences among garden types. Hygrophilous gardens had the lowest temperature and highest relative humidity, whereas gardens with small patches of moss had the highest temperature and lowest relative humidity. Using structural equation models, we determined that urbanization within 1000 m from the gardens increased temperature and decreased relative humidity, strongly affecting the type of garden. These effects could be attributed to the sensitivity of mosses to changes in microclimate caused by UHIs. Taken together, the results indicate that urban planning-e.g., increasing green space-within 1000 m of moss gardens can maintain those gardens by mitigating the influence of UHIs.

This research was implemented in a study area along the shores of Sendai Bay, a region that was heavily damaged by the tsunami following the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011. Field surveys of all the remnant patches of trees in the study area were conducted in 2014, three years after the disturbance. A total of 202 remnant patches were identified, and all the tree species, including both canopy trees and newly established seedlings, were recorded for each patch. The identified trees totaled 88 species, which were classified into three indicator-species types by a hierarchical cluster analysis. Comparisons based on species composition and similarity showed that species composition and other characteristics of the remnant patches were influenced by vegetation histories and other factors that only become visible at the regional landscape scale. The number of tree and seedling species per unit area was highest in patches that originated from pine plantations. Seven of the 25 seedling species identified were not present in any of the canopy layers in the study area, indicating that they dispersed from outside this area. These results show that, despite the immense scale of the tsunami, many diverse patches of trees managed to survive the disturbance.

The study stand showed a change in species composition from being dominated by Castanopsis cuspidata to Distylium racemosum, that is, from a typical coppice species to a typical climax species of the region. However, the relative dominance of Castanopsis spp. appeared to remain very high in the study stand compared to that in the Aya Research Site, a typical old-growth forest in the region, due to abundant C. cuspidata canopy trees of coppice origin. This suggests that the species composition of the study stand remained distinct from that of climax forests in the region. On the other hand, D. racemosum did not show a significant change in diameter at breast height (DBH) class frequency distribution from 1996 to 2017, probably due to the slow growth of this species. However, generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to identify the factors affecting better DBH growth of this species in the gap, indicating the potential for further development of the population structure when small trees are released from suppression of canopy trees. This suggests, inversely, that the development of the D. racemosum population was heavily suppressed by abundant C. cuspidata canopy trees of coppice origin that survived to the age of nearly 100 years. Further, large typhoons are suggested to cause severe canopy disturbances that remove canopy trees of C. cuspidata, which might be important for promoting further forest succession, even for a nearly 100-year-old evergreen old coppice.

Estimating relationships between size and fecundity in the threatened giant garter snake in seminatural and agricultural wetlands	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						effects of agriculture; fecundity; population ecology; snake; wildlife management	HUMAN FOOTPRINT; MODELS; REPRODUCTION; DIMORPHISM; LANDSCAPE; ABUNDANCE; SURVIVAL; COASTAL; GROWTH; RISK	Increasing numbers of populations of threatened and endangered plants and animals occur in environments altered by human activity. Life history traits may vary among populations in natural and human-dominated environments, and therefore, management strategies may need to be tailored to different environments to promote persistence. The primary objectives of this project were to estimate the probability of being pregnant for females of the threatened giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas) and test for differences in these demographic parameters between populations in seminatural wetlands and wetlands in areas dominated by rice agriculture. We also hypothesized that the probability of breeding and the number of fetuses would increase with increasing body size, a commonly reported relationship for snakes. We analysed data on T. gigas fecundity from 9 years using a Bayesian hurdle model and found no evidence of variation in the probability of being pregnant or in the number of fetuses given pregnancy for T. gigas in the two environments. The probability of being pregnant in a year was higher for females of larger size and ranged from <0.10 for snakes smaller than 631 mm snout-to-vent length (SVL) to >0.96 for the largest females. Similarly, given that a female was pregnant, the number of fetuses produced was higher for larger females. Pregnant females of average SVL were expected to produce 14 fetuses, and the largest females were expected to produce 34 fetuses. The inferences from our analyses are needed for subsequent population modeling, which will guide planning and decision-making for T. gigas.

Demographic consequences of climate variation along an elevational gradient for a montane terrestrial salamander	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						capture-recapture; growth; life history; MCMC; Plethodon; survival	LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; PLETHODON-CINEREUS; POPULATION-GROWTH; WOOD FROG; TEMPERATURE; DISPERSAL; DECLINES; SURVIVAL; RANGE; WATER	Climate change represents a significant threat to amphibians. However, for many species, the relationship between demography and climate is unknown, which limits predictive models. Here, we describe the life history variation of Plethodon montanus using capture-recapture data over a period of 4 years, along an elevational gradient to determine how survival and growth vary with climate, and how these relationships vary with elevation. We used a hierarchical model to estimate asymptotic size and growth rate and a spatial Cormack-Jolly-Seber model to estimate the probability of capture and survival and dispersal variance. We found that during the active season, growth and survival rates are both positively affected by precipitation; however, while survival was positively affected by temperature at all elevations, higher temperatures led to a decrease in growth at lower elevations, while at higher elevations the opposite was true. During the inactive season, we found reduced growth rates, whereas survival was lower compared with the active at lower elevations but was higher at higher elevations. Increased inactive season temperatures resulted in decreased survival while we found that temperature, amount of snow, and elevation interacted to influence survival. At low elevations, which were warmer, survival decreased with increasing snowfall but at higher elevations, survival generally increased with increasing snowfall. Our results demonstrate that understanding how the environment can affect salamander demography to develop mechanistic models will require knowledge of the actual environmental conditions experienced by a given population as well as an understanding of the overall differences in climate at a given site.

Assessing lek attendance of male greater sage-grouse using fine-resolution GPS data: Implications for population monitoring of lek mating grouse	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						Centrocercus urophasianus; greater sage-grouse; lek attendance; lek count; lek switching; Nevada	CENTROCERCUS-UROPHASIANUS; FIDELITY; MOVEMENTS; COUNTS	Counts of males displaying on breeding grounds are the primary management tool used to assess population trends in lekking grouse species. Despite the importance of male lek attendance (i.e., proportion of males on leks available for detection) influencing lek counts, patterns of within season and between season variability in attendance rates are not well understood. We used high-frequency global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data from male greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; n=67) over five lekking seasons (2013-2017) at eight study sites in Nevada to estimate lek attendance rates. Specifically, we recorded daily locations of sage-grouse in relation to mapped lek boundaries and used generalized additive models to assess temporal variation in attendance rates by age class (subadult vs. adult). Average timing of peak attendance occurred on 16 April but varied from March 16, 2014 to April 21 , 2016. Overall, adult males attended leks at higher rates (0.683 at peak) and earlier in the season (19 March) than subadults (0.421 at peak on April 19). Peak attendance probability was positively related to cumulative winter precipitation. Daily probabilities of lek switching differed between adults (0.019 at peak on March 3) and subadults (0.046 at peak on March 22), and lek switching was negatively related to distance to nearest lek. Our results indicate variable patterns in lek attendance through time, and that lek switching may occur at higher rates than previously thought. We demonstrate the use of generalizable daily attendance curves to date-correct lek counts and derive estimates of male abundance, although such an approach will likely require the incorporation of information on age structure to produce robust results that are useful for population monitoring.

Theory predicts that these fluctuations can be generated by predator-prey interactions, and empirical studies using life model systems, such as a rotifer-algae community consisting of Brachionus calyciflorus as predator and Chlorella vulgaris as prey, have been successfully used for studying such dynamics. B. calyciflorus is a cyclical parthenogen (CP) and clones often differ in their sexual propensity, that is, the degree to which they engage into sexual or asexual (clonal) reproduction. Since sexual propensities can affect growth rates and population sizes, we hypothesized that this might also affect population oscillations. Here, we studied the dynamical behaviour of B. calyciflorus clones representing either CPs (regularly inducing sex) or obligate parthenogens (OPs). We found that the amplitudes of population cycles to be increased in OPs at low nutrient levels. Several other population dynamic parameters seemed unaffected. This suggests that reproductive mode might be an important additional variable to be considered in future studies of population oscillations.

Intraspecific interactions affect the spatial pattern of a dominant shrub in a semiarid shrubland: A prospective approach	POPULATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						Andes; Croton; demography; Ecuador; individual-based modelling; spatial point analysis	SEED DISPERSAL; SPECIES COOCCURRENCE; LEGUMINOUS SHRUB; FACILITATION; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; FOREST; ORGANIZATION; COMMUNITIES; MECHANISMS	Dispersal, physical conditions and biotic interactions contribute to determine the spatial distribution of individuals in plant populations. Much of what we know has been learned from studies that retrospectively posit mechanisms presumed to have generated the observed spatial patterns. Here we present a prospective approach. We start by measuring spatial demographic effects and evaluate if they can generate observed spatial patterns. We evaluated the influence of interactions among conspecifics on vital rates, demography and spatial distribution of Croton aff. wagneri, a dominant shrub in dry Andean ecosystems. Recruitment, survival and growth varied in relation with distance to conspecifics neighbours and with their summed cover. We built a spatial individual-based model and simulated its population dynamics in 30 x 30m plots for a 30-year period. We compared the predicted spatial pattern from these demographic models with that observed among plants in 16 independent plots with the same area. Simulated populations mimicked observed spatial patterns, although in plots at high elevations the simulated populations did not reproduce the observed inhibition at small scales. Observed and simulated patterns indicated differences between elevations in maximum aggregation and location of the distances with higher aggregation. We discuss how consideration of critical seed and juvenile stages and interspecific interactions could further improve our understanding of spatial pattern and recommend that these factors be considered in future models.

Location Madrean Sky Islands and northern Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico. Methods I compared observations from recent fieldwork (2009-2012) with an extensive historical data set (1887-1954) and used modelling and multivariate techniques to assess spatiotemporal changes in species occurrence, richness and assemblage composition, and associations with climate, land use and landscape factors. Results Breeding species richness peaked in larger ranges often in the south and east, and regional beta diversity was attributable much more to turnover (0.80) than nestedness (0.07). Although richness increased across time, spatial assemblage heterogeneity declined due only to changes in nestedness, with temporal shifts in beta diversity equally attributable to variation in nestedness and turnover. Community change was associated with variation in climate, land use and landscape factors in ways that depended on species' traits. Major gains in Madrean and lowland Neotropical species from the south contrasted little change in Nearctic species, and there was some evidence lowland species expanded eastward into the higher-elevation interior, suggesting poleward and up-elevation shifts now occurring globally. Some such patterns were associated with increasing temperature and summer-fall precipitation typical of the south suggesting climate forcing. Despite regional gains in pine-dependent species linked to post-logging forest recovery, losses and turnover were greater in smaller more arid ranges due likely to climate-mediated habitat loss. High regional losses of cavity-nesting species in forest were greater in ranges subjected to past logging indicating effects of historical habitat degradation persist today. Main conclusion Despite ongoing forest recovery and potential for northward range expansion to offset climate-mediated losses of montane species, further assemblage homogenization seems likely. Active forest restoration that promotes large old trees, snags and mature forest conditions combined with increasing the capacity of local communities to implement best management practices will enhance conservation.

Complex elevational shifts in a tropical lowland moth community following a decade of climate change	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						elevational gradient; geometrid; Lepidoptera; long-term monitoring; occupancy modelling; range shift	RANGE SHIFTS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; MODEL SELECTION; UPSLOPE SHIFTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; RESPONSES; HABITAT; IMPACT; FOREST; BIRDS	Aim Climate change is driving many species towards higher latitudes and higher elevations. However, empirical studies documenting these changes have largely focused on presence/absence based range shifts in temperate regions. Studies in lowland tropical ecosystems that control for detection probabilities are especially lacking. Location Hong Kong SAR, China. Methods By analysing a 15-year trapping dataset of geometrid moths along a lowland elevation gradient (0-600 m) in Hong Kong, we used multiple metrics and approaches to estimate occurrence shifts with elevation, changes to range limits, and community-wide shifts in elevation. Our approaches used Bayesian occupancy models to account for false absences, which may bias naive measures of range shifts over time. Results Over the study period, we detected only subtle changes in forest cover but a notable increase in maximum temperatures (similar to 0.5 degrees C per decade) and extreme weather events. Of geometrid moths, one out of the 123 examined species exhibited increased occurrence probabilities across all elevations after accounting for uncertainty in detection; all other species exhibited no significant change in occupancy with elevation. However, at least two species became newly established in Hong Kong over the decade, and 32 species showed significant elevational shifts in lower or upper range limits. At the community level, geometrid moths showed a noticeable upslope shift at all but one of the examined sites. Main conclusions The complex patterns observed highlight the difficulties and limitations in detecting climate change impacts on diverse tropical communities. Our conservative results indicate early responses of tropical species over a relatively short timespan to a decade of environmental change, and the necessity of long-term monitoring for providing insights into the management and conservation of vulnerable species.

However, these pressures usually differ across the species' distribution range. To properly assess the combined effect of global change at species level, we need to evaluate its consequences across their complete distribution. We focused on recent decline in Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) populations given its high ecological and economic relevance. Location We selected 10 different sites (and two populations per site) separated about one degree in latitude across the core distribution of Q. suber, following a transcontinental aridity gradient. Methods To evaluate the current trends in population dynamics across the species' distribution and the factors implied on population decline, we evaluated the effect of latitude, aridity, pathogens (Phytophthora cinnamomi), stand density and tree size on seed and crop size, demographic structure, dominance of recruitment bank, defoliation and mortality. Results We found an increase in seed weight as latitude decreased, with a homogeneous low crop size across the complete distribution. Demographic structure was determined by latitude, precipitation and pathogen abundance. We detected a trend towards reduced sapling densities towards the southern edge of the distribution, with a demographic structure dominated by old trees. The low sapling density at the southern edge translates into a loss of dominance with respect to other woody species, suggesting an alteration of community structure in the mid-term future. Tree density, precipitation and pathogen abundance determined tree mortality across the species distribution, with a higher abundance of pathogens in central-latitude populations. Main conclusions Our results allow the early detection of declining trends and the evaluation of the main risks for species' conservation, suggesting potential for range displacement of the species driven by the recruitment failure at the southern edge of the distribution and a likely range expansion at northern populations.

Climate change can potentially affect parapatry by changing species' potential geographic distribution, and thereby widening or shrinking contact zones. Here, we study the effects of climate change on all six species in the genus Callithrix, a group of small-sized Neotropical primates that is distributed parapatrically in eastern Brazil, allegedly due to biotic interactions. Location Atlantic Forest, savanna and xeric shrublands from Brazil. Methods We explore a method to investigate potential effects of climate change on the distribution of parapatric species by (a) determining whether the parapatric pattern is explained by abiotic (climate) or biotic (species' interactions) factors using niche equivalency and niche similarity tests; (b) estimating each species' potential distribution under current and future climatic conditions, using ecological niche models; and (c) performing a pixel-by-pixel analysis in order to constrain distribution overlap between species pairs in which parapatry is maintained by biotic factors. Results We found that parapatry in Callithrix is maintained mostly by abiotic factors, except for two species pairs (Callithrix aurita vs. C. flaviceps and C. geoffroyi vs. C. penicillata) in which biotic factors are more likely to be acting. Our proposed method is able to produce better models than conventional ecological niche modelling, predicting net reductions in distribution area for some species and increases for others; however, reductions generally exceeded expansions. The reduction in potential distribution areas would maintain Callithrix flaviceps as Endangered under IUCN criteria. Main conclusions Despite range contractions and the loss of area of sympatry, climate change is unlikely to affect the parapatric distribution patterns in Callithrix, nor intensify interspecific interactions.

We examine the comparative sensitivity of plant and ant assemblages to climatic change, and determine if we should expect community breakdown and a loss of ecosystem function under climate change. Location A bioclimatic gradient from the temperate to arid zone in South Australia. Methods We sampled plant and ant assemblages along the gradient to establish assemblage-level responses to spatial climatic change using ordinations, and then projected assemblage responses to future climate change scenarios. Results We recorded totals of 363 plant and 227 ant species. Alignment between plant and ant communities was high, suggesting a high degree of similarity in the structuring of plant and ant communities in relation to environmental variation. However, our modelling suggested that ant assemblages were up to 7.5 times more sensitive to projected climate change than were plant assemblages, forecasting a very substantial decoupling of these assemblages under a future climate. Main conclusions Our results indicate that a high degree of community reorganization and change in ecosystem function should be expected under climate change.

Location The Mediterranean Sea. Methods We used the functional traits and geographic distributions of 106 copepod species to estimate the zooplankton functional diversity of Mediterranean surface assemblages for the 1965-1994 and 2069-2098 periods. Multiple environmental niche models were trained at the global scale to project the species habitat suitability in the Mediterranean Sea and assess their sensitivity to climate change predicted by several scenarios. Simultaneously, the species traits were used to compute a functional dendrogram from which we identified seven functional groups and estimated functional diversity through Faith's index. We compared the measured functional diversity to the one originated from null models to test if changes in functional diversity were solely driven by changes in species richness. Results All but three of the 106 species presented range contractions of varying intensity. A relatively low decrease of species richness (-7.42 on average) is predicted for 97% of the basin, with higher losses in the eastern regions. Relative sensitivity to climate change is not clustered in functional space and does not significantly vary across the seven copepod functional groups defined. Changes in functional diversity follow the same pattern and are not different from those that can be expected from changes in richness alone. Main conclusions Climate change is not expected to alter copepod functional traits distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, as the most and the least sensitive species are functionally redundant. Such redundancy should buffer the loss of ecosystem functions in Mediterranean zooplankton assemblages induced by climate change. Because the most negatively impacted species are affiliated to temperate regimes and share Atlantic biogeographic origins, our results are in line with the hypothesis of increasingly more tropical Mediterranean communities.

Predicting cetacean abundance and distribution in a changing climate	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						California current ecosystem; cetacean; climate change; generalized additive model; habitat model; species distribution model	DISTANCE SAMPLING DATA; SPATIAL MODELS; BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; BALEEN WHALES; PELAGIC FISH; CALIFORNIA; MARINE; HABITAT; ATLANTIC	Aim Changes in abundance and shifts in distribution as a result of a warming climate have been documented for many marine species, but opportunities to test our ability to forecast such changes have been limited. This study evaluates the ability of habitat-based density models to accurately forecast cetacean abundance and distribution during a novel year with unprecedented warm ocean temperatures caused by a sustained marine heatwave. Location California Current Ecosystem, USA. Methods We constructed generalized additive models based on cetacean sighting and environmental data from 1991 to 2009 for eight species with a diverse range of habitat associations. Models were built with three different sets of predictor variables to compare performance. Models were then used to forecast species abundance and distribution patterns during 2014, a year with anomalously warm ocean temperatures. Cetacean sighting data collected during 2014 were used to assess model forecasts. Results Ratios of model-predicted abundance to observed abundance were close to 1:1 for all but one species and accurately captured changes in the number of animals in the study area during the anomalous year. Predicted distribution patterns also showed good concordance with the 2014 survey observations. Our results indicate that habitat relationships were captured sufficiently to predict both changes in abundance and shifts in distribution when conditions warmed, for both cool- and warm-temperate species. Main conclusions Models built with multidecadal datasets were able to forecast abundance and distribution in a novel warm year for a diverse set of cetacean species. Models with the best explanatory power did not necessarily have the best predictive power. Also, they revealed species-specific responses to warming ocean waters. Results have implications for modelling effects of climate change on cetaceans and other marine predators.

An evaluation that combined both factors can be relevant to detect which species could be the most vulnerable and reveal the regions of highest stability or susceptibility to biodiversity. We aimed to: (a) assess the effect of climate change and land use on the distribution of Cerrado plant species for different countries where they occur, (b) evaluate the effectiveness of the current network of protected areas (PAs) to safeguards species under different greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions and land use scenarios, and (c) estimate the vulnerability of species based on protection effectiveness and habitat loss. Location Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Methods We modelled the distribution of 1,553 plant species of Cerrado and evaluated species range loss caused by present and future land use and two GHG for 2050 and 2080. We assessed species vulnerability combining the representativeness of species within conservation units with the loss of species' ranges outside PAs. Results We found that climate change and land use will cause great damage to Cerrado flora by 2050 and 2080, even under optimistic conditions. The greatest impacts of land use will occur in the regions where the greatest richness will be harboured. The conservation of the species will be seriously affected since the PA network is not as effective in safeguarding them under current or future conditions. Main conclusions The low level of protection together with the losses caused by the advance of agricultural lands will lead most species being highly vulnerable. Due to the distinct impacts of climate and land use over the three countries, conservation strategies should be implemented at transboundary and national levels.

Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) modifies microenvironment to promote nonnative plant communities	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Soil properties; Pacific Northwest; Extended growing season; Soil water	SUB-ALPINE VEGETATION; LOGGING-DEBRIS; COMPETING-VEGETATION; WESTERN WASHINGTON; NITROGEN-FIXATION; INVASIVE PLANTS; SOIL LEGACY; LEAF-LITTER; GROWTH; SHRUB	Scotch broom [Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link] is a globally important nitrogen (N)-fixing invasive plant species that has potential to alter soil water dynamics, soil chemistry, and plant communities. We evaluated the effects of Scotch broom on soil moisture, soil chemistry, soil temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and vegetation communities over 4years at a site recently harvested for timber. Treatments of Scotch broom (either present via planting or absent) and background vegetation (either present or absent via herbicide treatments) were applied to 4m(2) plots. Background vegetation was associated with the greatest decrease of soil water content (SWC) among treatments. During the driest year, Scotch broom showed some evidence of increased early-and late-season soil water usage, and, briefly, a high usage relative to background vegetation plots. On a percent cover basis, Scotch broom had a substantially greater negative influence on SWC than did background vegetation. Surprisingly, Scotch broom was not consistently associated with increases in total soil N, but there was evidence of increasing soil water N when Scotch broom was present. Scotch broom-only plots had greater concentrations of soil water magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+) than other treatments. On a percent cover basis, Scotch broom had a uniquely high demand for potassium (K+) relative to the background vegetation. Average soil temperature was slightly greater, and soil surface PAR lower, with Scotch broom present. Scotch broom-absent plots increased in species diversity and richness over time, while Scotch broom-present plots remained unchanged. Scotch broom presence was associated with an increase in cover of nonnative sweet vernalgrass (Anthoxanthum odoratum L.). Scotch broom generated positive feedbacks with resource conditions that favored its dominance and the establishment of nonnative grass.

Anthidium manicatum, an invasive bee, excludes a native bumble bee, Bombus impatiens, from floral resources	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Exotic species; Resource competition; Interspecific competition; Foraging behavior; Pollination	LINNAEUS HYMENOPTERA-MEGACHILIDAE; WOOL-CARDER BEE; DECLINE; POLLINATION; CONSERVATION; BEHAVIOR; APIDAE; APIS	Anthidium manicatum is an invasive pollinator reaching widespread distribution in North America. Male A. manicatum aggressively defend floral territories, attacking heterospecific pollinators. Female A. manicatum are generalists, visiting many of the same plants as native pollinators. Because of A. manicatum's rapid range expansion, the territorial behavior of males, and the potential for female A. manicatum to be significant resource competitors, invasive A. manicatum have been prioritized as a species of interest for impact assessment. But despite concerns, there have been no empirical studies investigating the impact of A. manicatum on North American pollinators. Therefore, across a two-year study, we monitored foraging behavior and fitness of the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) in response to A. manicatum presence. We found that B. impatiens avoided foraging near A. manicatum in both years; but despite this resource exclusion, we found no evidence of fitness consequences for B. impatiens. These results suggest A. manicatum pose as significant resource competitors, but that B. impatiens are likely able to compensate for this resource loss by finding available resources elsewhere.

Relative performance of co-occurring alien plant invaders depends on traits related to competitive ability more than niche differences	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Alien interaction; Competitive ability; Functional traits; Multi-species experiment; Niche differences	FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; PHYLOGENETIC RELATEDNESS; LIMITING SIMILARITY; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; GLOBAL TRADE; FACILITATION; MECHANISMS; INVASIONS; HIERARCHY; COEXISTENCE	Although conservation managers usually have to deal with multiple invaders that co-occur in native ecosystems, research to date has concentrated on the study of single highly invasive species. Consequently, this study aims to better understand the interactions among co-occurring alien plants. Specifically, I aim to determine how relative performance in mixture (compared to monoculture) depends on phylogenetic relatedness and similarity in functional traits. I investigated interactions among 18 alien annual plant species in Germany from six families in a multi-species common garden experiment, where plant individuals were grown in all pairwise species combinations. I measured growth, reproductive output and functional traits of the species, and determined phylogenetic and multivariate trait distances (representing niche differences) and individual trait hierarchies (representing average fitness differences that determine competitive superiority) between pairs. Across the 153 interspecific species combinations, individuals equally often experienced higher intraspecific or interspecific competition, with competitive responses varying greatly depending on species. Hierarchical differences in individual traits affected growth and seed production: being taller, having larger seed mass and higher specific leaf area benefitted relative performance of alien species when co-occurring with other aliens. Multivariate trait distance also had a positive effect on relative aboveground biomass production in mixture. Overall, hierarchical trait differences related to competitive ability appear to be more important than niche differences in determining performance for co-occurring alien plants. A better understanding on interaction type and strength among multiple plant invaders is crucial to determine appropriate management actions and contributes to ecological theory of community assembly.

Development of a quantitative PCR method for screening ichthyoplankton samples for bigheaded carps	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Hypophthalmichthys; Silver carp; Bighead carp; Eggs; Larvae; Genetic screening	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; SILVER CARP; IDENTIFICATION; EGGS; EDNA; TOOL	Monitoring ichthyoplankton is useful for identifying reproductive fronts and spawning locations of bigheaded carps (Hypophthalmichthys spp.). Unfortunately, sorting and identifying ichthyoplankton to monitor for bigheaded carp reproduction is time consuming and expensive. Traditional methods require frequent egg-larvae sampling, sorting of all samples to obtain presumptively identified bigheaded carp, and genetic validation of presumptively identified eggs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has the potential to streamline this process by identifying samples that likely do or do not contain a target species. Our objective was to develop a genetic screening tool using qPCR with the duplex assays SCTM4/5 and BHTM1/2 to prioritize samples that have a higher likelihood of containing bigheaded carp eggs or larvae. We used tandem ichthyoplankton samples collected for monitoring bigheaded carps in the Upper Mississippi, Illinois, and St. Croix rivers to evaluate the effectiveness of qPCR as a screening tool. Samples with >10,000 copies of DNA had 100% occurrence of bigheaded carp eggs or larvae in the traditionally sorted samples, whereas samples with <10 copies of DNA had 0% occurrence of ichthyoplankton from these invasive species. We used a logistic regression model to calculate the probability of finding bigheaded carp eggs or larvae based upon the number of DNA copies; 406 copies corresponded with a 50% probability of having bigheaded carp ichthyoplankton present in a sample. These data can be used to inform management actions (i.e., control, containment) for these invasive fishes, and this tool could be adapted for monitoring for reproduction of other aquatic invasive species.

Stable isotopes reveal mild trophic modifications in a native-invasive competitive relationship	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Amphibians; Discoglossus pictus; Epidalea calamita; Rapid evolution; Syntopy; Tadpoles	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; DISCOGLOSSUS-PICTUS; RAPID EVOLUTION; ANURAN; FOOD; POPULATION; TADPOLES; ECOLOGY; CARBON; TOADS	Temporal or evolutionary changes in the effects of invasive competitors on native species have not been studied in great depth. In this study, we explored possible modifications in the trophic shifts of native and invasive tadpoles in a set of ephemeral ponds with different amounts of time elapsed since the invasion, i.e., with different degrees of naivete of the native species to its invasive competitor. Using stable isotopes analysis, we found that the native (Epidalea calamita) and invasive (Discoglossus pictus) species always segregated in their trophic position within ponds. Furthermore, the isotopic signature of the tadpoles was affected by the composition and diversity of the surrounding vegetal and animal communities. The amount of time elapsed since the invasion did not influence the magnitude of the trophic differences between the species, but it did affect the nature of this segregation. Segregation at the trophic level occurred most frequently during the first stages of invasion, with the invasive species occupying higher trophic levels. However, segregation was progressively attained through the consumption of different items within the same trophic level when the amount of time since invasion increased. Thus, our results point that the native species no longer uses a lower trophic level after several generations of coexistence. In contrast, changes in the trophic niche width of either species during the invasion process were largely undetected.

We suggest using population viability analysis (PVA) as a tool to evaluate relative efficacy of different control options for invasive species. PVA explicitly accounts for stochastic events impacting survival of populations at low abundance, which is critically important for representing founder effects of invasive species and appropriately calculating relative eradication probabilities. We demonstrate how PVA may be used to compare control options for hypothetical invasive populations of smallmouth bass, zebra mussels and northern pike. The model is parameterized using readily available parameters from the literature and provides a time series of population projections with uncertainty, as well as outcomes such as total control cost, probability of eradication and final abundance. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the ranking of various control options may change with parameter misspecification, demonstrating the importance of evaluate sensitivity prior to a final decision. When considering the appropriate response to invasive species, there is a trade-off between acting quickly and carefully considering all options using best available knowledge. PVA provides a balance between these two choices by providing a means to compare all control options and perspective values collaboratively with agencies and stakeholders in a way that quickly builds consensus for the most appropriate option(s) and facilitates action.

If increased productivity in invaders relative to natives comes at the expense of reduced relative allocation to defenses, generalist herbivores may preferentially consume invasive species, potentially reducing the effectiveness of invader growth advantage. We compared leaf traits related to herbivory (nitrogen concentration, total phenolics, cellulose and lignin concentrations, and leaf dry matter content) in 20 phylogenetically paired native and non-native, invasive species and evaluated species palatability to two generalist herbivores: one non-native (European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar) and one native (fall webworm, Hyphantria cunia). We also evaluated potential physiological tradeoffs between defense-related leaf traits, leaf production, and carbon storage in this group of species. Invasive plants had higher leaf N and lignin concentrations than related native species (0.5% and 5%, respectively), but gypsy moth and fall webworm growth were not associated with plant nativity. Plant defense traits did not predict differences in gypsy moth growth, but fall webworm growth was marginally negatively associated with leaf N. We found no evidence of tradeoffs between defense-related leaf traits, leaf production, and carbon storage, indicating a limited role for carbon-based tradeoffs relating to growth and herbivory in these species, although other unmeasured carbon pools including reproduction may impact these relationships. Woody invaders continue to spread in Eastern North American forest understories, but we found no evidence of inhibition or facilitation by generalist insect herbivores, despite differences among species in leaf traits associated with defense.

For the Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH), which postulates that the success of invasive populations hinges upon release from the effects of their natural enemies, assessments of parasite loss during invasion across independent geographical replicates are scarce. This study is the first to test the ERH for a globally invasive amphibian, Xenopus laevis, a successful invader on four continents with a well-described parasite fauna. In this study, the metazoan parasite communities of X.laevis from 20 invasive and 27 native sites in five countries and three continents were compared. An overall pattern of reduced parasite diversity in invasive X. laevis was not yet countered by acquisition of novel parasites. Invasive X. laevis harboured impoverished parasite communities that were distinct from those of native X. laevis from undisturbed habitats. Conversely, parasite communities from native X. laevis from disturbed habitats were similar to those from the invasive range. Accompanying parasites were common in the native range and included both generalists with indirect and specialists with direct life cycles. Our findings emphasise that parasite loss is characteristic of the invasion process of X. laevis and possibly contributes to its success as a global invader. The ERH is supported in terms of metazoan parasites as natural enemies, irrespective of the geographical origin, climatic conditions and invasion history of the host populations. This study also draws attention to parasites that co-invade with their hosts as invaders in their own right.

Gypsy moth (Lymantria disparL.) is a generalist defoliator in North America and supraoptimal temperatures (above the optimal for developmental rate) have been implicated in range dynamics at the southern invasion front in West Virginia and Virginia. We sourced egg masses from the Appalachian Mountains (AM), where the gypsy moth range is expanding, from the Coastal Plain (CP), where range retraction is occurring, and from a long-established population in New York (NY) and conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to compare development and fitness components among these populations at two sites along the southern invasion front. We found evidence of sublethal effects from rearing in the CP, with decreased pupal mass and fewer eggs compared to individuals reared in the AM, but little difference between source populations in developmental traits. The AM and NY populations did experience reductions in egg viability under a southern winter at the CP site compared to control wintering conditions, while the CP egg masses had equivalent survival. This study provides empirical support for negative fitness consequences of supraoptimal temperatures at the southern range edge, consistent with patterns of range retraction and spread in the region, as well as suggesting the potential for local adaptation through variation in egg survival. Our work illustrates that sublethal effects from high temperature can be an important factor determining the distribution of invasive species under current and future climates.

Trophic plasticity and the invasion of a renowned piscivore: a diet synthesis of northern pike (Esox lucius) from the native and introduced ranges in Alaska, USA	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Trophic plasticity; Northern pike; Diet; Community ecology; Trophic ecology; Alaska fishes	LIFE-HISTORY; FEEDING STRATEGY; FISH COMMUNITIES; YAMPA RIVER; HABITAT USE; PREY; CONSUMPTION; SALMONIDS; ECOLOGY; LAKE	The invasion of non-native fishes is a leading cause of extinction and imperilment of native freshwater fishes. Evidence suggests that introduced species with generalist diets have the potential for greatest impacts through competition and predation even though populations are often comprised of specialist individuals. The northern pike (Esox lucius), a predatory fish, has been widely introduced outside its native range for recreational fishing purposes, especially in western North America, and it has been implicated in declines and extirpations of native fishes. We synthesized over 2900 individual northern pike diet records across 31 waterbodies from the native and introduced ranges in Alaska to quantify the extent of diet specialization and generalization relative to freshwater prey communities. To control for effects of ontogenetic diet shifts, we separately analyzed major size classes of northern pike and inferred and visualized trophic plasticity from prey-specific abundance indices and ordination. Diet generalization was common in northern pike among waterbodies and usually consisted of individuals consuming macroinvertebrates. However, when available, individual northern pike diets showed specialization on fishes, amphibians, small mammals, and dragonflies. The reliance on macroinvertebrate prey by northern pike from small, isolated lakes in the native and invasive ranges suggests that dietary plasticity facilitates persistence of these predators in the absence of preferred fish prey. Broadly, this synthesis supports the hypothesis that trophic plasticity and diet generalization widely occur among invasive and native populations of northern pike which is likely to enhance the probability of introduction success, exacerbate their environmental impacts, and complicate management of this potentially invasive freshwater predator.

Fire as driver of the expansion of Paraserianthes lophantha (Willd.) I. C. Nielsen in SW Europe	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Forest fire; Invasive species; Germination; Spatial stochastic models; Spreading pattern	ERICA-TETRALIX HEATHLANDS; PLANT INVASIONS; ACACIA-MELANOXYLON; GERMINATION; SMOKE; ASH; FOREST; PINUS; HEAT; CONSEQUENCES	Paraserianthes lophantha (Willd.) I. C. Nielsen is a plant species native to SW Australia that has recently invaded temperate ecosystems in Europe and other areas in the world. Since it has been found in burnt areas and its expansion could be promoted by forest fires, the germination response of seeds to fire factors (heat, smoke, ash and charcoal) was analyzed. Furthermore, stochastic post-fire invasion models were developed to check the impact of one-off and repeated forest fires. The spreading pattern after fire was modeled to provide accurate forecasts for future fires. The model was parameterized using data recorded after the 2013 forest fire in the Natura 2000 site Monte Pindo. Germination response is mainly modified by heat, which breaks seed dormancy at moderate temperature and kills seeds at high temperatures. Smoke, ash and charcoal did not have relevant influence on seed germination except large amounts of ash, which prevented seed germination. Neither charcoal origin (from native or from exotic species) had a significant effect on P. lophantha germination. The invasion model demonstrated the significant role of forest fires promoting P. lophantha spreading. Recurrent fires promote the spreading of invasive species, threatening natural plant communities. However, the expansion of the species was not exclusively linked to forest fires: anthropic systems, edges of agricultural areas and old fields were particularly affected by P. lophantha expansion. Some control methods based on the reproductive behavior and spreading pattern of P. lophantha were proposed in order to prevent new invasions and manage invaded areas.

Can marine reserves restore lost ecosystem functioning? A global synthesis	ECOLOGY			English	Article						consumer; ecosystem function; functional redundancy; herbivory; marine protected area; meta-analysis; predation	TOP-DOWN CONTROL; PROTECTED AREAS; LATITUDINAL GRADIENT; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; PREDATION PRESSURE; JASUS-EDWARDSII; SEA-URCHIN; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SIZE	Marine protected areas (MPAs) have grown exponentially, emerging as a widespread tool to conserve biodiversity and enhance fisheries production. Although numerous empirical studies and global syntheses have evaluated the effects of MPAs on community structure (e.g., biodiversity), no broad assessment concerning their capacity to influence ecological processes (e.g., species interactions) exists. Here, we present meta-analyses that compare rates of predation and herbivory on a combined 32 species across 30 MPAs spanning 85 degrees of latitude. Our analyses synthesize the fate of 15,225 field experiment assays, and demonstrate that MPAs greatly increased predation intensity on animals but not herbivory on macroalgae or seagrass. Predation risk, quantified as the odds of prey being eaten, was largely determined by predator abundance and biomass within reserves. At MPAs with the greatest predator accumulation, the odds of predation increased to nearly 49:1, as opposed to 1:1 at MPAs where predators actually declined. Surprisingly, we also found evidence that predation risk declined with increased sea-surface temperature. Greater predation risk within MPAs was consistent with predator and prey population abundance estimates, where predators increased 4.4-fold within MPAs, whereas prey decreased 2.2-fold. For herbivory, the lack of change may have been driven by functional redundancy and the inability of reserves to increase herbivore abundance relative to fished zones in our sample. Overall, this work highlights the capacity of MPAs to restore a critical ecosystem function such as predation, which mediates energy flows and community assembly within natural systems. However, our review of the literature also uncovers relatively few studies that have quantified the effects of MPAs on ecosystem function, highlighting a key gap in our understanding of how protected areas may alter ecological processes and deliver ecosystem services. From a historical perspective, these findings suggest that modern levels of predation in the coastal oceans may currently only be a fraction of the baseline prior to human exploitation.

Key colonist pools and habitat filters mediate the composition of fiddler crab-associated bacterial communities	ECOLOGY			English	Article						bacterial communities; colonist pools; dispersal; fiddler crabs; habitat filters; sediment bacteria	SOIL SEED BANK; SP-NOV.; CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND; DISPERSAL LIMITATION; PARTICLE INGESTION; SPECIES POOLS; RICHNESS; STERILIZATION; ASSEMBLAGES; COEXISTENCE	The diversity and composition of local communities depends strongly on the pool of species that have been able to colonize that community from elsewhere. Typically this is thought to depend on a larger regional species pool that is subject to local environmental constraints that act as "filters." Often, however, colonists arrive from multiple sources that differ in habitat conditions and have therefore already experienced distinct "prefiltering." Consequently, it is the interaction of species from these distinct pools that determine the composition of local communities. This interaction is particularly important when certain colonist pools provide keystone species with disproportionate roles on community assembly. We propose to identify these key colonist pools and their interaction with local habitat filters by quantifying community-level responses to colonist pool manipulation. We tested this framework to assess the contribution of surface and burrow sediment bacteria to bacterial communities associated with the fiddler crab, Uca panacea. In a mesocosm experiment, we combined normal and autoclaved surface and burrow sediment in a factorial experimental design, and we evaluated the community-level responses of carapace and gut microbial assemblages to sediment treatments with next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Results from carapace bacterial communities indicate that burrow sediments contribute most recruits, but surface sediments provide a few key colonizers that become established in the carapace community. In contrast, the composition of gut-associated microbial communities responded only to surface bacteria manipulation, despite being highly dissimilar from the community composition in both the surface and burrow source pools. These results suggest that assembly in the gut depends primarily on colonization from the surface sediment and regulation by habitat filtering. For fiddler crab-associated bacteria, we can conclude that key colonist pools and habitat filters regulate the influence of multiple colonist pools. Incorporating and distinguishing the contribution of multiple sources of species, rather than a single regional species pool, may better explain community dynamics in many systems, especially those with weak habitat filters.

Here, coupling an integrative path analysis approach with data from an extensive countrywide monitoring program, we tested the main spatial, environmental and anthropogenic drivers of change in the functional structure of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities along the entire Swiss Rhine river catchment. Functional structure was largely driven by inherent altitudinal variation influencing and cascading to regional scaled factors such as land use change and position in the riverine network, which, in turn, transformed local habitat structure variables. Those cascading effects across scales propagated through the biotic community, first affecting prey and, in turn, predators. Our results illustrate how seemingly less important local factors can act as essential transmission belts, propagating through direct and indirect pathways across scales to generate the specific context in which each functional group will strive or not, leading to characteristic landscape wide variations in functional community structure.

Managing the tree species richness and composition of these fragments to optimize their functioning and the deliverance of multiple ecosystem services is of great practical relevance. However, both the strength and direction of tree species richness and tree species composition effects on forest ecosystem multifunctionality may depend on the landscape context in which these forest remnants are embedded. Taking advantage of an observatory network of 53 temperate forest plots varying in tree species richness, tree species composition, and fragmentation intensity we measured 24 ecosystem functions spanning multiple trophic levels and analyzed how tree species diversity-multifunctionality relationships changed with fragmentation intensity. Our results show that fragmentation generally increases multifunctionality and strengthens its positive relationship with diversity, possibly due to edge effects. In addition, different tree species combinations optimize functioning under different fragmentation levels. We conclude that management and restoration of forest fragments aimed at maximizing ecosystem multifunctionality should be tailored to the specific landscape context. As forest fragmentation will continue, tree diversity will become increasingly important to maintain forest functioning.

Ecological consequences of anomalies in atmospheric moisture and snowpack	ECOLOGY			English	Article						alpine ecosystem; American pika; climate change; extreme weather; Ochotona princeps; phenology; snow drought; vapor pressure deficit	OCHOTONA-PRINCEPS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMERICAN PIKAS; SIERRA-NEVADA; POPULATION; WATER; RESPONSES; SURVIVAL; MODELS; PLACE	Although increased frequency of extreme-weather events is one of the most secure predictions associated with contemporary climate change, effects of such events on distribution and abundance of climate-sensitive species remain poorly understood. Montane ecosystems may be especially sensitive to extreme weather because of complex abiotic and biotic interactions that propagate from climate-driven reductions in snowpack. Snowpack not only protects subnivean biotas from extreme cold, but also influences forage availability through timing of melt-off and water availability. We related relative abundances of an alpine mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps), to measures of weather and snowpack dynamics over an 8-yr period that included before and after a year of record-low snowpack in Washington, USA. We sought to (1) quantify any change in pika abundance associated with the snowpack anomaly and (2) identify aspects of weather and snowpack that influenced abundance of pikas. Pikas showed a 1-yr lag response to the snowpack anomaly and exhibited marked declines in abundance at elevations below 1,400 m simultaneous with increased abundances at higher elevations. Atmospheric moisture, indexed by vapor pressure deficit (VPD), was especially important, evidenced by strong support for the top-ranked model that included the interaction of VPD with snowpack duration. Notably, our novel application of VPD from gridded climate data for analyses of animal abundances shows strong potential for improving species distribution models because VPD represents an important aspect of weather that influences the physiology and habitat of biota. Pikas were apparently affected by cold stress without snowpack at mid elevations, whereas changes to forage associated with snowpack and VPD were influential at high and low elevations. Our results reveal context dependency in pika responses to weather and illustrate how snow drought can lead to rapid change in the abundance of subnivean animals.

A comparative evaluation of five common pairwise tests of species association	ECOLOGY			English	Article						co-abundance; community assembly; co-occurrence; co-presence; null model; pairwise; species associations; species co-occurrence; type I error; type II error	COOCCURRENCE; MODEL	Researchers have long viewed patterns of species association as key to understanding the processes that structure communities. Community-level tests of species association have received the most attention; however, pairwise species associations may offer greater opportunity for linking patterns to specific mechanisms. Although several tests of pairwise association have been developed, there remain gaps in our understanding of their performance. Consequently, it is unclear whether these methods reliably detect patterns of association, or if any one method is superior. We maximized association patterns for single species pairs in synthetic community matrices and examined how accurately five pairwise association tests found that pair, while not finding others (i.e., type I and II error rates). All tests are more likely to miss patterns of association than to falsely detect them. When we maximized association for a species pair that included one or more rare or common species, tests were frequently unable to identify that pair as significantly associated. Consequently, these tests are best suited for identifying significant associations between pairs of species that occur in an intermediate number of samples; for such pairs, three of the five tests considered here detected 100% of the pairs for which we maximized associations.

Nutrient acquisition strategies augment growth in tropical N-2-fixing trees in nutrient-poor soil and under elevated CO2	ECOLOGY			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; elevated CO2; nitrogen fixation; nutrient acquisition strategies; phosphatase enzymes; tropical trees	ATMOSPHERIC CO2; NITROGEN-FIXATION; ORGANIC-CARBON; PLANT-GROWTH; PHOSPHORUS; RESPONSES; CLIMATE; PRODUCTIVITY; FACE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Tropical forests play a dominant role in the global carbon (C) cycle, and models predict increases in tropical net primary productivity (NPP) and C storage in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The extent to which increasing CO2 will enhance NPP depends in part on the availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to support growth. Some tropical trees can potentially overcome nutrient limitation by acquiring N via symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation, which may provide a benefit in acquiring P via investment in N-rich phosphatase enzymes or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We conducted a seedling experiment to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 and soil nutrient availability on the growth of two N-2-fixing and two non-N-2-fixing tropical tree species. We hypothesized that under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability (i.e., low N and P), N-2 fixers would have higher growth rates than non-N-2 fixers because N-2 fixers have a greater capacity to acquire both N and P. We also hypothesized that differences in growth rates between N-2 fixers and non-N-2 fixers would decline as nutrient availability increases because N-2 fixers no longer have an advantage in nutrient acquisition. We found that the N-2 fixers had higher growth rates than the non-N-2 fixers under elevated CO2 and at low nutrient availability, and that the difference in growth rates between the N-2 and non-N-2 fixers declined as nutrient availability increased, irrespective of CO2. Overall, N-2 fixation, root phosphatase activity, and AM colonization decreased with increasing nutrient availability, and increased under elevated CO2 at low nutrient availability. Further, AM colonization was positively related to the growth of the non-N-2 fixers, whereas both N-2 fixation and root phosphatase activity were positively related to the growth of the N-2 fixers. Though our results indicate all four tree species have the capacity to up- or down-regulate nutrient acquisition to meet their stoichiometric demands, the greater capacity for the N-2 fixers to acquire both N and P may enable them to overcome nutritional constraints to NPP under elevated CO2, with implications for the response of tropical forests to future environmental change.

Antipredator response diminishes during periods of resource deficit for a large herbivore	ECOLOGY			English	Article						bottom up; context dependence; moose; predation risk; predator avoidance; top down; ungulate; winter; wolf	HABITAT SELECTION; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; PREDATION RISK; PREY; ELK; MOOSE; POPULATION; STRENGTH; WOLVES; INTIMIDATION	The starvation-predation hypothesis predicts that, during resource shortages, prey forego antipredator behavior and forage as much as possible to avoid starvation, even when risk of predation is high. We tested this hypothesis using GPS locations collected simultaneously from moose (Alces alces) and wolves (Canis lupus) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of North America. We assessed shifts in the speed, displacement, and habitat selection of moose 24 h following encounter with wolves (0-1,500 m distance). We examined whether the strength of antipredator behaviors would weaken as winter progressed and the nutritional condition of moose declined. Moose responded to wolf encounters by increasing their rate of movement in early winter, but only within 500 m distance. Importantly, these responses attenuated as winter progressed. Moose did not avoid their preferred foraging habitat (riparian areas) following encounters with wolves at any distance, and instead they more strongly selected riparian areas, especially in early winter. Our findings support theoretical predictions that resource deficits should dampen prey antipredator behavior, and suggest that nutritional condition of prey may buffer against run-away risk effects in food webs involving large mammalian predators and prey.

Biogeochemical recuperation of lowland tropical forest during succession	ECOLOGY			English	Article						disturbance; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; phosphorus; plants; soil	LAND-USE CHANGE; RAIN-FOREST; PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; SECONDARY SUCCESSION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; CARBON STORAGE; PASTURE; DYNAMICS; LOSSES	High rates of land conversion and land use change have vastly increased the proportion of secondary forest in the lowland tropics relative to mature forest. As secondary forests recover following abandonment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) must be present in sufficient quantities to sustain high rates of net primary production and to replenish the nutrients lost during land use prior to secondary forest establishment. Biogeochemical theory and results from individual studies suggest that N can recuperate during secondary forest recovery, especially relative to P. Here, we synthesized 23 metrics of N and P in soil and plants from 45 secondary forest chronosequences located in the wet tropics to empirically explore (1) whether there is a consistent change in nutrients and nutrient cycling processes during secondary succession in the biome; (2) which metrics of N and P in soil and plants recuperate most consistently; (3) if the recuperation of nutrients during succession approaches similar nutrient concentrations and fluxes as those in mature forest in similar to 100 yr following the initiation of succession; and (4) whether site characteristics, including disturbance history, climate, and soil order are significantly related to nutrient recuperation. During secondary forest succession, nine metrics of N and/or P cycling changed consistently and substantially. In most sites, N concentrations and fluxes in both plants and soil increased during secondary succession, and total P concentrations increased in surface soil. Changes in nutrient concentrations and nutrient cycling processes during secondary succession were similar whether mature forest was included or excluded from the analysis, indicating that nutrient recuperation in secondary forest leads to biogeochemical conditions that are similar to those of mature forest. Further, of the N and P metrics that recuperated, only soil total P and foliar delta N-15 were strongly influenced by site characteristics like climate, soils, or disturbance history. Predictable nutrient recuperation across a diverse and productive ecosystem may support future forest growth and could provide a means to quantify successful restoration of ecosystem function in secondary tropical forest beyond biomass or species composition.

Successional dynamics of nitrogen fixation and forest growth in regenerating Costa Rican rainforests	ECOLOGY			English	Article						asymbiotic nitrogen fixation; forest regeneration; Neotropics; nitrogen; succession; symbiotic nitrogen fixation; tropical forests	SOIL-AGE GRADIENT; ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT; FIXING TREES; N-2 FIXATION; LEAF-LITTER; PATTERNS; ABUNDANCE; BIOMASS; FERTILIZATION; ACCUMULATION	Regenerating tropical forests have an immense capacity to capture carbon and harbor biodiversity. The recuperation of the nitrogen cycle following disturbance can fuel biomass regeneration, but few studies have evaluated the successional dynamics of nitrogen and nitrogen inputs in tropical forests. We assessed symbiotic and asymbiotic nitrogen fixation, soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and tree growth in a well-studied series of five tropical forest plots ranging from 19 yr in age to old-growth forests. Wet-season soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations were high in all plots, peaking in the 29-yr-old plot. Inputs from symbiotic nitrogen fixation declined through succession, while asymbiotic nitrogen fixation peaked in the 37-yr-old plot. Consequently, the dominant nitrogen fixation input switched from symbiotic fixation in the younger plots to asymbiotic fixation in the older plots. Tree growth was highest in the youngest plots and declined through succession. Interestingly, symbiotic nitrogen fixation was negatively correlated with the basal area of nitrogen-fixing trees across our study plots, highlighting the danger in using nitrogen-fixing trees as a proxy for rates of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Our results demonstrate that the nitrogen cycle has largely recuperated by 19 yr following disturbance, allowing for rapid biomass regeneration at our site. This work provides important insight into the sources and dynamics of nitrogen that support growth and carbon capture in regenerating Neotropical forests.

Asynchrony in individual and subpopulation fecundity stabilizes reproductive output of an alpine plant population	ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate; environmental variation; intraspecific trait variation; portfolio effect; Silene acaulis; synchrony	HETEROGENEITY; DIVERSITY; VIABILITY; STOCHASTICITY; PERFORMANCE; PERSISTENCE; REDUCTION; DYNAMICS	Population-wide outcomes such as abundance, reproductive output, or mean survival can be stabilized by non-synchronous variation in the performance of individuals or subpopulations. Such "portfolio effects" have been increasingly documented at the scale of subpopulations and are thought to play an important role in generating stability of population phenomena in the face of environmental variation. However, few studies quantify the strength and origin of portfolio effects at the finer scale of individuals. We used 16 yr of fruit production and climate data for an alpine plant to dissect the scale of portfolio effects in reproduction, as well as the contribution of individual traits including size and flowering time in driving reproductive output. Asynchrony in reproductive success substantially reduces variation in population-level reproductive output, with approximately one-fourth of this stabilizing effect arising from individual differences, mostly not those characterized by measured traits, and approximately three-fourths from asynchrony across subpopulations. These results emphasize the different scales and causes of portfolio effects. The decomposition for portfolio effects we provide can facilitate similar breakdowns of the strength and causes of these effects in other systems.

Whether this homogenization can erase latitudinal patterns of species diversity and composition has not been well studied. We examined this by comparing nematode and microbial communities in stands of native Phragmites australis and exotic Spartina alterniflora in coastal wetlands across 18 degrees of latitude in China. We found clear latitudinal clines in nematode diversity and functional composition, and in microbial composition, for soils collected from native P. australis. These latitudinal patterns were weak or absent for soils collected from nearby stands of the exotic S. alterniflora. Climatic and edaphic variables varied across latitude in similar ways in both community types. In P. australis there were strong correlations between community structure and environmental variables, whereas in S. alterniflora these correlations were weak. These results suggest that the invasion of S. alterniflora into the Chinese coastal wetlands has caused profound biotic homogenization of soil communities across latitude. We speculate that the variation in P. australis nematode and microbial communities across latitude is primarily driven by geographic variation in plant traits, but that such variation in plant traits is largely lacking for the recently introduced exotic S. alterniflora. These results indicate that widespread exotic species can homogenize nematode communities at large spatial scales.

An illustrative case is that of the flatworm Dendrocoelum italicum, the first survey of which was performed 79 years after its description. The survey revealed that the underground stream supplying water to the pool from which the species was first described had been diverted into a pipe for human use, thus severely reducing the available habitat for the species. Here we describe the results of what we believe is the first habitat restoration action performed in a cave habitat for the conservation of a flatworm. The water-diverting structure was removed, with the involvement of local protected area administrators, citizens and volunteers from local organizations. The intervention resulted in the restoration of a large, stable pool inside the cave, thus creating an optimal habitat for this threatened planarian, with increased availability of prey and a stable population.

The Crau steppe in southern France is a protected area that is traditionally grazed by sheep. The Critically Endangered Crau plain grasshopper Prionotropis rhodanica is endemic to the area and a flagship for the conservation of this unique ecosystem. Its population has declined significantly during the last 2 decades, but the reasons remain poorly understood. One potential factor is an altered habitat structure caused by changes in the grazing regime. We examined the microhabitat preferences of the species and compared the habitat structure of populated sites with those where the species is now extinct (former habitat). We found that populated sites had denser and higher vegetation, whereas former habitat had higher cover of stones and bare ground. Vegetation structure in the habitat of the smallest subpopulation was similar to areas of former habitat, suggesting a marginal habitat quality. Our results show that P. rhodanica requires 50-70% vegetation cover and suggest that grazing has contributed considerably to the population decline, but it remains unclear whether this is a direct effect of habitat degradation or an indirect effect by attracting predators associated with grazing activities. We recommend careful management of grazing to improve habitat quality, which would also benefit other invertebrates and insectivores. Continued monitoring is required to conserve habitat specialists in protected areas.

Caterpillar fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis, known as yartsagunbu in Tibet and in the literature on this subject, is a medicinal resource extracted by the mountain communities of the Himalaya. Studies of the contribution of the fungus to local livelihoods in the Indian Himalaya are scarce. We investigated trade and harvest and analysed the contribution of caterpillar fungus to household economies in 32 villages in Dhauliganga Valley, Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, in the Western Himalaya. Caterpillar fungus harvesting has become an integral part of local livelihoods in the study area, and on average contributes c. 74% of household cash income. The majority of harvesters perceived that harvesting had become more difficult during 2010-2015 as a result of competition and a decline in abundance of the species. The mean annual per capita harvest declined by 54 pieces during 2011-2015. Increasing harvesting and trade, coupled with the dependency of local communities on the fungus, may result in greater extraction of the resource for short-term economic benefits, and could eventually lead to depletion and ecological damage. Harvesting of the fungus has already created environmental, legal and social challenges, although it has become a lucrative livelihood opportunity. The ongoing decline of the fungus threatens local livelihoods. Good governance and livelihood security should be integrated with biodiversity conservation when devising government policies and plans for sustainable management of the caterpillar fungus.

The underlying factors driving this consumption are, however, relatively understudied, particularly among rural households, and improved understanding would facilitate the development of conservation strategies. We therefore aimed to identify the factors that influence bushmeat consumption in rural households to the west of Tai National Park, in Cote d'Ivoire. We carried out enquiries in a total of 144 rural households in 20 localities during July-December 2012. Bushmeat, the majority of which comprised rodents and bovids, accounted for 13% of the animal protein consumed in these households. This consumption was significantly higher in households in which poverty was more acute (low annual income and more dependent children). We found that repeated awareness campaigns involving theatre performances and/or film screenings (multimedia campaigns) contributed to a decrease in bushmeat consumption. This decrease exceeded 62% after exposure to four multimedia campaigns. We highlight the importance of awareness campaigns for reducing consumption of wild animals, and demonstrate the importance of recurring multimedia campaigns to maximize the impact of such conservation activities in rural communities.

Seabird mortality in the Namibian demersal longline fishery and recommendations for best practice mitigation measures	ORYX			English	Article						Albatross; bycatch; fisheries; mitigation; Namibia; procellariiform; seabirds; white-chinned petrel	WHITE-CHINNED PETRELS; PROCELLARIA-AEQUINOCTIALIS; ALBATROSS MORTALITY; DIOMEDEA-EXULANS; DIVING BEHAVIOR; BY-CATCH; BYCATCH; LINE; TRAWL; WATERS	Seabird bycatch is widely regarded as the greatest threat globally to procellariiform seabirds. Although measures to reduce seabird-fishery interactions have been in existence for many years, uptake in fleets with high risk profiles remains variable. We recorded seabird bycatch and other interactions in the Namibian demersal longline fishery. Interaction rates were estimated for seasonal and spatial strata and scaled up to fishing effort data. Bycatch rates were 0.77 (95% CI 0.24-1.39) and 0.37 (95% CI 0.11-0.72) birds per 1,000 hooks in winter and summer, respectively. Scaling up to 2010, the most recent year for which complete data are available, suggests 20,567 (95% CI 6,328-37,935) birds were killed in this fishery that year. We compared bycatch rates to those from experimental fishing sets using mitigation measures (one or two bird-scaring lines and the replacement of standard concrete weights with 5 kg steel weights). All mitigation measures significantly reduced the bycatch rate. This study confirms the Namibian longline fishery has some of the highest known impacts on seabirds globally, but implementing simple measures could rapidly reduce those impacts. In November 2015 the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources introduced regulations requiring the use of bird-scaring lines, line weighting and night setting in this fishery. A collaborative approach between NGOs, industry and government was important in achieving wide understanding and acceptance of the proposed mitigation measures in the lead up to the introduction of new fishery regulations.

Informing compensatory habitat creation with experimental trials: a 3-year study of a threatened amphibian	ORYX			English	Article						Amphibian; Anura; Australia; compensatory; evidence-based; habitat creation; Litoria aurea; management; offset	GOLDEN BELL FROG; LITORIA-AUREA; ENDANGERED GREEN; CONSERVATION; REINTRODUCTION; RESTORATION; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; LANDSCAPE; AUSTRALIA	The creation or restoration of habitat to mitigate biodiversity loss is a common conservation strategy. Evidence-based research via an extensively monitored trial study should be undertaken prior to large-scale implementation to predict success and identify potential limiting factors. We constructed an experimental trial habitat for the threatened green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea, in Australia, to inform a broader programme of compensatory habitat creation. Individuals were released into the trial plot and a nearby natural wetland for comparison to determine if the created habitat would support their growth, survival and persistence. Half of the trial waterbodies were enclosed within an exclusion fence to separate the effects of habitat suitability from ecological processes. We found the habitat provided L. aurea with sufficient resources to grow, survive and persist for 3 years. However, no breeding occurred, and further investigations need to focus on understanding the drivers of reproduction. Although a disease outbreak occurred during the study, persistence continued for the next 2 years. This was attributed to the large number of individuals released, a strategy we recommend for future mitigation strategies to account for low survival and high turnover rates. Dispersal probably affected abundance in the unfenced areas, and landscape-level initiatives are suggested for this species. This study demonstrates that experimental trials are valuable, as they can inform future habitat management by identifying limitations that could hinder success prior to the implementation of large-scale initiatives.

We assessed trends in brown bear habitat use in the Pyrenees and investigated the underlying environmental and anthropogenic drivers. Using detection/non-detection data collected during 2008-2014 through non-invasive methods, we developed dynamic occupancy models, accounting for local colonization and extinction processes. We found two non-connected core areas of occupancy, one in the west and the other in the centre of the Pyrenees, with a significant decrease in habitat use overall during 2008-2014. We also found a negative correlation between human density and bear occupancy, in agreement with previous studies on brown bear habitat suitability. Our results confirm the Critically Endangered status of the Pyrenean population of brown bears.

We examined each individual's use of space and social interactions during the first year after their release. Lynxes were selected for reintroduction according to behavioural, genetic and health criteria and fitted with collars with VHF and global positioning systems. Both males and females went through an exploratory phase that lasted 65-105 days. The lynxes did not exhibit any movement directionality from the release site during the exploratory period. During August-December 2015 a stable nucleus comprising seven individuals (four males, three females) was established south-west of the release enclosure. Although the males had a slightly larger mean home range (11.18 +/- SE 1.36 km(2)) than females (9.87 +/- SE 8.71 km(2)), the difference was not significant. The knowledge obtained during the first year of the lynx reintroduction project in Portugal is critical to support the future of this reintroduction strategy. Our results suggest that once the soft release technique is no longer possible because of logistical constraints on the construction of more enclosures, new individuals should be released in unoccupied areas surrounded by occupied territories. This will promote strong social ties to the resident population and prevent lynx dispersal.

Understanding whether some individuals in a population are more likely to forage on crops, and the temporal patterns of elephant visits to farms, is key to mitigating the negative impacts of elephants on farmers' livelihoods. We used camera traps to study the crop foraging behaviour of African elephants Loxodonta africana in farmland adjacent to the Udzungwa Mountains National Park in southern Tanzania during October 2010-August 2014. Camera traps placed on elephant trails into farmland detected elephants on 336 occasions during the study period. We identified individual elephants for 126 camera-trap detections. All were independent males, and we identified 48 unique bulls aged 10-29 years. Two-thirds of the bulls identified were detected only once by camera traps during the study period. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that found that adult males are more likely to adopt high-risk feeding behaviours such as crop foraging, although young males dispersing from maternal family units also consume crops in Udzungwa. We found a large number of occasional crop-users (32 of the 48 bulls identified) and a smaller number of repeat crop-users (16 of 48), suggesting that lethal control of crop-using elephants is unlikely to be an effective long-term strategy for reducing crop losses to elephants.

Location Easter Island, Pacific Ocean. Methods Samples of ten species were used: six small-range species endemic to Rapa Nui and Motu Motiro Hiva (Salas y Gomez) (i.e. small-range endemic species) and four large-range species endemic to the southern subtropical Pacific (i.e. large-range endemic species). We present phylogenetic reconstruction results based on mitochondrial (1 to 5) and nuclear (1 to 6) loci to place these endemic species in their respective family phylogenies (8). Using these newly calibrated phylogenetic trees, information of species distributions and geological data, we inferred the divergence times from the closest relatives of these ten endemic fishes, compared biogeographical history estimation models to reconstruct their ancestral geographic ranges, colonization routes and underlying mechanisms of speciation. Results The divergence times (i.e. divergence times from the closest relatives) of all of the small-range endemics studied were more recent than the age of Rapa Nui and Motu Motiro Hiva; thus, these species can be considered as neoendemics. Biogeographical history estimation models indicated that speciation following a founder-event is the most likely scenario. In contrast, the divergence estimates of the large-range endemic species were highly variable. This being said, the divergence times of all species were more recent than the age of the oldest islands within their distributions. Main conclusions Taken together, these results demonstrate that Rapa Nui acts as a cradle of coral reef biodiversity, being responsible for the emergence of small-range endemic fish species, but also a route of dispersion for several large-range endemics and as a stepping stone in the diversification of the Myripristis and Pseudolabrus genera. While no common divergence time was recovered for all of the ten endemic species studied here, the common mechanism of speciation following a founder event was recovered for most of the small-range endemic species.

Location France and the United States. Time period 1993-2011. Major taxa studied Freshwater stream diatoms. Methods beta-diversity along a nutrient enrichment gradient was examined across multiple spatial scales. beta-diversity was estimated using multi-site Sorensen dissimilarity. We assessed the relative importance of specialists versus generalists using Friedley coefficient, and the contribution of local community assembly versus gamma-diversity to beta-diversity across spatial scales, with a null model. Finally, we estimated the response of beta-diversity to environmental and spatial factors by testing the correlations between community, environmental and geographical distance matrices with partial Mantel tests. Results beta-diversity generally increased with spatial scale but the rate of increase depended on nutrient enrichment level. beta-diversity decreased significantly with increasing nutrient enrichment level due to the loss of specialist species. Local assembly was an important driver of beta-diversity especially under low nutrient enrichment. Significant partial Mantel correlations were observed between diatom beta-diversity and pure environmental distances under these conditions, highlighting the role of species sorting in local assembly processes. Conversely, in heavily enriched sites, only spatial distances were significantly correlated with beta-diversity, which indicated a substantial role of dispersal processes. Main conclusions Nutrient concentration mediated the expected increase in beta-diversity with spatial scales. Across spatial scales, beta-diversity was more influenced by local assembly processes rather than by gamma-diversity. Nutrient enrichment was associated with an overall decline in diatom beta-diversity and a shift in assembly processes from species sorting to dispersal, notably due to the elimination of some specialists and their subsequent replacement by generalists.

The existence of a fire-mediated tree-recruitment bottleneck in an Asian savanna	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						deciduous dipterocarp forest; fire; mesic savanna; resprouting; seedling growth; seedling mortality; tree demography; tropical dry forest; YokDon National Park	TROPICAL FOREST; DYNAMICS; REGENERATION; COEXISTENCE; PATTERNS; TOPKILL; CLIMATE	Aim A considerable proportion of the global savanna biome has been mis-classified as forest, especially in Asia. However, the structure and responses of dominant tree species to fire can help to clarify this ambiguity. Here, we examine demographic structure and fire responses of four dominant tree species in a deciduous dipterocarp forest (DDF) of the continental Southeast Asia. We examine whether fire creates a tree-recruitment bottleneck in the DDF, as in savannas on other continents. Location YokDon National Park, Vietnam. Taxon Dipterocarpus tuberculatus Roxb.; Dipterocarpus obtusifolius Teysm. ex Miq.; Shorea obtusa Wall. ex Blume; Shorea siamensis (Kurz) Miq. Methods We measured the size of all 8,288 individuals of the four dominant dipterocarp species in 12 pair study sites. We then applied fire treatments (burnt or unburnt) to the plots and monitored the survival and growth of juveniles five times over the subsequent growing season. Results All four species showed clear indications of a recruitment bottleneck at the sapling stage. Almost all juveniles in the burnt plots suffered aboveground mortality, but 64% resprouted by the end of the following growing season. Compared to large juveniles, small juveniles had a significantly higher probability of aboveground mortality and a more limited ability to resprout. Within 3 months of fire, 43%-93% of individuals had resprouted, and they had recovered 67%-95% of their pre-fire basal diameter and 43%-94% of their pre-fire height. At the end of the post-fire growing season, burnt juveniles experienced virtually no net increase in size; however, juveniles in unburnt plots attained up to 150% of their pre-fire size. Main conclusions The four dominant tree species of the DDF show remarkable similarities in the demographic structures and fire-responses with savanna tree species on other continents. Our results are consistent with the notion that the DDF is functionally similar to savannas on other continents. Fire appears to act as potent environmental filter of tree species composition in the DDF.

As such, genetic variation may reflect properties of the specific biomes species inhabit, or shared life history traits among species may result in similar genetic structure. We evaluated these hypotheses jointly by quantifying the similarity of genetic structure in three South American marsh rat species (Holochilus), and test how genetic variation in each species relates to biome-specific environmental space and historical stability. Location South America. Taxon Rodentia. Methods Using complementary analyses (Mantel tests, dbRDA, Procrustes, covariance structure of allele frequencies and environmental niche models [ENMs]) with 8,000-32,000 SNPs per species, we quantified the association between genomic variation and geographic and/or environmental differences. Results Significant association between genetic variation and geography was identified for all species. Similarity in the strength of the association suggests connectivity patterns dictated by shared species-traits predominate at the biome scale. However, substantial amounts of genetic variation are not explained by geography. Focusing on this portion of the variance, we demonstrate a significant quantitative association between genetic variation and the environmental space of a biome, and a qualitative association with varying regional stability. Specifically, historically stable areas estimated from ecological niche models are correlated with local levels of geographic structuring, suggesting that local biome-specific histories affect population isolation/connectivity. Main conclusions These tests show that although species exhibit similar patterns of genetic variation that are consistent with shared natural histories, irrespective of inhabiting different wetland biomes, local biome-specific properties (i.e. varying environmental conditions and historical stability) contribute to departures from equilibrium patterns of genetic variation expected by isolation by geographic distance. The reflection of these biome-specific properties in the genetic structure of the marsh rats provides a window into the differences among South American wetlands with evolutionary consequences for their respective constituent assemblages.

In populations of a specialized alpine species, we explore the role of geography and climate in the divergence of genetic, morphological and acoustic characters, and analyse the functional consequences of variation on mate choice. Taxon Chorthippus cazurroi (Orthoptera: Caelifera, Acrididae, Gomphocerinae). Location The entire distribution of the species (23 populations from six massifs of the Cantabrian Mountains, NW Spain). Methods First, we analysed the extent of intraspecific spatial divergence and the covariation among climatic niche, genetic (mtDNA), acoustic (song structure) and morphological (body size) traits. Then, we analysed the consequences of phenotypic variation by means of a crossing experiment among populations from different elevations. This served to test for differences in sexual selection among body size-divergent populations and for the relationship between male traits, female preference and reproduction. Results Genetic, morphologic and acoustic divergence increased with geographic distance. Female morphology was also affected by climate variation, while male one tightly covaried with the song differentiation. Females more closely approached males investing more time in song activities, but weakly responded to the rest of acoustic features and morphological variation. They also distanced themselves slightly more from males from different populations, although this behaviour did not lead to clear differences in reproductive parameters. Main conclusions The process of colonization of mountain massifs has led to significant genetic and phenotypic changes in C. cazurroi. Phenotypic divergence does not constitute a strong intrinsic barrier to reproduction and is largely unpaired from female preference, overall suggesting that sexual selection is a minor actor in the process of differentiation as compared, for instance, to drift. This does not exclude that traits associated with individual condition are under strong selection and, therefore, do not vary so extensively. This study dismisses the idea that alpine specialists with narrow distributions lack genetic and phenotypic variability, and highlights the importance of synthesizing biogeographic and experimental approaches to obtain stronger and deeper inferences about the dynamics and mechanisms of biological differentiation.

In this study, we examined three ecological processes (environmental and biotic filtering, and dispersal limitation) hypothesized to drive community assembly in the island biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia, and whether the relative importance of these processes changes along environmental gradients. Methods First, we assessed environmental filtering by stacking binary presence/absence species distribution models generated for 678 tree species from c. 40,000 occurrences. Second, we acknowledged the influence of dispersal limitation by applying a buffer around each occurrence. Third, we modelled a local hierarchy of performances by ranking species in decreasing order of their predicted habitat suitability, up to the predicted local species richness. Predictions of stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) accounting for different combinations of the filtering processes were compared with the composition of 12 forest plots. Results The three filters appear to be important driving forces. Accounting for environmental filtering provided fairly accurate assemblage predictions but species richness was overestimated. Considering dispersal limitation increased assemblage specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences) while considering differences in local performances increased assemblage sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences). The predictive ability of all S-SDMs decreased with elevation, which suggests that unpredictable stochastic processes influenced biodiversity dynamics in more productive mountain habitats. Main conclusions New Caledonian tree communities appear to be similar to those of other tropical regions in their structuring processes (important role of dispersal and biotic filtering, increasing role of neutral processes with productivity). Our findings stress the potential of using S-SDMs to understand and predict current and future biodiversity patterns.

Here we investigated the fungal and bacterial community composition in nest-carton and adjoining soil of L. fuliginosus. We found that fungal communities in the nest were stable and distinct from surrounding soil over 2 y, while bacterial communities were not stable with the differentiation between nest and surrounding soil changing over the years. This suggests that in contrast to bacterial communities, fungal communities in the nest are actively managed by the ant L fuliginosus, a result that was corroborated by additional growth assays. In these assays we found that an antagonistic fungus was inhibited when incubated with extracts of ant body parts, while fungal associates were not only not affected but even partly favoured in their growth. Overall our results support a role of host secretions in shaping the association between L fuliginosus and fungal partners. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

Selection of specific symbionts may be explained by the provisioning of specific, optimal cultivar growth substrates by termite farmers. We tested whether differences in in vitro performance of Termitomyces cultivars from nests of three termite species on various substrates are correlated with the interaction specificity of their hosts. We performed single-factor growth assays (varying carbon sources), and a two-factor geometric framework experiment (simultaneously varying carbohydrate and protein availability). Although we did not find qualitative differences between Termitomyces strains in carbon-source use, there were quantitative differences, which we analysed using principal component analysis. This showed that growth of Termitomyces on different carbon sources was correlated with termite host genus, rather than host species, while growth on different ratios and concentrations of protein and carbohydrate was correlated with termite host species. Our findings corroborate the interaction specificity between fungus-growing termites and Termitomyces cultivars and indicate that specificity between termite hosts and fungi is reflected both nutritionally and physiologically. However, it remains to be demonstrated whether those differences contribute to selection of specific fungal cultivars by termites at the onset of colony foundation. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Considering the biogeochemical importance of ammonia oxidation in bioaugmented zero water exchange aquaculture systems, the diversity and abundance of bacterial and archaeal ammonia-oxidizing communities were analyzed in three selected ponds at different time intervals during the culture period, to unravel the key environmental factors influencing their distribution in the system. Materials and methods The diversity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in three tropical bioaugmented zero water exchange (ZWE) shrimp culture systems were analyzed using ammonia monooxygenase A (amoA) gene from the sediment metagenome during different phases of culture. The environmental factors associated with the variability in bacterial and archaeal amoA gene abundance and diversity were elucidated using RDA and Pearson correlation analysis. Results and discussion Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), Nitrosopumilus sp., Nitrosospharea sp., and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), Nitrosomonas sp., were the dominant ammonia-oxidizing communities in the ZWE ponds studied. AOA shared 41 OTUs, and the maximum distribution was influenced by dissolved oxygen in the system, whereas AOB shared 4 OTUs. The copy numbers amoA gene determined using qPCR showed that the AOA amoA gene was 10- to 100-fold abundant than AOB amoA gene. Gene abundance of AOA was positively related to total organic carbon (TOC) and salinity of sediments, and the temperature had a negative impact on bacterial amoA gene abundance. The dissolved oxygen and TOC had a negative and redox potential a positive impact on the diversity of AOA, whereas pH had a negative impact on the diversity of AOB. Conclusions The ammonia-oxidizing archaeal communities dominated the bioaugmented zero water exchange aquaculture systems compared to bacteria based on the abundance and diversity analysis using amoA gene sequence-based OTU analysis and gene copy numbers. Dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, and Eh of the sediments contributed to the distribution and abundance of AOA group in the ZWE ponds. This study points to the importance of environmental management in these culture systems for maintaining ammonia-oxidizing populations for optimal ammonia removal. The relative contribution of the archaea and bacteria to ammonia oxidation in these systems is to be further resolved along with that of anammox and comammox bacteria, which would help to develop appropriate biostimulation or bioaugmentation strategies for the management of these sustainable aquaculture production systems.

Quantifying irrigation adaptation strategies in response to stakeholder-driven groundwater management in the US High Plains Aquifer	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						water management; irrigation; agriculture; farmer adaptation; groundwater sustainability; High Plains Aquifer; Ogallala Aquifer	WATER; FUTURE; AGRICULTURE; IMPACT; SUSTAINABILITY; INSIGHTS	Irrigation enhances agricultural yields and stabilizes farmer incomes, but overexploitation has depleted groundwater resources around the globe. Strategies to address this sustainability challenge differ widely. Socio-ecological systems research suggests that management of common pool resources like groundwater would benefit from localized approaches that combine self-organization along with active monitoring. In 2012, the US state of Kansas established a Local Enhanced Management Area (LEMA) program, empowering farmers to work with local and state officials to develop five-year, enforceable groundwater conservation programs. Here, we assessed the efficacy of the firstLEMA implemented from 2013 to 2017 using a causal impact methodology based on Bayesian structural time series that is new to agrohydrology. Compared to control scenarios, we found that the LEMAreduced water use by 31% over the five-year period, with early indications of stabilizing groundwater levels. Three main conservation strategies can lead to reduced water use: (1) reducing irrigated area, (2) reducing irrigation amount applied to existing crops through improved efficiency, and/or (3) switching to crops that require less water. To partition water savings among these strategies, we combined satellite-derived irrigated areas and crop type maps with well records. Wefound that farmers were able to largely maintain irrigated area and achieved the majority of pumping reductions (72%) from improvements in irrigation efficiency, followed by expansion of crops with lower water demand (19%). The results of this analysis demonstrate that conservation programs that are irrigatordriven with regulatory oversight can provide a path toward sustainability in stressed aquifers.

In Nebraska, these species have been expanding into the native Populus deltoides riparian forests along the Republican River. Using dendrochronological data and stable isotope ratios, we examined the annual growth and acclimation strategies of these three species to climatic and streamflow variability. We hypothesized that the ability of invasive species to grow under a wide range of environmental conditions favour vegetation shifts at the expense of native species. Streamflow was the strongest predictor for performance. When accompanied with above-average annual precipitation, streamflow resulted in peak tree-ring widths in P. deltoides. J. virginiana showed less sensitivity, and E. angustifolia showed no response. delta O-18 values did not differ among species, which indicates that all species compete for the same water source. delta C-13 ratios and WUEi were higher in J. virginiana than in P. deltoides and E. angustifolia and increased in all species over time. E. angustifolia and P. deltoides exhibit a strong stomatal control and response to relative humidity relative to J. virginiana, which showed anisohydric stomatal behaviour. Our results show that once established, J. virginiana and E. angustifolia thrive in the understory of P. deltoides using different adaptive and acclimation strategies. Based on current water flow management, which prevents high-flood pulses through the riparian zone, these species will continue to establish and spread throughout the Republican River watershed.

Recent approaches have focused on filtering occurrences in overrepresented regions based on geographic or environmental proximity. We tested the efficacy of filtering in geographic and environmental space using occurrence data from four species. Our evaluation strategies examined 14 distance measures in geographic and environmental spaces and eight combinations of environmental variables and their ordinations. This resulted in 78 datasets for each species, which we evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), the difference between training and testing AUC, omission rate, the true skill statistic, and Schoener's D to examine the effects of different filtering schemes. The degree of change produced by filtering on predicted suitability and evaluation statistics increased with increasing range size. Environmental filtering resulted in higher model fit at larger extents and retained more occurrences than geographic filtering. Our results indicate that models should be evaluated using multiple evaluation statistics at multiple thresholds. The use of bin sizes when filtering in environmental space allows for simple comparison between species and filter types and makes for an easily reportable and repeatable distance metric. We specifically recommend that ecological niche models using natural history collection data filter in environmental space with variables derived from permutation importance or the first few axes of a principal components ordination.

Spatial models of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur stable isotope distributions (isoscapes) across a shelf sea: An INLA approach	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Bayesian spatial modelling; carbon; isoscape; jellyfish; nitrogen; stable isotopes; sulphur; UK shelf seas	MARINE; DELTA-C-13; RATIOS; FIXATION; HYDROGEN; ORIGINS; AREAS; CO2	Spatial models of variation in the isotopic composition of structural nutrients across habitats (isoscapes) offer information on physical, biogeochemical and anthropogenic processes occurring across space, and provide a tool for retrospective assignment of animals or animal products to their foraging area or geographic origin. The isotopic differences among reference samples used to construct isoscapes may vary spatially and according to non-spatial terms (e.g. sampling date, or among individual or species effects). Partitioning variance between spatially dependent and spatially independent terms is a critical but overlooked aspect of isoscape creation with important consequences for the design of studies collecting reference data for isoscape creation and the accuracy and precision of isoscape models. We introduce the use of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to construct isoscape models. Integrated nested Laplace approximation provides a computationally efficient framework to construct spatial models of isotopic variability explicitly addressing additional variation introduced by including multiple reference species (or other recognized sources of variance). We present carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isoscape models extending over c. 1 million km(2) of the UK shelf seas. Models were built using seven different species of jellyfish as spatial reference data and a suite of environmental correlates. Compared to alternative isoscape prediction methods, INLA-spatial isotope models show high spatial precision and reduced variance. We briefly discuss the likely biogeochemical explanations for the observed spatial isotope distributions. We show for the first time that sulphur isotopes display systematic spatial variation across open marine shelf seas and may therefore be a useful additional tool for marine spatial ecology. The INLA technique provides a promising tool for generating isoscape models and associated uncertainty surfaces where reference data are accompanied by multiple, quantifiable sources of uncertainty.

However, recent studies demonstrated that the presence of spatial autocorrelation in both distance matrices induced inflations of parameter estimates and type I error rates. These results also hold for partial Mantel test which is supposed to control for the spatial structures. To address the issue of spatial autocorrelation in testing the Mantel statistic, we developed a new procedure based on spatially constrained randomizations using Moran spectral randomization. A simulation study was conducted to assess the performance of this new procedure. Different scenarios were considered by manipulating the number of variables, the number of samples, the regularity of the sampling design and the level of spatial autocorrelation. As identified by previous studies, we found that Mantel statistic and its associated type I error rate are inflated in simple and partial Mantel tests when both distances matrices are spatially structured. We showed that these biases increased with the number of variables, decreased with the number of samples and were slightly lower for regular than irregular sampling. The new procedure succeeded in correcting the spurious inflations of the parameter estimates and type I error rates in any of the presented scenarios. Our results suggest that studies from several fields (e.g. genetic or community ecology) could have been overestimating the relationship between two distances matrices when both presented spatial autocorrelation. We proposed an alternative solution applicable in every field to correctly compute Mantel statistic with a fair type I error rate.

METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						borrowing of strength; effective number of parameters; family-wise error; hierarchical model; imbalance; partial pooling; type I error	FUTURE	Ecologists increasingly use hierarchical Bayesian (HB) models to estimate group-level parameters that vary by, for example, species, treatment level, habitat type or other factors. Group-level parameters may be compared to infer differences among levels. We would conclude a non-zero pairwise difference, separately, for each pair in the group, when the respective 95% credible interval excludes zero. Classical procedures suggest that the rejection procedure should be adjusted to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) for a family of differences. Adjustments for FWER have been considered unnecessary in HB models due to partial pooling whereby increased pooling strength - group-level parameters become more alike - could lead to decreased rejection rates (Type I error, FWER, or Power) and increased false acceptance rates (Type 2 error and its family-wise analogue). To address this, we conducted a simulation experiment with factors of sample size, group size, balance (missingness), overall mean and ratio of within- to between-group variances, resulting in 2016 factor-level combinations ('scenarios'), replicated 100 times, producing 201,600 pseudo datasets analysed in a Bayesian framework. We evaluated the results in the context of a new partial pooling index (PPI), which we show is also applicable to more complex model structures based on four real-data examples. Simulation results confirm intuition that rejection rates (false and true) decrease and false acceptance rates increase with increasing PPI or pooling strength (scenario-level R-2 = 0.81-0.97). The relationship with PPI differed greatly for balanced versus unbalanced designs and was affected by group size, especially for family-wise errors. Critically, an HB model does not guarantee that the FWER will follow a set significance level (alpha); for example, even minor imbalance can lead to FWER > alpha for weak to moderate pooling. These results are confirmed by the real-data examples, suggesting that ecologists need to consider FWER when applying HB models, especially for large group sizes or incomplete datasets. Contrary to current thought, HB models are not immune to issues of multiplicity, and our proposed PPI offers a method for evaluating if a particular HB analysis is likely to produce FWER <= alpha (no adjustment or alternative solution required).

The variable quality of these models makes it critical to assess whether a model's outputs are suitable for the intended use, but commonly used evaluation approaches are inappropriate for many ecological contexts. In particular, unrealistically high performance assessments have been associated with models for rare species and predictions over large geographic extents. We evaluated the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) as a performance metric for rare binary events, focusing on the assessment of species distribution models. Precision is the probability that a species is present given a predicted presence, while recall (more commonly called sensitivity) is the probability the model predicts presence in locations where the species has been observed. We simulated species at three levels of prevalence, compared AUC-PR and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) when the geographic extent of predictions was increased and assessed how well each metric reflected a model's utility to guide surveys for new populations. AUC-PR was robust to species rarity and, unlike AUC-ROC, not affected by an increasing geographic extent. The major advantages of AUC-PR arise because it does not incorporate correctly predicted absences and is therefore less prone to exaggerate model performance for unbalanced datasets. AUC-PR and precision were useful indicators of a model's utility for guiding surveys. We show that AUC-PR has important advantages for evaluating models of rare species, and its benefits in the context of unbalanced binary responses will make it applicable for other ecological studies. By not considering the true negative quadrant of the confusion matrix, AUC-PR ameliorates issues that arise when the geographic extent is increased beyond the species' range or when a large number of background points are used when absence information is unavailable. However, no single metric captures all aspects of performance nor provides an absolute index that can be compared across datasets. Our results indicate AUC-PR and precision can provide useful and intuitive metrics for evaluating a model's utility for guiding sampling, and can complement other metrics to help delineate a model's appropriate use.

A plethora of assessment protocols have been developed to evaluate the current and potential impacts of non-native species, but consistency among them has received limited attention. To estimate the consistency across impact assessment protocols, 89 specialists in biological invasions used 11 protocols to screen 57 NNS (2614 assessments). We tested if the consistency in the impact scoring across assessors, quantified as the coefficient of variation (CV), was dependent on the characteristics of the protocol, the taxonomic group and the expertise of the assessor. Mean CV across assessors was 40%, with a maximum of 223%. CV was lower for protocols with a low number of score levels, which demanded high levels of expertise, and when the assessors had greater expertise on the assessed species. The similarity among protocols with respect to the final scores was higher when the protocols considered the same impact types. We conclude that all protocols led to considerable inconsistency among assessors. In order to improve consistency, we highlight the importance of selecting assessors with high expertise, providing clear guidelines and adequate training but also deriving final decisions collaboratively by consensus.

Vegetation changes over large areas are traditionally monitored by linking plot-scale measurements to satellite data. However, integrating field and satellite data is not straightforward. Typically, the satellite data are at a much coarser scale in comparison to field measurements. Here, we studied how Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) can be used to bridge this gap. We covered three 250 m x 250 m sites in Fennoscandian tundra with varying productivity ana FCover, ranging from barren vegetation to shrub tundra. The UAS sites were then used to train satellite data-based FCover models. First, we created a binary vegetation classification (absent, present) by using UAS-derived RGB-orthomosaics and logistic regression. Secondly, we used the classification to calculate FCover to Planet CubeSat (3 m), Sentinel-2A MSI (10 m, 20 m), and Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) grids, and examined how well FCover is explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VI) derived from satellite data. The overall classification accuracies for the UAS sites were >= 90%. The UAS-FCover were strongly related to the tested VIs (D-2 89% at best). The explained deviance was generally higher for coarser resolution data, indicating that the effect of data resolution should be taken into account when comparing results from different sensors. VIs based on red-edge (at 740 nm, 783 nm), or near-infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) had the highest performance. We recommend wider inspection of red-edge and SWIR bands for future Arctic vegetation research. Our results demonstrate that UASs can be used for observing FCover at multiple scales. Individual UAS sites can serve as focus areas, which provide information at the finest resolution (e.g. individual plants), whereas a sample of several UAS sites can be used to train satellite data and examine vegetation over larger extents.

Although this resolution mismatch may cause bias and increase in prediction error, it has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to clarify the meaning of resolution dependence in ABA, and to further identify its causal factors and quantify their effects. In general, a number of factors contribute to resolution dependence in ABA forest inventories, including the varying point density of the ALS data, the type of response variable, how the predictor variables are computed, and the properties of the prediction model. For quantification, we used field plots with mapped tree locations, which enabled the generation of different sized sample plots inside a larger plot. Plot level above ground biomass (AGB) was the response variable employed in all the models. The error rate seemed to increase when the prediction plots were larger than the fitting plots, and vice versa. The maximum BIAS was 1.50% and the maximum change of RMSE compared to its value in native resolution was 0.97% when there was a 4-fold difference in resolution. This indicates that the resolution effect is small in most real-world use cases, however, resolution effect should be carefully considered in ALS-assisted large area inventories that target unbiased estimates of forest parameters.

Identifying historic river ice breakup timing using MODIS and Google Earth Engine in support of operational flood monitoring in Northern Ontario	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Hydrology; First Nations; Optical remote sensing; Operational monitoring; Far North Ontario; James Bay; Hudson Bay; Cold regions; Cryosphere; Flood risk; Emergency management; Large rivers; Near real-time; Cloud computing	TEMPORAL PATTERNS; MACKENZIE RIVER; DYNAMICS; WATER	River ice breakup and resulting flood risk is a nearly annual concern for communities along the five major rivers draining to the James and Hudson Bay Coasts in Ontario (Moose, Albany, Attawapiskat, Winisk and Severn Rivers). Ice breakup within this region has historically been monitored using flight reconnaissance supplemented by assessment of hydrometric data. More recently, remote sensed imagery have been used to monitor near real-time ice breakup and flood risk. However, the near real-time remotely sensed breakup information was found to have limited utility in the absence of a broader spatial and temporal understanding of breakup progression. The primary purpose of this study was to develop a method for generating a dataset of breakup dates. A secondary objective was to calculate statistics from this dataset that can be used to provide context to operational near real-time imagery analysis and improve understanding of ice processes in the study area. An automated method for detecting river ice breakup dates from 2000 to 2017 using MODIS imagery was developed. This method uses a threshold-based technique that aims to maximize river coverage and minimize effects of cloud obstruction. Image processing was completed in the high-performance Google Earth Engine application which enabled iterative classification and model calibration. The breakup date dataset was used to calculate statistics on breakup timing, duration, annual variability and breakup order. An assessment of patterns within these data is discussed, relationships between breakup timing, duration and highwater years is explored and the operational utility of these statistics is described. The classification compared well with Water Survey of Canada derived breakup dates with mean bias ranging from -2.0 days to 6.7 days and mean absolute error of 3.4 days to 6.9 days across the rivers. Latitude and distance upstream were found to be primary controls on breakup timing with drainage network configuration and reach morphology also having an influence. No relationships between highwater years and calculated breakup statistics were found. It is recommended that future studies use the dataset developed in this study in combination with hydrometric and remotely sensed data to improve prediction of highwater and understanding of breakup processes within these rivers.

Females may adjust their propensity for remating based on the amount of provided sperm to ensure a sufficient sperm supply, and males may determine sperm allocation based on female availability and female mating frequency. In this study, I investigated male and female mating behaviors in the parasitoid wasp Anisopteromalus calandrae. The wasp exhibits the haplo-diploid sex determination, in which sperm-depleted females are constrained to produce only sons by laying unfertilized eggs. The first experiment showed that a rapid succession of male mating decreased the production of daughters (fertilized eggs) by the inseminated females, suggesting that sperm-limited males provided an insufficient amount of sperm to the females. Although the males appeared to replenish their sperm store after 6h, they mated upon encountering females despite their sperm shortage. The second experiment showed that copulation reduced the subsequent mating receptivity of the inseminated females irrespective of whether the females received a sufficient amount of sperm. Moreover, although approximately 26% of females accepted a second mating and recovered a certain degree of daughter production, remating was independent of the mating status of their first mating partner or the social environment. These results suggest that sperm-limited males may benefit from continuing to mate because their copulation prevents competing males from reproducing with their mates. Females incur a cost from not remating depending on the amount of sperm provided, which may result from weak environmental selection pressure or manipulation by the initial mate.Significance statementMale and female mating strategies are likely to evolve interdependently. Specifically, in species that produce limited numbers of sperm, the mating behavior of males and females is likely to be influenced by sperm transfer. The results of the present study suggest that males of the parasitoid wasp Anisopteromalus calandrae can replenish their sperm stores over time. However, sperm-limited males that encounter a potential mating partner mate rather than wait for sperm recovery. Females do not discriminate the male state before copulation, and those that mate with sperm-limited males suffer from sperm shortage. Although females can augment their sperm supply by remating, only a portion of females do so, regardless of sperm supply. The lack of a female facultative response suggests weak environmental selection on the species or the existence of sexual conflict over sperm transfer.

This study examines the effects of a deciduous tree species (Tilia x europaea L) on surface temperature over different ground materials and in turn on human thermal comfort, with a particular focus on tree shade variation due to leaf fall. Grass, asphalt, and gravel-covered ground surfaces, both sun-exposed and under the Tilia, were monitored in Florence, Italy, during the summer (2014) and autumn (2017) seasons. The Index of Thermal Stress (ITS) was used to gauge the micrometeorological effects of the changing tree canopy, with tree defoliation quantified by the Plant Area Index. On clear summer days, thermal discomfort was especially pronounced over exposed asphalt, and even more intense above exposed gravel due to its higher reflectivitywhile shaded surfaces showed large reductions in thermal stress. Even though incoming solar radiation decreases over the course of the fall season, the direct radiation under the gradually defoliating tree canopy actually increases. Due to this diminished shading effect, the differences in surface temperature between exposed and shaded asphalt shrink dramatically from about 20 to 3 degrees C. However, since ambient conditions become milder as the season progresses, the Tilia demonstrated a double benefit in terms of ITS: providing thermal comfort under its full canopy at the beginning of autumn and maintaining comfort even as its canopy thins out. At the same time, tree species with earlier defoliation may be unable to replicate such benefits.

Spring- and fall-flowering species show diverging phenological responses to climate in the Southeast USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Phenology; Flowering; Climate change; Phenological asynchrony; Autumn; Biodiversity hotspot	PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; HERBARIUM SPECIMENS; LONG-TERM; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; TEMPERATURE; SHIFTS; RECORDS; SEASON; TIMES; PHOTOGRAPHS	Plant phenological shifts (e.g., earlier flowering dates) are known consequences of climate change that may alter ecosystem functioning, productivity, and ecological interactions across trophic levels. Temperate, subalpine, and alpine regions have largely experienced advancement of spring phenology with climate warming, but the effects of climate change in warm, humid regions and on autumn phenology are less well understood. In this study, nearly 10,000 digitized herbarium specimen records were used to examine the phenological sensitivities of fall- and spring-flowering asteraceous plants to temperature and precipitation in the US Southeastern Coastal Plain. Climate data reveal warming trends in this already warm climate, and spring- and fall-flowering species responded differently to this change. Spring-flowering species flowered earlier at a rate of 1.8-2.3days per 1 degrees C increase in spring temperature, showing remarkable congruence with studies of northern temperate species. Fall-flowering species flowered slightly earlier with warmer spring temperatures, but flowering was significantly later with warmer summer temperatures at a rate of 0.8-1.2days per 1 degrees C. Spring-flowering species exhibited slightly later flowering times with increased spring precipitation. Fall phenology was less clearly influenced by precipitation. These results suggest that even warm, humid regions may experience phenological shifts and thus be susceptible to potentially detrimental effects such as plant-pollinator asynchrony.

Planting in autumn and winter and using precipitation can help cope with the problem. But in the semi-arid areas with cold winter, frost is another limited factor affecting crop production. For this purpose, in the present study, a simple and universal crop growth simulator (SUCROS) model was used to estimate the potential yield of sugar beets and frost damage from 1993 to 2009 for four autumn sowing dates (2 October, 17 October, 1 November, and 16 November) and two spring dates (6 March and 6 May) in eight locations (Birjand, Bojnord, Ghaen, Mashhad, Torbat-e Heydarieh, Neyshabor, Torbat-e Jam, and Ghochan) of the Khorasan province in northeastern Iran as a semi-arid and cold area. There was a large variability between locations and years in terms of frost damage. The crop failure from frost for the autumn sowing dates ranged from 62.5 to 100% at Neyshabor and Ghochan, respectively. Although autumn sowing dates performed better than spring sowing dates in terms of fresh storage organ yield (similar to 109.9tha(-1) vs. similar to 78.4tha(-1)), the risk of frost stress under autumn sowing dates was high at all studied locations. To maximize potential yield and minimize frost risk, sugar beet farmers under semi-arid and frost-prone conditions in the world such as Khorasan province should choose optimum sowing dates outside the high frost risk period to avoid crop damage. The last frost day under these areas normally happened between the 15th and 28th of February, after which no frost events occurred. Accordingly, it is recommended to farmers to sow sugar beet after the period during which no frost risk for sugar beet occurred.

Effect of temperature on nickel uptake and elimination in Daphnia magna	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Uptake; Elimination; Temperature; Nickel; Daphnia magna	AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES; TOXICITY; CADMIUM; COPPER; ZINC; WATER; BIOACCUMULATION; ACCUMULATION; ZN; CD	It is well known that temperature can affect the ecotoxicity of chemicals (including metals) to aquatic organisms. It was recently reported that nickel (Ni), a priority substance under the European Water Framework directive, showed decreasing chronic toxicity to Daphnia magna with increasing temperature, between 15 and 25 degrees C. We performed a toxicokinetic study to contribute to an increased mechanistic understanding of this effect. More specifically, we investigated the effect of temperature on Ni uptake and elimination in D. magna (in 4 clones) using an experimental design that included Ni exposures with different stable isotopic composition and using a one-compartment model for data analysis. Both Ni uptake and elimination were affected by temperature, and some clear interclonal differences were observed. On average (across all clones), however, a similar pattern of the effect of temperature was observed on both Ni uptake and elimination, that is, the uptake rate constant (k(u)) and elimination rate constant (k(e)) during 72 h of Ni exposure were lower at 25 than at 19 degrees C, by 2.6-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively, and they were similar at 19 and 15 degrees C. This pattern does not correspond to the effects of temperature on chronic Ni toxicity reported previously, suggesting that Ni compartmentalization and/or toxicodynamics may also be affected by temperature. The data gathered with our specific experimental design also allowed us to infer that 1) the k(u) was up-regulated over time, that is, the k(u) after 2 d of Ni exposure was significantly higher than the initial k(u), by 1.5- to 2.3-fold, and 2) the k(e) decreased significantly when the external Ni exposure was stopped, by 1.2- to 1.9-fold. These 2 findings are in contrast with 2 commonly used assumptions in toxicokinetic models, that is, that k(u) is constant during exposure and k(e) is independent of external exposure. We suggest that future toxicokinetic studies consider these factors in their experimental designs and data analyses. Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of evidence that temperature affects toxicokinetics of metals (and chemicals in general), but at the same time we emphasize that knowledge of toxicokinetics alone is not necessarily sufficient to explain or predict temperature effects on (chronic) toxicity.

We analyzed blood lead concentrations from osprey (n = 244; Pandion haliaetus) and bald eagles (n = 68; Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and documented potential sources of lead they may encounter. Adult bald eagles had higher blood lead concentrations than did adult osprey. However, blood lead concentrations of nestlings were similar for both species. Although 62% of osprey had detectable lead concentrations (x over bar = 1.99 +/- 4.02 mu g/dL, mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), there was no difference in the detection frequency or lead concentrations between osprey adults and nestlings. Likewise, we found no differences in the detection frequency or lead concentrations in osprey adults and nestlings from high- and low-salinity areas. Of the bald eagle samples tested, 55% had detectable lead levels (x over bar = 6.23 +/- 10.74 mu g/dL). Adult bald eagles had more detectable and higher lead concentrations than did nestlings or pre-adults. Among environmental samples, paint had the highest lead concentrations, followed by sediment, blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus), and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum). There was no correlation between blood lead concentrations of osprey adults and their offspring. Our results indicate that, in the Chesapeake Bay region of Maryland and Virginia (USA), there are multiple sources by which piscivorous raptors may be exposed to lead.

ANTILLARUM; TROPHIC CASCADES; MACROALGAL COVER; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; COMMUNITY; ATLANTIC; MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEMS	The patterns of variability in the composition and structure of benthic communities along two depth strata (5 and 10m) and the presence of sea urchins in structuring the subtidal rocky reefs were quantified in a long-established coastal marine protected area (Garajau MPA) and in two size equivalent and contiguous impacted areas (one highly urbanized and other with high fishing pressure) at Madeira Island (northeast Atlantic). Results suggest i) the MPA could be acting as a refuge for local biodiversity, ii) communities from the highly fished area could be suffering an impoverishment of local biodiversity, and iii) communities from the highly urbanized area would be enriched by the establishment of opportunistic species. These findings support that the level of human-pressure likely plays an important role in the composition of benthic communities in this insular ecosystem, although this was more relevant at the shallower stratum where the key grazer Diadema africanum explained 65% of the variance of benthic assemblages. It is suggested that this MPA small dimension and proximity to human impacted areas are limiting the survival of predators of the D. africanum.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						large spatial scale modeling; biochar; carbon sequestration	BAYESIAN NETWORKS; SEQUESTERING CARBON; SOIL; UNCERTAINTY; PYROLYSIS; RESPONSES; YIELD	The heating of biomass under low-oxygen conditions generates three co-products, bio-oil, biogas, and biochar. Bio-oil can be stabilized and used as fuel oil or be further refined for various applications and biogas can be used as an energy source during the low-oxygen heating process. Biochar can be used to sequester carbon in soil and has the potential to increase crop yields when it is used to improve yield-limiting soil properties. Complex bio-physical interactions have made it challenging to answer the question of where biochar should be applied for the maximum agronomic and economic benefits. We address this challenge by developing an extensive informatics workflow for processing and analyzing crop yield response data as well as a large spatial-scale modeling platform. We use a probabilistic graphical model to study the relationships between soil and biochar variables and predict the probability and magnitude of crop yield response to biochar application. Our results show an average increase in crop yields ranging from 4.7% to 6.4% depending on the biochar feedstock and application rate. Expected yield increases of at least 6.1% and 8.8% are necessary to cover 25% and 10% of US cropland with biochar. We find that biochar application to crop area with an expected yield increase of at least 5.3%-5.9% would result in carbon sequestration offsetting 0.57%-0.67% of US greenhouse gas emissions. Applying biochar to corn area is the most profitable from a revenue perspective when compared to soybeans and wheat because additional revenues accrued by farmers are not enough to cover the costs of biochar applications in many regions of the United States.

Parasite community structure as a predictor of host population structure: An example using Callorhinchus capensis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE			English	Article						Species accumulation curves; Callorhinchus spp.; Cestoda; Monogenea; Parasite ecology; Marine biodiversity	BASAL POLYOPISTHOCOTYLEAN MONOGENEANS; ULTRASTRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS; MARINE FISHES; HEXABOTHRIIDAE; ECOLOGY; CHIMAERICOLIDAE; INDICATORS; BIOLOGY	This paper describes the parasite community structure of the Cape elephant fish or St Joseph shark (Callorhinchus capensis) caught off the West and South Coast of South Africa between 2010 and 2015. These data were used to build species accumulation curves (SAC) and calculate biodiversity indices including rarefied species richness, Shannon Weiner's diversity index, Simpson's index and Pielou's J index. The biodiversity indices were correlated with the host's biological data to determine how these affected the parasite community structure and provide insight into the host's population structure. The parasites identified in C. capensis (n = 259) include a cestode (Gyrocotyle plana), two monogeneans (Callorhynchicotyle callorhynchi and Callorhinchicola multitesticulatus), an isopod (Anilocra capensis) and a leech (Branchellion sp.). Gyrocotyle plana was the most prevalent at 71.43% and the monogenean C. callorhynchi had the highest mean abundance (1.55 +/- 0.45 parasites.fish(-1)) and the highest mean infection intensity (4.79 +/- 0.66 parasites.infected fish(-1)). The SAC and biodiversity measures indicate a uniform parasite community across the sampled host population, suggesting a highly interactive shark community with no evidence for population structure. These results show that parasite community structure can be used to infer their host's population structure.

Drawing from information on over 400 admixed genomes sourced from replicate transects across the European hybrid zone between all-black carrion crows and grey-coated hooded crows, we decipher the interplay between phenotypic divergence and selection at the molecular level. Over 68% of plumage variation was explained by epistasis between the gene NDP and a similar to 2.8-megabase region on chromosome 18 with suppressed recombination. Both pigmentation loci showed evidence for divergent selection resisting introgression. This study reveals how few, large-effect loci can govern prezygotic isolation and shield phenotypic divergence from gene flow.	[Knief, Ulrich; Weissensteiner, Matthias; Wolf, Jochen B.

Mass has a pervasive influence on biological processes, but the effect is usually non-proportional; for example, a tenfold increase in mass is typically accompanied by just a four-to sevenfold increase in metabolic rate. Understanding the cause of allometric scaling has been a long-standing problem in biology. Here, we examine the evolution of metabolic allometry in animals by linking microevolutionary processes to macroevolutionary patterns. We show that the genetic correlation between mass and metabolic rate is strong and positive in insects, birds and mammals. We then use these data to simulate the macroevolution of mass and metabolic rate, and show that the interspecific relationship between these traits in animals is consistent with evolution under persistent multivariate selection on mass and metabolic rate over long periods of time.

However, whether and how climate change affects microbial STRs remains unclear, mainly due to the scarcity of long-term experimental data. Here, we examine the STRs and phylogenetic-time relationships (PTRs) of soil bacteria and fungi in a long-term multifactorial global change experiment with warming (+3 degrees C), half precipitation (-50%), double precipitation (+100%) and clipping (annual plant biomass removal). Soil bacteria and fungi all exhibited strong STRs and PTRs across the 12 experimental conditions. Strikingly, warming accelerated the bacterial and fungal STR and PTR exponents (that is, the w values), yielding significantly (P < 0.001) higher temporal scaling rates. While the STRs and PTRs were significantly shifted by altered precipitation, clipping and their combinations, warming played the predominant role. In addition, comparison with the previous literature revealed that soil bacteria and fungi had considerably higher overall temporal scaling rates (w = 0.39-0.64) than those of plants and animals (w = 0.21-0.38). Our results on warming-enhanced temporal scaling of microbial biodiversity suggest that the strategies of soil biodiversity preservation and ecosystem management may need to be adjusted in a warmer world.

The evolution of linkage disequilibrium between such loci is therefore a fundamental step in the origin of species. Here, we show that this process can take place in the absence of physical linkage in hamlets-a group of closely related reef fishes from the wider Caribbean that differ essentially in colour pattern and are reproductively isolated through strong visually-based assortative mating. Using full-genome analysis, we identify four narrow genomic intervals that are consistently differentiated among sympatric species in a backdrop of extremely low genomic divergence. These four intervals include genes involved in pigmentation (sox10), axial patterning (hoxc13a), photoreceptor development (casz1) and visual sensitivity (SWS and LWS opsins) that develop islands of long-distance and inter-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium as species diverge. The relatively simple genomic architecture of species differences facilitates the evolution of linkage disequilibrium in the presence of gene flow.

Megaphylogeny resolves global patterns of mushroom evolution	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; FORMING FUNGI; EXPLOSIVE DIVERSIFICATION; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; EXTINCTION RATES; R PACKAGE; DIVERSITY; SPECIATION; LIKELIHOOD; BINARY	Mushroom-forming fungi (Agaricomycetes) have the greatest morphological diversity and complexity of any group of fungi. They have radiated into most niches and fulfil diverse roles in the ecosystem, including wood decomposers, pathogens or mycorrhizal mutualists. Despite the importance of mushroom-forming fungi, large-scale patterns of their evolutionary history are poorly known, in part due to the lack of a comprehensive and dated molecular phylogeny. Here, using multigene and genome-based data, we assemble a 5,284-species phylogenetic tree and infer ages and broad patterns of speciation/extinction and morphological innovation in mushroom-forming fungi. Agaricomycetes started a rapid class-wide radiation in the Jurassic, coinciding with the spread of (sub) tropical coniferous forests and a warming climate. A possible mass extinction, several clade-specific adaptive radiations and morphological diversification of fruiting bodies followed during the Cretaceous and the Paleogene, convergently giving rise to the classic toadstool morphology, with a cap, stalk and gills (pileate-stipitate morphology). This morphology is associated with increased rates of lineage diversification, suggesting it represents a key innovation in the evolution of mushroom-forming fungi. The increase in mushroom diversity started during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic radiation event, an era of humid climate when terrestrial communities dominated by gymnosperms and reptiles were also expanding.

We used noninvasive genetic sampling, hunter surveys, and occupancy models to evaluate the effect of harvest on occurrence and turnover of packs in a population of wolves managed with intensive harvest in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, 2012-2014. We tested 2 alternative hypotheses: the abundance and distribution of wolf packs were dynamic because of harvest or the abundance and distribution of wolf packs were generally stable regardless of harvest. We found the mean annual probability for wolf pack occupancy ranged 0.72-0.74 and the estimated distribution of wolf packs was consistent over time, 2012-2014. Our top model indicated wolf pack occupancy was positively associated with forest cover and the probability of detecting a wolf pack was positively associated with the intensity of harvest for wolves in that area. We observed frequent turnover of individuals within packs that were genetically sampled consecutive years but not of entire packs. Because turnover of packs occurred infrequently during our study, we could not reject our hypothesis that occurrence of packs was generally stable in a harvested population of wolves. Our results suggest environmental factors have a stronger effect than harvest on the abundance and distribution of wolf packs in southwestern Alberta, but harvest appears to strongly influence turnover of individuals within packs. We hypothesize local dispersal from within the study area and neighboring packs on the periphery of the study area helped promote pack stability. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

Little is known about habitat covariates that may limit or enhance range expansion of nutria, especially when combined with predicted changes in climate. We used a hierarchical modeling approach to develop broad- and local-scale maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models based on nutria harvest records in the eastern United States from 2006-2015. We developed models for current conditions and for climate change projections in 2050. At a broad scale, nutria habitat was located in areas with <= 80 annual freezing days. At local scales, nutria were found in areas with high proportions of freshwater forested-shrub wetlands close to other wetlands. Managers who are concerned about possible nutria range expansion can use this hierarchical modeling framework to identify areas for surveillance and prioritize control efforts.

Lifetime, known-age moose reproduction in a nutritionally stressed population	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Alaska; Alces alces; delayed maturation; known-age; moose; parturition rates; reproduction; twinning	ALCES-ALCES; MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; TWINNING RATES; RED DEER; HISTORY; COSTS; SENESCENCE; ACCURACY; DYNAMICS	Quantifying long-term, low reproductive metrics indicative of an ungulate population's low nutritional status can help spur action to manage for moderate densities in contrast to unsustainable, high densities. We previously ranked the moose (Alces alces gigas) population described here as having the lowest nutritional status among 14 moose populations in Alaska, USA, primarily using reproductive indices (1996-2005) from moose with ages estimated by counting cementum annuli. Here, we detailed lifetime reproductive metrics from a subset of known-age female moose initially radio-collared at 9-10 months of age (7 cohorts; 1996-2002); we renewed radio-collars as necessary. We radio-tracked and circled these moose via aircraft at 24- or 48-hour intervals to detect the presence of newborns during the 1998-2018 calving seasons, with meaningful annual sample sizes during 2000-2014. The number of snow-free days in the year preceding parturition had a subtle positive effect on parturition probability, but we found no evidence for effects of the preceding February and March immobilization, cohort affiliation, or the preceding winter's snow cover on the probability of a female being parturient. The probability of twinning declined as the calving season progressed. Compared with moose production in populations with improved nutrition, our study population experienced low production primarily as a result of delayed maturation, occasional pauses in reproduction, and low twinning rates. Reproductive senescence occurred at normal advanced ages despite nutritional stress. We recorded a 28% parturition rate among 144 females 3 years of age (min. age of reproduction). Parturition rates were stable from 4 to 13 years of age (x over bar = 77%), declined at 14 years of age, and peaked at 15 years of age. Females first twinned at 5 years of age (5%), and the twinning rate increased with age, peaking at 13 years of age (25%). Overall, 136 radio-collared females with complete reproductive histories produced a mean of 5.3 calves/lifetime while being monitored a mean of 7.1 years at ages >= 3 years, although variability in individual production was high. Delaying or pausing reproduction increased the parturition rate at 4 and 5 years of age. However, females that delayed first reproduction produced fewer calves/lifetime on average compared with moose that first produced at 3 years of age. Virtually all moose regularly gave birth with occasional 1-year pauses that acted to enhance production the subsequent year; the incidence of 2 consecutive nonparturient years was 2.8% (24/844). Moose experienced relatively stable, low nutritional status during 2000-2014 based upon low population-wide twinning rates from annual aerial transect surveys (no telemetry) flown a few days after the median annual calving dates. Detailed understanding of low reproductive metrics encouraged empowered stakeholders to allow liberal harvests of female moose (2.0-4.4% of prehunt moose population numbers) and encouraged land managers to allow wildfires to burn 25% of the study area to improve moose carrying capacity. We helped manage a 31% decline in moose numbers during 2004-2012 by implementing liberal harvests of female moose. Elevated population-wide twinning rates in 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2018, similar to elevated levels prior to 1997, were likely a positive response to lower moose densities and improved browse after wildfires.

The black brant population is declining based on mark recapture	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Arctic; banding; black brant geese; Branta bernicla nigricans; capture-mark-recapture; Lincoln estimator; Mexico; population dynamics; Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta	BERNICLA-NIGRICANS; SURVIVAL ESTIMATION; HARVEST; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; PREDATION; FIDELITY; GOSLINGS; DENSITY; CLIMATE	Annual survival and recruitment in black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) have declined since the 1990s, yet aerial surveys of the global population have been stable or even increasing over the past decade. We used a combination of a Lincoln estimator based on harvest information and band recoveries, and marked-unmarked ratios in bag checks in 1 harvest area in Mexico to estimate the number of adults in the population during 1992-2015. We produced weighted means from the 2 kinds of estimates for years in which we had data for both, with weights equal to the inverse of the variance of the individual estimates. We treated the black brant population as consisting of 2 subpopulations. One population consisted of breeding black brant on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), Alaska, USA, and the other consisted of Arctic (northern Alaska, western Canada, and eastern Russia) breeders, and nonbreeders and failed breeders from the YKD that underwent molt migration to the Arctic. For the global population estimates, we assessed potential bias due to differential marking and harvest of the 2 subpopulations, which was approximately 1%, probably because band recovery rates were similar for the 2 subpopulations. Population estimates declined from 229,980 (average for 1999-2002) to 161,504 (average for 2012-2015). Population estimates based on estimated harvest were variable but more stable in the later years of the study, when larger numbers of brant hunters were included in the sample. We suggest that the combination of Lincoln estimates and bag check data provides a reasonable and cost effective approach to monitoring the population. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

Reduction in meso-mammal nest predators improves northern bobwhite demographics	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Colinus virginianus; Florida; Georgia; nest; northern bobwhite; population; predation; predator control; reproduction; survival	IDENTIFYING PREDATORS; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; ALTERNATIVE PREY; SURVIVAL; RECRUITMENT; ABUNDANCE; WILDLIFE; SUCCESS; CYCLES; GAME	Nest predation is the major cause of nest failure in northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; i.e., bobwhites). Control of mid-sized mammalian nest predators (i.e., meso-mammals) is often conducted to increase reproductive success on lands managed for bobwhites. Nest predation by meso-mammals, however, is only one part of a complex predator-prey trophic system. There is limited understanding of the effect of nest predators on bobwhite demographics, which creates uncertainty about the efficacy of nest predator control. We quantified demographic effects on bobwhite populations from reducing meso-mammals on 4 study areas managed for bobwhites in northern Florida and southwestern Georgia, USA, during 2000-2006. After 1 year of pre-treatment monitoring (2000), we reduced meso-mammal nest predator abundance through trapping over 3-year intervals, March to September, on 2 sites using a crossover design. Efficacy of trapping was demonstrated by a 43% reduction in scent station visitation rates of meso-mammals. Meso-mammal control increased all demographic metrics including a 30% increase in nesting propensity, a 10% increase in nest success, and a 43% increase in chicks produced. Despite significant regional variation in breeding season survival rates, this equated to an average 18% increase in autumn density on trapped sites. Decision-makers should weigh the tradeoffs between bobwhite population goals and costs of meso-mammal control, where those that value maximum bobwhite density and reduced annual variation should likely implement control of meso-mammals.

Fluctuating mast production does not drive Scandinavian brown bear behavior	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						food abundance; foraging; human-wildlife conflict; Ursus arctos; Vaccinium myrtillus	ESTIMATING POPULATION-SIZE; URSUS-ARCTOS; BLACK BEARS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; BOREAL FOREST; GRIZZLY BEARS; STAYING COOL; DIET; LANDSCAPE; ECOSYSTEM	Bears often rely on soft or hard mast during fall hyperphagia when they increase body mass in preparation for winter hibernation. Studies of North American and Japanese bear populations suggest they respond to years of mast crop failure by increasing movement rates and roaming farther, with an increase in human-wildlife conflicts. In southcentral Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) primarily feed on bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea) during hyperphagia. We hypothesized that berry production affects movement, activity, and space use behaviors of bears in Sweden, which have the potential to increase human-bear encounters. We tested whether seasonal activity patterns, human settlement visits, and clearcut selection ratios were affected by bilberry and lingonberry productivity between 2007 and 2017 with linear and generalized linear mixed effect models. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find that bears moved more or maintained larger home ranges in years of low berry production. Bears were slightly more active in years of higher bilberry production, but variation in behavior was primarily explained by demographic group and individual differences. Bears rarely visited human settlements and the number of visits did not increase in relation to shortage of natural foods. Likewise, population-level selection for clearcuts was unrelated to berry production but reflected a differential food search behavior in the 2 peak berry seasons, with higher clearcut selection ratios during the lingonberry season. Only 12 bears regularly used agricultural fields, which were too few to relate field visits to berry production, but all bears visited fields more often during the later lingonberry season. We suggest that weaker fluctuations in berry production, a continuous spatial distribution of berries, and an apparent absence of forage-limiting exploitative intra- or interspecific competition contribute to brown bears in Scandinavia being less food limited than bears in North America or Japan, which might help to explain the low number of human-bear conflicts in Sweden. Factors potentially influencing encounters and actual or perceived conflict between bears and humans differ among populations because of a different distribution of natural and non-natural food resources or differences in the magnitude of variation in food abundance among years. These data are important to consider when communicating causes of human-wildlife conflicts to the public. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

Multi-scale habitat selection of elk in response to beetle-killed forest	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						bark-beetle epidemic; Cervus canadensis; forest disturbance; land cover classification; locomotion; resource selection function; step selection function; thermoregulation; Wyoming	LEAF-AREA INDEX; RESOURCE SELECTION; UNDERSTORY VEGETATION; DISTURBANCE; BEHAVIOR; OUTBREAKS; WILDFIRE; WILDLIFE; CLASSIFICATION; SUCCESSION	Forests of the Rocky Mountains (USA and Canada) have experienced a large-scale bark-beetle (Dendoctronus ponderosae) epidemic that has led to widespread mortality of pine trees, followed by structural and compositional changes to the forest. The millions of dead trees resulting from this event likely have an effect on ecosystem processes, but currently those effects are mostly unclear. Changes to forest canopy and understory structure are likely to affect behavior and space use of large ungulates as forage abundance, thermal cover, and locomotive costs are presumably altered. We developed and tested hypotheses for how resource selection in summer of female elk (Cervus canadensis; n = 47; 2012-2016), the primary large mammal in our study area, was influenced by changes in canopy, understory vegetation, and downed logs in bark-beetle affected forest in south-central Wyoming, USA. We employed global positioning system (GPS) technology, an imagery-derived land cover classification specifically depicting beetle-affected forest, and on-the-ground forest measurements to develop resource and step selection functions. At the study area scale, elk avoided beetle-killed forest during nearly all parts of the day and selected for intact conifer forest during the day. At the micro-habitat scale, as canopy cover decreased in beetle-killed areas, there was a concomitant increase in grass biomass and downed logs. Nevertheless, while in the forest, elk did not alter resource selection relative to changes in understory vegetation or downed logs. The boost in forage abundance within beetle-killed areas was insufficient to overcome the presumed increases in energy expenditures associated with locomotion and thermoregulation in beetle-killed forests. The bark-beetle epidemic has altered how elk use the landscape and has resulted in a potential loss of forest habitat that elk use during the day. Our results indicate that habitat treatments (i.e., fire or harvest) that remove standing dead trees and downed logs in beetle-killed forest would further facilitate understory growth while reducing the locomotion costs associated with foraging in beetle-killed forest.

Activity center selection by northern spotted owls	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						canopy cover; habitat selection; light detection and ranging (lidar); Oregon; spotted owl Strix occidentalis caurina	SITE OCCUPANCY DYNAMICS; BARRED OWLS; NEST SITES; HOME-RANGE; HABITAT SELECTION; CASCADE MOUNTAINS; LIDAR; FORESTS; MODEL; POPULATIONS	The federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) has been intensively studied across its range, and habitat needs for the species have influenced forest management in northwestern North America for decades. Dense forest canopies are often reported in the scientific literature and agency management plans as an important habitat attribute for spotted owls, though the means of measuring forest canopy and interpreting species requirements vary across studies and more importantly, among management plans. We used light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements of canopy cover, canopy surface heterogeneity, and upper canopy surface connectivity, and an index of the presence of a competitive invasive species, the barred owl (S. varia), in multinomial discrete choice models using a Bayesian framework to evaluate selection of forest cover types by spotted owls in Oregon, USA, 2008-2015. We designated yearly activity centers based on the most biologically significant observation during the nesting season (Mar-Aug), generally centered on the nest tree. Spotted owls selected activity centers with more canopy cover and higher heterogeneity of the canopy surface within 100 m than was available within their territories. The average proportion of canopy cover within 100 m of a spotted owl activity center was 0.79 +/- 0.12 (SD; range = 0.34-0.99). The presence of barred owls did not explain variability in selection of spotted owl activity centers, but barred owls might not affect third-order habitat selection within territories, or our index was too spatially coarse to detect these effects on spotted owl resource selection. We demonstrate that lidar provides researchers and managers with a tool that can accurately measure forest canopies over large areas, and assist in mapping spotted owl habitat.

Long-term individual marking of small freshwater fish: the utility of Visual Implant Elastomer tags	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Elastomer tagging; VIE tags; Cichlid fish; Social behaviour; Survival; Individual identification	CICHLID FISH; BROODCARE HELPERS; PREDATION RISK; DISPERSAL; SURVIVAL; COLOR; RELATEDNESS; EVOLUTION; CONFLICT; PATTERNS	Tracking wild animals over long periods of time is a non-trivial challenge. This has caused a bias in the availability of individual-based long-term datasets with the majority including birds and mammals. Visual Implant Elastomer (VIE) tags are now a widely used technique that may facilitate the collection of such data for fish and amphibians. However, VIE tags might have important drawbacks. Overall, four potential issues with VIE tags have been proposed: tag loss or misidentification, limited number of individual identifiers, enhanced mortality risk, and effects on intra-specific interactions. Here, we present three experiments in which we investigated these potential problems with VIE tagging in small freshwater fish both in the laboratory and in the wild, using the cooperatively breeding Lake Tanganyika cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. We find VIE tags to be generally suitable for work with these fish as they did not impair survival, were recognisable up to 2years after injection, and did not generally disturb group formation. Nevertheless, we identify specific issues of VIE tagging, including colour- and position-dependent variation in tag identification rates, and indications that specific colours may influence social behaviour. Our results demonstrate the suitability of VIE tags for long-term studies on small freshwater fish, while also highlighting the need of validating this method carefully for any species and study.Significance statementInformation on the survival, dispersal, and reproductive success of wild individuals across their lifespan is among the most valuable data in Behavioural Ecology. Because tracking of free-ranging individuals over extended periods of time is challenging, there exists a bias in the taxonomic distribution of such long-term datasets. Here, we investigate the suitability of visible implant elastomers (VIE) as a tracking technique to allow for the collection of such data also in small tropical freshwater fish. We show that VIE tags neither alter social behaviour in our study species, nor do they reduce survival, but they enable the tracking of wild individuals across years. We also identify colours and tag positions that are less suitable. We conclude that VIE tags can help produce long-term datasets also for small fish, provided certain precautions are met.

Bees of the Victorian Alps: Network structure and interactions of introduced species	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Apis mellifera; Australian Alps; bees; Hypochaeris radicata; pollination network	POLLINATION NETWORKS; TREELESS VEGETATION; PLANT; NESTEDNESS; IMPACT; CONSERVATION; AUSTRALIA; HONEYBEES; DYNAMICS; BIOLOGY	Bees are considered the most important plant pollinators in many ecosystems, yet little is known about pollination of native plants by bees in many Australian ecosystems including the alpine region. Here we consider bee pollination in this region by constructing a bee visitation network and investigating the degree of specialism and network nestedness', which are related to the robustness of the network to perturbations. Bees and flowers were collected and observed from 10 sites across the Bogong High Plains/Mt Hotham region in Victoria. Low nestedness and a low degree of specialism were detected, consistent with patterns in other alpine regions. Twenty-one native and one non-indigenous bee species were observed visiting 46 of the 67 flower species recorded. The introduced Apis mellifera had a large floral overlap with native bees, which may reduce fecundity of native bees through competition. The introduced plant, Hypochaeris radicata (Asteraceae), had the largest and most sustained coverage of any flower and had the most visitations and bee species of any flower. The network developed in this study is a first step in understanding pollination patterns in the alpine/subalpine region and serves as a baseline for future comparisons.

Street fighters: Bite force, injury rates, and density of urban Australian water dragons (Intellagama lesueurii)	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						bite force; combat; lizard; performance; urban ecology	POPULATION-DENSITY; COLLARED LIZARDS; PERFORMANCE; ECOLOGY; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; SIZE; CITY; SEX; TERRITORIALITY	In an increasingly urbanized world it is imperative that we understand how wildlife responds to this novel anthropogenic landscape, both at the individual- and population-level. Urbanization generally reduces biodiversity, but can also favour particular species and increase their abundance relative to wild populations. When population density increases, so too does the frequency and cost of social interactions. We studied Australian water dragons (Intellagama lesueurii), a species common in urban, semi-natural and natural areas, to firstly test the prediction that urban populations occur at higher densities, and then determine the consequences of urbanization for combat rates (quantified using wounding) and bite force. We established that urban populations are denser than ones from semi-natural and natural habitats. We also recorded significantly more wounds in females from urban populations than females from both natural and semi-natural populations. Urban males also had significantly higher incidence of wounding than males from natural populations. We did not find a difference in male or female bite force among any populations across the urban-natural gradient. Overall, we found evidence that urbanization results in a higher population density of water dragons and more frequent conspecific combat, but this was not associated with an increase in bite force. These finding suggests that there may be a physiological cost to living in urban habitats related to increased contest rates and wounding.

Trophic ecology of young-of-the-year elasmobranchs in a critical habitat within the Rio de la Plata outer estuarine waters	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						active feeders; Chondrichthyes; length-weight relationships; Southwest Atlantic; stomach contents	SHARK NOTORYNCHUS-CEPEDIANUS; NURSERY AREAS; SQUATINA-GUGGENHEIM; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; FEEDING-HABITS; SYMPTERYGIA-BONAPARTII; PREDATORY SHARKS; 4 ABUNDANT; BODY-SIZE; DIET	Knowledge on the trophic ecology of elasmobranch species in all their size classes is important to determine complex trophic roles and relationships between members of the community, which ultimately promotes the development of more effective conservation measures. This study investigates the diet of young-of-the-year from two shark and one skate species that are common within the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Identification and analysis of stomach contents indicated that the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus fed mostly on fishes (96.08%I-RI), whereas the angular angel shark Squatina guggenheim, and the smallnose fanskate Sympterygia bonapartii preyed mainly on crustaceans (68.73-99.96%I-RI). In particular, Artemesia longinaris, a widely distributed small shrimp, was an important prey item for the two crustacean feeders. The high proportion of stomachs with food and the trophic levels suggest that the three species are active predators at a very young age. A high frequency of neonates was also observed for all species, suggesting that parturition events are probably occurring nearby. Overall, this study suggest that the nearshore waters of northern Argentina are functioning as an important feeding ground for co-occurring elasmobranch species within an important estuarine habitat.

Biodiversity responses to land-use and restoration in a global biodiversity hotspot: Ant communities in Brazilian Cerrado	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity conservation; functional composition; land mosaic; savanna; species richness	FUNCTIONAL-GROUPS; HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE; FOREST RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; EUCALYPT FOREST; WESTERN-GHATS; SAO-PAULO; CONSERVATION; DISTURBANCE; VEGETATION	Given that land-use change is the main cause of global biodiversity decline, there is widespread interest in adopting land-use practices that maintain high levels of biodiversity, and in restoring degraded land that previously had high biodiversity value. In this study, we use ant taxonomic and functional diversity to examine the effects of different land uses (agriculture, pastoralism, silviculture and conservation) and restoration practices on Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) biodiversity. We also examine the extent to which ant diversity and composition can be explained by vegetation attributes that apply across the full land management spectrum. We surveyed vegetation attributes and ant communities in five replicate plots of each of 13 land-use and restoration treatments, including two types of native vegetation as reference sites: cerrado sensu stricto and cerradAo. Several land-use and restoration treatments had comparable plot richness to that of the native reference habitats. Ant species and functional composition varied systematically among land-use treatments following a gradient from open habitats such as agricultural fields to forested sites. Tree basal area and grass cover were the strongest predictors of ant species richness. Losses in ant diversity were higher in land-use systems that transform vegetation structure. Among productive systems, therefore, uncleared pastures and old pine plantations had similar species composition to that occurring in cerrado sensu stricto. Restoration techniques currently applied to sites that were previously Cerrado have focused on returning tree cover, and have failed to restore ant communities typical of savanna. To improve restoration outcomes for Cerrado biodiversity, greater attention needs to be paid to the re-establishment and maintenance of the grass layer, which requires frequent fire. At the broader scale, conservation planning in agricultural landscapes, should recognize the value of land-use mosaics and the risks of homogenization.

Adaptation to climate in five eastern North America broadleaf deciduous species: Growth clines and evidence of the growth-cold tolerance trade-off	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS			English	Article						Climate change responses; Local adaptation; Ecological genetics; Growth potential-cold hardiness trade-off; Provenance tests	RED MAPLE PROGENIES; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; ASSISTED MIGRATION; QUERCUS-RUBRA; POPULATIONS; RESPONSES; REFORESTATION; GENETICS; IMPACTS; NICHE	Clines in genetic variation along climate gradients documented for many species in temperate and boreal forests illustrate adaptation of forest tree populations to climate. Adaptation tends to involve balancing selection between high growth rates and stress resistance: a trade-off in resource allocation between stress tolerance and competitive ability that determines fundamental life history strategies. The growth-cold tolerance trade-off, in particular, has been well documented for many conifers but evidence in broadleaf deciduous species is scarce. Using populations' mean total tree height and provenance climate from range-wide provenance tests established in the USA between 1960 and 1975, we evaluate and model growth dines along climatic gradients and assess evidence of the growth rate-cold tolerance trade-off in five eastern North America broadleaf deciduous species: Acer rubrum (red maple), Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch), Juglans nigra (black walnut), Prunus serotina (black cherry), and Quercus rubra (northern red oak). Number of populations and provenance tests in this study varies by species, ranging from 31 to70 and 4 to 8, respectively. For each species, observations were separated into two groups, those where the population was moved to a test site climate milder than at its origin, and those where the population was moved to a colder test site climate. Clines of growth potential along climate gradients were evaluated using the group of observations in which the populations had been transferred to a milder test climate, while cold-limited responses were evaluated using the observations in the group of populations moved to colder test climate. Results showed steep dines in association with temperature variables for black walnut and black cherry and less pronounced clines for red maple. Population differentiation in northern red oak and yellow birch was weak. Growth potential dines had slopes opposite to the cold-limited growth responses, providing strong evidence for the growth-cold tolerance trade-off in broadleaf deciduous species. The results show that genetic growth responses to climate will differ considerably among species and thereby demand different management strategies to mitigate climate change impacts.

When a seed-feeding beetle is a predator and also increases the speed of seed germination: an intriguing interaction with an invasive plant	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Hard seeds; Invasion ecology; Leucaena leucocephala; Life-history evolution; Plant-insect interaction	COLEOPTERA-CHRYSOMELIDAE BRUCHINAE; BRUCHIDIUS-DORSALIS COLEOPTERA; LEUCAENA-LEUCOCEPHALA FABACEAE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; HOST-PLANT; SIZE; POPULATION; SATIATION; SURVIVAL; ECOLOGY	Bruchine beetles are usually considered seed predators, particularly because these beetles consume the seed embryo and kill the seeds. Previous studies suggest that under certain conditions, these insects do not kill the embryo. In this study, we asked whether the germination speed of seeds of the invasive tree Leucaena leucocephala is enhanced by the seed-feeding beetle Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae). We also tested whether differences in germination between attacked and intact seeds could be related to seed size. We finally examined whether the number of larvae per seed affected seed germination and whether seedling emergence patterns were similar to those exhibited by germination. We found that compared to intact seeds, proportionally faster germination occurred in seeds attacked by A. macrophthalmus in 14 of the 26 populations studied. In addition, those populations that presented greater germination speed in the attacked seeds during the evaluation time also had the largest seeds. Similar to the germination experiments, seedling emergence was faster in the attacked compared to the intact seeds. Our findings show that the germination speed of L. leucocephala seeds can be enhanced by A. macrophthalmus. However, this effect is much more intense when a single larva develops inside the seed. In evolutionary terms, it is possible that the selection for larger seeds is favoured, increasing the speed of seed germination and contributing to predator satiation at the seed level. However, this effect could be minimized by the production of many seeds by L. leucocephala plants, causing predator satiation by masting effects, which would favour the selection for higher seed numbers.

Previous studies have shown a correlation of increased urban noise levels, higher minimum frequency, and lowered bandwidth in Great Tit song (Parus major). We therefore studied the effect of urban noise pollution on the song characteristics of the closely related Eastern Great Tit (EGTs, Parus minor) at Hongneung experimental forests (HEFs) in the metropolitan urban of Seoul, Korea. We analysed the song characteristics of breeding territories of EGTS in total 13 individuals recorded including four individuals at high noise group. EGTs singing in noisier locations exhibited higher minimum & maximum frequency, and lower note & strophe length, and higher bandwidth, replicating the different findings of Great Tits. This data also suggests that several individuals at high noise location exhibited a non-typical song type indicative of structural adaptation to higher noise levels. Although the mechanisms of these correlations are as yet undetermined, it is likely that behavioural plasticity may play a role of vocal signal adaption in an increasingly urbanizing Korea.

Plant compartment and genetic variation drive microbiome composition in switchgrass roots	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article							PANICUM-VIRGATUM; COMMUNITY; ADAPTATION; DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; SPOT	Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a promising biofuel crop native to the United States with genotypes that are adapted to a wide range of distinct ecosystems. Various plants have been shown to undergo symbioses with plant growth-promoting bacteria and fungi, however, plant-associated microbial communities of switchgrass have not been extensively studied to date. We present 16S ribosomal RNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data of rhizosphere and root endosphere compartments of four switchgrass genotypes to test the hypothesis that host selection of its root microbiota prevails after transfer to non-native soil. We show that differences in bacterial, archaeal and fungal community composition and diversity are strongly driven by plant compartment and switchgrass genotypes and ecotypes. Plant-associated microbiota show an enrichment in Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria as well as Sordariales and Pleosporales compared with the surrounding soil. Root associated compartments display low-complexity communities dominated and enriched in Actinobacteria, in particular Streptomyces, in the lowland genotypes, and in Alphaproteobacteria, specifically Sphingobium, in the upland genotypes. Our comprehensive root analysis serves as a snapshot of host-specific bacterial and fungal associations of switchgrass in the field and confirms that host-selected microbiomes persist after transfer to non-native soil.

AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH			English	Article						Visibility trends; Fog; Haze; PM10; Relative humidity	SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT; ATMOSPHERIC VISIBILITY; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITIONS; METROPOLITAN-AREA; URBAN AREA; HAZE; FREQUENCY; POLLUTANTS; PARTICLES	This study provides insight into how the visibility in Taiwan has varied over time and what the main drivers of these visibility changes are. From 1985 to 2016, urban inland sites showed increases in visibility and decreases in the frequency of hazy and/or foggy days, whereas urbanized and rural coastal regions either showed no clear trend or even an overall decrease in visibility. Over the most recent 5 to 10 years, a consistent increase in the visibility and decrease in the haze frequency has been found for most of the stations, except for the rural to suburban regions. In general, visibility is driven by the relative humidity (rH) and the mass concentration of aerosol particles (PM). On the one hand, the combination of climate change and urbanization, resulting in a rise in temperature (on average, + 0.035 degrees C y(-1)) and an associated overall decrease in rH (on average, -0.125% y(-1)), has had a positive influence on long-term visibility in the cities of Taiwan. On the other hand, improvements in air quality supported the increase in visibility during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Our results show an almost exponential relationship between visibility and PM10. At lower PM10 levels, the visibility is more sensitive to changes in the PM10. Thus, the influence of the long-term PM10 on visibility becomes weaker at high PM10 levels. Consequently, over the long term, the PM10 more strongly influenced the visibility trends at the northern urban stations, which had lower PM10 concentrations to begin with. At the southern urban stations, the PM10 concentrations were generally higher and hence were less of a factor in variations in visibility. Therefore, the visibility trends at these sites were more related to changes in rH until about 2011, at which time these regions reached a lower level of pollution.

Samples were collected during winter (June) and summer (November) at sampling sites from Dourados and Brilhante Rivers (Mato Grosso do Sul/Brazil). The toxicogenetic variables, including chromosomal alterations, micronuclei, and mitotic index, were analyzed in meristematic cells of Allium cepa; and micronuclei, nuclear abnormalities, and DNA strand breaks (arbitrary units, AU(T)) were analyzed in erythrocytes of Astyanax lacustris. The rivers presented physicochemical values outside the Brazilian laws, which can be a characteristic of human pollution (domestic sewage and local agriculture). The results of A. cepa test suggest that the water samples from Dourados and Brilhante rivers exerted significant (p<0.05) cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, in both periods of collection, especially alterations in mitotic index. In blood cells of A. lacustris, genotoxic effect of the water samples from the rivers also was observed as significant nuclear abnormalities, DNA breaks (UA(T)), in both sampling periods, compared with the negative control. Spearman correlation analyses revealed that data of land use and cover and physicochemical parameters were statistically correlated with DNA damages in bioassays. This study demonstrates toxicogenetic potential of water samples from Dourados and Brilhante rivers; furthermore, the type of land use and land cover and physicochemical parameters were revealed to have influence on toxicogenetic damage.

The role of forest canopy cover in habitat selection: insights from the Iberian lynx	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Resource selection functions; Habitat suitability; Forest structure; Mammal carnivores; Iberian lynx; Woodland conservation management	LANDSCAPE; CONSERVATION; MODELS; SCALE; PERFORMANCE; RISK; MAPS	Habitat selection models for woodland species usually consider forest attributes derived from land cover maps, such as an area covered by forests or distance to forest edge, but canopy cover is less frequently used as a predictor. We evaluated the effect of including forest canopy cover data in habitat selection models for woodland species using the endangered Iberian lynx as a case study. We considered four canopy cover classes for both conifer and broadleaved forests, together with other land cover predictors, and analyzed a large telemetry (GPS-GSM collars) dataset. The model that included forest canopy cover outperformed, both in predictive power and in conservation management insights, the model that only used forest area. The effect of forest canopy cover on lynx habitat selection was especially strong for broadleaved forests; an increased tree cover in these forests consistently translated into significantly lower selection probabilities. Open broadleaved forests were found to clearly be the most preferred habitat. By contrast, the habitat model without canopy cover data indicated that broadleaved forests were significantly less preferred than shrublands and mountain olive groves, which may mislead conservation management actions. We conclude that habitat selection models for woodland species should consider forest canopy cover as a relevant candidate predictor as it can capture important factors influencing habitat use, such as understory vegetation abundance or prey availability. Recent developments on remote sensing technologies will increase the availability of spatially continuous information on canopy cover, facilitating a more widespread use of vegetation structural variables in habitat modeling and hence improving the conservation planning value of these models.

Although photosynthetic rates are hypothesized to increase in response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, results from in situ experiments are inconsistent in supporting a CO2 fertilization effect of tree growth. Tree-ring data provide a historical record of tree-level productivity that can be used to evaluate long-term responses of tree growth. We use tree-ring data from old-growth, subalpine forests of western Canada that have not had a stand-replacing disturbance for hundreds of years to determine if growth has increased over 19th and 20th centuries. Our sample consisted of 5,858 trees belonging to five species distributed over two sites in the coastal zone and two in the continental climate of the interior. We calculated annual increments in tree basal area, adjusted these increments for tree size and age, and tested whether there was a detectable temporal trend in tree growth over the 19th and 20th centuries. We found a similar pattern in 20th century growth trends among all species at all sites. Growth during the 19th century was mostly stable or increasing, with the exception of one of the coastal sites, where tree growth was slightly decreasing; whereas growth during the 20th century consistently decreased. The unexpected decrease in growth during the 20th century indicates that there was no CO2 fertilization effect on photosynthesis. We compared the growth trends from our four sites to the trends simulated by seven Earth System Models, and saw that most of the models did not predict these growth declines. Overall, our results indicate that these old-growth forests are unlikely to increase their carbon storage capacity in response to rising atmospheric CO2, and thus are unlikely to contribute substantially to offsetting future carbon emissions.

Fire deficits have increased drought sensitivity in dry conifer forests: Fire frequency and tree-ring carbon isotope evidence from Central Oregon	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						basal area; carbon isotope discrimination; CO2; drought resistance; fire suppression; ponderosa pine; stand density; stomatal conductance	PINUS-PONDEROSA TREES; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; STAND DENSITY; STABLE-CARBON; GAS-EXCHANGE; EVAPORATIVE DEMAND; FUEL TREATMENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIERRA-NEVADA; CASCADE RANGE	A century of fire suppression across the Western United States has led to more crowded forests and increased competition for resources. Studies of forest thinning or stand conditions after mortality events have provided indirect evidence for how competition can promote drought stress and predispose forests to severe fire and/or bark beetle outbreaks. Here, we demonstrate linkages between fire deficits and increasing drought stress through analyses of annually resolved tree-ring growth, fire scars, and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) across a dry mixed-conifer forest landscape. Fire deficits across the study area have increased the sensitivity of leaf gas exchange to drought stress over the past >100 years. Since 1910, stand basal area in these forests has more than doubled and fire-return intervals have increased from 25 to 140 years. Meanwhile, the portion of interannual variation in tree-ring Delta C-13 explained by the Palmer Drought Severity Index has more than doubled in ca. 300-500-year-old Pinus ponderosa as well as in fire-intolerant, ca. 90-190-year-old Abies grandis. Drought stress has increased in stands with a basal area of >= 25 m(2)/ha in 1910, as indicated by negative temporal Delta C-13 trends, whereas stands with basal area <= 25 m(2)/ha in 1910, due to frequent or intense wildfire activity in decades beforehand, were initially buffered from increased drought stress and have benefited more from rising ambient carbon dioxide concentrations, [CO2], as demonstrated by positive temporal Delta C-13 trends. Furthermore, the average Delta C-13 response across all P. ponderosa since 1830 indicates that photosynthetic assimilation rates and stomatal conductance have been reduced by similar to 10% and similar to 20%, respectively, compared to expected trends due to increasing [CO2]. Although disturbance legacies contribute to local-scale intensity of drought stress, fire deficits have reduced drought resistance of mixed-conifer forests and made them more susceptible to challenges by pests and pathogens and other disturbances.

Yet, the spatiotemporal patterns of vulnerability to both short-term extreme events and gradual environmental changes are quite uncertain across the species' limits of tolerance to dryness. Such information is fundamental for defining ecologically relevant upper limits of species tolerance to drought and, hence, to predict the risk of increased forest mortality and shifts in species composition. We investigate here to what extent the impact of short- and long-term environmental changes determines vulnerability to climate change of three evergreen conifers (Scots pine, silver fir, Norway spruce) and two deciduous hardwoods (European beech, sessile oak) tree species at their southernmost limits of distribution in the Mediterranean Basin. Finally, we simulated future forest growth under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios using a multispecies generalized linear mixed model. Our analysis provides four key insights into the patterns of species' vulnerability to climate change. First, site climatic marginality was significantly linked to the growth trends: increasing growth was related to less climatically limited sites. Second, estimated species-specific vulnerability did not match their a priori rank in drought tolerance: Scots pine and beech seem to be the most vulnerable species among those studied despite their contrasting physiologies. Third, adaptation to site conditions prevails over species-specific determinism in forest response to climate change. And fourth, regional differences in forests vulnerability to climate change across the Mediterranean Basin are linked to the influence of summer atmospheric circulation patterns, which are not correctly represented in global climate models. Thus, projections of forest performance should reconsider the traditional classification of tree species in functional types and critically evaluate the fine-scale limitations of the climate data generated by global climate models.

Deeper thaw depths in combination with geomorphological changes due to the loss of ice structures in permafrost, may modify soil water distribution, creating wetter or drier soil conditions. Previous studies revealed higher ecosystem respiration rates under drier conditions, and this study investigated the cause of the increased ecosystem respiration rates using radiocarbon signatures of respired CO2 from two drying manipulation experiments: one in moist and the other in wet tundra. We demonstrate that higher contributions of CO2 from shallow soil layers (0-15 cm; modern soil carbon) drive the increased ecosystem respiration rates, while contributions from deeper soil (below 15 cm from surface and down to the permafrost table; old soil carbon) decreased. These changes can be attributed to more aerobic conditions in shallow soil layers, but also the soil temperature increases in shallow layers but decreases in deep layers, due to the altered thermal properties of organic soils. Decreased abundance of aerenchymatous plant species following drainage in wet tundra reduced old carbon release but increased aboveground plant biomass elevated contributions of autotrophic respiration to ecosystem respiration. The results of this study suggest that drier soils following drainage may accelerate decomposition of modern soil carbon in shallow layers but slow down decomposition of old soil carbon in deep layers, which may offset some of the old soil carbon loss from thawing permafrost.

In interaction with anthropogenic activities (flow regulation, channel restoration and catchment land-use) this will both increase flooding and drought across the world. Like in many other ecosystems facing changed environmental conditions, it remains difficult to predict the rate and trajectory of vegetation responses to changed conditions. Given that critical ecosystem services (e.g. bank stabilization, carbon subsidies to aquatic communities or water purification) depend on riparian vegetation composition, it is important to understand how and how fast riparian vegetation responds to changing flooding regimes. We studied vegetation changes over 19 growing seasons in turfs that were transplanted in a full-factorial design between three riparian elevations with different flooding frequencies. We found that (a) some transplanted communities may have developed into an alternative stable state and were still different from the target community, and (b) pathways of vegetation change were highly directional but alternative trajectories did occur, (c) changes were rather linear but faster when flooding frequencies increased than when they decreased, and (d) we observed fastest changes in turfs when proxies for mortality and colonization were highest. These results provide rare examples of alternative transient trajectories and stable states under field conditions, which is an important step towards understanding their drivers and their frequency in a changing world.

However, most efforts focus on abiotic drivers of plant biomass change, with little consideration for functional roles performed by animals, particularly at landscape scales. We combined repeat airborne Light Detection and Ranging with measurements of elephant densities, abiotic factors, and exclusion experiments to determine the relative importance of drivers of change in aboveground woody vegetation carbon stocks in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Despite a growing elephant population, aboveground carbon density (ACD) increased across most of the landscape over the 6-year study period, but at fine scales, bull elephant density was the most important factor determining carbon stock change, with ACD losses recorded only where bull densities exceeded 0.5 bulls/km(2). Effects of bull elephants were, however, spatially restricted and landscape dependent, being especially pronounced along rivers, at mid-elevations, and on steeper slopes. In contrast, elephant herds and abiotic drivers had a comparatively small influence on the direction or magnitude of carbon stock change. Our findings demonstrate that animals can have a substantive influence on regional-scale carbon dynamics and warrant consideration in carbon cycling models and policy formulation aimed at carbon management and climate change mitigation.

Long-term dietary shift and population decline of a pelagic seabird-A health check on the tropical Atlantic?

However, unravelling ecological changes that pre-date modern monitoring programmes remains challenging. Using stable isotope analysis of feathers and regurgitants collected from sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) nesting at a major Atlantic colony, we reconstructed a long-term dietary time series from 1890 to the present day and show that a significant dietary shift occurred during the second half of the twentieth century coinciding with an apparent population collapse of approximately 84%. After correcting for the "Suess Effect," delta C-13 in feathers declined by similar to 1.5 parts per thousand and delta N-15 by similar to 2 parts per thousand between the 1890s and the present day, indicating that birds changed their diets markedly over the period of population decline. Isotopic niches were equally wide before and after the population collapse but isotopic mixing models suggest that birds have grown ever more reliant on nutrient-poor squid and invertebrates as teleost fish have declined in availability. Given that sooty terns rely heavily on associations with sub-surface predators such as tuna to catch fish prey, the rapid expansion of industrialized fisheries for these species over the same period seems a plausible mechanism. Our results suggest that changes to marine ecosystems over the past 60 years have had a dramatic impact on the ecology of the most abundant seabird of tropical oceans, and highlight the potentially pervasive consequences of large predatory fish depletion on marine ecosystem function.

Resolving how the combination of warming and browning of aquatic ecosystems affects fish biomass production is essential for future ecosystem functioning, fisheries, and food security. In this study, we analyzed individual- and population-level fish data from 52 temperate and boreal lakes in Northern Europe, covering large gradients in water temperature and color (absorbance, 420 nm). We show that fish (Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis) biomass production decreased with both high water temperatures and brown water color, being lowest in warm and brown lakes. However, while both high temperature and brown water decreased fish biomass production, the mechanisms behind the decrease differed: temperature affected the fish biomass production mainly through a decrease in population standing stock biomass, and through shifts in size- and age-distributions toward a higher proportion of young and small individuals in warm lakes; brown water color, on the other hand, mainly influenced fish biomass production through negative effects on individual body growth and length-at-age. In addition to these findings, we observed that the effects of temperature and brown water color on individual-level processes varied over ontogeny. Body growth only responded positively to higher temperatures among young perch, and brown water color had a stronger negative effect on body growth of old than on young individuals. Thus, to better understand and predict future fish biomass production, it is necessary to integrate both individual- and population-level responses and to acknowledge within-species variation. Our results suggest that global climate change, leading to browner and warmer waters, may negatively affect fish biomass production, and this effect may be stronger than caused by increased temperature or water color alone.

The extent of humpback whale breeding habitats and the impact of temperature variation on their availability are both unknown. We used 19 years of dedicated survey data from seven countries and territories of Oceania (1,376 survey days), to investigate humpback whale breeding habitat diversity and adaptability to climate change. At a fine scale (1 km resolution), seabed topography was identified as an important influence on humpback whale distribution. The shallowest waters close to shore or in lagoons were favored, although humpback whales also showed flexible habitat use patterns with respect to shallow offshore features such as seamounts. At a coarse scale (1 degrees resolution), humpback whale breeding habitats in Oceania spanned a thermal range of 22.3-27.8 degrees C in August, with interannual variation up to 2.0 degrees C. Within this range, both fine and coarse scale analyses of humpback whale distribution suggested local responses to temperature. Notably, the most detailed dataset was available from New Caledonia (774 survey days, 1996-2017), where encounter rates showed a negative relationship to sea surface temperature, but were not related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation or the Antarctic Oscillation from previous summer, a proxy for feeding conditions that may impact breeding patterns. Many breeding sites that are currently occupied are predicted to become unsuitably warm for this species (>28 degrees C) by the end of the 21st century. Based on modeled ecological relationships, there are suitable habitats for relocation in archipelagos and seamounts of southern Oceania. Although distribution shifts might be restrained by philopatry, the apparent plasticity of humpback whale habitat use patterns and the extent of suitable habitats support an adaptive capacity to ocean warming in Oceania breeding grounds.

Despite the critical importance of soil respiration (Rs) in the global carbon and nutrient cycles, how plant diversity loss affects Rs remains uncertain. Here we present a meta-analysis using 446 paired observations from 95 published studies to evaluate the effects of plant and litter mixtures on Rs and its components. We found that total Rs and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) were, on average, greater in plant mixtures than expected from those of monocultures. These mixture effects increased with increasing species richness (SR) in both plant and litter mixtures. While the positive effects of species mixtures remained similar over time for total Rs, they increased over time for Rh in plant mixtures but decreased in litter mixtures. Despite the wide range of variations in mean annual temperature, annual aridity index, and ecosystem types, the plant mixture effects on total Rs and Rh did not change geographically, except for a more pronounced increase of total Rs in species mixtures with reduced water availability. Our structural equation models suggested that the positive effects of SR and stand age on total and Rh were driven by increased plant inputs and soil microbial biomass. Our results suggest that plant diversity loss has ubiquitous negative impacts on Rs, one of the fundamental carbon-cycle processes sustaining terrestrial element cycling and ecosystem function.

Using a foundation tree species, Populus angustifolia, observational and common garden approaches, and a base population genetic collection that spans 17 river systems in the western United States, from AZ to MT, we show that (a) as mean annual temperature (MAT) increases, genetic and phenotypic variation for bud break phenology decline; (b) soil microbiomes, soil nitrogen (N), and soil carbon (C) vary in response to MAT and conditioning by trees; and (c) with losses of genetic variation due to warming, population-level regulation of community and ecosystem functions strengthen. These results demonstrate a relationship between the potential evolutionary response of populations and subsequent shifts in ecosystem function along a large temperature gradient.

Using a 40 year old common garden experiment with replicated plots of eleven temperate tree species, we investigated relationships between soil organic matter (SOM) stability in mineral soils and 17 ecological factors (including tree tissue chemistry, magnitude of organic matter inputs to the soil and their turnover, microbial community descriptors, and soil physicochemical properties). We measured five SOM stability indices, including heterotrophic respiration, C in aggregate occluded particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral associated SOM, and bulk SOM delta N-15 and increment C-14. The stability of SOM varied substantially among tree species, and this variability was independent of the amount of organic C in soils. Thus, when considering forest soils as C sinks, the stability of C stocks must be considered in addition to their size. Further, our results suggest tree species regulate soil C stability via the composition of their tissues, especially roots. Stability of SOM appeared to be greater (as indicated by higher delta N-15 and reduced respiration) beneath species with higher concentrations of nitrogen and lower amounts of acid insoluble compounds in their roots, while SOM stability appeared to be lower (as indicated by higher respiration and lower proportions of C in aggregate occluded POM) beneath species with higher tissue calcium contents. The proportion of C in mineral associated SOM and bulk soil increment C-14, though, were negligibly dependent on tree species traits, likely reflecting an insensitivity of some SOM pools to decadal scale shifts in ecological factors. Strategies aiming to increase soil C stocks may thus focus on particulate C pools, which can more easily be manipulated and are most sensitive to climate change.

Bridging reproductive and microbial ecology: a case study in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							OFFSPRING SIZE; FATTY-ACIDS; R PACKAGE; COLONIZATION; SPORE; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; WALL; MICROORGANISMS; ERGOSTEROL; DISPERSAL	Offspring size is a key trait for understanding the reproductive ecology of species, yet studies addressing the ecological meaning of offspring size have so far been limited to macro-organisms. We consider this a missed opportunity in microbial ecology and provide what we believe is the first formal study of offspring-size variation in microbes using reproductive models developed for macro-organisms. We mapped the entire distribution of fungal spore size in the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (subphylum Glomeromycotina) and tested allometric expectations of this trait to offspring (spore) output and body size. Our results reveal a potential paradox in the reproductive ecology of AM fungi: while large spore-size variation is maintained through evolutionary time (independent of body size), increases in spore size trade off with spore output. That is, parental mycelia of large-spored species produce fewer spores and thus may have a fitness disadvantage compared to small-spored species. The persistence of the large-spore strategy, despite this apparent fitness disadvantage, suggests the existence of advantages to large-spored species that could manifest later in fungal life history. Thus, we consider that solving this paradox opens the door to fruitful future research establishing the relationship between offspring size and other AM life history traits.

Here, we argue that macro-evolutionary niche conservatism and unequal diversification rates among phylum-level lineages are strong determinants of diversit-yenvironment relationships in bacterial systems. That is, apart from stochasticity, environmental effects operate most strongly on phylum composition, which in turn dictates the species diversity of bacterial communities. This concept is demonstrated using bacterioplankton in the surface seawaters of the East China Sea. Furthermore, we show that the species richness of a local bacterioplankton community can generally be estimated based on the relative abundances of phyla and their contributions of species numbers in the global seawater pool-highlighting the important influence of evolutionary constraints on local community diversity.

Using a metabarcoding dataset of marine plankton from the global ocean, 318,054 mixotrophic metabarcodes represented by 89,951,866 sequences and belonging to 133 taxonomic lineages were identified and classified into four mixotrophic functional types: constitutive mixotrophs (CM), generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs (GNCM), endo-symbiotic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (eSNCM), and plastidic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (pSNCM). Mixotrophy appeared ubiquitous, and the distributions of the four mixotypes were analyzed to identify the abiotic factors shaping their biogeographies. Kleptoplastidic mixotrophs (GNCM and pSNCM) were detected in new zones compared to previous morphological studies. Constitutive and non-constitutive mixotrophs had similar ranges of distributions. Most lineages were evenly found in the samples, yet some of them displayed strongly contrasted distributions, both across and within mixotypes. Particularly divergent biogeographies were found within endo-symbiotic mixotrophs, depending on the ability to form colonies or the mode of symbiosis. We showed how metabarcoding can be used in a complementary way with previous morphological observations to study the biogeography of mixotrophic protists and to identify key drivers of their biogeography.

Recombination contributes to population diversification in the polyploid intestinal symbiont Epulopiscium sp. type B	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							GENETIC-TRANSFORMATION; BLUESPINE UNICORNFISH; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; HERBIVOROUS FISHES; STATISTICAL TESTS; GENOME EVOLUTION; MULLERS RATCHET; NASO-UNICORNIS; GUT MICROBIOTA; TROPHIC STATUS	Epulopiscium sp. type B (Lachnospiraceae) is an exceptionally large, highly polyploid, intestinal symbiont of the coral reef dwelling surgeonfish Naso tonganus. These obligate anaerobes do not form mature endospores and reproduce solely through the production of multiple intracellular offspring. This likely makes them dependent on immediate transfer to a receptive host for dispersal. During reproduction, only a small proportion of Epulopiscium mother-cell DNA is inherited. To explore the impact of this unusual viviparous lifestyle on symbiont population dynamics, we investigated Epulopiscium sp. type B and their fish hosts collected over the course of two decades, at island and reef habitats near Lizard Island, Australia. Using multi-locus sequence analysis, we found that recombination plays an important role in maintaining diversity of these symbionts and yet populations exhibit linkage disequilibrium (LD). Symbiont populations showed spatial but not temporal partitioning. Surgeonfish are long-lived and capable of traveling long distances, yet the population structures of Epulopiscium suggest that adult fish tend to not roam beyond a limited locale. Codiversification analyses and traits of this partnership suggest that while symbionts are obligately dependent on their host, the host has a facultative association with Epulopiscium. We suggest that congression of unlinked markers contributes to LD estimates in this and other recombinant populations of bacteria. The findings here inform our understanding of evolutionary processes within intestinal Lachnospiraceae populations.

Recent studies on self-thinning focus on understanding how the variability arises and are dedicated to a broader theory, with different biotic and abiotic factors suggested to explain the variability of the self thinning line. However, the relative role and importance of different factors in altering the self-thinning line are still unclear. Using a generic individual-based model which simultaneously implements different modes (symmetric versus asymmetric) of both competition and facilitation among individual plants, we explored the variability of the self-thinning line in simulated plant populations. We employed a machine learning approach (Random Forests) to evaluate the potential effect and importance of seven biotic and abiotic factors (i.e. mode of competition, mode of facilitation, abiotic stress level, initial density, initial spatial distribution pattern, threshold of death and method used for fitting self-thinning lines) on simulated self-thinning lines. Simulations of the individual-based model demonstrated a significant variation in self-thinning lines. Our Random Forests models were able to explain and predict more than 98% of the variation in both the slope and intercept of the self thinning line. These models identified mode of competition as being the most important factor that alters both the slope and intercept of the self-thinning line. For the variation of slope, other factors were much less important than competition. Most of the factors were more important in altering the intercept rather than the slope of self-thinning line. Changes of the slope and intercept in response to different factors indicated their divergent roles and partial effects on self-thinning mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that different biotic and abiotic factors have distinct effects and importance in altering the self-thinning rule, implying context dependent outcomes and consequences. We highlight that individual-based models and machine learning approaches are powerful tools to evaluate driving factors and to understand hidden mechanisms underlying complex patterns. The joint application of the two powerful tools will help to extend the framework of self-thinning and foster other research in ecology.

However, knowledge regarding water transfer induced water quality changes in determining fish communities in the impounding ecosystems remain largely unknown. In the current study, we filled this research gap by using a set of machine learning algorithms to ensemble modelling fish community indices with water quality indicators in the impounded lakes along the eastern route of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). Overall, our results realed that water quality changes can be good predictors for the variation of fish community structures in these lakes. Although different model techniques highlighted different variable importance of water quality in determining fish communities, there is generally a consensus that the hydrological related water quality indicators like: water clarity (e.g., total suspended solids) and nutrient loading (e.g., phosphate) contributed the most to the changes of fish communities. Our results also indicated that water diversions could bring knock-on effects on fish communities. Thus, more attention should be paid to long-term ecological effects from future water diversions.

Empirical studies collect data with increasing resolution and provide greater opportunities for its testing. However, several different density-dependent habitat selection models exist in the literature incorporating many different scenarios. We attempt to unify some of these models in a single framework, to increase our predictive power, and assist researchers in making predictions from combinations of these models. To achieve this, we created the generalized ideal free distribution, an expansion of the ideal free distribution model. With this model, we synthesize many of the previous theoretical developments in habitat selection to better incorporate temporal dynamics. By using community matrices to represent the interaction between individuals, we demonstrated that thirteen scenarios represented in other studies can be combined into a single model. In addition, for four of these scenarios, our predictions are similar to the original studies that developed these scenarios. Additionally, we derived four novel predictions that take advantage of using community matrices to represent distribution.

To understand and manage the impacts of N deposition, we need metrics which accurately reflect N deposition pressure on the environment, and are responsive to changes in both N deposition and its impacts over time. In the UK, the metric typically used is a measure of total N deposition over 1-3 years, despite evidence that N accumulates in many ecosystems and impacts from low-level exposure can take considerable time to develop. Improvements in N deposition modelling now allow the development of metrics which incorporate the long-term history of pollution, as well as current exposure. Here we test the potential of alternative N deposition metrics to explain vegetation compositional variability in British semi-natural habitats. We assembled 36 individual datasets representing 48,332 occurrence records in 5479 quadrats from 1683 sites, and used redundancy analyses to test the explanatory power of 33 alternative N metrics based on national pollutant deposition models. We find convincing evidence for N deposition impacts across datasets and habitats, even when accounting for other large-scale drivers of vegetation change. Metrics that incorporate long-term N deposition trajectories consistently explain greater compositional variance than 1-3 year N deposition. There is considerable variability in results across habitats and between similar metrics, but overall we propose that a thirty-year moving window of cumulative deposition is optimal to represent impacts on plant communities for application in science, policy and management.

Spatial variability in total and organic mercury levels in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba across the Scotia Sea	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Food-web; Egg laying; Crustacean; Southern Ocean; Contaminant	NATURAL GROWTH-RATES; TRACE-METALS; FOOD-WEB; ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS; NORTHEAST ATLANTIC; TEMPORAL VARIATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH-GEORGIA; ZOOPLANKTON; PENGUINS	Total and organic mercury concentrations were determined for males, females and juveniles of Euphausia superba collected at three discrete locations in the Scotia Sea (South Orkney Islands, South Georgia and Antarctic Polar Front) to assess spatial mercury variability in Antarctic krill. There was clear geographic differentiation in mercury concentrations, with specimens from the South Orkney Islands having total mercury concentrations 5 to 7 times higher than Antarctic krill from South Georgia and the Antarctic Polar Front. Mercury did not appear to accumulate with life-stage since juveniles had higher concentrations of total mercury (0.071 mu g g(-1) from South Orkney Islands; 0.014 mu g g(-1) from South Georgia) than adults (0.054 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.048 mu g g(-1) in males from South Orkney Islands; 0.006 mu g g(-1) in females and 0.007 mu g g(-1) in males from South Georgia). Results suggest that females may use egg laying as a mechanism to excrete mercury, with eggs having higher concentrations than the corresponding somatic tissue. Organic mercury makes up a minor percentage of total mercury (15-37%) with the percentage being greater in adults than in juveniles. When compared to euphausiids from other parts of the world, the concentration of mercury in Antarctic krill is within the same range, or higher, highlighting the global distribution of this contaminant. Given the high potential for biomagnification of mercury through food webs, concentrations in Antarctic krill may have deleterious effects on long-lived Antarctic krill predators.

Persistence of elevated concentrations of PM, affiliated pharmaceuticals, and tetracycline resistance genes downwind of feedyards	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Feedyard; Particulate matter; Steroids; Antibiotics; Beta agonists	AIRBORNE PARTICULATE MATTER; BEEF-CATTLE FEEDYARDS; ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE; GROWTH PROMOTERS; LIVESTOCK MANURE; FEEDLOT; EXPOSURE; 17-BETA-TRENBOLONE; DEPOSITION; TRANSPORT	Beef cattle feedyards have been identified as sources of large amounts of particulate matter (PM) which may transport affiliated chemicals including steroids, beta agonists, and antibiotics from feedyards into the environment. This study is the first to examine persistence of PM-affiliated pharmaceuticals downwind of feedyards using multiple downwind samples collected at increasing distances from feedyard boundaries (n = 5). Concentrations of antibiotics and ractopamine per gram of PM remained consistent at all downwind locations (out to 4.8 km) whereas concentrations per m(3) air decreased significantly at distances between 0.1 and 0.7 km downwind, corresponding to significant decreases in mass of PM. Monensin was present in the highest concentrations of any measured pharmaceutical, with concentrations of 371 mu g/g PM (376 ng/m(3)) air in samples collected within 0.1 km downwind of feedyards. Total copy count of tetracycline resistance genes (tetW, tetQ tetO, tetM, tett, and tetB) were also significantly increased in samples collected within 0.1 km downwind of feedyards (10(6) copies) as compared to samples collected upwind (10(3) copies) and farther downwind (10(4) copies) of feedyard boundaries. These results suggest that transport of pharmaceutical-laden PM into the terrestrial environment is occurring primarily via PM deposition within 0.7 km of the feedyard, while aerial transport persists over longer distances (>4.8 km).

Many epidemiological studies have reported the association between O-3 pollution and mortality, only a few studies have focused on the O-3-related mortality and corresponding economic effects at the Chinese city and province level. This study reports the seasonal variation of ground-level O-3 in 338 cities of China during the year 2016 and evaluates its effect on premature mortality and economic loss. It further illustrates the differences in cause-specific mortality outcomes of the log-linear and linear model, two of the prominently used methods for estimating health effects. In 2016, the annual average daily maximum 8-h O-3 concentration in China ranged between 74 and 201 mu g/m(3) (138 +/- 24.7 mu g/m(3)). 30% of the total population was exposed to >160 mu g/m(3) O-3 concentration (Chinese national ambient air quality standard) and about 67.2% urban population lived in exposure above the WHO recommended O-3 concentrations (100 aim3). The estimated national O-3-attributable mortality was 74.2 x 10(3) (95% CI: 16.7 x 10(3)-127 x 10(3)) in the log-linear model, whereas, the total O-3-related mortality using the linear model was 69.6 x 10(3) (95% Cl: 16.2 x 10(3)-115 x 10(3)). The exposure to O-3 caused a nationwide economic loss of about 7.6 billion US$ (range: 1.7-12.9) in 2016. This study uniquely provides most comprehensive coverage of the Chinese cities for O-3 associated mortality utilizing ground level measurement data for 2016 and presents a measurable assessment to the policymakers of China for streamlining their efforts on air quality improvement and O-3 containment.

Here, the main source of N input to the ecosystem is via N-2 fixation by moss- and lichen-associated bacteria. While inhibitory effects of N deposition on moss-associated N-2 fixation have been reported, we still lack understanding of the effects of traffic derived N and heavy metal deposition on this ecosystem function in an otherwise pristine setting. To test this, we established a distance gradient (0-1280 m) away from a metal pollution source -a railway transporting iron ore that passes through a subarctic birch forest. We assessed the effects of railway-derived pollution on N-2 fixation associated with two moss species Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens and with the lichen Peltigera aphthosa. Deposition and availability of N and heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb) as well as the respective contents in moss, lichen and soil was assessed. While we found a steep gradient in metal concentration in moss, lichen and soil with distance away from the pollution source, N deposition did not change, and with that, we could not detect a distance gradient in moss- or lichen-associated N-2 fixation. Hence, our results indicate that N-2 fixing bacteria are either not inhibited by heavy metal deposition, or that they are protected within the moss carpet and lichen tissue. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effects of regional pollution levels and specific feeding habits on the bioaccumulation of EDCs in fish are rarely reported. 4-Nonylphenol (4-NP), bisphenol A (BPA), 4-tert-octylpheno] (4-t-OP), triclocarban (TCC) and triclosan (TCS) were determined in abiotic compartments [water, sediment, suspended particulate matter (SPM)] and fish with different feeding habits along the Pearl River, China. EDCs in abiotic compartments exhibited significant (p <0.05) spatial variations, forming five zones clustered based on site-specific EDC concentrations. 4-NP was the dominant compound, contributing 58-98% of the EDCs in fish, followed by BPA (<41%), 4-t-OP (<13%), and TCC and TCS (<4.7%). The concentrations of 4-NP and 4-t-OP, SPA, and TCC and TCS were the highest in brackish carnivorous, planktivorous, and detritivorous fish, respectively. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) showed that 4-NP accumulated (BAF> 5000) in all fish except for suck-feeding detritivores, while 4-t-OP and TCC accumulated in filter-feeding planktivores. The concentration of 4-NP in carnivores was significantly higher than that in detritivores, indicating the potential biomagnification of 4-NP along food chains. EDCs in sediment and SPM and those in water were most positively correlated with those in detritivores and planktivores, respectively, suggesting the potential of fish with these two feeding habits to act as bioindicators of EDC pollutants.

The aims of this study were (a) to compare the global pattern of species richness in Cuculidae with species richness of birds, amphibians and mammals; (b) whether it is spatially congruent with hotspot areas of biodiversity at a global scale; and (c) whether the distribution of night light intensity reflecting human population density is associated with cuckoo species richness. We mapped the global distribution of all cuckoo species, classified as parasitic or non-parasitic species. Species richness was calculated at a fixed spatial scale for: Cuculidae, amphibians, birds and mammals. We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Models in order to explore the associations between species richness of each group of animals, night light intensity and hotspots of biodiversity areas at a global scale. Worldwide patterns of species richness of parasitic and non-parasitic cuckoos reflected species richness of birds, amphibians and mammals. In addition, and importantly, species richness of cuckoos was spatially congruent with hotspot areas of biodiversity across the world. Finally, night light intensity was slightly positively associated with species richness of parasitic cuckoos. Our findings confirmed that cuckoos constitute an important surrogate of high species richness of different animal taxa at a global scale: It is easy to learn how to identify cuckoos, whereas other species of birds, mammals or amphibians can only be identified by specialists. Our findings also suggest that other parasitic cuckoo species can be used as a biodiversity surrogate in a similar way as the common cuckoo in Eurasia.

Quantifying the contribution of conservation easements to large-landscape conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article							PRIVATE LAND CONSERVATION; PROTECTED AREAS; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONNECTIVITY; HABITAT; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; NETWORK; SYSTEM	Private lands are critical for conservation of ecosystem diversity and sustaining large-scale ecological processes. Increasingly, conservation easements (CE) are used as a tool to protect private land from future development; yet, few studies have examined whether contemporary patterns of CE effectively contribute to landscape scale biodiversity and ecosystem conservation goals. We analyzed the distribution of 1223 CE established between 1970 and 2016 in the High Divide, a region dominated by public lands and of national conservation importance in the Rocky Mountains of the United States, with respect to ecosystem representation and landscape connectivity, two common large-scale conservation goals. We found that CE were frequently located closer to water and to other land protected for biodiversity (e.g., GAP 1 and 2 status) than were private lands more generally. CE provided increased representation within the protected areas network for 10% of the ecosystems within the region, particularly for mesic and riparian areas. Despite the addition of CE to the protected areas network, we found insufficient representation for 43 out of 87 ecosystems (< 5% representation on land managed for biodiversity). Protection of priority ecosystems varied across CE and illustrated potential mismatches between regional and national scale conservation goals. Furthermore, while public lands contributed the most toward conserving important areas for connectivity, CE protected potential landscape connectivity only slightly more effectively than randomly allocated areas. CE provide important complements to public lands in terms of ecosystem diversity and landscape connectivity. However, conservation planners and land managers could increase conservation benefits from CE by prioritizing under-represented ecosystems and more explicitly targeting lands to maintain landscape permeability.

We investigated the conservation value of moist evergreen Afromontane forest sites across gradients of site-level disturbance, landscape context and forest history in southwestern Ethiopia. We surveyed woody plants at 108 randomly selected sites and grouped them into forest specialist, pioneer, and generalist species. First, we investigated if coffee dominance, current distance from the forest edge, forest history, heat load and altitude structured the variation in species composition using constrained correspondence analysis. Second, we modelled species richness in response to the same explanatory variables. Our findings show that woody plant community composition was significantly structured by altitude, forest history, coffee dominance and current distance from forest edge. Specifically, (1) total species richness and forest specialist species richness were affected by coffee management intensity; (2) forest specialist species richness increased, while pioneer species decreased with increasing distance from the forest edge; and (3) forest specialist species richness was lower in secondary forest compared to in primary forest. These findings show that coffee management intensity, landscape context and forest history in combination influence local and landscape level biodiversity. We suggest conservation strategies that foster the maintenance of large undisturbed forest sites and that prioritize local species in managed and regenerating forests. Creation of a biosphere reserve and shade coffee certification could be useful to benefit both effective conservation and people's livelihoods.

Using data from MPAs where changes have been detected due to ocean warming, can help inform discussion on how to increase temporal robustness in planning. Our aim was to determine how well fish assemblage patterns, used to develop a Habitat Classification System (HCS) as a coarse biodiversity surrogate in MPA planning, persisted over a 16 year timeframe in a warming region (east coast subtropics) of Australia. We analysed persistence/change in fish assemblage patterns in the Solitary Islands Marine Park (SIMP) where species shifts and habitat changes associated with ocean warming have been detected. Fish relative abundance was recorded at 12 sites over 16 years (2001-2017) using roving timed counts. Strong cross-shelf patterns were maintained over that 16 year period, which included some large-scale disturbances (destructive storms, 2016 mass coral bleaching event). Overall persistence in these broad assemblage patterns suggest a well-designed HCS can be a robust tool for coarsely representing biodiversity patterns in a warming world at decadal scales. 'Tropicalisation' was detected in some categories, suggesting additional planning strategies are needed within those and beyond decadal plans.

The distribution of each species was compared with levels of construction disturbance and environmental variables using Hurdle Model analysis and spatial referencing. Numbers of all four species varied throughout the study period with significant increases observed across the reservoir during the four year construction period. Findings show that the most important environmental variable was shallow water with increases in this area of habitat as a result of planned enhancement measures being of particular benefit to Gadwall, Shoveler and Teal. Numbers of Wigeon were especially variable across the site during construction and were displaced from the Main Section during the most disturbing shoreline works, behaviour we attribute to the loss of suitable grazing habitat during the construction process. While results show some disturbance responses, maintenance of site integrity for all four species is attributed to the overall size of the reservoir complex (4.75 km(2)) and the phased construction programme which reduced the extent and impact of disturbance. Research presented here provides evidence for a sensitive and science based approach to better deliver conservation and development requirements. The monitoring prior to (2006-2009) and during the construction phase (2010-2013) has enabled the much needed, but often lacking, evidence-based reporting on construction disturbance effects and associated mitigation measures.

Fourteen placentas at term were perfused in an open dual circuit with deuterated BPS (1 and 5 mu M) and non-labelled BPSG (2.5 mu M) and a freely diffusing marker antipyrine (800 ng/ml) in the presence of albumin (25 mg/ml). In a second experiment, the potential role of P-glycoprotein in the active efflux of BPS across the placental barrier was studied using the well-established P-glycoprotein inhibitor, PSC833 (2 and 4 mu M). Placental transfer of BPS was much lower than that of BPA in both directions. The placental clearance index of BPS in the materno-fetal direction was three times lower than in the opposite direction, strongly suggesting some active efflux transport. However, our results show that P-glycoprotein is not involved in limiting the materno-fetal transfer of BPS. Placental transfer of BPSG in the fetal compartment was almost non-existent indicating that, in the fetal compartment, BPSG originates mainly from feto-placental metabolism. The feto-maternal clearance index for BPSG was 20-fold higher than the materno-fetal index. We conclude that the blood-placental barrier is much more efficient in limiting fetal exposure to BPS than to BPA, indicating that the placenta has a crucial role in protecting the human fetus from BPS exposure.

A singular value decomposition Bayesian multiple-trait and multiple-environment genomic model	HEREDITY			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAITS; GRAIN-YIELD; SELECTION; PREDICTION; INDEXES	Today, breeders perform genomic-assisted breeding to improve more than one trait. However, frequently there are several traits under study at one time, and the implementation of current genomic multiple-trait and multiple-environment models is challenging. Consequently, we propose a four-stage analysis for multiple-trait data in this paper. In the first stage, we perform singular value decomposition (SVD) on the resulting matrix of trait responses; in the second stage, we perform multiple trait analysis on transformed responses. In stages three and four, we collect and transform the traits back to their original state and obtain the parameter estimates and the predictions on these scale variables prior to transformation. The results of the proposed method are compared, in terms of parameter estimation and prediction accuracy, with the results of the Bayesian multiple-trait and multiple-environment model (BMTME) previously described in the literature. We found that the proposed method based on SVD produced similar results, in terms of parameter estimation and prediction accuracy, to those obtained with the BMTME model. Moreover, the proposed multiple-trait method is atractive because it can be implemented using current single-trait genomic prediction software, which yields a more efficient algorithm in terms of computation.

Disentangling the genetic effects of refugial isolation and range expansion in a trans-continentally distributed species	HEREDITY			English	Article							TURTLE CHRYSEMYS-PICTA; ECOLOGICAL-NICHE MODELS; PAINTED TURTLES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; NORTH-AMERICA; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; SOFTWARE; MITOCHONDRIAL; EVOLUTION	In wide-ranging taxa with historically dynamic ranges, past allopatric isolation and range expansion can both influence the current structure of genetic diversity. Considering alternate historical scenarios involving expansion from either a single refugium or from multiple refugia can be useful in differentiating the effects of isolation and expansion. Here, we examined patterns of genetic variability in the trans-continentally distributed painted turtle (Chrysemys picta). We utilized an existing phylogeographic dataset for the mitochondrial control region and generated additional data from nine populations for the mitochondrial control region (n = 302) and for eleven nuclear microsatellite loci (n = 247). We created a present-day ecological niche model (ENM) for C. picta and hindcast this model to three reconstructions of historical climate to define three potential scenarios with one, two, or three refugia. Finally, we employed spatially-explicit coalescent simulations and an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework to test which scenario best fit the observed genetic data. Simulations indicated that phylogeographic and multilocus population-level sampling both could differentiate among refugial scenarios, although inferences made using mitochondrial data were less accurate when a longer coalescence time was assumed. Furthermore, all empirical genetic datasets were most consistent with expansion from a single refugium based on ABC. Our results indicate a stronger role for post-glacial range expansion, rather than isolation in allopatric refugia followed by range expansion, in structuring diversity in this species. To distinguish among complex historical scenarios, we recommend explicitly modeling the effects of range expansion and evaluating alternate refugial scenarios for wide-ranging taxa.	[Reid, B.

Selection, drift, and introgression shape MHC polymorphism in lizards	HEREDITY			English	Article							MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX; PODARCIS-ERHARDII LACERTIDAE; CLASS IIB GENE; BALANCING SELECTION; TRANSSPECIES POLYMORPHISM; MICROSATELLITE MARKERS; CONVERGENT EVOLUTION; ISLAND POPULATIONS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GREEN LIZARDS	The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has long served as a model for the evolution of adaptive genetic diversity in wild populations. Pathogen-mediated selection is thought to be a main driver of MHC diversity, but it remains elusive to what degree selection shapes MHC diversity in complex biogeographical scenarios where other evolutionary processes (e.g. genetic drift and introgression) may also be acting. Here we focus on two closely related green lizard species, Lacerta trilineata and L. viridis, to address the evolutionary forces acting on MHC diversity in populations with different biogeographic structure. We characterized MHC class I exon 2 and exon 3, and neutral diversity (microsatellites), to study the relative importance of selection, drift, and introgression in shaping MHC diversity. As expected, positive selection was a significant force shaping the high diversity of MHC genes in both species. Moreover, introgression significantly increased MHC diversity in mainland populations, with a primary direction of gene flow from L. viridis to L. trilineata. Finally, we found significantly fewer MHC alleles in island populations, but maintained MHC sequence and functional diversity, suggesting that positive selection counteracted the effect of drift. Overall, our data support that different evolutionary processes govern MHC diversity in different biogeographical scenarios: positive selection occurs broadly while introgression acts in sympatry and drift when the population sizes decrease.

The genetic characteristics underlying the evolutionary success of the tree growth form: high genetic diversity, extensive gene flow and strong species integrity, contribute to their survival in terms of adaptability. However, different biological and landscape contexts challenge these characteristics. This study employs 63 de novo developed microsatellite or SSR (Single Sequence Repeat) markers in different datasets of nine Neotropical Magnolia species. The genetic patterns of these protogynous, insect-pollinated tree species occurring in fragmented, highly-disturbed landscapes were investigated. Datasets containing a total of 340 individuals were tested for their genetic structure and degree of inbreeding. Analyses for genetic structure depicted structuring between species, i.e. strong species integrity. Within the species, all but one population pair were considered moderate to highly differentiated, i.e. no indication of extensive gene flow between populations. No overall correlation was observed between genetic and geographic distance of the pairwise species' populations. In contrast to the pronounced genetic structure, there was no evidence of inbreeding within the populations, suggesting mechanisms favouring cross pollination and/or selection for more genetically diverse, heterozygous offspring. In conclusion, the data illustrate that the Neotropical Magnolias in the context of a fragmented landscape still have ample gene flow within populations, yet little gene flow between populations.

Fish assemblage-environment relationships suggest differential trophic responses to heavy metal contamination	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						catchment; ecotoxicology; geographic information systems; hydrology; species distribution modelling	OLD LEAD BELT; LAND-COVER; BIG RIVER; SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; PISCIVOROUS BASS; GRAZING MINNOWS; ACUTE TOXICITY; WATER-QUALITY; STREAM	While ecotoxicology has long recognised the importance of identifying levels at which contaminants pose threats to biota, most estimates of species responses to toxicants are derived from controlled laboratory studies and may hold limited relevance to natural systems. However, designing appropriate field-based studies investigating contaminant induced changes in assemblages has been challenging, partially due to the difficulty in identifying comparable uncontaminated reference sites. The aim of this study is to characterise the effects of heavy metal contamination on natural fish assemblages using an ecologically relevant catchment-scale design. We hypothesise that environmental variables, including discharge, sediment, and landscape variables, can be used to characterise differences in fish species richness and abundances between sites contaminated with heavy metals and uncontaminated reference sites. We apply a geographic information systems approach that uses assemblage-environment relationships developed using hydrologic model outputs, land cover, and topographic data from uncontaminated reference sites to predict expected fish species richness and abundance at sites contaminated with heavy-metals within the Big River catchment in south-eastern Missouri, U.S.A. These predicted levels of richness and abundance are then compared to observed assemblages at contaminated sites to estimate the potential impacts of historical lead mining activities on freshwater taxa. We developed models that characterised variation in Centrarchidae (bass and sunfish) richness and abundance, Cyprinidae (minnows) abundance, and Percidae (darters) richness using variables including streamflow regime, suspended sediment concentration, and land cover at uncontaminated sites. Using these relationships, we predicted expected fish species richness and abundance at heavy metal contaminated sites across the Big River catchment and found a significant reduction in centrarchid abundance from field-collected data compared to predicted estimates. Our results suggest that centrarchids, which tend to occupy a higher trophic level than cyprinids and percids, have lower abundances at sites contaminated with heavy metals than predicted by assemblage-environment relationships. These decreases in abundance are not associated with decreases in centrarchid species richness, cyprinid abundance, or percid richness. This geographic information systems-based approach provides a useful and ecologically relevant framework for understanding the response of taxa to the presence of contaminants without assuming habitat equivalence across sites. Our findings also suggest the need for further research regarding how heavy metals impact fishes of varying trophic levels in natural settings.

This may cause important shifts in ecosystem functioning through the functional feeding patterns of benthic organisms that rely differently on climatically altered carbon resources. Twenty-five subarctic lakes in Finnish Lapland across a tree line ecotone were analysed for limnological and optical variables, carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope (SI) composition of surface sediment organic matter (OM) and fossil Chironomidae (Diptera) remains to examine environmental controls behind chironomid functional feeding group (FFG) structure and their isotopic associations for assessing ecosystem functioning and carbon utilisation. We hypothesise that the chironomid SI signatures reflect increased allochthony with increasing allochthonous input, but the resource use may be altered by the functional characteristics of the assemblage. Multivariate analyses indicated that carbon geochemistry in the sediments (delta C-13, delta N-15, C/N), nutrients, indices of productivity (chlorophyll-a) and lake water optical properties, related to increasing presence of OM, played a key role in defining the chironomid FFG composition and isotopic signatures. Response modelling was used to examine how individual FFGs respond to environmental gradients. They showed divergent responses for OM quantity, dissolved organic carbon and nutrients between feeding strategies, suggesting that detritivores and filter feeders prefer contrasting carbon and nutrient conditions, and may thus hold paleoecological indicator potential to identify changes between different carbon fluxes. Benthic production was the primary carbon source for the chironomid assemblages according to a three-source SI mixing model, whereas pelagic and terrestrial components contributed less. Between-lake variability in source utilisation was high and controlled primarily by allochthonous OM inputs. Combination of biogeochemical modelling and functional classification is useful to widen our understanding of subarctic lake ecosystem functions and responses to climate-driven changes in limnology and catchment characteristics for long-term environmental change assessments and functional paleoecology.

Hierarchy theory, a central tenet of riverscape ecology, allows for investigating ecological relationships between aquatic organisms and habitat by exploring the nested interactions inherent in reaches, segments, and basins. Arkansas darter Etheostoma cragini is a Great Plains fish endemic to the Arkansas River basin and is listed as in need of conservation in all five states within its range in North America. The aim of this study was to develop empirical models describing relationships between Arkansas darter abundance and local habitats, and identify the appropriate scale(s) for assessing and managing populations. We used Arkansas darter abundance data collected from stream sample units as a fixed grain size (10(2) m) and compiled datasets at three hierarchical spatial extents, including reach (10(3) m), nested within segment (10(4) m), nested within basin (10(5) m) in southcentral Kansas. We fit generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) to assess scale-specific relationships between Arkansas darter abundance and local habitat dimensions (stream depth and width) and heterogeneity (canopy cover, overhanging vegetation, and woody structure). Habitat parameters included in best-supported GLMMs differed among extents. Variation in Arkansas darter abundance was explained by canopy cover and channel depth at the reach (54% explained) and segment (56%) extents, and stream width and depth at the basin extent (37%). Partial dependence plots from multiple regression GLMMs revealed that Arkansas darter abundance was negatively correlated with increasing channel depth across all extents, increasing canopy cover at reach and segment extents, and increasing channel width at the basin extent. Our results highlight scale-specific relationships between Arkansas darter abundance and local habitats across multiple spatial extents. These findings provide direction for assessing stream fish ecology pattern-process relationships at the appropriate spatial scales and benefit native fish conservation by highlighting the application of hierarchy theory to address management challenges.

Microbial and macroinvertebrate communities, but not leaf decomposition, change along a mining-induced salinity gradient	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						beta-diversity; coal mining; community composition; freshwater ecosystem; stressor	SPECIES RICHNESS; FRESH-WATER; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL; ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE; MAJOR IONS; SALINIZATION; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; BREAKDOWN	Natural levels of salinity in aquatic ecosystems drive biodiversity patterns across broad spatial scales; however, less is known about changes in biotic communities and the ecosystem functions they support along anthropogenic salinisation gradients. Resource extraction often causes salinisation of freshwater ecosystems which may extirpate salinity-sensitive macroinvertebrates and microbes and thus reduce rates of organic matter decomposition. We quantified bacterial (16S), fungal (ITS) and macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness, composition, and beta-diversity across the resulting gradient of specific conductance (annual mean: 25-1,383 mu S/cm) in 24 headwater streams in the eastern U.S.A. variously influenced by surface coal mining but selected to minimise habitat and water-quality differences other than salinity. Furthermore, we measured rates of organic matter decomposition in submersed leaf packs (Quercus alba) across these same sites. Bacterial and reach-wide macroinvertebrate richness was reduced along the mining-induced salinity gradient whereas fungal or leaf-pack macroinvertebrate richness remained similar. Community composition of microbes and macroinvertebrates changed along the salinity gradient, with mining-influenced sites becoming increasingly dissimilar to reference sites as salinity increased. Beta-diversity was driven by taxonomic replacement rather than nestedness for microbial and macroinvertebrate communities. Organic matter decomposition rates in mining-influenced streams were not reduced even at mean specific conductance levels 10x higher than reference sites. We attribute maintenance of decomposition rates to salinity tolerance of both fungi and macroinvertebrate shredders found in leaf packs. Our study informs theory linking anthropogenic alteration of biotic communities to rates of ecosystem functions by providing evidence that taxonomic replacement and stressor-tolerance of specific functional groups along a mining-induced salinity gradient can maintain certain ecosystem functions, at least within the studied salinity range. We therefore advise against generalising biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships in other salinised systems, but caution that organic matter decomposition may be altered at salinity levels above those observed in our study and that other ecosystem functions may be affected by loss of salinity-sensitive taxa.

Pockets of resistance: Response of arid-land fish communities to climate, hydrology, and wildfire	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						drought; fish community; long-term data; resilience; resistance	FRESH-WATER; NONNATIVE FISHES; NATIVE FISHES; SPECIES TRAITS; FLOW REGIMES; GILA RIVER; PERSISTENCE; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; DYNAMICS	Disturbance regimes of arid regions throughout the world are changing along with global warming. Severity of drought associated with decreased stream discharge and increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are increasing in many of these systems. Combined, these factors can have potentially devastating effects on stream fish communities. To quantify the response of fish communities to annual variation in climate, hydrology, and wildfire, we used long-term and spatially extensive datasets from the Gila River drainage, NM, U.S.A. Additionally, we tracked the recovery of multiple fish communities within the study area following extreme drought and associated wildfires that occurred between 2011 and 2013. Twenty-nine years of monitoring at six sites, beginning in 1988, indicated that fish community richness and density were negatively associated with drought, as quantified by the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Ordination of fish species densities across these sites further suggested that native species were more sensitive to inter-annual variation in climate than non-native fishes. The resistance and resilience of fishes to drought and ash flows following the most severe series of wildfires on record between 2011 and 2013 were highly variable across sites and species. The percent of common species that were able to resist a significant decline ranged from 0 to 70%, depending on location. As of 2017, all but two species (one native and one non-native) had recovered at one or more sites. Although we hypothesised that the response to wildfire and drought that occurred between 2011 and 2013 should vary with body size and species provenance (native or non-native), this was not supported. Rather, resistance of fish communities to these events appeared to be driven primarily by spatial factors, such as intensity of disturbance, and resilience was driven by species ability to rapidly rebound from severely depressed numbers or immigrate from nearby refuge populations. Current climate trends suggest an increase in the intensity of disturbance associated with wildfire and drought; thus, maintenance of native biodiversity should focus on preservation of habitat integrity and connectivity among habitats that allows for recolonisation of disturbed habitats.

Assessing the conservation potential of fish and corals in aquariums globally	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Animal records; Animal records; Species360/ZIMS; Data sharing; Collection planning; Species vulnerable to climate change; Zoo	PUBLIC AQUARIUMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; ZOOS; EXTINCTION; PRIORITIES	Aquatic ecosystems are indispensable for life on earth and yet despite their essential function and service roles, marine and freshwater biomes are facing unprecedented threats from both traditional and emerging anthropogenic stressors. The resultant species and ecosystem-level threat severity requires an urgent response from the conservation community. With their care facilities, veterinary and conservation breeding expertise, reintroduction and restoration, and public communication reach, stand-alone aquariums and zoos holding aquatic taxa have great collective potential to help address the current biodiversity crisis, which is now greater in freshwater than land habitats. However, uncertainty regarding the number of species kept in such facilities hinders assessment of their conservation value. Here we analyzed, standardized and shared data of zoological institution members of Species360, for fish and Anthozoa species (i.e. Actinopterygii, Elasmobranchii, Holocephali, Myxini, Sarcopterygii and Anthozoa). To assess the conservation potential of populations held in these institutions, we cross-referenced the Species360 records with the following conservation schemes: the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), the IUCN Red List of Threatened species, climate change vulnerability, Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) and The Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). We found that aquariums hold four of the six fish species listed by the IUCN Red List as 'Extinct in the Wild', 31% of Anthozoa species listed by Foden et al. (2013) as vulnerable to climate change, 19 out of the 111 Anthozoa EDGE species, and none of the species prioritized by the AZE. However, it is very likely that significant additional species of high conservation value are held in aquariums that do not manage their records in standardized, sharable platforms such as Species360. Our study highlights both the great value of aquarium and zoo collections for addressing the aquatic biodiversity crisis, as well as the importance that they maintain comprehensive, standardised, globally-shared taxonomic data.

A case study in snapdragons	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION			English	Article						Conservation; Endangered species; Field research; Hybridization; Molecular markers; Reproductive barrier	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; ORIGINS; HYBRIDS; PLANTS; SIZE	Hybridization, natural or artificial, is considered disadvantageous for species biodiversity when it threatens the population integrity of endangered species. Frequently, studies investigating whether hybridization poses a legitimate risk to rare species are based on genetic data obtained in molecular biology laboratories. In this study, we used field research to approach the problem that hybridization could cause for the viability of a population of a rare species and to be able to propose the most appropriate initial conservation strategy. Specifically, using the model genus Antirrhinum, the reproductive barriers between the rare A. pulverulentum and its common congener A. litigiosum have been analysed under the reproductive isolation index (RI). A. pulverulentum had a high value of total RI, indicating that there are barriers to gene flow from A. litigiosum towards this species, and also had a high value for the intrinsic RI, reflecting a low inherent capacity for production of hybrid plants; in addition, the possibility of successful backcrosses between this species with hybrids produced from A. litigiosum ovules were low, given the high intrinsic RI of A. litigiosum. These data indicate the current existence of strong and permanent barriers to hybridization between the two species, suggesting that hybridization does not seem to be a serious problem for the conservation of A. pulverulentum in the studied population, nor for the near future. This study shows how the RI index can provide useful information for conservation purposes and proposes different management recommendations.

To better understand the interaction of M. sjostedti to cowpea cultivars to improve management efforts, we investigated the repellent properties of volatiles of four cowpea cultivars, namely Ex-Luanda, Machakos, Ken Kunde 1 and Katumani 80 at different phenological stages. Bioassays were conducted to study host preference and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for chemical analysis of volatiles. Our results showed no significant preference of females M. sjostedti for any cowpea cultivars tested in preference assays. However, in olfactometer, the volatiles emitted during the vegetative stage of only Ex-Luanda, Machakos and Katumani 80 cultivars were repellent to females, while only Ken Kunde 1 was repellent to males. Volatiles from flowers of Ken Kunde 1 were attractive to females, whereas volatiles from the flowers of Katumani 80 were repellent, respectively. Ex-Luanda and Machakos elicited neutral response. Flowers of Machakos 66 and Ex-Luanda cultivars were repellent to males, while Katumani 80 and Ken Kunde 1 were neutral. The volatile analysis showed that (E)--ocimene and 1-octen-3-ol were unique to the volatile profile of Katumani 80 flowers. Previous study showed that (E)-2-hexenal and hexanal were only abundant in the vegetative stage of Katumani 80. (E)-2-hexenal was repellent to the females at a concentration of 0.01% but not at 1%. Hexanal, (E)--ocimene and 1-octen-3-ol elicited a neutral response from females at 0.01% and 1%. Our study indicates that (E)-2-hexenal could be useful in the development of semiochemical-based repellent tools for M. sjostedti management.	[Diabate, Seydou; Deletre, Emilie; Fiaboe, Komi K.

Our objective was to examine community-level species invasion as a function of multiple competing hypotheses. Methods We used data from >3500 woodland plant species in 2750 plots in 49 national parks in eastern US deciduous forests to test multiple competing theories of species invasion: competition, empty niche, propagule pressure and latitude matching. We also tested interactions with residence time to account for non-native species naturalization and spread since arrival. Important Findings The non-native herbs generally thrived at latitudes similar to those from which they originated, but not necessarily where they were originally introduced to the eastern US. Overall, we found that each hypothesis explained at least some aspect of woodland plant species invasion, but examining them simultaneously allowed assessment of their relative strengths and interactions. Our results suggested that residence time is a strong predictor of non-native woodland plant success, particularly as it interacts with other mechanisms of invasion, such as competition (abundance of native woodland plants), climate matching (similar invaded latitude as home range), propagule pressure (distance to putative seed sources) and empty niche (relatedness to native plants). We found that initial barriers, such as distance from propagule source or suboptimal habitat, were overcome, as was resistance from native relatives. However, the biggest challenge for the non-native woodland plants appeared to be time, as they declined after 1 to 2 centuries.

While necessity for restoration grows, no information on restoration potential of grasslands after afforestation exists. Here, we aim at analyzing composition and structure of grassland vegetation with a history of eucalyptus plantations in order to assess recovery potential of these areas. We hypothesized that areas with history of eucalyptus would differ from reference grasslands with no history of land-use change in terms of floristic and functional composition and would present lower species richness. Methods Our study region comprised four sites in the southeastern part of the Pampa biome, in the coastal plain in the extreme south of Brazil, always with sites with long (50 years) history of eucalyptus plantation and reference grassland. We sampled vegetation at post-eucalyptus sites (with and without resprouting) 10 years after clearclutting and in natural grasslands. We analyzed data by analysis of variance and ordination techniques, considering compositional parameters and life forms, and indicator species analysis. Important Findings Species richness and vegetation cover were higher in reference grassland than in resprout areas but did not differ from post-eucalyptus areas. Exotic species cover was significantly higher in areas with afforestation history. In terms of total composition, natural grasslands differed significantly from areas with past plantation use. Indicator species analyses revealed considerable differences between grassland types. In conclusion, vegetation development led to grassland communities that are still quite distinct from reference sites. Likely, the specificity of grassland management has a high importance in defining vegetation trajectories in time and importance for grassland recovery, and restoration needs to be addressed in more studies.

While several studies have addressed spatial patterns of some mycorrhizal, saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi, the method based on fruit-body surveys is not efficient and unreliable to study the spatial pattern of root-associated fungal species because most fungi in plant roots do not have sporocarps and cannot be identified based only on morphological traits. Our aims are (i) to determine the spatial pattern of common root-associated fungi; (ii) to evaluate whether the abundance and spatial pattern of root-associated fungi and categories of fungi, reflect their biotic and abiotic niche constraints. Methods About 828 soil cores were collected from a 24-ha plot in a subtropical forest and Illumina Miseq was carried out to determine fungal composition in root samples and spatial patterns of 1009 common fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were studied using point pattern analyses. Biotic (plant community composition) and abiotic niche constraints on the presence/abundance of a fungal OTU was assessed as the n-dimensional niche hypervolumes of biotic and abiotic characteristics. Important Findings Our results showed that (i) most fungal OTUs were highly spatially aggregated at small scales (less than 30 m), but that the aggregated pattern decreased, while regular and random patterns increased, with the increasing distance; (ii) A significant positive correlation was found between fungal abundance and aggregation intensity of fungal OTUs, indicating that the dominant fungi tended to be more aggregated in natural forests; (iii) Mean abundance and spatial aggregation intensity of ectomycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi were relatively higher than those of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that host plants may play an important role in determining spatial pattern of root-associated fungi; (iv) Spatial patterns of root-associated fungi depended on fungal abundance, fungal functional group, fungal taxa, biotic and abiotic niche hypervolumes of fungal OTUs.

However, it is thought that root competition may be less important than shoot competition due to greater size symmetry belowground. Because direct experimental tests on the importance of root competition are scarce, we aim at elucidating whether root competition may have direct or indirect effects on community structure. Indirect effects may occur by altering the overall size asymmetry of competition through root-shoot competitive interactions. Methods We used a phytometer approach to examine the effects of root, shoot and total competition intensity and importance on evenness of experimental plant communities. Thereby two different phytometer species, Festuca brevipila and Dianthus carthusianorum, were grown in small communities of six grassland species over three levels of light and water availability, interacting with neighbouring shoots, roots, both or not at all. Important Findings We found variation in community evenness to be best explained if root and shoot (but not total) competition were considered. However, the effects were species specific: in Dianthus communities increasing root competition increased plant community evenness, while in Festuca communities shoot competition was the driving force of this evenness response. Competition intensities were influenced by environmental conditions in Dianthus, but not in Festuca phytometer plants. While we found no evidence for root-shoot interactions for neither phytometer species root competition in Dianthus communities led to increased allocation to shoots, thereby increasing the potential ability to perform in size-asymmetric competition for light. Our experiment demonstrates the potential role of root competition in structuring plant communities.

In a peri-urban agricultural landscape in eastern Japan that lacks large ungulates but supports small generalist herbivores, fewer native seedlings have become established in thickets dominated by native dwarf bamboo, Pleioblastus chino (Franch. et Sav.) Makino. The mechanisms limiting tree seedling establishment are unknown. Our aim here was to evaluate the influence of interactions among the dwarf bamboo, its litter cover and small vertebrate herbivores on the microsite conditions governing the establishment of native tree seedlings from different successional stages in an old field in temperate Japan. Methods First, seedling emergence and survival of seeded Pinus densiflora Siebold et Zucc., Celtis sinensis Pers., Aphananthe aspera (Thunb.) Planch., Quercus serrata Murray, Quercus myrsinifolia Blume and Castanopsis sieboldii (Makino) Hatus. ex T. Yamaz. et Mashiba were observed in a factorial design that accounted for the presence or absence of dwarf bamboo and its litter cover, as well as the exclusion or access of small vertebrate fauna, in 2009 and 2010. To identify small vertebrate herbivores that reduced the emergence or survival of tree seedlings in the first experiment, reseeding experiments using P. densiflora, C. sinensis, A. aspera and Q. myrsinifolia were conducted by video trapping in 2011 and video and still-camera trapping in 2012. Important Findings The abiotic conditions under the dwarf bamboo were lethal to early- to mid-successional P. densiflora, C. sinensis, A. aspera and Q. serrata but led to better survivalalthough spindly growthof late-successional Q. myrsinifolia and C. sieboldii. The main consumers and the plants they found palatable differed between the bamboo thickets and the intervening gaps. Predation by mice appeared to have severely limited the emergence of all species, particularly in the bamboo thickets but occasionally in the gaps, whereas litter cover slightly mitigated this limitation. However, bamboo litter cover reduced the emergence of P. densiflora in the gaps. Chinese bamboo partridge (Bambusicola thoracicus Temminck), an introduced game bird, selectively and severely fed on the cotyledonsand probably seedsof A. aspera and moderately preyed upon those of P. densiflora in the gaps. Apparent consumption of seedlings in the gaps by the Japanese hare (Lepus brachyurus Temminck) suppressed the growth of all species but apparently did not severely affect emergence and survival. Thus, the net balance of positive and negative interactions at the bamboo thicket scale (i.e. the presence of dominant dwarf bamboo cover or intervening gaps and the herbivore behaviours in these two environments) and at the microsite level (i.e. litter cover) shapes the early establishment patterns of native tree seedlings, and this balance differs among tree seedling species.

The aim of this study is to explore variations in plant functional trait distributions along a hydrological gradient spanning from recurrent drought events to recurrent floodingmimicking future precipitation patterns. Methods The experiment was conducted in a controlled grassland experiment over a period of 3 years. A novel and more extreme hydrological regime was achieved by manipulating the flow of a nearby stream thereby creating a continuous hydrological gradient from flooding during winter to drought during summer. Plant community responses were recorded along this hydrological gradient. Community-weighted trait distribution changes along the gradient were described using null models. Six functional traits were considered: seed mass, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area (SLA) and height. Important findings Over time, responses in plant functional traits changed at the community level. Over the study period consistent changes occurred in the mean trait value of several traits. Communities in relatively dry plots became dominated by species with water-conserving life strategies, represented by high seed mass and thick leaves. In contrast, disturbance-resistant species (high leaf dry matter content) became dominant in flooded plots, indicating that persistence to flooding was the most important factor controlling the functional structure in those communities. Furthermore, a high abundance of small-seeded species in flooded plots likely indicates higher frequency of species with higher dispersal ability through hydrochory. In conclusion, plant traits are useful for predicting responses to climate change, but abrupt and extreme climate event may cause unexpected responses because they have no analog to previously more stable conditions. We suggest that traits related to dispersal and resistance to disturbance are useful in describing responses to flooding and that these traits should be included in future investigations of plant community responses to extreme hydrological events.

However, the related researches in shrubs were very limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate leaf stoichiometry and its driving factors in shrubs, and whether stoichiometry significantly differs among closely related species. Methods We analyzed leaf C, N and P concentrations and their ratios in 32 species of Ericaceae from 161 sites across southern China. We examined the relationships of leaf stoichiometry with environmental variables using linear regressions, and quantified the interactive and independent effects of climate, soil and species on foliar stoichiometry using general linear models (GLM). Important Findings The foliar C, N and P contents of Ericaceae were 484.66, 14.44 and 1.06 mg g(-1), respectively. Leaf C, N and P concentrations and their ratios in Ericaceae were significantly related with latitude and altitude, except the N:P insignificantly correlated with latitude. Climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation) and soil properties (soil C, N and P and bulk density) were significantly influenced element stoichiometry. The GLM analysis showed that soil exerted a greater direct effect on leaf stoichiometry than climate did, and climate affected leaf traits mainly via indirect ways. Further, soil properties had stronger influences on leaf P than on leaf C and N. Among all independent factors examined, we found species accounted for the largest proportion of the variation in foliar stoichiometry. These results suggest that species can largely influence foliar stoichiometry, even at a lower taxonomic level.

Land use legacy for a tropical myco-heterotroph: how spatial patterns of abundance, reproductive effort and success vary	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						forest recovery; Orchidaceae; tropical forest; disturbance ecology; Wullschlaegelia	USE HISTORY; RAIN-FOREST; SEED-GERMINATION; HUMAN IMPACT; PUERTO-RICO; ORCHIDS; CONSERVATION; DISTURBANCE; REGRESSION; DIVERSITY	Aims Human land use such as agriculture and logging can have cascading effects on the environment and severely influence forest ecosystems by altering structure, species composition and community processes. These activities may have long-term consequences, which impact forest recovery. We investigated the legacy of historical anthropogenic land use on the current reproductive effort (RE) and success of the understory, myco-heterotrophic orchid, Wullschlaegelia calcarata in Puerto Rico's tropical rain forest after 80 years of forest recovery. Methods Our study site was the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot in the Luquillo Experimental Forest. We used six 10 m x 500 m transect lines that spanned areas with differing levels of historic canopy coverage which are correlated with land use history. We recorded the abundance of W. calcarata plants and measured shoot height, number of flowers, fruit set for all plants and seed set from the most mature, undehisced fruit on a random subset of plants measured. We sought to determine whether or not there is a legacy of land use history on the RE and success of W. calcarata. Of the varying degrees of historic disturbance, we predicted that RE and success would be highest in minimally disturbed old-growth forest, and that soil type differences would be insufficient to affect RE or success. Important Findings We found 1607 plants of W. calcarata, and only one was detected in the most historically disturbed area of the forest. The orchids were most abundant in the two least historically disturbed sites. However, the prevailing trend in all measures of RE is in the opposite direction with greater RE in the forest plots with intermediate levels of historical disturbance. Furthermore, the best model (as a function of AICc and weights) to predict RE is a combination of soil type and cover class. Nevertheless, our measures of reproductive success (fruit and seed set) were best in the least historically disturbed sites and were not associated with soil type. Thus, the best sites for growth are not always the same as those for abundance and reproduction, and after >80 years of recovery, components of the rainforest community have not fully recovered.

However, most previous studies have explored only species-loss patterns and mechanisms over small sampling areas, so their results might overestimate species loss at larger spatial scales. The aim of this research was to explore species diversity change patterns and species-loss rates at multiple scales in alpine meadow communities following nutrient enrichment. Specifically, we asked two closely related questions: (i) do changes in species diversity and species-loss patterns differ among spatial scales? and (ii) how does community compositional dissimilarity and species turnover change among spatial scale? Methods This study was implemented in an alpine meadow community, which is regarded as one of the most sensitive and vulnerable terrestrial ecosystems to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. We conducted a fertilization experiment that involved the addition of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and a mixture of both to a series of quadrats ranging from 1 to 16 m(2) over 5 years to study the variations in the patterns of species diversity in response to nutrient additions at different spatial scales. Important Findings Our results showed that the changes in species diversity and species loss were dependent on the type of fertilization and the spatial scale. After N and NP fertilization, species diversity significantly decreased at the small scale but not at the large scale, and the rate of species loss decreased as the spatial scale increased. In contrast, the differences between the P addition and control communities were negligible at both the small and large spatial scales. N fertilization caused species to be lost from the small sampling scale, but because different species were lost from different samples, there was an increase in compositional dissimilarity at larger spatial scales, which reduced the total number of species lost when measured at larger scales. These findings highlight spatial scale in evaluating the biodiversity loss after fertilization and suggest that the compositional dissimilarity might play an important role in mediating species loss after fertilization. Our study significantly improved our understanding of changes in species diversity and species loss at different spatial scales under nutrient-enrichment scenarios.

Overview of the toxic effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in blood, liver, muscles, and brain of a Neotropical detritivorous fish	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						bioaccumulation; glutathione-S-transferase neurotoxicity; immune system; reactive oxygen species	METAL-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; TIO2 NANOPARTICLES; RAINBOW-TROUT; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PISCINE MICRONUCLEUS; DNA-DAMAGE; EXPOSURE; GLUTATHIONE; ASSAY; LEAD	The toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) in the blood, liver, muscle, and brain of a Neotropical detritivorous fish, Prochilodus lineatus, was tested. Juvenile fish were exposed to 0, 1, 5, 10, and 50 mg L-1 of TiO2-NP for 48 hours (acute exposure) or 14 days (subchronic exposure) to evaluate changes in hematology, red blood cell (RBC) genotoxicity/mutagenicity, liver function (reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, antioxidant responses, detoxification, and histopathology), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in muscles and brain, and Ti bioaccumulation. TiO2-NP did not cause genetic damage to RBC, but acutely decreased white blood cells (WBC) and increased monocytes. Subchronically, RBC decreased, mean cell volume and hemoglobin increased, and WBC and lymphocytes decreased. Therefore, NP has the potential to affect immune system and increase energy expenditure, reducing the fish's ability to avoid predator and to resist pathogens. In the liver, acute exposure decreased ROS and increased glutathione (GSH) content, while subchronic exposure decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and GSH content. GSH and GST seem to play an essential role in metabolizing NP and ROS, likely increasing hepatocytes' metabolic rate, which may be the cause of observed cell hypertrophy, disarrangement of hepatic cords and degenerative morphological alterations. Although most studies indicate that the kidney is responsible for metabolizing and/or eliminating TiO2-NP, this study shows that the liver also has a main role in these processes. Nevertheless, Ti still accumulated in the liver, muscle, and brain and decreased muscular AChE activity after acute exposure, showing neurotoxic potential. More studies are needed to better understand the biochemical pathways TiO2-NP are metabolized and how its bioaccumulation may affect fish homeostasis and survival in the environment.

Conservation scientists often rely on 1 type of corridor model, typically the least-cost model or current-flow model, to construct a linkage design, and their choice is not usually based on theory or empirical evidence. We developed a method to empirically confirm whether corridors produced by these 2 models are used by target species under current landscape conditions. We applied this method in the Gamba landscape between 2 national parks in southwestern Gabon. We collected signs of presence of African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and 2 apes, western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), on transects. We used patch-occupancy models to identify least-cost and current-flow corridors for these 4 species. On average, 28.7% of current-flow corridors overlapped with least-cost corridors, confirming that the choice of corridor model can affect the location of the resulting linkage design. We validated these corridors by monitoring signs and examining camera detections on new transects within and outside modeled corridors. Current-flow corridors performed better than least-cost corridors for elephants, whereas the opposite was found for buffalo and apes. Locations of the highest priority corridors for the 3 taxa did not overlap, and only 18.3% of their combined surface was common among 2 species. We used centrality metrics to calculate the average contribution of corridor pixels to landscape connectivity and derived an index that can be used to prioritize corridors. As a result, we recommend protecting at least 17.4% of the land surface area around Gamba town to preserve the preferred travel routes of the target species.	[Vanthomme, Hadrien P.

Theory suggests land-cover and disturbance characteristics affect recovery, but individual studies of disturbance and recovery frequently struggle to uncover generalizable patterns because of high levels of site-specific variation. To understand how land-cover, disturbance type, and disturbance duration influence ecosystem recovery, we used studies documenting recovery of 50 streams to perform a global meta-analysis of stream recovery from disturbances that affect water quality (e.g., oil spill, fire, wastewater). We extracted upstream natural and urban land-cover percentages for each site and performed model selection and averaging to identify influences on recovery completeness. Most streams improved following the end of a disturbance (median 240% of disturbed condition) but did not recover fully to baseline predisturbance condition within the studied period (median study period 2 years; median recovery 60% of baseline). Scale of disturbance in time and space did not predict recovery, but sites with higher percentages of upstream natural land cover had less complete recovery relative to sites with more urban or agricultural cover, possibly due to higher baseline conditions in these streams. Our findings suggest impacts to systems with low anthropogenic stress may be more irreversible than impacts to already modified systems. We call for more long-term evaluations of ecosystem response to disturbance and the inclusion of regional references and predisturbance reference conditions for comparison. A more thorough understanding of the role of the surrounding landscape in shaping stream response to disturbance can help managers calibrate expectations for recovery and prioritize protection.

Long-term demographic and genetic effects of releasing captive-born individuals into the wild	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						artificial selection; captivity; domestication; genetic adaptation; supplementation; adaptacion genetica; cautiverio; domesticacion; seleccion artificial; suplemento; (sic)(sic); &#x9a6f;(sic); (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic); (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic); (sic)(sic)	CONSERVATION GENETICS; SPECIES CONSERVATION; BREEDING PROGRAMS; FITNESS; POPULATIONS; ADAPTATION; REINTRODUCTION; CONSEQUENCES; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT	Because of continued habitat destruction and species extirpations, the need to use captive breeding for conservation purposes has been increasing steadily. However, the long-term demographic and genetic effects associated with releasing captive-born individuals with varied life histories into the wild remain largely unknown. To address this question, we developed forward-time, agent-based models for 4 species with long-running captive-breeding and release programs: coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), western toad (Anaxyrus boreas), and Whooping Crane (Grus americana). We measured the effects of supplementation by comparing population size and neutral genetic diversity in supplemented populations to the same characteristics in unaltered populations 100 years after supplementation ended. Releasing even slightly less fit captive-born individuals to supplement wild populations typically resulted in reductions in population sizes and genetic diversity over the long term when the fitness reductions were heritable (i.e., due to genetic adaptation to captivity) and populations continued to be regulated by density-dependent mechanisms over time. Negative effects for species with longer life spans and lower rates of population replacement were smaller than for species with shorter life spans and higher rates of population replacement. Programs that released captive-born individuals over fewer years or that avoided breeding individuals with captive ancestry had smaller reductions in population size and genetic diversity over the long term. Relying on selection in the wild to remove individuals with reduced fitness mitigated some negative demographic effects, but at a substantial cost to neutral genetic diversity. Our results suggest that conservation-focused captive-breeding programs should take measures to prevent even small amounts of genetic adaptation to captivity, quantitatively determine the minimum number of captive-born individuals to release each year, and fully account for the interactions among genetic adaptation to captivity, population regulation, and life-history variation.

However, contaminants, such as heavy metals and pesticides, in stormwater adversely affect the survival, growth, and reproduction of animals inhabiting these wetlands. A key question is whether wildlife can identify and avoid highly polluted wetlands. We investigated whether pond-breeding frogs are attempting to breed in wetlands that affect the fitness of their offspring across 67 urban wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. Frog species richness and the concentration of contaminants (heavy metals and pesticides) were not significantly related, even in the most polluted wetlands. The proportion of fringing vegetation at a wetland had the greatest positive influence on the number of frog species present and the probability of occurrence of individual species, indicating that frogs inhabited wetlands with abundant vegetation, regardless of their pollution status. These wetlands contained contaminant levels similar to urban wetlands around the world at levels that reduce larval amphibian survival. These results are, thus, likely generalizable to other areas, suggesting that urban managers could inadvertently be creating ecological traps in countless cities. Wetlands are important tools for the management of urban stormwater runoff, but their construction should not facilitate declines in wetland-dependent urban wildlife.

This practice is based on the assumption that protected areas buffer species from processes that drive extinction. However, protected areas can maintain biodiversity in the face of climate change and subsequent shifts in distributions have been questioned. We evaluated the degree to which protected areas influenced colonization and extinction patterns of 97 avian species over 20 years in the northeastern United States. We fitted single-visit dynamic occupancy models to data from Breeding Bird Atlases to quantify the magnitude of the effect of drivers of local colonization and extinction (e.g., climate, land cover, and amount of protected area) in heterogeneous landscapes that varied in the amount of area under protection. Colonization and extinction probabilities improved as the amount of protected area increased, but these effects were conditional on landscape context and species characteristics. In this forest-dominated region, benefits of additional land protection were greatest when both forest cover in a grid square and amount of protected area in neighboring grid squares were low. Effects did not vary with species' migratory habit or conservation status. Increasing the amounts of land protection benefitted the range margins species but not the core range species. The greatest improvements in colonization and extinction rates accrued for forest birds relative to open-habitat or generalist species. Overall, protected areas stemmed extinction more than they promoted colonization. Our results indicate that land protection remains a viable conservation strategy despite changing habitat and climate, as protected areas both reduce the risk of local extinction and facilitate movement into new areas. Our findings suggest conservation in the face of climate change favors creation of new protected areas over enlarging existing ones as the optimal strategy to reduce extinction and provide stepping stones for the greatest number of species.

These are time-consuming and complex tasks, so SRs are considered resource intensive, but published estimates of systematic-review resource requirements are largely anecdotal. We analyzed all Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) SRs (n = 66) and maps (n = 20) published from 2012 to 2017 to estimate the average number of articles retained at each review stage. We also surveyed 33 experienced systematic reviewers to collate information on the rate at which those stages could be completed. In combination, these data showed that the average CEE SR takes an estimated 164 d (full-time equivalent) (SD 23), and the average CEE systematic map (SM) (excluding critical appraisal) takes 211 d (SD 53). While screening titles and abstracts is widely considered time-consuming, metadata extraction and critical appraisal took as long or longer to complete, especially for SMs. Given information about the planned methods and evidence base, we created a software tool that predicts time requirements of a SR or map with evidence-based defaults as a starting point. Our results shed light on the most time-consuming stages of the SR and mapping processes, will inform review planning, and can direct innovation to streamline processes. Future predictions of effort required to complete SRs and maps could be improved if authors provide more details on methods and results.

By conducting a field experiment in a temperate grassland, we found that both plant richness and temporal stability of community biomass increased with spatial scale, but N enrichment reduced richness and stability at the two scales considered. Reduced local-scale stability under N enrichment arose from N-induced reduction in population stability, which was partly attributable to the decline in local species richness, as well as reduction in asynchronous local population dynamics across species. Importantly, N enrichment did not alter spatial asynchrony among local communities, which provided similar spatial insurance effects at the larger scale, regardless of N enrichment levels. These results suggest that spatial variability among local communities, in addition to local diversity, may help stabilise ecosystems at larger spatial scales even in the face of anthropogenic environmental changes.

We use this approach to better understand the composition of a community of winter annual plants with multiple decades of monitoring and detailed morphological, phenological and physiological measurements. Previous research on this system revealed a physiological trade-off among dominant species that accurately predicts population and community dynamics. Here we expanded our investigation to 51 species, representing 96% of individual plants recorded over 30 years, and analysed trait relationships in the context of species abundance and phylogenetic relationships. We found that the functional-trait trade-off scales to the entire community, albeit with diminished strength. It is strongest for dominant species and weakens as progressively rarer species are included. The trade-off has been consistently expressed over three decades of environmental change despite some turnover in the identity of dominant species.

Using a 20-year experiment, where 50 non-resident (but mostly native) grassland plant species were sown into savannah plots, we ask how traits linked with invasion depend on invasion stage (establishment, spread), indicator of invasion success (occupancy, relative abundance), time, environmental conditions, propagule rain, and traits of invaders and invaded communities. Trait data for 164 taxa showed that invader occupancy was primarily associated with traits of invaders, traits of recipient communities, and invader-community interactions. Invader abundance was more strongly associated with community traits (e.g. proportion legume) and trait differences between invaders and the most similar resident species. Annuals and invaders with high-specific leaf area were only successful early in stand development, whereas invaders with conservative carbon capture strategies persisted long-term. Our results indicate that invasion is context-dependent and long-term experiments are required to comprehensively understand invasions.

Phenological mismatch with trees reduces wildflower carbon budgets	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						climate change; carbon gain; forest understorey; herbaceous layer; light environment; phenology; spring wildflowers; Thoreau	LEAF-OUT PHENOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATE; PLANTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; REPRODUCTION; RECORDS; DRIVEN; SHIFTS; TIMES	Interacting species can respond differently to climate change, causing unexpected consequences. Many understorey wildflowers in deciduous forests leaf out and flower in the spring when light availability is the highest before overstorey canopy closure. Therefore, different phenological responses by understorey and overstorey species to increased spring temperature could have significant ecological implications. Pairing contemporary data with historical observations initiated by Henry David Thoreau (1850s), we found that overstorey tree leaf out is more responsive to increased spring temperature than understorey wildflower phenology, resulting in shorter periods of high light in the understorey before wildflowers are shaded by tree canopies. Because of this overstorey-understorey mismatch, we estimate that wildflower spring carbon budgets in the northeastern United States were 12-26% larger during Thoreau's era and project a 10-48% reduction during this century. This underappreciated phenomenon may have already reduced wildflower fitness and could lead to future population declines in these ecologically important species.	[Heberling, J.

We performed macroevolutionary analyses of trait divergence and diversification rates across closely related pairs of Andean and Amazonian passerine birds, to assess whether the difference in elevational range separating species pairs - a proxy for the degree of ecological divergence - influences the speed of trait evolution and diversification rates. We found that elevational differentiation is associated with faster divergence of song frequency, a trait important for pre-mating isolation, and several morphological traits, which may contribute to extrinsic post-mating isolation. However, elevational differentiation did not increase recent speciation rates, possibly due to early bursts of diversification during the uplift of the eastern Andes followed by a slow-down in speciation rate. Our results suggest that ecological differentiation may speed up trait evolution, but not diversification of Neotropical birds.

Density can inform on fitness prospects, acting as a cue for either habitat quality, or competition over resources. However, when escaping competition, high local density should only increase emigration if lower-density patches are available elsewhere. Few empirical studies on dispersal have considered the effects of density at the local and landscape scale simultaneously. To explore this, we analyze 5 years of individual-based data from an experimental introduction of wild guppies Poecilia reticulata. Natal dispersal showed a decrease in local density dependence as density at the landscape level increased. Landscape density did not affect dispersal among adults, but local density-dependent dispersal switched from negative (conspecific attraction) to positive (conspecific avoidance), as the colonisation progressed. This study demonstrates that densities at various scales interact to determine dispersal, and suggests that dispersal trade-offs differ across life stages.

Ionome and elemental transport kinetics shaped by parallel evolution in threespine stickleback	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Eco-evolutionary dynamics; ecological stoichiometry; genes-to-ecosystems; ionomics; rapid evolution; parallel evolution	BIOLOGICAL STOICHIOMETRY; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; NATURAL-SELECTION; RAPID EVOLUTION; LIFE; ECTODYSPLASIN; PERSPECTIVE; TRAITS; GENES; FISH	Evidence that organisms evolve rapidly enough to alter ecological dynamics necessitates investigation of the reciprocal links between ecology and evolution. Data that link genotype to phenotype to ecology are needed to understand both the process and ecological consequences of rapid evolution. Here, we quantified the suite of elements in individuals (i.e., ionome) and differences in the fluxes of key nutrients across populations of threespine stickleback. We find that allelic variation associated with freshwater adaptation that controls bony plating is associated with changes in the ionome and nutrient recycling. More broadly, we find that adaptation of marine stickleback to freshwater conditions shifts the ionomes of natural populations and populations raised in common gardens. In both cases ionomic divergence between populations was primarily driven by differences in trace elements rather than elements typically associated with bone. These findings demonstrate the utility of ecological stoichiometry and the importance of ionome-wide data in understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics.

We develop simple alternative models to predict population limits in relation to body mass. A model assuming that within-species area use increases with the square of daily travel distance broadly predicts the scaling of empirical extremes of minimum density across birds and mammals. Consistent with model predictions, the estimated density range for a given mass, 'population scope', is greater for birds than for mammals. However, unlike mammals and carnivorous birds, expected broad relationships between body mass and density extremes are not supported by data on herbivorous and omnivorous birds. Our results suggest that simple constraints on mobility and energy use/supply are major determinants of the scaling of density limits, but further understanding of interactions between dietary constraints and density limits are needed to predict future wildlife population responses to anthropogenic threats.

Quantifying ecological stability therefore requires inspecting multiple stability properties, such as resistance, recovery, persistence and invariability. Correlations among these properties can reduce the dimensionality of stability, simplifying the study of environmental effects on ecosystems. A key question is how the kind of disturbance affects these correlations. We here investigated the effect of three disturbance types (random, species-specific, local) applied at four intensity levels, on the dimensionality of stability at the population and community level. We used previously parameterized models that represent five natural communities, varying in species richness and the number of trophic levels. We found that disturbance type but not intensity affected the dimensionality of stability and only at the population level. The dimensionality of stability also varied greatly among species and communities. Therefore, studying stability cannot be simplified to using a single metric and multi-dimensional assessments are still to be recommended.

We evaluated the shape of thermal-abundance distributions using 98 422 abundance estimates of 702 reef fish species worldwide. We found that curved ceilings in local abundance related to sea temperatures for most species, where local abundance declined from realised thermal 'optima' towards warmer and cooler environments. Although generally supporting the abundant-centre hypothesis, many species also displayed asymmetrical thermal-abundance distributions. For many tropical species, abundances did not decline at warm distribution edges due to an unavailability of warmer environments at the equator. Habitat transitions from coral to macroalgal dominance in subtropical zones also influenced abundance distribution shapes. By quantifying the factors constraining species' abundance, we provide an important empirical basis for improving predictions of community re-structuring in a warmer world.

This assessment is a complicated task in coastal lagoons due to their intrinsic variability, prompting moves to use real-time measurements. Here, we tested the ability of the submersible spectrofluorometer FluoroProbe (R) to accurately estimate the phytoplankton biomass and to efficiently discriminate spectral groups in Mediterranean coastal lagoons, by using sub-surface water samples (n=107) collected at Biguglia lagoon (Corsica) in different environmental situations (salinity and trophic state) from March 2012 to December 2014. We compared the estimates of biomass and phytoplankton group composition obtained with the FluoroProbe (R) (in situ and lab measurements) with the spectrofluorimetrically measured biomass and HPLC-derived quantifications of pigment concentrations. FluoroProbe (R) provided good estimates of the total phytoplankton biomass (particularly, the lab measurements). The FluoroProbe (R) data were significantly correlated with the HPLC results, except for the in situ measurements of very weak concentrations of blue-green and red algae. Our findings indicate that factory-calibrated FluoroProbe (R) is an efficient and easy-to-use real-time phytoplankton monitoring tool in coastal lagoons, especially as an early warning system for the detection of potentially harmful algal blooms. Practical instructions dedicated to non-specialist field operators are provided. A simple and efficient method for discarding in situ measurement outliers is also proposed.

The degree to which consistent inter-individual behavioural differences are influenced by social cues in such groups is largely unanswered. We used the honey bee waggle dance as an experimental paradigm to explore this question. Honey bee foragers use the waggle dance behaviour to communicate information about food sources in the environment to their nest mates. This recruitment process incorporates information about the food reward, the colony food stores and the environmental food availability and plays a major role in ensuring efficient exploitation of the food sources available to the colony. We first observed individual foragers visiting the same food source and quantified the probability and intensity of their dance activity. We found that there are consistent inter-individual differences in both measures of dance activity within a forager group. Next, we removed foragers and observed that this led to a significant increase in the average dance activity of some foragers. The individuals which increased their dance activity were the ones which were more active before the removal. Finally, we allowed recruits to join the foragers at the food source, which had a strong inhibitory effect on the dance activity of all the individual foragers. Our study shows that a complex interplay between individual behavioural differences and social interactions drives the dance communication needed to effectively organise the colony's collective foraging behaviour.Significance statementVery little is known about the effect of social cues and signals on consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour amongst workers in the same colony in social insects. We studied this in the recruitment behaviour of honey bee foragers, the dance communication. Foragers visiting the same food source consistently differed in their dance activity, suggesting that there were strong inter-individual differences in the perception of the food reward. We then changed the social cues experienced by the foragers by either removing some of the foragers or allowing recruits to forage at the same food source. We found that the removal of some foragers had an individual specific effect, whereas the presence of all recruits affected all foragers. Our results show that the regulation of foraging in honey bees involves the social modulation of consistent differences in recruitment activity.

Conspecific presence and microhabitat features influence foraging decisions across ontogeny in a facultatively social mammal	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Dilution effect; Group-living; Ontogeny; Optimal foraging theory; Vigilance	CALIFORNIA GROUND-SQUIRRELS; GROUP-SIZE; PREDATION-RISK; SPERMOPHILUS-BEECHEYI; TRADE-OFF; AGE-DIFFERENCES; ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; ANTIPREDATOR VIGILANCE; BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; NATAL DISPERSAL	Natural selection is expected to favor the evolution of threat-sensitive behaviors that permit individuals to adaptively detect and respond to danger. However, because time allocated to vigilance reduces the amount of time that is available for energy acquisition, foraging in the face of predation can impose an evolutionary trade-off. Optimal foraging theory therefore predicts that risk-taking decisions should vary in response to perceived levels of threat. Our goal here is to disentangle the relative contributions of conspecific presence, ecological factors, and individual traits on two measures of vigilance in free-living California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). This facultatively social and ecologically flexible rodent represents a major source of prey in California grasslands. Over a 5-year period, we collected 386 focal animal surveys on 156 free-living individuals residing at two colony sites. Individuals were most vigilant in conditions for which predation risk was highest, such as when foraging alone and on flat areas with low vegetative cover. In general, juvenile foragers were more gregarious but less vigilant than adult foragers. Although all animalsregardless of age or sexgenerally decreased their intensity of vigilance as group size increased, only adults decreased their time allocated to vigilance in response to conspecific presence. Thus, grouping consistently buffered the costs of foraging for risk-averse adults, but the benefits of conspecific presence were less salient for juveniles. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of context in shaping foraging decisions and offer insights into the suite of factors mediating decision-making in socially and ecologically variable environments.Significance statementAnimals face trade-offs when foraging in the face of predation, but the capacity for individuals to respond appropriately to subtle changes in context-dependent threats remains poorly understood. We studied antipredator vigilance by the California ground squirrel, a flexible species that may forage alone or in small groups of various sizes and in habitats that vary in their protective value from predators and the ease at which prey may detect predators. Although adults are more sensitive to changes in group size, all animals detected context-dependent danger to some extent. Our findings offer insights into the multiple factors that prey respond to when making foraging decisions, suggesting that animals possess the ability to integrate disparate sources of information about danger to optimize energy gain.

A large proportion of these organisms are constitutive mixotrophs (CMs), with an innate ability to photosynthesize. Here, for the first time, an analysis is presented of the biogeography of CMs across the oceans. Location Global marine ecosystems. Time period 1970-2018. Major taxa studied Marine planktonic protists. Methods Records for CM species, primarily from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), were grouped by taxonomy and size to evaluate sampling efforts across Longhurst's oceanic provinces. Biases were evaluated through nonparametric tests and multivariate analysis. Biogeographies of CMs from OBIS data were compared with data from studies that specifically targeted these organisms. Results Constitutive mixotrophs of different taxonomic groups, across all size ranges, are ubiquitous. However, strong database biases were detected with respect to organism size, taxonomic groups and region. A strong bias was seen towards dinophytes. Species < 20 mu m, especially non-dinophytes, were least represented, with their recorded distribution limited to coastal regions and to temperate and polar seas. Studies specifically targeting these organisms revealed their distribution to be much wider. Such biases are likely to have occurred owing to a failure to capture and correctly identify these organisms in routine sampling protocols. Main conclusions Constitutive mixotrophs are dominant members of organisms traditionally termed "phytoplankton". However, lack of routine protocols for measuring phagotrophy in "phytoplankton" protists has led to widespread misrepresentation of the fundamental nature of marine planktonic primary producers; most express both "animal-like" and "plant-like" nutrition. Our results have implications for studies of the global biogeography of plankton, of food web dynamics (including models) and of biogeochemical cycling in the oceans.

We currently lack a framework that predicts these violations. Here, we examine whether variation in climatic disequilibrium is structured by properties of species' native distributions and climatic niches. Location Global. Methods We built climatic niche models for 106 pine (Pinus L.) species, including 25 that have naturalized outside their native range. We measured the extent of climate space occupied exclusively by naturalized populations and considered what fraction of this space was available within the native continent and near the native range. We examined the consequences of disequilibrium for estimates of potential range filling and sister species niche conservatism. Results Most species (23 of 25) have naturalized in climate conditions outside the native niche, leading to increases in the total known suitable climate space. Increases in niche size were negatively related to native niche size. Increases were often large; one species expanded its niche by almost 10% of the global climate space. These increases were associated primarily with cooler, wetter and less seasonal climates. Increases in known niche size lowered potential range filling estimates within species' native continent and ecoregion. Naturalized data did not strengthen support for niche conservatism among sister species. Main conclusions Among pines, climatic disequilibrium is the norm and not the exception. The magnitude of this disequilibrium can be vast, such that the native range greatly under-represents the true climatic tolerances of some species. Fortunately, this disequilibrium can be predicted largely by the size of a species' native niche. Accounting for this disequilibrium can improve our ability to characterize ecological phenomena, including potential range filling. This is an essential step towards improving the conservation value of ecological niche models.

It is an established fact that root turnover is jointly regulated by climatic, edaphic and biotic factors. However, the relative importance of these forces in determining the global patterns of root turnover time is far from clear. Location Global. Time period 1946-2017. Major taxa studied Grasslands. Methods We compiled a database of 141 sites with 433 observations on root turnover time and applied structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the relative contribution of climate, soil properties and vegetation type to the observed variations in root turnover time. Results Root turnover time was 3.1 years on average across the global grasslands and differed significantly among grassland types (tropical grassland and savanna, temperate grassland and meadow, alpine grassland and meadow, tundra and desert). It decreased with mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and Palmer drought severity index but increased with soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen content and carbon : nitrogen ratio. Soil bulk density and soil texture also significantly affected root turnover time, with clay content negatively correlating to root turnover time and explaining more variations than bulk density and sand content. The SEM showed that climatic factors had dominant effects on root turnover time when vegetation type was not considered. Vegetation type became the primary driver when it was included in the SEM. Main conclusions Our results indicate that the influences of climatic and edaphic factors on root turnover time are predominantly manifested through vegetation type. The critical role of precipitation as revealed for the first time in this study challenges our current understanding of climate impacts on root turnover time. The findings necessitate accurate representation of vegetation type in Earth system models to predict root function dynamics under global change.

The analysis of recently diverged, hyper-rich invertebrate groups provides an opportunity to investigate latitudinal patterns with the statistical power of large trees while minimizing potentially confounding variation in ecology and history. Here, we synthesize global phylogenetic and macroecological data on a hyperdiverse (> 1,100 species) ant radiation, Pheidole and test predictions of three general explanations for the latitudinal gradient: variation in diversification rates, tropical conservatism and ecological regulation. Location Global. Time period The past 35 million years. Major taxa studied The hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole Westwood. Methods We assembled geographic data for 1,499 species and morphospecies, and inferred a dated phylogeny for 449 species of Pheidole, including 167 species newly sequenced for this study. We tested for correlations between diversification rate and latitude with Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixtures (BAMM), hidden state speciation and extinction (HiSSE), geographic state speciation and extinction (GeoSSE), and a non-parametric method (FiSSE), evaluated evidence for richness steady state, and examined patterns of diversification as Pheidole spread around the globe. Results There was no evidence of systematic variation of net diversification rates with latitude across any of the methods. We found that Pheidole diversification occurred in bursts when new continents were colonized, followed by a slowdown in each region, but there is no evidence richness has saturated at an equilibrium in any region. Additionally, we found latitudinal affinity is moderately conserved with a Neotropical ancestor and simulations show that phylogenetic inertia alone is sufficient to produce the gradient pattern. Main conclusions Our results provide no evidence that diversification rates vary systematically with latitude. Richness is far from steady state in each region, contrary to the ecological regulation hypothesis, although there is evidence that ecological opportunity promotes diversification after colonization of new areas. The fact that niche conservatism is strong enough to produce the gradient pattern is in accord with the tropical conservatism hypothesis. Overall, these results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the emergence of the diversity gradient within the past 34 million years, complementing recent work on deeper time-scales, and more generally contribute toward much-needed invertebrate perspective on global biodiversity dynamics.

For well over a century, climatic factors have been regarded as primary sources of natural selection on animal body size, and hypotheses such as Bergmann's rule (the increase of body size with decreasing temperature) have dominated discussions. However, evidence for consistent climatic effects, especially among ectotherms, remains equivocal. Here, we test a range of key hypotheses on climate-driven size evolution in squamate reptiles across several spatial and phylogenetic scales. Location Global. Time period Extant. Major taxa studied Squamates (lizards and snakes). Methods We quantified the role of temperature, precipitation, seasonality and net primary productivity as drivers of body mass across ca. 95% of extant squamate species (9,733 spp.). We ran spatial autoregressive models of phylogenetically corrected median mass per equal-area grid cell. We ran models globally, across separate continents and for major squamate clades independently. We also performed species-level analyses using phylogenetic generalized least square models and linear regressions of independent contrasts of sister species. Results Our analyses failed to identify consistent spatial patterns in body size as a function of our climatic predictors. Nearly all continent- and family-level models differed from one another, and species-level models had low explanatory power. Main conclusions The global distribution of body mass among living squamates varies independently from the variation in multiple components of climate. Our study, the largest in spatial and taxonomic scale conducted to date, reveals that there is little support for a universal, consistent mechanism of climate-driven size evolution within squamates.

Here, we develop a comparative trait framework for birds and mammals to provide a global quantification of the similarity of species roles (functional redundancy) and the breadth of roles across taxa (functional dispersion). We predict different contributions of birds and mammals to redundancy and dispersion, and unique geographical patterns of redundancy and dispersion by including both taxa. Location Global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Birds and mammals. Methods We systematically select, compile and impute the same six traits (i.e., a common currency of traits) across 15,485 bird and mammal species from multiple databases. We use these six traits to compute functional redundancy and functional dispersion for birds and mammals across all 825 terrestrial ecoregions. We then calculate the standardized effect size (SES) of these observed values compared with null expectations, based on a randomization of species composition (i.e., independent of differences in species richness). Results We find that species-rich regions, such as the Neotropics, have high functional redundancy coupled with low functional dispersion, characterizing a global trade-off. Thus, in general, as species richness increases, the similarity in species functional roles also increases. We therefore suggest that different processes generate species richness/functional redundancy and functional dispersion, leading to a novel, and generally non-tropical, distribution of hotspots of high functional dispersion across Madagascar, Eastern Asia and Western USA. Main conclusions We recommend consideration of both the similarity and the breadth of functional roles across species pools, including taxa that may play similar roles. We therefore suggest that functional redundancy, as a means of insurance, and functional dispersion, as an indicator of response diversity, should be evaluated further as conservation objectives.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the polymorphism in ventral plumage colouration observed in the cosmopolitan common barn owl group is determined by climatic factors, such as temperature and rainfall, consistent with Gloger's and Bogert's biogeographical rules. Location World. Time period 1809-2017. Major taxa studied Tyto alba species complex. Methods We analysed the variation in heritable melanin-based plumage colour according to annual temperature and rainfall in 9,110 individuals of the cosmopolitan barn owl, with three distinct evolutionary lineages representing its entire distribution range: the Afro-European Tyto alba, occurring between Scandinavia and South Africa, the American Tyto furcata, found from southern Canada to Patagonia, and the Australasian Tyto javanica, living between the Himalayan Plateau and Tasmania. Results Although the geographical distribution of colour morphs is heterogeneous among the lineages, in all of them plumage colour becomes darker with increasing annual rainfall, indicating a convergent selection of darker morphs in humid habitats possibly to improve camouflage against the dark environment and/or to repel water more efficiently. Moreover, in T. alba and T. furcata, melanization increases at decreasing temperature, suggesting its possible role in thermoregulation. Discussion These findings provide convincing evidence of repeated evolution of similar body colouration patterns at a worldwide scale compatible with the main biogeographical rules, while emphasizing the possible role of melanin-based traits in animal adaptation to climate change.

However, empirical studies have so far mainly focused on leading edges or on species' optima, and evidence of rear edge shifts remains scarce. Yet, the balance between leading and rear edge shifts has important consequences for conservation and co-determines species' extinction risk. Here, we present a comparative synthesis of range dynamics observed at both range limits. Location Global. Time period 1850-present. Major taxa studied Plants, invertebrates, vertebrates. Methods From the literature, we compiled elevational leading and rear edge shifts of 1,026 species observed at the same localities over the same time period. We used linear mixed-effects models to analyse whether both range limits shifted upslope, whether leading edges shifted faster than rear edges and elevational range sizes have thus changed, whether observed shifts were linked to temperature changes, and whether shifts lagged behind temperature changes. Results Despite pronounced species-specific variation, both range limits shifted upslope on average. Rates of shift did not differ between rear and leading edges, elevational range sizes thus did not change. Regional differences in temperature trends were only related to dynamics at rear edges. Yet, the stronger climate warmed regionally, the more species' responses lagged behind expectations at both range limits. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that extinctions at rear edges of mountain species have at least been as common as colonizations at leading edges. The drivers of observed range limit shifts are not deducible from our data, but weak relationships with temperature trends suggest that other factors than climate warming played an additional role. These results do not relax concerns about possible detrimental effects of environmental change on mountain biodiversity and point to the importance of refocusing monitoring towards a better representation of rear edge dynamics.

This study assessed groundwater level changes in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region with a focus on cultivated areas. Trends of groundwater level were estimated using linear regression, and examined for shallow, medium, and deep depths across physiographic regions of Mid-Atlantic. A hotspot analysis was conducted to identify spatial clusters of wells with rising or declining groundwater levels. In addition, differences in the percentage of cultivated area with declining groundwater between cultivated land categories was examined at the county level. From 2002-2016, the Mid-Atlantic region had an overall decline in groundwater level (0.06 m/yr, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.09) although groundwater changes varied by physiographic regions. The Coastal Plain physiographic region was dominated by declining groundwater wells (48%) and had the most significant groundwater level declines (0.23 m/yr, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.26). Significant groundwater level rises were detected in Southern Virginia adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay (0.92 m/yr on average), which could be due to the cessation of groundwater withdrawal from one of the region's largest groundwater users. In the Mid-Atlantic region, shallow groundwater was found to have slight rising trends (0.08 m, p < 0.05) while deeper groundwater showed distinctive declining trends (1.36 m, p < 0.05) between 2002 and 2016. There were significantly more cultivated areas with declining groundwater levels (88% vs. 35%, p < 0.05) in counties with high percentages of cropland (> 50%) compared to areas covered by less cropland. As climate and human pressures increase, it will be critical to identify and evaluate alternative water sources, such as reclaimed water, to sustain agricultural production and protect groundwater resources.

Because magnetic fields are correlated with distance from lines, the question of whether the risk is due to magnetic fields exposure or to some other factor associated with distance from lines is unresolved. We used data from a large records-based case-control study to examine several research questions formulated to disentangle the relationships among magnetic fields, distance from high voltage lines, and childhood leukemia risk. In models examining an interaction between distance and magnetic fields exposure, we found that neither close proximity to high voltage lines alone nor exposure to high calculated fields alone were associated with childhood leukemia risk. Rather, elevated risk was confined to the group that was both very close to high voltage lines (< 50 m) and had high calculated fields (>= 0.4 mu T) (odds ratio 4.06, 95% CI 1.16, 14.3). Further, high calculated fields (>= 0.4 mu T) that were due solely to lower voltage lines (< 200 kV) were not associated with elevated risk; rather, risk was confined to high fields attributable to high voltage lines. Whilst other explanations are possible, our findings argue against magnetic fields as a sole explanation for the association between distance and childhood leukemia and in favor of some other explanation linked to characteristics of power lines.

Back to the future: conserving functional and phylogenetic diversity in amphibian-climate refuges	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Anthropocene; Climate change; Atlantic Forest; Anura; Gymnophiona	BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST; 6TH MASS EXTINCTION; CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; REPRODUCTIVE MODES; NICHE EVOLUTION; PROTECTED AREAS; BIODIVERSITY; RANGE; DISTRIBUTIONS	Climate refuges have been used by several species over historical climate change. Ectothermic species often display good models for climate change studies because they are highly sensitive to temperature. Analysis of species loss with ecosystem and evolutionary values helps to understand environmental processes and climate change consequences. We determined the functional and phylogenetic diversity of amphibians in the Atlantic Forest hotspot, using multiple models representingpresent and future conditions. Through a novel approach, we predict species' threat status by 2080, following the IUCN's criterion B1. Our results estimate a drastic reduction in species richness, ecosystem functioning and evolutionary history at low latitudes and altitudes. We show that species will tend to disperse to the areas with milder temperatures (i.e., high latitudes/altitudes). Some of these areas are the same climate refuges that have been suggested for the Late Pleistocene. We highlight that 60% of amphibians can become threatened under predicted-future conditions. This work advances the knowledge on climate refuges for amphibian ecology and evolution, supporting complementary tools for conservation strategies.

Species richness and diversity are the most used descriptors to assess the effect of changes in land use on tropical communities. However, other biological responses such as richness and diversity of trophic guilds may also provide a better understanding about the robustness and resilience of tropical environments to disturbance. In this study, we evaluated how changes in local and landscape characteristics associated to habitat loss and fragmentation affect: (i) species richness and Shannon diversity as well as (ii) trophic guild richness and diversity of leaf litter ants in human-modified tropical rainforest landscapes in Mexico. For this, we sampled ants in 16 sampling sites and recorded a series of descriptors at both local (i.e. elevation, temperature, relative humidity, soil pH, canopy cover, litter volume and vegetation structure) and landscape level (i.e. landscape heterogeneity, forest cover and connectivity). Overall, we observed that increasing primary forest cover within the sampling sites positively influenced richness and diversity of species and trophic guilds. In addition, at the local level, we found that only richness and diversity of ant species were negatively associated with tree density (i.e. number of trees, litter volume and canopy cover). These findings suggest that opportunistic species can be favored in environments with low tree density. In short, our complementary approach highlights the importance of environmental variability and primary forest cover in the maintenance of ant biodiversity in primary rainforest remnants.

Effects of grazing on plant composition, conservation status and ecosystem services of Natura 2000 shrub-grassland habitat types	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Carbon storage; Fire hazard; Functional traits; Indicator species; Vegetation structure	CALCAREOUS GRASSLANDS; FIRE-BEHAVIOR; BIODIVERSITY; CARBON; FOREST; FUELS; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; RESPONSES	The Natura 2000 network is crucial to conserve biodiversity in the European Union and provides hotspots for certain ecosystem services. Grazing, a common land use in different Natura 2000habitat types, may contribute to the maintenance of protected plant communities and reduce fuel loads and wildfire hazard. Our study aims to assess the effects of grazing on plant composition and conservation status of calcareous shrub-grassland Natura 2000 habitat types, as well as its effects on fire hazard reduction and aboveground carbon storage. We surveyed plant communities grazed by goats in fenced (ungrazed) and open (grazed) plots in a mosaic of calcareous shrub-grassland habitat types and assessed plant species composition and habitat conservation status. We also assessed aboveground plant biomass in grazed and ungrazed plots and modelled potential fire behaviour in those plots for each habitat. With the exception of cryptogams, grazing did not affect plant cover, but positively affected species richness (mean +/- SD: 26.80 +/- 11.65 vs. 29.37 +/- 8.59, P=0.01; fenced vs. unfenced) and Shannon diversity (2.11 +/- 0.81 vs. 2.33 +/- 0.55, P<0.01) in the habitat mosaic. Furthermore, grazing did not affect the conservation status of two out of three of the studied habitat types. Additionally, grazing decreased the fire hazard in grass and dwarf shrub communities without reducing aboveground carbon stocks significantly. Our results show that moderate grazing is a management practice that effectively contribute to the conservation of Natura 2000 shrub-grassland habitat types through reduction of wildfire hazard and maintenance of habitat conservation status.

Surrogate species have been used for that purpose as a means to lower costs/effort to assess representation of other species important for conservation planning. Such strategy should include multiple species and habitats within a given landscape or geographic area. The use of surrogates provides an appealing shortcut to monitoring biodiversity as it enables an efficient use of limited resources. As a group, raptors feed on a very wide range of prey sizes and, therefore, on a high diversity of prey species, which should improve their surrogacy complementarity. The aim of this paper is to identify a suitable approach that can be used as an efficient surrogate of regional diversity in desert ecosystems. First, through assemblageconcordance analysis we tested two alternative approaches either using: (a) a single raptor species or (b) the entire group of raptor species as surrogates of biodiversity. Second, through correlation analysis we also tested whether the species richness of single target groups (raptors, other birds, reptiles, mammals and plants), or of two-group combinations, was correlated with the pooled species richness of the remaining groups, and then determine each of the taxonomic groups as surrogates of the entire biodiversity at the regional scale. Four single raptor species showed significant concordance with the entire bird community but, overall, most comparisons between single raptor species and other taxonomic groups failed to show any consistent correlation. A remarkable finding from the single species approach was that the strongest significant positive association was that found between caracara C. cheriway and bird species richness. This raptor is a habitat and diet generalist, thus contradicting the hypothesis that specialist species make the best bioindicators. Raptor species were significantly associated with non-raptor birds, vegetation and rodents, but not with the mammal or reptile communities. Plant species richness showed a statistically significant concordance with most of the other groups except for reptiles. Reptiles were the group that showed less concordance with the others. Between-groups comparisons showed that the species richness was strongly correlated between birds and plants, followed by between raptors and birds; correlations between birds and mammals, reptiles and mammals and raptors and plants were weak albeit statistically significant. Species richness of some individual groups, namely other birds, plants and mammals, were significantly correlated with their corresponding remaining richness values. The pooled species richness of two-group combinations were strongly correlated for raptors and other birds, raptors and plants, other birds and mammals, and reptiles and plants, and their corresponding remaining richness. We propose an approach using the combined species richness of two taxonomic groups given the high, statistically significant correlation with their corresponding remaining richness in the Baja California peninsula and possibly in other desert ecosystems too.

This also applies to Poa badensis, a rare steppe plant of calcareous rock/sand vegetation. To explore potential differences in reproductive success and genetic composition of peripheral populations, we analysed the absolute (north)westernmost occurrences in Western Germany and populations at the western margin (Eastern Austria) and the centre (Central Hungary) of the Pannonicum, representing a part of the continuous range. Specifically, we discuss the genetic and reproductive constitution of the (north)westernmost exclave and draw conclusions on the species' biogeographical and conservation history in this region. Therefore, we used two independent molecular marker systems (AFLPs, cpDNA sequences) and a set of performance parameters. Overall, lowest regional genetic diversity was found in Western Germany, which is mainly a result of the specific history of two populations. However, this low genetic diversity was not accompanied by reduced reproductive success. The Eastern Austrian populations showed reduced genetic diversity and predominantly reduced performance, interpreted as a consequence of small population sizes. Central Hungarian populations showed the overall highest genetic diversity and comparatively high performance values. We observed high admixture and haplotype sharing between Austrian and Hungarian populations, indicating gene flow among these regions. In contrast, we interpreted the increased population differentiation within, and the clear distinctiveness of the German exclave as a long-term isolation of these (north)westernmost occurrences. Our results, overall, prove the good constitution of these populations and, together with their particular biogeographical history, highlight their conservation value.

We used six aquatic taxonomic groups to test the relationship between environmental and geographic factors and their effect on species turnover patterns in an agriculturally dominated river (Chaohu Lake Basin, China). The relationships between three dissimilarity indices and geographic distance were assessed using the Mantel test while considering the differences in environmental factors between sites. Then, we employed a variation partitioning method to distinguish the isolated and combined effects of environmental and geographic distance on species turnover. There were significant relationships between environmental distance and species turnover in all groups. All organisms except periphytic diatoms were significantly correlated with two geographic (Euclidean and network) distances when the Chao dissimilarity index was considered. The results suggest that the strength of the correlations changed with environmental and geographic distances and with the aquatic community. The communities displayed more complex relationships with the distance measures when different dissimilarity (Jaccard, Chao, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) indices were considered. Nevertheless, aquatic communities are strongly influenced by both environmental and geographic distance, and the former has a stronger effect than the latter.

Developing and testing models of the drivers of anthropogenic and lightning-caused wildfire ignitions in south-eastern Australia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Wildfire; Ignition; Bushfire; Risk; Modelling	FUEL TREATMENT; BUSHFIRE FATALITIES; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; FIRE OCCURRENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST; LANDSCAPE; MANAGEMENT; WEATHER; RISK	Considerable investments are made in managing fire risk to human assets, including a growing use of fire behaviour simulation tools to allocate expenditure. Understanding fire risk requires estimation of the likelihood of ignition, spread of the fire and impact on assets. The ability to estimate and predict risk requires both the development of ignition likelihood models and the evaluation of these models in novel environments. We developed models for natural and anthropogenic ignitions in the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria incorporating variables relating to fire weather, terrain and the built environment. Fire weather conditions had a consistently positive effect on the likelihood of ignition, although they contributed much more to lightning (57%) and power transmission (55%) ignitions than the 7 other modelled causes (8-32%). The built environment played an important role in driving anthropogenic ignitions. Housing density was the most important variable in most models and proximity to roads had a consistently positive effect. In contrast, the best model for lightning ignitions included a positive relationship with primary productivity, as represented by annual rainfall. These patterns are broadly consistent with previous ignition modelling studies. The models developed for Victoria were tested in the neighbouring fire prone states of South Australia and Tasmania. The anthropogenic ignition model performed well in South Australia (AUC = 0.969) and Tasmania (AUC = 0.848), whereas the natural ignition model only performed well in South Australia (AUC = 0.972; Tasmania AUC = 0.612). Model performance may have been impaired by much lower lightning ignition rates in South Australia and Tasmania than in Victoria. This study shows that the spatial likelihood of ignition can be reliably predicted based on readily available meteorological and biophysical data. Furthermore, the strong performance of anthropogenic and natural ignition models in novel environments suggests there are some universal drivers of ignition likelihood across south-eastern Australia.

In this study, we hypothesized that plant populations perform differently under different grazing management due to their specified preference by livestock animals. We also tested whether grazing-rest management, aimed at increasing long-term rangeland sustainability, improves the plant growth of forage grass species. We evaluated plant density, individual morphology and plant-size distribution of dominant grass populations in permanent exclosures and open fields under moderate and intensive grazing pressures in Patagonian steppes (South America). We also examined the effects of seasonal grazing-rest managements on the growth and tillering (asexual reproduction) of forage species plants, using temporary mobile exclosures. Grazing intensity changed population density and structure according to species. Compared to permanent exclosures, moderate grazing maintained the plant density of palatable species highly preferred by sheep, reduced the standing-dead biomass proportion of individual plants, and promoted the green biomass of tussocks. Conversely, intensive grazing (double stocking rates) decreased the plant density and individual size of species highly preferred by sheep, and increased the plant density of non-preferred species. Grazing-rest enhanced forage grass species growth and reproduction compared with year-round grazing management, especially during the growing season of a wet year. Our studies support that sheep can be managed to control the plant-size distribution of dominant grass species, their population dynamics, and thereby the overall forage availability at the community level. Both moderate grazing and grazing-rest management can improve the forage availability and preserve the dominant native grasses. We suggest applying a plant population dynamics perspective to facilitate sustainable management of global rangelands.

Assessments of cumulative effects must first calculate the cumulative exposure of a wildlife population to a hazard and then estimate how the exposure will affect the population. Our research responds to the first need by developing a model designed to assess how different wind farm siting scenarios cumulatively expose wildlife. The model assesses cumulative exposure by identifying all locations where development could occur, placing wind farms within this suitability layer, and then overlaying wind engineering and biological data sets. The first model output is a graphical representation of how offshore wind farm siting decisions affect wildlife cumulative exposure. The second output is an index that ranks which offshore wind farm siting decisions will have the greatest influence on wildlife cumulative exposure. Together these outputs provide stakeholders with valuable information that could be used to guide siting and management decisions.	[Goodale, M.

Estimating high fire severity potential and accurate classification between fire severity levels are essential for integrated fire management planning in fire prone Mediterranean pine ecosystems. This study attempts to determine the role of topography, pre-fire forest stand structure, fuel complex characteristics and fire behavior parameters on high fire severity potential and classification based on a large fire event occurred in Thasos, Greece. Within this framework, the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm was used to model the relationship between a large set of predictors and fire severity as expressed by the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) spectral index, inferred from differenced pre- and post-fire Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) at 30-m resolution. Results from the RF classifier algorithm showed that high fire severity potential and classification between fire severity levels mainly depended on topography variables and fuel complex characteristics. Assessing of factors which drive a fire to turn into high severe fire and classification into fire severity levels will substantially help land and forest managers to increase fire prevention and develop of concrete actions for successful post fire management at landscape level.

The estimation of burn severity based on remote sensing is a powerful tool that, to be useful, needs to be related and validated with field data. The present paper explores the relationships between field accessible variables and Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) index by using linear mixed-effects models and boosted regression trees, based on data from 28 large fires and 668 field measurements across three countries in southern Europe. The RdNBR clearly reflected the mean height of charred stem and loss of ligneous, living shrub and tree cover during the fire. The paper confirms that remote sensing indices provide an acceptable assessment of fire induced impact on forest vegetation but also highlights there are important between-fire variations due to specific contexts that modify these relationships. These variations can be effectively assessed and should be taken into account in future predictive efforts.

Investigation of recent decadal-scale cyclical fluctuations in salinity in the lower Colorado River	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Colorado River; Water quality; Salinity		Beginning in the late 1970s, 10- to 15-year cyclical oscillations in salinity were observed at lower Colorado River monitoring sites, moving upstream from the international border with Mexico, above Imperial Dam, below Hoover Dam, and at Lees Ferry. The cause of these cyclical trends in salinity was unknown. These salinity cycles complicate the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) responsibility for managing salinity in the river for delivery of water to Mexico to meet treaty obligations. This study develops a conceptual model of the salinity cycles from time-series water quality, streamflow, and precipitation data in both the lower and upper Colorado River Basins in order to provide Reclamation the ability to understand, anticipate, and manage future salinity cycles in the lower river. Compared with the Lees Ferry record, both maximum and minimum salinity levels increase downstream by about 25% at Hoover Dam, by about 49% at Imperial Dam, and by about 69% at the northern international boundary with Mexico. In the upper basin, cyclical salinity trends are evident at the outflow of three major tributaries, where salinity is also noted to be inversely related to streamflow. Time series trends in precipitation within the catchments of the three upper basin tributaries indicate cyclical periods with above normal precipitation and periods with below normal precipitation. Periods of greater than normal precipitation in the contributing areas correspond with declines in salinity at the catchment monitoring sites and periods of less than normal precipitation correspond with rising salinity at the sites. Based on the conceptual model developed in this investigation, a multiple linear regression model was developed using a stepwise variable selection procedure to simulate salinity in Lake Powell inflow. Important variables in the explanation of salinity entering Lake Powell include flow from the three upper basin tributaries, seasonality, and mean precipitation in the upper basin, among others. The root mean square error of prediction for the MLR model was 31.48 mg/L (5.7%).

Here, we present a modelling approach that assesses the relative impact of disturbances on carbon storage and sequestration, and how this will alter under climate change. Our case study is semi-arid Australia where large areas of land are managed to offset over 122 million tonnes of anthropogenic carbon emissions over a 100-year period. These carbon offsets include mature vegetation that has been protected from clearing and regenerating vegetation on degraded agricultural land. We use a Bayesian Network model to combine multiple probabilistic models of the risk posed by fire, drought, grazing and recruitment failure to carbon dynamics. The model is parameterised from a review of relevant literature and additional quantitative analyses presented here. We found that the risk of vegetation becoming a net source of carbon due to a mortality event, or failing to realise maximum sequestration potential, through recruitment failure in regenerating vegetation, was primarily a function of rainfall in this semi-arid environment. However, the relative size of an emissions event varied across vegetation communities depending on plant attributes, specifically resprouting capacity. Modelled climate change effects were variable, depending on the climate change projection used. Under 'best-case' or 'most-likely' climate scenarios for 2050, similar or increased projections of mean annual precipitation, associated with a build-up of fuel, were expected to drive an increase in fire activity (a 40-160% increase), but a decrease in drought (a 20-35% decrease). Under a 'worst-case' climate scenario, fire activity was expected to decline (a 37% decrease), but drought conditions remain similar (a 5% decrease). These projected changes to the frequency of drought and fire increase the risk that vegetation used for carbon offsetting will fail to provide anticipated amounts of carbon abatement over their lifetime.

Mitigation measures such as fences and wildlife passages have been applied to reduce these effects. During the widening of Quebec's Highway 175 from two to four lanes between 2006 and 2012, 33 wildlife passages designed specifically for small and medium-sized mammals were installed under the road in combination with short fences. This study examined the effectiveness of the fences at reducing the number of small and medium-sized mammals killed along a 68 km section of the road while controlling for the potential confounding effects of landscape variables. Repeated daily mortality surveys were conducted by car during the summers of 2012-2015 to measure roadkill occurrence and detection probability. A total of 893 dead animals from 13 taxa were detected. Roadkill occurrence was significantly greater at fence ends than in fenced sections and unfenced sections (fence-end effect), indicating that the fences were not long enough to discourage animals from moving along the fence to the fence ends. Greater length would be required to meet the target of reduced road mortality. Shrubby vegetation in the median strip separating the two directions of the highway was associated with high roadkill occurrence for medium-sized species. Roadkill detection probability for all species combined was 0.72, ranging from 0.17 for small mammals (< 1 kg) to 0.82 for medium-sized mammals (> 1 kg). To reduce road mortality, when wildlife passages are constructed along with new highways or retrofitted to old highways, fences either should be continuous or sufficiently long to encourage passage use rather than movement around the fence ends. Future road mortality studies should be combined with data about wildlife abundance and detection probability to more accurately estimate the effects at the population level.

A new analysis workflow for discrimination of nuclear grade graphite using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article						LIBS fingerprinting; i-graphite; Decommissioning; Waste management	EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY; IRRADIATED GRAPHITE; ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; LINE ANALYSIS; SAMPLES; IDENTIFICATION; ABLATION; CARBON; CHARCOAL	Stand-off, in-situ, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) offers a rapid, safe, and cost-effective method for discrimination of radioactive waste materials arising during the operation of nuclear plants and from decommissioning activities. Characterisation of waste materials is a critical activity in understanding the nature of the waste, ensuring hazardous material is managed safely and that waste can be segregated for reuse, recycle or sentenced for appropriate disposal. Characterisation of materials, often in hostile environments, requires the ability to remotely differentiate between materials in terms of their chemical composition and radioactivity. This proposition was tested using a case study on nuclear grade graphite. Graphite has been used extensively as a moderator material in many nuclear reactors. Internationally, over 250,000 tons of various nuclear-grade graphite, and graphite-bearing, materials exist. These are a major issue for nuclear decommissioning and radioactive waste management, due to the long half-lives of the associated C-14 and Cl-36 isotopes. LIBS offers a method for discrimination of nuclear grade graphites and other carbon and non-carbon-bearing wastes. This paper describes the development of a workflow method, including LIBS measurement analysis, for the discrimination of pre-irradiated nuclear 'Pile Grade A' (PGA) graphite moderator rod and domestic lumpwood charcoal, which act as surrogates for nuclear grade graphite and other carbon-bearing wastes. A new analysis workflow comprising the examination of spectral characteristics, multivariate analysis and molecular isotopic spectroscopy is proposed to enable rapid segregation of graphite from a heterogeneous waste stream. Enhanced characterisation techniques have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of decommissioning large parts of legacy nuclear generation plants.	[Horsfall, John P.

Feral fuchsia eating: Long-term decline of a palatable shrub in grazed rangelands	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Australia; Browsing impacts; Extinction; Resprouting; Threatened species; Recruitment dynamics	REGENERATION; AUSTRALIA; RABBITS; KANGAROOS; SURVIVAL; SHEEP; SURVIVORSHIP; RECRUITMENT; EXTINCTION; STRATEGIES	Palatable shrubs and trees in rangelands are vulnerable to grazing impacts, with local extinctions and declines documented. However, population trends are difficult to detect due to longevity of individuals and poor understanding of regeneration. We investigated the demography and conservation status of the Grey Range fuchsia (Eremophila stenophylla Chinnock), a geographically restricted and palatable shrub endemic to south-west Queensland. We documented 28 populations over 30,400 km(2), with an estimated total population size of 17,000 individuals. Seedling recruitment is rare and seedlings were observed at six populations, all with low or intermittent grazing pressure. In contrast, vegetative recruits were recorded at 19 populations and comprised at least 28% of plants measured. Resprouting confers some resilience to individuals, although repeated browsing restricts plant growth, limiting flowering and fruiting. Consistently heavily grazed populations also contain fewer plants. Although Eremophila stenophylla is secure in numerous populations with low grazing pressure, it qualifies as Vulnerable under IUCN Red List criteria due to past and ongoing decline at more than half of its populations. Grazing relief is necessary to ensure the long-term persistence of these populations. We predict that similar trajectories apply to other semi-arid shrubs, and research is required to inform grazing management to avert local extinctions.	[Silcock, J. L.; Fensham, R.

Responses of biological soil crusts to rehabilitation strategies	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Exopolysaccharides; Cyanobacteria; Chlorophyll a; Soil stability; Restoration	DESERT; EXOPOLYSACCHARIDES; STABILIZATION; DISTURBANCE; MODELS; ALGAE	Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are common to dryland ecosystems and can influence a broad suite of soil ecological functions including stability and surface hydrology. Due to long recovery times following disturbance, there is a clear need for rehabilitation strategies to enhance the recovery of biocrust communities. Essential to biocrust recovery are exopolysaccharides (EPS): secretions comprised mainly of high molecular weight polymers that protect cyanobacteria and other biocrust organisms from harsh environmental conditions. We examined whether biocrust rehabilitation strategies (combinations of inoculation with surface shading and artificial soil stabilization) promote EPS production. To test if responses varied by soil texture, we measured biocrust recovery on two fine-textured soils (clay and sandy clay loam) in a cool desert ecosystem. Shade coupled with inoculum addition resulted in the highest biocrust recovery, especially on clay soils. Independent of rehabilitation strategies, natural recovery of biocrusts occurred more rapidly on clay soils, reflected by greater increases in chlorophyll a (chl a). Chl a, a proxy for cyanobacterial biomass, was correlated to EPS amounts, suggesting that cyanobacteria are significant contributors to EPS production in biocrust development. Despite the role of EPS in biocrust establishment, EPS amounts had negligible effects on soil stability on the fine soil texture.

Quantitative bias analysis of the association of type 2 diabetes mellitus with 2,2 ',4,4 ',5,5 '-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153)	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Quantitative bias analysis; PBPK modeling; Persistent organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Confounding	PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHER; BLOOD PARTITION-COEFFICIENTS; SUBCUTANEOUS ADIPOSE-TISSUE; ELIMINATION HALF-LIVES; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; EPIDEMIOLOGIC ASSOCIATIONS; CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK; SERUM CONCENTRATIONS; FAT RADIODENSITY	An association between serum concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153), and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been reported. Conditional on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), a higher serum PCB-153 concentration may be a marker of T2DM risk because it reflects other aspects of obesity that are related to T2DM risk and to PCB-153 clearance. To estimate the amount of residual confounding by other aspects of obesity, we performed a quantitative bias analysis on the results of a specific study. A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict serum levels of PCB-153 for a simulated population. T2DM status was assigned to simulated subjects based on age, sex, BMI, WC, and visceral adipose tissue mass. The distributions of age, BMI, WC, and T2DM prevalence of the simulated population were tailored to closely match the target population. Analysis of the simulated data showed that a small part of the observed association appeared to be due to residual confounding. For example, the predicted odds ratio of T2DM that would have been obtained had the results been adjusted for visceral adipose tissue mass, for the >= 90th percentile of PCB-153 serum concentration, was 6.60 (95% CI 2.46-17.74), compared with an observed odds ratio of 7.13 (95% CI 2.65-19.13). Our results predict that the association between PCB-153 and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus would not be substantially changed by additional adjustment for visceral adipose tissue mass in epidemiologic analyses. Confirmation of these predictions with longitudinal data would be reassuring.	[Dzierlenga, M. W.; Yoon, M.; Clewell, H. J.] ScitoVation LLC, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Wania, F.; Armitage, J.

We tested the efficacy of three local biological components (municipal compost, white-rot fungus: Pleurotus ostreatus and willow: Salix planifolia) to remediate diesel-contaminated soils in a subarctic climate (Whitehorse, YT, Canada), and compared their efficacy to natural attenuation and chemical fertilizers (industry standard). After the first growing season, biologically amended treatments (BAT) that contained >2 biological components, had decreased 69-73% of the diesel's F2 fraction (C-10-C-16), which is more than natural attenuation or fertilizer (48 and 51%). By the third growing season, the BAT dropped below the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment's (CCME) Agricultural & Residential/Parkland guideline (<150 mg kg(-1)) and 86% of willows had survived and developed extensive roots. MiSeq amplicon sequencing of fungal (ITS) and bacterial (16S) rRNA genes showed the BAT's microbial communities were significantly more abundant and diverse. We found 132 bacterial and 35 fungal genera unique to the BAT. Readily-available local biological components such as municipal compost, fungi and willows may provide an effective alternative to applications of imported chemical fertilizers for the bioremediation and revegetation of diesel-contaminated soil in northern environments.

Evaluation of historical atmospheric pollution in an industrial area by dendrochemical approaches	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Dendrochemistry; Historical atmospheric exposure; Trace metal pollution; Tree rings; Industrial harbour	AIRBORNE TRACE-ELEMENTS; METAL POLLUTION; TREE-RINGS; AIR-POLLUTION; HEAVY-METALS; SOILS; URBAN; BARK; MERCURY; FOLIAR	We conducted a dendrochemical study in order to evaluate the exposure of territories and populations to different types of pollutants and to characterise the history of pollution in one of the most intensely industrialised areas of Europe: the industrial port zone of Fos, also heavily urbanised. To perform the study, two tree species have been selected, Pinus halepensis and Populus nigra, on a rural plot located roughly 20 km away from the industrial harbour, an urban plot located in the city of Fos-sur-Mer and an industrial plot. Our study indicated that poplar was a more relevant model for the dendrochemical studies, exhibiting a higher bioaccumulation capacity than pine except for Hg, Sb and Mn. Moreover, thanks to this work, we observed significant exposure of the trees in the urban and industrial areas to As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mo, Sb, Zn, Al, Ca, and Mg, highlighting the exposure of the territory and populations living in the vicinity of the industrial harbour. The temporal variability of the concentrations measured in the tree rings corresponds to the increasing industrialisation of the territory as well as to the evolution of the industrial processes. Thus, this project highlighted the exposure of the Gulf of Fos to atmospheric emissions (industrial, road and urban) of the industrial harbour as well as the changes over time. It also pointed out the relevance of using dendrochemistry to measure atmospheric exposure of metals and metalloids and its temporal variability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The identification of potential endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has gained increasing priority in the assessment of environmental hazards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has developed the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) which aims to prioritize and screen potential EDCs. The Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) program has generated data using in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays measuring activity of chemicals at multiple points along the androgen receptor (AR) activity pathway. In the present study, using a large and diverse data set of 1667 chemicals provided by the U.S. EPA from the combined ToxCast AR assays in the framework of the Collaborative Modeling Project for Androgen Receptor Activity (CoMPARA). Two models were built using ADMET Predictor (TM); one is based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) technology and the other uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm; one model is a Decision Tree (DT) developed in R; and two models make use of differently combined sets of structural alerts (SAs) automatically extracted by SARpy. We used two strategies to integrate predictions from single models; one is based on a majority vote approach and the other on prediction convergence. These strategies led to enhanced statistical performance in most cases. Moreover, the majority vote approach improved prediction coverage when one or more single models were not able to provide any estimations. This study integrates multiple in silico approaches as a virtual screening tool for use in risk assessment of endocrine disrupting chemicals. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The environmental risk was computed as the ratio of MECs (i.e. the measured environmental concentrations) to PNECs (i.e. the respective predicted no-effect concentrations). The effects of caffeine and propranolol on the freshwater cyclopoid Diacyclops crassicaudis crassicaudis were tested both individually and in binary mixtures. Propranolol posed an environmental risk in some but not in all the surface water ecosystems of Spain investigated in this study, while caffeine posed an environmental risk to all the investigated freshwater bodies, both as single compound and in the mixture with propranolol. Propranolol was the most toxic compound to D. crassicaudis crassicaudis, while caffeine was non-toxic to this species. The CA model predicted the toxicity of the propranolol and caffeine mixture for this species. D. crassicaudis crassicaudis was much less sensitive than several other aquatic species to both compounds. The sensitivity of D. crassicaudis crassicaudis does not increase the environmental risk posed by the two compounds in the freshwater bodies of Spain, however, further testing is recommended since the effect of toxicants on freshwater copepods can be more pronounced under multiple stressors and temperature increasing due to climate change.

It is described that the selection and dissemination of antibiotic resistance is enhanced by stressors, like metals or antibiotics, which can occur as environmental contaminants. This study aimed at unveiling the composition of the conjugative plasmidome of a hospital effluent multidrug resistant Escherichia coli strain (H1FC54) under different mating conditions. To meet this objective, plasmid pulsed field gel electrophoresis, optical mapping analyses and DNA sequencing were used in combination with phenotype analysis. Strain H1FC54 was observed to harbor five plasmids, three of which were conjugative and two of these, pH1FC54_330 and pH1FC54_140, contained metal and antibiotic resistance genes. Transconjugants obtained in the absence or presence of tellurite (0.5 mu M or 5 mu M), arsenite (0.5 mu M, 5 mu M or 15 mu M) or ceftazidime (10 mg/L) and selected in the presence of sodium azide (100 mg/L) and tetracycline (16 mg/L) presented distinct phenotypes, associated with the acquisition of different plasmid combinations, including two co-integrate plasmids, of 310 kbp and 517 kbp. The variable composition of the conjugative plasmidome, the formation of co-integrates during conjugation, as well as the transfer of non-transferable plasmids via co-integration, and the possible association between antibiotic, arsenite and tellurite tolerance was demonstrated. These evidences bring interesting insights into the comprehension of the molecular and physiological mechanisms that underlie antibiotic resistance propagation in the environment.

A toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic (TK-TD) model was used to quantify AOP of the toxicity of Cd and Pb to zebrafish, including the quantitative relationship between Cd and Pb accumulation in gill and oxidative damage level based on ROS or MDA, and LC50 values at different times. Significant relationships were found between the oxidative damage level characterized by ROS and MDA content and Cd or Pb accumulation in gill (R-2 > 0.60), and the TK model could better simulate the Pb accumulation in the gills (R-2 > 0.60) than Cd. The increasing of Cd or Pb concentrations induced the generation of ROS and the formation of ROS initiated the fluctuation of MDA level in the cells as compared to controls (p < 0.05). For the individual level effect, the Damage Assessment Model (DAM) could successfully explain the change of LC50-ROS and LC50-MDA values at different times (R-2 > 0.99). Our findings suggested that the TK-TD model based on ROS and MDA could be used as a quantitative AOP to predict toxicity of metals to zebrafish. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Physiologically based toxicokinetics (PBTK) models that can quantitatively describe absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion processes of chemicals in biota are of importance to predict internal exposure (e.g. doses at specific target tissues/organs) from external exposure concentrations. In this study, PBTK models with up to six compartments including brain, liver, kidney, gills, richly perfused tissues and poorly perfused tissues, were developed for predicting internal distribution of 10 PPCPs in wild common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The PBTK predicted concentrations were close to the measured ones, with deviations less than 1 log unit for most of PPCPs. Sensitivity analysis showed that various partition coefficients of the chemicals exerted significant influence on model outputs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the relative merits of conserving versus increasing non-production perennial vegetation (NPPV) are not well understood despite the universal conflicts among such objectives in rapidly urbanizing and intensifying agricultural regions worldwide. Hence, using the most intensive agricultural region of British Columbia, Canada as a case study, we aimed to (i) evaluate the current status of NPPV in terms of carbon stocks and landscape connectivity metrics (ii) compare options for conservation relative to agricultural expansion in terms of maintenance of landscape multifunctionality (iii) identify management options for NPPV that could maximize ecological benefits using a normative scenario analysis. We determined that 83% of the NPPV found on the farmland in our study area is likely susceptible to conversion to expanding agricultural production or urban development. Scenario analysis showed planting hedgerows along all farm parcel boundaries and riparian buffers along all farmscape waterways will not compensate for the loss of multifunctionality from agricultural intensification based on expansion. Conserving or planting hedgerows alone however resulted in a disproportionate increase in connectivity given the relative loss of productive agricultural land. This analysis clearly highlights the potential trade-offs among the indicators evaluated as well as the benefits of intensification on land already in production. In the assessed landscape, protecting existing large patches of NPPV and augmenting the landscape pattern with hedgerows is an effective approach to conflicting objectives and ensuring landscape multifunctionality.

Resource recovery can contribute to mitigation, for instance through converting wastewater resources to microbial protein for animal feed. Wastewater typically holds a complex mixture of organics, posing a challenge to selectively produce heterotrophic biomass. Ensuring the product's quality could be achieved by anaerobic generation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) followed by photoheterotrophic production of purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) with infrared light. This study aimed to determine the most suitable PNSB culture for VFA conversion and map the effect of acetate, propionate, butyrate and a VFA mixture on growth and biomass yield. Six cultures were screened in batch: (i) Rhodopseudomonas palustris, (ii) Rhodobacter sphaeroides, (iii) Rhodospirillum rubrum, (iv) a 3-species synthetic community (i+ii+iii) (v) a community enriched on VFA holding Rb. capsulatus, and (vi) Rb. capsulatus (isolate 'v'). The VFA mixture elevated growth rates with a factor 1.3-2.5 compared to individual VFA. Rb. capsulatus showed the highest growth rates: 1.8 -2.2 d(-1) (enriched) and 2.3-3.8 d(-1) (isolated). In a photobioreactor (PBR) inoculated with the Rb. capsulatus enrichment, decreasing sludge retention time (SRT) yielded lower biomass concentrations, yet increased productivities, reaching 1.7 g dry weight (DW) L-1 d(-1), the highest phototrophic rate reported thus far, and a growth rate of up to 5 d(-1). PNSB represented 26-57% of the community and the diversity index was low (3-7), with a dominance of Rhodopseudomonas at long SRT and Rhodobacter at short SRT. The biomass yield for all cultures, in batch and reactor cultivation, approached 1 g CODBiomass g(-1) CODRemoved. An economic estimation for a two-stage approach on brewery wastewater (load 2427 kg COD d(-1)) showed that 0.5 d SRT allowed for the lowest production cost ((sic) 10 kg(-1) DW; equal shares for capex and opex). The findings strengthen the potential for a novel two-stage approach for resource recovery from industrial wastewater, enabling high-rate PNSB production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The stochastic deterioration model predicts faeces size evolution over time. It conceptually entails the two main processes of solid fragmentation, namely breakage and erosion. Model parameters were calibrated on synthetic faeces and validated with real human ones. A cylindrical reactor was used, where turbulent flow was forced by an array of water jets and the physical disintegration of the faeces was monitored using a high speed camera. Image analysis of breakage experiments obtained under backlight illumination allowed determination of the evolution of the solids' size over time. The flow field in the reactor was characterised by particle image velocimetry (Ply) using tracer particles seeded into the water. We found different disintegration behaviours depending on turbulence intensity and water content of the solid. In conditions of low shear stress, dense solids hardly disintegrated. Generally, the model predictions mirrored the broad range in the solids disintegration rate imparted by the high variability in flow conditions and in solids characteristics. It is expected that, similar to our experiments, also in real sewer systems both flow conditions and solid characteristics are highly variable and the stochastic model can be tailored to capture this variability. We thus anticipate that the model can be integrated into existing sewer models predicting sewer flows and solids' movement. From these, shear stress, flow velocities and transport of individual solids can be inferred. The integration of the present solids disintegration model may provide better predictions of hot-spots for solids accumulation and blockages in sewers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Yet their dynamics have seldom been studied in engineered systems, or indeed in any system, for long periods of time. We measured virus abundance in a full-scale activated sludge plant every week for two years. Total bacteria and ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) abundances, bacterial community profiles, and a suite of environmental and operational parameters were also monitored. Mixed liquor virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude (3.18 x 10(8) -3.41 x 10 virus's mL(-1)) and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and AOB abundance, community composition, and effluent concentrations of COD and NH4+-N and thus system function. This suggests viruses play a far more important role in the dynamics of activated sludge systems than previously realised and could be one of the key factors controlling bacterial abundance, community structure and functional stability and may cause reactors to fail. These findings are based on statistical associations, not mechanistic models. Nevertheless, viral associations with abiotic factors, such as pH, make physical sense, giving credence to these findings and highlighting the role that physical factors play in virus ecology. Further work is needed to identify and quantify specific bacteriophage and their hosts to enable us to develop mechanistic models of the ecology of viruses in wastewater treatment systems. However, since we have shown that viruses can be related to effluent quality and virus quantification is simple and cheap, practitioners would probably benefit from quantifying viruses now.

We here examined whether macroinvertebrates and diatoms, experiencing recurring non-flow periods, showed alterations even after complete flow resumption in 13 mountain streams in SW Italian Alps. Benthic communities were sampled after complete flow resumption in April 2017 in a control section, with permanent flow, and inan intermittent section, which experiences recurrent non-flow periods during summer, in each stream. We tested for differences in terms of taxonomic composition, diversity and functional groups between permanent and temporary sections. Our results showed a significant alteration of benthic invertebrate, but not diatom communities in temporary sections. Different species composition and low diversity values in temporary sections were due to the replacement of monovoltine taxa, with aquatic respiration, preferring medium to fast flowing, oligotrophic waters by plurivoltine taxa, with aerial respiration preferring lentic habitats. Such results provide some insights into the mechanisms by which non-flow periods impact Alpine streams, and further investigations in mountain areas are required in the future to better unravel the repercussions on stream ecosystem processes.

Fate of selenium in soil: A case study in a maize (Zea mays L.) field under two irrigation regimes and fertilized with sodium selenite	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Selenium fractionation; Leachates; Selenium volatilization; Available Se; Irrigation	ORGANIC-MATTER; WATER MANAGEMENT; SPECIATION; SE; WHEAT; VOLATILIZATION; FRACTIONS; SELENATE; BIOAVAILABILITY; ACCUMULATION	Selenium(Se) is a trace element necessary for both human and livestock nutrition. To increase Se human intake, soil Se fertilizations were performed but the fate of the added Se remains unclear. The present research aims to: (1) determine the influence of Se fertilization on the fractionation of Se in soil; (2) assess the influence of water availability on the distribution of soil Se chemical fractions; and (3) monitor the Se content in soil, leachates and plants. To reach these goals, 200 g Se ha(-1) was applied to soil as sodium selenite in maize crops under two irrigation regimes, and the Se content in plant, soil chemical fractions and leachates were analyzed. Se application increased the total Se content of the soil, specifically it increased the Se content of the soluble, exchangeable and organic fractions with more pronounced effect in the soils with higher water availability. These differences disappeared over time likely due to the Se loss through volatilization. The hypothesis of Se volatilization is confirmed by the absence of both leachates during the maize growing season and differences among the treatments of Se content in sub-soil samples. Also, although the Se treated plants showed higher Se content than the untreated ones, overall <1% of the added Se was assimilated by plants. Hence, this study demonstrated that the addition of selenite to the soil increased the Se contents of the plants, but the Se does not accumulate in the soil because it is likely lost via volatilization. Further, leaching of Se into groundwater is avoided due to its association with both the soil organic matter and positively charged binding sites of soil, and due to its loss via volatilization. Therefore, soil Se fertilization could increase the nutritional value of plants without consequences on the environment. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modelling environmental antibiotic-resistance gene abundance: A meta-analysis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Antibiotic resistance; Gene abundance; Linear mixed-effects models; Antibiotic pollution; Environmental risk	WASTE-WATER; ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; HORIZONTAL TRANSFER; SELECTIVE PRESSURE; HEAVY-METALS; BACTERIA; TETRACYCLINE; RIVER; EMERGENCE; RESISTOME	The successful treatment of infectious diseases heavily relies on the therapeutic usage of antibiotics. However, the high use of antibiotics in humans and animals leads to increasing pressure on bacterial populations in favour of resistant phenotypes. Antibiotics reach the environment from a variety of emission sources and are being detected at relatively low concentrations. Given the possibility of selective pressure to occur at sub-inhibitory concentrations, the ecological impact of environmental antibiotic levels on microbial communities and resistance levels is vastly unknown. Quantification of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) and of antibiotic concentrations is becoming commonplace. Yet, these two parameters are often assessed separately and in a specific spatiotemporal context, thus missing the opportunity to investigate how antibiotics and ARGs relate. Furthermore, antibiotic (multi) resistance has been receiving ever growing attention from researchers, policy-makers, businesses and civil society. Our aim was to collect the limited data on antibiotic concentrations and ARG abundance currently available to explore if a relationship could be defined in surface waters, sediments and wastewaters. A metric of antibiotic selective pressure, i.e. the sum of concentrations corrected for microbial inhibition potency, was used to correlate the presence of antibiotics in the environment to total relative abundance of ARG while controlling for basic sources of non-independent variability, such as country, year, study, sample and antibiotic class. The results of this meta-analysis show a significant statistical effect of antibiotic pressure and type of environmental compartment on the increase of ARG abundance even at very low levels. If global environmental antibiotic pollution continues, ARG abundance is expected to continue as well. Moreover, our analysis emphasizes the importance of integrating existing information particularly when attempting to describe complex relationships with limited mechanistic understanding.

Tracking non-indigenous fishes in lotic ecosystems: Invasive patterns at different spatial scales in Greece	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Invasion ecology; Alien; Translocated; Freshwater fish; Assessment method	FRESH-WATER FISH; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; NONNATIVE FISHES; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; BROWN TROUT; SPECIES DENIALISM; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; PROTECTED AREAS; SCREENING TOOL; RAINBOW-TROUT	Mediterranean lotic waters such as rivers, streams and springs are poorly monitored for non-indigenous fish species (NIFS). Since these systems are stressed by multiple anthropogenic pressures, it is important to build robust procedures to track NIFS distribution and spread. This study applies a multi-faceted assessment of NIFS in the lotic ecosystems of Greece at different spatial scales by providing: a) a historical review of temporal patterns and arrival pathways of fish introductions in river basins of Greece (140 basins) across 100 years; b) an analysis of occurrence and abundance data of NIFS assemblages at the lotic site scale (644 electrofished sites); c) the mapping of NIFS distributional patterns at river basin (75 basins) and regional scales (7 freshwater ecoregions); and, d) a vector analysis of fish translocations using an ecoregional framework. In total, 55 NIFS were recorded (25 alien and 30 translocated); however, there is a low incidence of NIFS in lotic waters at the site scale (30 NIFS recorded in the field samples; 10 alien and 20 translocated). NIFS introductions in Greece appear to be influenced by specific socio-historical periods, indicating a gradual increase since late 1970s. Despite this increase, our study provides evidence that only four alien species are currently widespread and common in the rivers and streams of Greece: Gambusia holbrooki, Carassius gibelio, Pseudorasbora parva, and Lepomis gibbosus (in order of recorded abundance). NIFS tend to be absent or distributed in very low numbers in upland streams and in smaller river basins. However, the issue of translocated fish species is shown to be a sorely neglected problem that is difficult to track. This review tests a readily transferable screening procedure, contributes to the application of the European Union Regulation on Invasive Alien Species; it suggests gaps and uncertainties, and proposes conservation and management actions.

Yet, little is known about their dynamics at polluted coastal environments in the context of heterotrophic microbial communities. Here, we present the dynamics of these protists relative to their heterotrophic counterparts in three different environments, namely Pearl River Estuary (ZJK), Shenzhen Bay (SZW) and Daya Bay (DYW) along the coastline of South China Sea. ZJK and SZW were characterized by low salinity and high N levels with large variations, unlike DYW. However, the average abundance of fungus-like protists did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) among these environments, except that it increased in August (422 +/- 264 cells/mL, P < 0.01) over March, May and October. Correlation analysis revealed association of their abundance to different environmental factors, namely dissolved organic N in ZJK (rho=-0.87); NH4+ (rho=0.64) and Chl a (rho=0.73) in SZW; and salinity (rho=0.46), DO (rho=0.57) and total P (rho=0.48) in DYW, suggesting distinct influence of trophic conditions. Analysis of their abundance relative to other heterotrophic protists (HP) shows that fungus-like protists display selective advantage over HP in the environment (DWY) with low N levels. Further, the similar biomass fraction (ZJK: 5.97 +/- 6.23%, SZW: 5.97 +/- 5.28%, and DYW: 12.1 +/- 11.4%; P > 0.05) of fungus-like protists relative to heterotrophic bacteria, suggest their invariable contribution to carbon cycling. Thus, dynamics of fungus-like protists in relation to their heterotrophic counterparts is largely regulated by the trophic conditions of coastal environments. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, whether species from the same taxonomic group with distinct geographical ranges will respond differently is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to predict the potential impacts of future climate and land use change on the distribution of narrow-and wide-ranging Rhododendron species, and estimate their relative contribution in China. We applied the presence-only ecological niche model MaxEnt to predict the distribution of 10 narrow-ranging and 10 wide-ranging Rhododendron species for the year 2070, using three general circulation models and three scenarios of climate and land use change. We measured the predicted distribution change of each species using change ratio, distance and direction of core range shifts, and niche overlap using Schoener's D. We found that the distribution areas of six narrow-ranging species would decrease, of which one species would go extinct. The remaining four narrow-ranging species would experience range expansion. Distribution of all the wide-ranging Rhododendron species would decrease. All Rhododendrons will shift to the northwest. We conclude that Rhododendron species generally will be negatively affected by the climatic and land use change expected in 2070 from the three scenarios evaluated in this study, but some narrow ranging species may be positively influenced. Narrow-ranging Rhododendron species are more vulnerable compared to wide-ranging Rhododendron species. This study demonstrated that the effects of climate and land use change on alpine and subalpine plant species is species-specific, thereby strengthening our understanding of the impacts of climate and land use change on plant distribution.

The present work mapped blackwater floodplain forests (igapo) downstream of the Balbina Reservoir, which was created between 1983 and 1987 by damming the Uatuma River in the Central Amazon basin. We apply remote sensing methods to detect tree mortality resulting from hydrological changes, based on analysis of 56 ALOS/PALSAR synthetic aperture radar images acquired at different flood levels between 2006 and 2011. Our application of object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods and the random forests supervised classification algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.2%. A total of 9800 km(2) of igapo forests were mapped along the entire river downstream of the dam, but forest mortality was only observed below the first 49 km downstream, after the Morena rapids, along an 80-km river stretch. In total, 12% of the floodplain forest died within this stretch. We also detected that 29% of the remaining living igapo forest may be presently undergoing mortality. Furthermore, this large loss does not include the entirety of lost igapo forests downstream of the dam; areas which are now above current maximum flooding heights are no longer floodable and do not show on our mapping but will likely transition over time to upland forest species composition and dynamics, also characteristic of igapo loss. Our results show that floodplain forests are extremely sensitive to long-term downstream hydrological changes and disturbances resulting from the disruption of the natural flood pulse. Brazilian hydropower regulations should require that Amazon dam operations ensure the simulation of the natural flood-pulse, despite losses in energy production, to preserve the integrity of floodplain forest ecosystems and to mitigate impacts for the riverine populations.

In comparison to well-studied Mediterranean streams, drying events in canopied temperate streams occur under higher ambient humidity which probably affects the metabolic response to drying. Previous work on drying sediments (in temperate streams) did not consider the interactions of trophic levels. We hypothesized that preservation of sediment moisture due to high humidity increases resistance to drying in temperate streambed biofilms and fast resilience of biofilm activity after flow resumption. We also expected the presence of macroinvertebrate grazers to modulate the biofilm response to dry-rewet stress. Following a two-level factorial design in 24 microcosms, we tested the effect of drying intensity (moderate and intense) and grazer presence and absence (P. antipodarum) on the activity of biofilm colonizing shallow hyporheic sediment. We measured the community respiration over a drying period of 27 days, a single rewetting event and a follow-up of three days. Grazer presence stimulated biofilm community respiration (CRmic) in the permanently wet control, but decreased biofilm resistance to desiccation (<0.2% of pre-disturbed activity), regardless of drying intensity. In the absence of grazers, higher atmospheric humidity in moderately drying microcosms resulted in maintaining a film of adhesive water and low CRmic (29% of pre-disturbed respiration) until the end of the drying period. After flow resumption, the CRmic increased within 8 h, achieving 79-83% of pre-disturbed respiration (no grazers) and 15-41% (with grazers), respectively. Results show that short dry periods in temperate streams, even under high humidity, impact the streambed biofilm community negatively.

In this study, we investigated methane dynamics of five river impoundments within a two year period using a variety of methods ranging from sediment incubations for measuring methane formation rates (MF), automatic bubble-traps and echo-sounding surveys to assess ebullition fluxes, and estimated diffusive methane fluxes via dissolved concentrations in the water and calculated transport coefficients via wind speed. MF was found to be predominantly acetoclastic, and higher porewater acetate concentrations were associated with higher MF. Moreover, sediment MF showed consistent depth profiles, and when depth-integrated, MF was comparable to bubble-trap ebullition time-series measurements. Thermal response analysed for our systems and a wide range of literature data demonstrated a consistent mean value, but a large range of temperature coefficient Q(10) (1.6 to 7.0) for different studies. Annual mean ebullition rates varied over more than one order of magnitude from site to site (0.03 to 1.85 mgCH(4) l(-1) d(-1)), demonstrating that river impoundments are not all hot-spots. Future work should investigate the role of sediment delivery, deposition patterns and management on methane emissions by ebullition. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For immobilization of the trace metals the amendments zerovalent iron grit, natural zeolite, and Divergan (R) were used. Trace metal total and mobile contents were determined and bacterial communities were assessed after a SIP experiment with C-13-labelled wheat root by Ion-Torrent Sequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and two trace metal resistant genes for copper and cadmium (copA and czcA gene). The results show that the remediation effect of the three amendments is still stable after five years. The mobile trace metal contents were significantly (<= 0.001) reduced in all treatments, except the Cu content in the zeolite treatment. A higher diversity in active metabolizing and growing soil bacteria was observed in remediated soils as compared to the non-remediated control, especially for the Divergan (R) treatment. The bacterial genera Kribbella, Glycomyces, Inquilinus, Nocardioides, and Lysobacter are the most significantly enriched genera in the C-13 fractions of the treated samples. The occurrence of bacterial families, which could be identified carrying efflux-mediated metal resistance genes for Cd/Zn and Cu, were reduced in the remediated soils as compared to the non-remediated control. The most abundant bacterial family for the copA and the czcA gene is Xanthomonadaceae. The pH-value and the trace metal concentration could be identified as key drivers of bacterial community composition, and functions in trace metal contaminated soils and remediated soils.

Agriculture versus wastewater pollution as drivers of macroinvertebrate community structure in streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aquatic ecosystems; Chemical pollution; Land use; Multiple stressors; Micropollutants; Pesticides	FRESH-WATER; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; TREATMENT PLANTS; FINE SEDIMENT; PESTICIDES; ECOLOGY; TOXICITY; TRANSFORMATIONS; BIODIVERSITY	Water pollution is ubiquitous globally, yet how the effects of pollutants propagate through natural ecosystems remains poorly understood. This is because the interactive effects of multiple stressors are generally hard to predict. Agriculture and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are often major sources of contaminants for streams, but their relative importance and the role of different pollutants (e.g. nutrients or pesticides) are largely unknown. Using a 'real world experiment' with sampling locations up-and downstream ofWWTPs, we studied how effluent discharges affected water quality and macroinvertebrate communities in 23 Swiss streams across a broad land-use gradient. Variation partitioning of community composition revealed that overall water quality explained approximately 30% of community variability, whereby nutrients and pesticides each independently explained 10% and 2%, respectively. Excluding oligochaetes (which were highly abundant downstream of the WWTPs) from the analyses, resulted in a relatively stronger influence (3%) of pesticides on the macroinvertebrate community composition, whereas nutrients had no influence. Generally, the macroinvertebrate community composition downstream of the WWTPs strongly reflected the upstream conditions, likely due to a combination of efficient treatment processes, environmental filtering and organismal dispersal. Wastewater impacts were most prominently by the Saprobic index, whereas the SPEAR index (a trait-based macroinvertebrate metrics reflecting sensitivity to pesticides) revealed a strong impact of arable cropping but only a weak impact of wastewater. Overall, our results indicate that agriculture can have a stronger impact on headwater stream macroinvertebrate communities than discharges fromWWTP. Yet, effects of wastewater-born micropollutants were clearly quantifiable among all other influence factors. Improving our ability to further quantify the impacts of micropollutants requires highly-resolved water quality and taxonomic data with adequate spatial and temporal sampling. These improvements would help to better account for the underlying causal pathways that drive observed biological responses, such as episodic contaminant peaks and dispersal-related processes.

Here, through the first analysis of the parasite fauna of lymnaeid gastropods of Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe). We illustrate how the creation of an artificial lake may lead to a cascade of biological invasions in which an invasive aquatic plant promotes the proliferation of invasive gastropods, which in turn alters the epidemiology of trematodiases of potential medical and veterinary importance. Using a new multiplex Rapid Diagnostic PCR assay, we assessed the prevalence of Fasciola sp. infections in the gastropod populations. Both gastropod hosts and trematode parasites were identified using DNA barcoding. We provide the first record of the invasive North-American gastropod Pseudosuccinea columella in Lake Kariba. This species was found at 14 out of 16 sampled sites and its abundance was strongly positively correlated with the abundance of the invasive South-American water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). About 65% of the P. columella specimens analysed were infected with a hitherto unknown Fasciola species. Phylogenetic analyses indicate close affinity to Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, which cause fasciolosis, an important liver disease affecting both ruminants and humans. In addition, another non-native Lymnaeid species was found: a Radix sp. that clustered closely with a Vietnamese Radix species. Radix sp. hosted both amphistome and Fasciola trematodes. By linking an invasion cascade and parasite spillback, this study shows howboth processes can act in combination to lead to potentially important epidemiological changes.

This study used a functional trait approach to characterise the responses of macrophyte assemblages to reach-scale disturbances (measured by lack of riparian shading, altered hydromorphology and eutrophication), from 97 wadeable stream sites in an agriculturally impacted region of New Zealand. To determine whether macrophyte assemblages differed due to disturbances, we examined multidimensional assemblage functional structure in relation to eleven functional traits and further related two functional diversity indices (entropy and originality) to disturbances. Macrophyte assemblages showed distinct patterns in response to disturbances, with riparian shading and hydromorphological conditions being the strongest variables shaping macrophyte functional structure. In the multidimensional space, most of the non-native species were associatedwith disturbed conditions. These species had traits allowing faster colonisation rates (higher number of reproductive organs and larger root-rhizome system) and superior competitive abilities for resources (tall and dense canopy, heterophylly and greater preferences for light and nitrogen). In addition, lack of riparian shading increased the abundance of functionally distinct species (i.e. entropy), and eutrophication resulted in the growth of functionally unique species (i.e. originality). We demonstrated that stream reach-scale habitat disturbances were associated to a dominance of more productive species, equating to a greater abundance of non-native species. This, can result in a displacement of native species, habitat alterations, and changes to higher trophic level assemblages. Our results suggests that reachscale management efforts such as the conservation and restoration of riparian vegetation that provides substantial shading and hydromorphologically diverse in-stream habitat, would have beneficial direct and indirect effects on ecosystem functioning, and contribute to the mitigation of land-use impacts.

In this study, the assemblage composition and stomach contents of fish in the subtropical East River of southern China were analyzed to determine their diet composition (DC) and identify prey-oriented feeding groups. Ten prey items were identified and used to cluster 106 fish species into 23 feeding groups. The number of groups increased longitudinally due to the accumulated emergence of site-specific prey sources in fish DC, although this number decreased sharply near the estuary due to the loss of insectivorous fish. The fish assemblages showed a longitudinal decrease in abundance and an increase in biomass, with higher values observed in the rainy season than the dry season. A downstream decrease in insectivores and epiphytivores and increase in detritivores and molluscivores represented the basic patterns observed along the river. Seven widespread fish species exhibited spatial dietary shifts, among which three generalist feeders with a high abundance notably influenced the fish trophic structures, and four specialist feeders with high food selectivity were significantly (P<0.05) correlated with prey availability. Multivariate data analysis showed that the flow velocity, water depth, riffle areas, and nutrient concentrations were the key environmental factors that determined the distribution of fish feeding groups, while hydrophytes, plant debris, Ephemeroptera and Odonata insects, and Atyidae shrimp were the key prey sources.

There are limited numbers of examples of ecological traps for bats in urban environments. We describe a case of high bat mortality in one concrete building (Kharkiv city, 50 degrees 0 N, 36 degrees 15 E Ukraine) where we found 157 carcasses of Nyctalus noctula killed by cats over the winter 2014-2015. We suppose that cats killed mainly healthy individuals with a higher ratio of females than in the total sample size. We are describing this case of bat mortality as an ecological trap. Moreover, we presume that the real number of bats killed by free-ranging cats could be higher, up to several hundreds per winter. In addition, it is a specific way for disease transfer that could affect public health. European bats are under special protection and in such cases, conservationist and animal welfare activists attempt to protect bat hibernation aggregations from any negative impacts.

Very few studies explore the associated factors and spatial risk modeling together for E. coli contamination in Bangladesh, this research gap motivates to explore this fact further by utilizing Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2012-13 data. A Bayesian spatial ordered logit model was used to examine the associated factors and spatial risks of the E. coli contamination. The results show that 62% of HH water samples were contaminated with E. coli. After controlling for different factors, a high level of E. coli contamination was observed among HHs who had access to non-improved water sources. Moreover, no significant rural-urban difference was observed. The spatial prediction of the high-risk contamination was prominent in districts like Dhaka and Bandarban. The study findings can provide insights into the planning of policy activities in Bangladesh.

However, we have a poor understanding of animals' capability to select an appropriate flight trajectory. We investigated whether eastern gray squirrels would adjust their flight trajectory based on the relative locations of the squirrel, the approaching threat, and potential refuges. We used a person running toward a focal squirrel (N = 122) as the threat and considered the three trees nearest the squirrel and taller than 8m to be potential refuges. Squirrels were strongly affected by the angle (theta) formed by the locations of person, squirrel, and the three nearest trees. A squirrel was less likely to run to the nearest tree (Tree 1) when theta(1) was relatively acute, but also less likely to run to Tree 1 when theta(2) was obtuse, making Tree 2 a more attractive refuge. A squirrel was more likely to run to Tree 1 if it was close and if Tree 2 was relatively far. Subtle differences in the effects of theta(1) vs. theta(2) on squirrel refuge choice support the idea that squirrels prefer a nearby refuge. Squirrels were more likely to select Trees 2 and 3 rather than Tree 1 only when theta(2) was obtuse (105 degrees). In contrast, most squirrels chose to run to Tree 1 when theta(1) was >65 degrees; thus squirrels were more likely to choose Tree 1 even when doing so required running at least partly toward the approaching threat. The decisions made by focal squirrels provide evidence that this species' assessment of risk is highly nuanced. A great deal of variation has been reported in responses to predators within species. While part of the variation may be due to strategic unpredictability on the part of the prey, part of it may also be due to differences in flight trajectory and refuge preferences that have not been well-studied.

However, the effect of this strategy on the fitness of coexisting species or on the structure of the respective food web is poorly understood. In this study, bacteria and bacterivorous nematodes with short (Caenorhabditis elegans) and long (Plectus acuminatus) life cycles were exposed to the mucus secreted by the freshwater flatworm Polycelis tenuis. The growth, reproduction, and feeding preferences of the nematodes in the presence/absence of the mucus were then determined. In addition, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to examine the structural footprint of the mucus and the mucus colonization dynamics of bacteria and protozoans.ResultsMucus exposure resulted in a greater reproductive output in P. acuminatus than in C. elegans. In a cafeteria experiment, both nematode species were attracted by bacteria-rich patches and were not deterred by mucus. CLSM showed that the flatworms spread a layer of polysaccharide-rich mucus ca. 15 mu m thick from their tails. Subsequent colonization of the mucus by bacteria and protozoans resulted in an architecture that progressively resembled a complex biofilm. The presence of protozoans reduced nematode reproduction, presumably due to competition for their bacterial food supply.ConclusionAnimal secretions such as mucus may have broader, community-level consequences and contribute to fueling microbial food webs.

Hydrodynamic Connectivity of Habitats of Deep-Water Corals in Corsair Canyon, Northwest Atlantic: A Case for Cross-Boundary Conservation	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						deep-water corals; connectivity; area-based conservation; cross-boundary collaboration; submarine canyons; hydrodynamics; continental slope; fishery closures	CONTINENTAL MARGINS; GORGONIAN CORALS; LARVAL TRANSPORT; COASTAL OCEAN; DISPERSAL; GULF; TRAJECTORIES; COMMUNITIES; MODELS; REGION	Deep-water corals are significant ecosystem engineers that provide habitat complexity in the deep sea. They are indicator species of vulnerable marine ecosystems because of their slow growth and longevity, characteristics that can prolong recovery from disturbances such as fishing. For populations with discontinuous distributions, such as aggregations of deep-water corals, population connectivity is critical in regulating persistence and recovery and is one of the recommended elements in the design of area-based conservation measures. In this study, we assessed potential pathways of connectivity in the Corsair Canyon Conservation Area, off Nova Scotia, Canada, for populations of the deep-water corals Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis discovered in 2014 and afforded protection in 2016. Corsair Canyon located in the Canadian EEZ, similar to 20 km from the border between Canada and the United States, is potentially receiving larvae from either the Canadian or US EEZ. In Corsair Canyon, P arborea was very abundant at depths 484-856 m and some colonies of P arborea were > 2 m high. These are the locally densest aggregations of P arborea we have detected on the continental slope off Nova Scotia. We also recorded P resedaeformis at similar depths. Colonies of both species were most often seen attached perpendicularly to a rock face, and into the current. We assessed hydrodynamic connectivity between Corsair Canyon and other canyons to the northeast and southwest along the continental slope with known occurrences of the two corals, using the ocean model Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth). Our results indicate that estimated hydrodynamic connectivity originates consistently from canyons to the southwest of Corsair Canyon, particularly Georges, and Heezen Canyons. Of these, only Georges Canyon is within Canada's EEZ and based on our data has very sparse populations of corals that can supply potential recruits. Predicted connectivity with the Northeast Channel Coral Conservation Area occurs in winter and spring, but the complexity of circulation in those seasons needs to be resolved to confirm the strength of this connection. Our results strongly suggest that cross-boundary coordination is essential in the conservation of aggregations of deep-water corals in the northwest Atlantic, by ensuring larval exchange and connectivity.

Hunting in Times of Change: Uncovering Indigenous Strategies in the Colombian Amazon Using a Role-Playing Game	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						wildmeat; hunting; role-playing games; wildlife management; Colombia; indigenous; alternative livelihoods; companion modeling	LINEAR MIXED MODELS; WILD MEAT; DEVELOPMENT POLICY; BUSHMEAT; CONSERVATION; SUSTAINABILITY; CONSUMPTION; FORESTS; HARVEST; LIVELIHOODS	Despite growing industrialization, the shift to a cash economy and natural resource overexploitation, indigenous people of the Amazon region hunt and trade wildlife in order to meet their livelihood requirements. Individual strategies, shaped by the hunters' values and expectations, are changing in response to the region's economic development, but they still face the contrasting challenges of poverty and overhunting. For conservation initiatives to be implemented effectively, it is crucial to take into account people's strategies with their underlying drivers and their adaptive capabilities within a transforming socio-economic environment. To uncover hunting strategies in the Colombian Amazon and their evolution under the current transition, we co-designed a role-playing game together with the local stakeholders. The game revolves around the tension between ecological sustainability and food security-hunters' current main concern. It simulates the mosaic of activities that indigenous people perform in the wet and dry season, while also allowing for specific hunting strategies. Socio-economic conditions change while the game unfolds, opening up to emerging alternative potential scenarios suggested by the stakeholders themselves. Do hunters give up hunting when given the opportunity of an alternative income and protein source? Do institutional changes affect their livelihoods? We played the game between October and December 2016 with 39 players-all of them hunters-from 9 different communities within the Ticoya reserve. Our results show that providing alternatives would decrease overall hunting effort, but impacts are not spatially homogenous. Legalizing trade could lead to overhunting except when market rules and competition come into place. When it comes to coupled human-nature systems, the best way forward to produce socially just and resilient conservation strategies might be to trigger an adaptive process of experiential learning and scenario exploration. The use of games as "boundary objects" can guide stakeholders through the process, eliciting the plurality of their strategies, their drivers and how outside change affects them.

During a low-intensity flood pulse, seven X-band HH COSMO-SkyMed Hlmage images are acquired, covering a nine-month period. Scenes are segmented with a mean-shift segmentation algorithm. Objects are classified with an expectation maximization algorithm into clusters with different temporal signatures and are assigned to six information classes: water, bulrush marshes, short broad-leaf marshes, tall broad-leaf marshes, short grasslands and grass marshes, and tall grasslands and grass marshes. Class interpretation is based on backscatter dynamics, with focus on their correlation with hydrometric water level measured in the Parana River and/or with the floodplain area covered by water as estimated with a normalized difference vegetation index threshold criterion. The obtained product has a global accuracy of 75.4% and a kappa index of 67.2%. We point out the usefulness of X-band for flood monitoring and macrophyte vegetation type discrimination. However, we find limitations for the discrimination between high-biomass vegetation targets, such as tall broad-leaf marshes and tall grasslands. In a mosaic of herbaceous wetlands, the knowledge on the relation between vegetation and floods is essential for interpreting and predicting how back-scattering coefficients and other synthetic aperture radar-derivated parameters vary with flooding.

Fast macropore flow has been shown to reduce the influence of pesticide properties on leaching, but data on these processes are scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of soil freezing and thawing on transport of pesticides with a range of soil sorption coefficients (K-f ). To do this we conducted a soil column study to quantify the transport of bromide and five pesticides (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, clomazone, boscalid, propiconazole, and diflufenican). Intact topsoil and subsoil columns from two agricultural soils (silt and loam) in southeastern Norway were used in this experiment, and pesticides were applied to the soil surface in all columns. Half the columns were then frozen (-3 degrees C), and the other half were left unfrozen (4 degrees C). Columns were subjected to repeated irrigation events where 25 mm of rainwater was applied during 5 h at each event. Irrigations were followed by 14-d periods of freezing or refrigeration. Percolate was collected and analyzed for pesticides and bromide. Pesticide leaching was up to five orders of magnitude larger from frozen than unfrozen columns. Early breakthrough (<<1 pore volume) of high concentrations was observed for pesticides in frozen columns, indicating that leaching was dominated by preferential flow. The rank order in pesticide leaching observed in this study corresponded to the rank order of mean K-f values for the pesticides, and the results suggest that sorption plays a role in determining leaching losses even in frozen soil.

To effectively plan for multi-species management practices, it is important to have a robust understanding of the variability in the spatial and behavioral ecology of sympatric species. To address this in the context of marine turtles, this study explored fine-scale habitat use by three sympatric species [juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas), Kemp's ridley turtles (Lepidochelys kempii) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta)] in a foraging area near Crystal River, Florida, United States. By combining sighting surveys and satellite tracking methods, we found that the distribution of the three species of marine turtles in this region overlapped both in space and time. We also observed differences in the fine-scale location of hotspots and in-water behavior among species, with some degree of apparent habitat partitioning. Habitat partitioning was particularly evident when assessing the diving and surfacing behavior of tracked turtles, with some degree of differentiation in diel diving patterns, particularly depths utilized during daytime/nighttime and the dive/surface duration. Our study provides ecological baseline data on the spatial overlap, habitat use and behavior of three sympatric marine turtle species, which can inform future management strategies at nearshore marine habitats in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico.

Tree Cover Mediates the Effect of Artificial Light on Urban Bats	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						ALAN; bats; canopy cover; chiroptera; light-emitting diodes; trees; ultraviolet light; urban	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; INSECTIVOROUS BAT; POLLUTION; BEHAVIOR; IMPACTS; IDENTIFICATION; PREDATORS; EVOLUTION; INSECTS; VISION	With urban areas growing worldwide, so does artificial light at night (ALAN) which negatively affects many nocturnal animals, including bats. The response of bats to ALAN ranges from some opportunistic species taking advantage of insect aggregations around street lamps, particularly those emitting ultraviolet (UV) light, to others avoiding lit areas at all. Tree cover has been suggested to mitigate the negative effects of ALAN on bats by shielding areas against light scatter. Here, we investigated the effect of tree cover on the relationship between ALAN and bats in Berlin, Germany. In particular, we asked if this interaction varies with the UV light spectrum of street lamps and also across urban bat species. We expected trees next to street lamps to block ALAN, making the adjacent habitat more suitable for all species, irrespective of the wavelength spectrum of the light source. Additionally, we expected UV emitting lights next to trees to attract insects and thus, opportunistic bats. In summer 2017, we recorded bat activity at 22 green open spaces in Berlin using automated ultrasonic detectors. We analyzed bat activity patterns and landscape variables (number of street lamps with and without UV light emission, an estimate of light pollution, and tree cover density around each recording site within different spatial scales) using generalized linear mixed-effects models with a negative binomial distribution. We found a species-specific response of bats to street lamps with and without UV light, providing a more detailed picture of ALAN impacts than simply total light radiance. Moreover, we found that dense tree cover dampened the negative effect of street lamps without UV for open-space foraging bats of the genera Nyctalus, Eptesicus, and Vespertilio, yet it amplified the already existing negative or positive effect of street lamps with or without UV on Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, and Myotis spp. Our study underpins the importance of minimizing artificial light at night close to vegetation, particularly for bats adapted to spatial complexity in the environment (i.e., clutter-adapted species), and to increase dense vegetation in urban landscape to provide, besides roosting opportunities, protection against ALAN for open-space foraging bats in city landscapes.

It remains to be determined whether this role is anecdotic or is a key mutualism for some plant species. We recently found that the large nut-like seeds of the two South American Araucaria tree species (Araucaria araucana in Andean forests and Araucaria angustifolia in Atlantic forests, weighing c. 3.5 and 7 g, respectively) are frequently dispersed, and to long distances, by parrots. Moreover, both observational and experimental work demonstrated that dispersed seeds can germinate faster after partial predation by parrots. Here, we hypothesized that a third, even larger-seeded (17.5 g) congeneric Australian species (A. bidwillii) is also dispersed by parrots. We surveyed 52 A. bidwillii and 42 A. cunninghamii (a sympatric species with small winged seeds, c. 0.2 g) during the seeding period. We found that sulfur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita) consumed large amounts of seeds from all of the A. bidwillii trees surveyed. Cockatoos dispersed ca. 30% of the seeds they removed from the mother tree, carrying the seeds to distant perches for handling or dropped them while flying. Dispersal distances ranged between 10 and 153m (mean = 61m). Most seeds handled for consumption (93%) were fully eaten but others were dropped intact (3%) or only partially eaten (4%), and germination was confirmed for both intact and partially-eaten dispersed seeds. Moreover, seeds dropped by cockatoos facilitated secondary seed dispersal by conspecifics and another three bird species. We found no evidence of other primary dispersal species for A. bidwillii, while the small, winged seeds of Araucaria cunninghamii were only dispersed through barochory and anemochory. The seed weight of the three Araucaria species dispersed by zoochory is strongly related to the body mass of their main seed-disperser parrot species. These results support a role for parrots as key dispersers of the three large-seeded Araucaria species around the world, and suggest that large seeds may have evolved-at least partially-as an adaptation that allows trees to attract parrots, satiate them, and benefit from their long-distance seed dispersal services.

Spatio-Temporal Pattern of Dinoflagellates Along the Tropical Eastern Pacific Coast (Ecuador)	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						dinoflagellates; HABs; ENSO; tropical Eastern Pacific; nutrients; upwelling; humboldt current	HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; EL-NINO; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; HUMBOLDT CURRENT; PHYTOPLANKTON; OCEAN; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES	Among marine phytoplankton, dinoflagellates are a key component in marine ecosystems as primary producers. Some species synthesize toxins, associated with human seafood poisoning, and mortality in marine organisms. Thus, there is a large necessity to understand the role of environmental variables in dinoflagellates spatial-temporal patterns in response to future climate scenarios. In that sense, a monthly four-year (2013-2017) monitoring was taken to evaluate dinoflagellates abundances and physical-chemical parameters in the water column at different depths. Sampling sites were established at 10 miles in four locations within the Ecuadorian coast. A total of 102 taxa were identified, corresponding to 8 orders, 22 families, and 31 genera. Eight potentially harmful genera were registered but no massive blooms were detected. The most frequent dinoflagellates were Gymnodinium sp. and Gyrodinium sp. Environmental variables showed different mixing layer thickness and a conspicuous and deepening thermocline/oxycline/halocline and nutricline depending on annual and seasonal oceanographic fluctuations. This study confirms that seasonal and spatial distribution of the environmental variables are linked to the main current systems on the Eastern Tropical Pacific, thus the warm Panama current lead to a less dinoflagellates abundance in the north of Ecuador (Esmeraldas), while the Equatorial Upwelling and the cold nutrient-rich Humboldt Current influence dinoflagellates abundance at the central (Manta, La Libertad) and South of Ecuador (Puerto Bolivar), respectively. Interannual variability of dinoflagellates abundance is associated with ENSO and upwelling conditions. Climate change scenarios predict an increase in water surface temperature and extreme events frequency in tropical areas, so it is crucial to involve policy-makers and stakeholders in the implementation of future laws involving long-term monitoring and sanitary programs, not covered at present.

Nested levels of dependence among microbes, vectors, and vertebrate hosts may have complicated effects on both microbial community assembly and evolution. We examined Bartonella sequences from European bats and their ectoparasites with a combination of network analysis, Bayesian phylogenetics, tip-association and cophylogeny tests, and linear regression to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape parasite communities. We detected seven batectoparasite-Bartonella communities that can be differentiated based on bat families and roosting patterns. Tips of the Bartonella tree were significantly clustered by host taxonomy and geography. We also found significant evidence of evolutionary congruence between bat host and Bartonella phylogenies, indicating that bacterial species have evolved to infect related bat species. Exploring these ecological and evolutionary associations further, we found that sharing of Bartonella species among bat hosts was strongly associated with host phylogenetic distance and roost sharing and less strongly with geographic range overlap. Ectoparasite sharing between hosts was strongly predicted by host phylogenetic distance, roost sharing, and geographic overlap but had no additive effect on Bartonella sharing. Finally, historical Bartonella host-switching was more frequent for closely related bats after accounting for sampling bias among bat species. This study helps to disentangle the complex ecology and evolution of Bartonella bacteria in bat species and their arthropod vectors. Our work provides insight into the important mechanisms that partition parasite communities among hosts, particularly the effect of host phylogeny and roost sharing, and could help to elucidate the evolutionary patterns of other diverse vector-borne microorganisms.

Primary producer and consumer organisms were collected from two sampling stations at two desalination plants sites: an "Impacted station," near the brine discharge outlets, and a "Control station" situated further offshore to the impacted zone. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of both producers and consumers displayed minor variations between the impacted and control stations, indicating little effect of brine discharge on the coastal trophic structure. The coastal delta N-15 values were generally higher than those of similar pelagic communities of the southeastern Mediterranean. These were particularly high in benthic invertebrates and benthic carnivores (fish) from the southern site, where high anthropogenically N loads from ground water amelioration are discarded alongside the brine. The observed differences in the delta N-15 of the benthic components between the two study sites suggest that brine derived density plumes from desalination plants are a possible vector of nutrients to benthic communities. The results indicate that the benthic components were the most sensitive group to anthropogenic derived N pollution, and provide insight into site-specific processes.

This greatly limits how empirical data can be used to improve model performance and reduce the uncertainty associated with their predictions of carbon (C) cycling. Recent advances in our understanding of the biogeochemical processes that govern SOM formation and persistence demand a new mathematical model with a structure built around key mechanisms and biogeochemically relevant pools. Here, we present one approach that aims to address this need. Our new model (MEMS v1.0) is developed from the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization framework, which emphasizes the importance of linking the chemistry of organic matter inputs with efficiency of microbial processing and ultimately with the soil mineral matrix, when studying SOM formation and stabilization. Building on this framework, MEMS v1.0 is also capable of simulating the concept of C saturation and represents decomposition processes and mechanisms of physico-chemical stabilization to define SOM formation into four primary fractions. After describing the model in detail, we optimize four key parameters identified through a variance-based sensitivity analysis. Optimization employed soil fractionation data from 154 sites with diverse environmental conditions, directly equating mineral-associated organic matter and particulate organic matter fractions with corresponding model pools. Finally, model performance was evaluated using total topsoil (0-20 cm) C data from 8192 forest and grassland sites across Europe. Despite the relative simplicity of the model, it was able to accurately capture general trends in soil C stocks across extensive gradients of temperature, precipitation, annual C inputs and soil texture. The novel approach that MEMS v1.0 takes to simulate SOM dynamics has the potential to improve our forecasts of how soils respond to management and environmental perturbation. Ensuring these forecasts are accurate is key to effectively informing policy that can address the sustainability of ecosystem services and help mitigate climate change.

This allowed periodic pollutant concentration patterns in bus-derived pollutants to be explored using Fourier analysis. The analysis showed the defining role of the bus stops in terms of NO and PM2.5 concentrations, which have profiles with a sawtooth form. Early in inter sup segmenis, concentrations are high, followed by a decline. This arises from high emissions during the acceleration away from the bus stop, then lower emissions during cruise and de-acceleration. This pattern can be enhanced on sections of the ruffle where buses are frequern as pollutants accumulate from the larger number of buses. The high conceniraLions just. beyond bus stops may have implications fur planning bus roues and the positioning of bus stops. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are among the most studied contaminants due to their persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity potential. Biomagnification is often described using the estimation of a Trophic Magnification Factor (TMF). This estimate is based on the relationship between contamination levels of the species and their trophic level. However, while the estimation can be significantly biased in relation to multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. species physiology, measurement errors, food web complexity), usual TMF estimation methods typically do not allow accounting for these potential biases. More accurate and reliable assessment tool of TMFs and their associated uncertainty are therefore needed in order to appropriately guide chemical pollution management. The present work proposes a relevant and innovative TMF estimation method accounting for its many variability sources. The ESCROC model (EStimating Contaminants tRansfers Over Complex food webs), which is implemented in a Bayesian framework, allows for a more reliable and rigorous assessment of contaminants trophic magnification, in addition to accurate estimations of isotopes trophic enrichment factors and their associated uncertainties in food webs. Similar to classical mixing models used in food web investigations, ECSROC computes diet composition matrices using isotopic composition data while accounting for contamination data, leading to more robust food web descriptions. As a demonstration of the practical application of the model, ESCROC was implemented to revisit the trophic biomagnification of 5 polyfluoroalkyl substances (PEAS) in a complex estuarine food web (the Gironde, SW France). In addition to the IMF estimate and 95% confidence intervals, the model provided biomagnification probabilities associated to the investigated contaminants-for instance, 92% in the case of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)-that can be interpreted in terms of risk assessment in a precautionary approach, which should prove useful to environmental managers.

Meltwater temperature in streams draining Alpine glaciers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						River temperature; Glacier hydrology; Climate change; Glacierisation; Thermal regime; Finclelen	WATER TEMPERATURE; RIVER; HABITAT; DYNAMICS; SENSITIVITY; PATTERNS; COVERAGE	Climate change is significantly impacting lotto environments, through changes to hydrology, biodiversity and species distribution. Effects of climate change are greatest at high elevation and biota in and around glacier-fed rivers is likely, therefore, to be at great risk. How climate change influences hydrology will have great impact on river water temperature as glacier-fed rivers in Alpine environments arc extremely sensitive to climatic change. This paper assesses five rivers: Four glacier-fed rivers (36.9-83.7% basin glacierisation) located in the Swiss Alps, and one located in an ice-free catchment in the Bemese Oberland, Switzerland. The aim was to assess the impact of basin characteristics on river water temperature. A distinct paradoxical relationship was identified whereby water temperature in some glacier-fed rivers was reduced during the time of highest incoming short-wave radiation receipts and high air temperature. Whether a summer cooling effect presenfed itself in all glacier-fed rivers within this study was researched. The key findings were that the identified summer cooling effect was not present in all rivers, despite percentage glacierisation. Percentage glacier cover has often been reported as they key determiner of water temperature in such rivers. More important was the stream dimensions, notably stream surface area. Understanding the controlling factors that influence water temperature of glacier-fed rivers will help river managers and planners in understanding how climate change will affect fisheries downstream of glaciers over the coming decades. This may allow plans to be introduced to try and mitigate warmer water temperature that will result, in some glacier-fed rivers, as the climate warms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, they have been largely ignored in biomonitoring and conservation programmes, such as the EU Water Framework Directive, while global change pressures are threatening their singular values. Here we present a framework to classify and evaluate the ecological quality of naturally stressed rivers along a water salinity gradient. We gathered datasets, including aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental information, for 243 river locations across the western Mediterranean to: a) gauge the role of natural stressors (salinity) in driving aquatic community richness and composition; b) make river classifications by encompassing the wide range of environmental and biological variation exhibited by Mediterranean rivers; c) provide effective biomonitoring metrics of ecological quality for saline rivers. Our results showed that water salinity played a pivotal role in explaining the community richness and compositional changes in rivers, even when considering other key and commonly used descriptors, such as elevation, climate or lithology. Both environmental and biologically-based classifications included seven river types: three types of freshwater perennial rivers, one freshwater 'intermittent river type and three new saline river types. These new saline types were not included in previous classifications. Their validation by independent datasets showed that the saline and freshwater river types represented differentiable macroinvertebrate assemblages at family and species levels. Biomonitoring metrics based on the abundance of indicator taxa of each saline river type provided a much better assessment of the ecological quality of saline rivers than other widely used biological metrics and indices. Here we demonstrate that considering natural stressors, such as water salinity, is essential to design effective and accurate biomonitoring programmes for rivers and to preserve their unique biodiversity.

The average concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluoroocianoic acid (PFOA) and most of other PFASs in the liver samples were respectively greater than any records previously reported in cetaceans globally. PFOS levels in 46% of dolphin liver samples exceeded the hepatic toxicity threshold in cetaceans. For the first time, we found a U-shaped trend for the distribution pattern of perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) between liver and kidney with 'increasing carbon chain lengths (C5-C16), whereas a descending trend (C4-C10) was found for perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFASs), which may be explained by binding efficiencies of PFAS analogues to proteins. Dolphins with the highest levels of Sigma PFASs (age-corrected) were clustered near the river outlets in Lingdingyang area, which agrees with the spatial distribution of PFASs in the environment. Significant temporal trends were observed for many PFASs. Concentrations of PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and peilluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) all peaked in year 2011, followed by a decreasing trend, while a consistently descending trend was shown for perfluorounclecanoic acid (PEUdA) and perfluoroclecane sulfonate (PEDS). Our findings contribute to the knowledge of tissue distribution and spatiotemporal trends of PFASs in the PRE dolphins, which are valuable for us to understand the PFASs exposure risk and their industrial emission in Southern China, (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We combined eco-hydrological and empirical models to study chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator of eutrophication in a small agricultural river. We used a modified story-and-simulation method to build three storylines for possible changes in future land use due to climate change and political change. The main objective in the first storyline is to stimulate economic activity but also to promote the sustainable and efficient use of resources. The second storyline is based on the high awareness but poor regulation of environmental protection, and the third is to survive as individual countries instead of being part of a unified Europe. We assumed trade of agricultural products to increase to countries outside Europe. We found that chlorophyll-a concentration in the river depended on total phosphorus concentration. In addition, there was a positive synergistic interaction between total phosphorus and water temperature. In future storylines, chlorophyll-a concentration increased due to land use and climate change. Climate change mainly had an indirect influence via increasing nutrient losses from intensified agriculture. We found that well-designed agri-environmental measures had the potential to decrease nutrient loading from fields, as long as the predicted increase in temperature remained under 2 degrees C. However, we were not able to achieve the nutrient reduction stated in current water protection targets. In addition, the ecological status of the river deteriorated. The influence of temperature on chlorophyll-a growth indicates that novel measures for shading rivers to decrease water temperature may be needed in the future. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Urban blue: A global analysis of the factors shaping people's perceptions of the marine environment and ecological engineering in harbours	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Estuaries and bays; Urbanisation; Coastal armouring; Eco-engineering; Stakeholders; Human perceptions	PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; COASTAL HABITATS; PLACE ATTACHMENT; CONSERVATION; RESIDENTS; INFRASTRUCTURE; IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT; PRIORITIES; SCIENCE	Marine harbours are the focus of a diverse range of activities and subject to multiple anthropogenically induced pressures. Support for environmental management options aimed at improving degraded harbours depends on understanding the factors which influence people's perceptions of harbour environments. We used an online survey, across 12 harbours, to assess sources of variation people's perceptions of harbour health and ecological engineering. We tested the hypotheses: 1) people living near impacted harbours would consider their environment to be more unhealthy and degraded, be more concerned about the environment and supportive of and willing to pay for ecological engineering relative to those living by less impacted harbours, and 2) people with greater connectedness to the harbour would be more concerned about and have greater perceived knowledge of the environment, and be more supportive of, knowledgeable about and willing to pay for ecological engineering, than those with less connectedness. Across twelve locations, the levels of degradation and modification by artificial structures were lower and the concern and knowledge about the environment and ecological engineering were greater in the six Australasian and American than the six European and Asian harbours surveyed. We found that people's perception of harbours as healthy or degraded, but not their concern for the environment, reflected the degree to which harbours were impacted. There was a positive relationship between the percentage of shoreline modified and the extent of support for and people's willingness to pay indirect costs for ecological engineering. At the individual level, measures of connectedness to the harbour environment were good predictors of concern for and perceived knowledge about the environment but not support for and perceived knowledge about ecological engineering. To make informed decisions, it is important that people are empowered with sufficient knowledge of the environmental issues facing their harbour and ecological engineering options.

Dose-dependence of growth and ecophysiological responses of plants to biochar	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Charcoal; Pyrogenic carbon; Stoichiometry; Nutrition	BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; SOIL PROPERTIES; YIELD; STOICHIOMETRY; PRODUCTIVITY; WHEAT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; INCREASES; CHARCOAL; MAIZE	Charcoal is a ubiquitous legacy of wildfire in terrestrial systems that often contributes to rapid revegetation following disturbance; the use of charcoal soil amendments, or "biochars", to promote plant growth has received recent research attention and increasing applied use. Despite its widespread use, well-resolved quantitative estimates of dose-response relationships for biochar effects on plant growth are nonexistent, and studies of biochar dosage effects on plant ecophysiology are minimal. We investigated the effects of biochar dosage on plant growth and ecophysiology in a glasshouse experiment involving two common early-successional plants, Abutilon theophrasti and Trifolium repens. Plants were grown in disturbed temperate soils with increasing dosages of wood biochars: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 t/ha. We measured leaf-level gas-exchange traits (A(max), g(s), WUE), chlorophyll concentration, and leaf area growth throughout the experiment. At the end of the experiment, we measured biomass, foliar nutrition, and soil properties (pH, EC, C and N). Responses of biomass and physiological traits were highly dose-dependent, followed primarily unimodal forms, and differed in some traits between species. Increases in the uptake of K, P, and Mg, were responsible for accelerated growth. Biochars also generally increased the concentration of micronutrients, especially B. As a result, nutrient stoichiometry shifted substantially: in A. theophrasti biochars increased C:N, P:N and K:N ratios, suggesting nitrogen dilution or induced deficiency at higher dosages. This work supports the general hypothesis that ecophysiological responses to biochar are dose dependent and driven mainly by changes in nutrient availability. Additional work is necessary to understand the broader ecological impacts of heterogeneity in soil pyrogenic C levels to succession and ecosystem function. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, existing pollen forecasts do not reflect the spatial variations in the pollen release time within a heterogeneous urban environment. The main objective of this study was to model the spatial pattern of flowering onset (and thus the moment of pollen release) in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) in Poznan (Western Poland) using land surface temperature (LST) data and in situ phenological observations. The onset of silver birch flowering was observed at 34 urban and rural sites (973 trees) in Poznan from 2012 to 2014. Forty-four thermal variables were retrieved from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To predict the spatio-temporal distribution of B. pendula flowering onset dates in a city, the ordinary and partial least squares, support vector machine and random forest regression models were applied. The models performance was examined by an internal repeated k-fold cross-validation and external validation with archival phenological data (2010). Birch flowering began significantly earlier in the urban sites compared to the rural sites (from -1.4 days in 2013, to -4.1 days in 2012). The maximum March LST difference between the urban and rural sites reached 2.4 degrees C in 2013 and 4.5 degrees C in 2012. The random forest model performed best at validation stage, i.e. the root mean square error between the predicted and observed onset dates was 1.461 days, and the determination coefficient was 0.829. A calibrated model for predicting the timing of flowering in a heterogeneous city area is an important step in developing a fine-scale forecasting system that can directly estimate pollen exposure in places where allergy sufferers live. Importantly, by incorporating only pre-flowering thermal data into the model, location-specific allergy forecasts can be delivered to the public before the actual flowering time.

Side-by-side comparison of 15 pilot-scale conventional and intensified subsurface flow wetlands for treatment of domestic wastewater	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aeration; Constructed wetland; Design; Phragmites australis; Reciprocating; Role of plants; Tidal flow	TOTAL NITROGEN REMOVAL; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; ORGANIC-MATTER; INTERMITTENT AERATION; TIDAL FLOW; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; OXYGEN; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	This study reports a systematic assessment of treatment efficacy for 15 pilot-scale subsurface flow constructed wetlands of different designs for CBOD5, TSS, TOC, TN, NH4-N, NO3-N, NO2-N, and E. coli over the course of one year in an outdoor study to evaluate the effects of design and plants. The systems consisted of a range of designs: horizontal flow (HF) with 50 and 25 cm depth, unsaturated vertical flow (VF) with sand or fine gravel, and intensified systems (horizontal and saturated vertical flow with aeration, and reciprocating fill and drain). Each system was built in duplicate: one was planted with Phragmites and one was left unplanted (with the exception of the reciprocating system, of which there was only one and it was unplanted). All systems were fed with the same primary-treated domestic wastewater. Effluent concentrations, areal and volumetric mass removal rates, and percent mass removal for the 15 systems arc discussed. HF wetlands removed CBOD5, TSS, TN, NH4-N and E. coli by 73-83%, 93-95%, 17-41%, 0-27% anti 1.5 log units, respectively. Unsaturated VF and aerated VF wetlands removed CBOD5, TSS, TN, NH4-N and E. coli by 69-99%, 76-99%, 17-40%, 69-99% and 0.9-2.4 log units, respectively. The aerated HF and reciprocating systems removed CBOD5, TSS, TN, NH4-N and E. coli by 99%, 99%, 43-70%, 94-99% and 3.0-3.8 log units, respectively. The aerated HF and reciprocating systems achieved the highest TN removal rate of all of the designs. Design complexity clearly enhanced treatment efficacy (HF VF < Intensified, p < 0.001) during the first two years of plant growth while the presence of plants had minor effects on TN and NH4-N removal in the shallow HF design only.

In temperate climates, it is critical to investigate the interactive effect of C and N inputs on SOM stabilisation under low or high substrate availability. We measured SOM content and in situ soil respiration in a long-term field experiment in Sweden, which started in 1956. In 2000, the previous C3 crops were replaced with C4 maize, making it possible to trace old- (C3-derived) and young-C (C4-derived) sources in CO2 and SOM under bare fallow, maize cropped with or without N-fertilisation (root C-inputs). Soil respiration and its isotopic composition were measured in the field prior to sowing, every second week during crop growth and once after harvest. During 1956-1999, the bare fallow lost 38% of its SOM, following an exponential decay trend. Despite root C inputs, total SOM content under C3 crops declined from 1.5% in 1956 to 1.4% and 1.2% C in fertilised and unfertilised treatments, respectively, in 1999. After the crop change in 2000, estimated C input increased by 5% (under fertilisation), but SOM content continued to decline (as before 2000), to 1.25% (fertilised) and 1.03% (unfertilised) in 2017. Analysis of delta C-13 revealed that 9 and 11% of young-C was retained in unfertilised and fertilised SOM, respectively. However, up to 70% of soil respiration derived from young-C. Comparing the contributions of old- and young-C to CO2 and SOM showed that, irrespective to the time of measurement, young-C was always more available for microbial decomposition than old-C, particularly under fertilisation. We conclude that the amount of C entering the soil through root inputs was insufficient to counterbalance SOM losses over time. Moreover, soil nutrient status and recent root-C availability appear to be important for CO2 release, and must be considered in further recommendations on maintaining/improving SOM stocks.

However, quantifying this distribution is challenging due to a lack of spatially explicit and temporally dynamic empirical data of both surface water and is drivers of change at large spatial scales. We focused on one of the largest dryland basins in the world, Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), recently identified as a global hotspot. of water decline. We used a new remotely sensed time-series of surface water extent dynamics (SWD) data to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in surface water across the entire MDB and catchments and to assess natural and anthropogenic drivers of SWD including climate and historical land use change. We show high intra- and inter-annual dynamics in surface water with a rapid loss during the Millennium Drought, the worst, decade-long drought in SE Australia. We show strong regional and catchment differences in SWD with the northern basin showing high variability compared to the southern basin which shows a steady decline in surface water. Linear mixed effect models including climate and land-use change variables explained up to 70% variability in SWD with climate being more important in catchments of the northwestern MDB, whereas land-use was important primarily in the central MDB. Increase in fraction of dryland agriculture in a catchment and maximum temperature was negatively related to SWD, whereas precipitation and soil moisture were positively related to SWD. The tact that land-use change was an important explanatory variable of SWD in addition to climate is a significant result as land-use can be managed more effectively whereas climate-mitigation actions can be intractable, with global change scenarios predicting drier conditions for the area followed by a further reduction in surface water availability.

Seismic line impacts on proximal boreal forest and wetland environments in Alberta	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Linear disturbance; Seismic line; Edge effects; Lidar; Vegetation structure; Oil sands	SLOPE ASPECT; DISCONTINUOUS PERMAFROST; TOPOGRAPHIC POSITION; GROWTH-RESPONSE; EDGE; VEGETATION; LIDAR; CANOPY; HEIGHT; PLAINS	Seismic lines are corridors cut through forest and wetland land covers for geophysical exploration of oil and gas deposits. Here we present a localised case study of the impacts of seismic lines on proximal boreal forest and wetland ecosystem vegetation structural characteristics. The study concentrates on a relatively undisturbed area of the Oil Sands Region of the Boreal zone in north central Alberta using airborne multi-spectral lidar and publically available geospatial data. The results of this study indicate that significant variations in adjacent forest/wetland edge vegetation structure occur proximal to 30 seismic lines identified within the study area. The variations observed in this area depend on the environmental characteristics of the seismic lines. Often taller trees and greater fractional cover extends to a distance of up to 55 m from the seismic line, especially in land covers adjacent to wider seismic lines. Random forest analysis of spatial correspondence between environmental and proximity based variability associated with seismic lines indicates that distance, incident radiation and the potential for accumulation of surface water based on local geomorphology (inferred from topographic position) are the most important variables affecting height and fractional cover of proximal vegetation. Combined variables including distance from the seismic line, width of the seismic line, cardinal direction and incident radiation, topographic position and underlying surface geology may be used to predict spatial variability of vegetation height to an accuracy of 70% (adjusted (adj.) R-2). From this research, we suggest continued sampling testing of lidar/high resolution optical imagery and geospatial data to examine the impacts of seismic lines in other parts of the Oil Sands Region using the methods developed in this case study. Reclamation management plans for oil and gas exploration areas should focus on reclaiming wider seismic lines first as these have the greatest impact on proximal ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the influences of urban green space management on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships is poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between soil fauna and litter decomposition in 170 urban garden sites along a gradient of urbanisation intensity in the city of Zurich, CH. We used litter bags of 1 and 4 mm mesh size to evaluate the contribution of soil meso- and macrofauna on litter decomposition. By using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we investigated direct and indirect environmental effects and management practices on litter decomposition and litter residue quality. We evaluated the role of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of soil fauna species on litter decomposition, based on a sample of 120 species (81,007 individuals; 39 collembola, 18 earthworm, 16 isopod, 47 gastropod species). We found highest litter decomposition rates using 4 mm mesh size litter bags, highlighting the importance of soil macrofauna. Urban warming, a proxy for urbanisation intensity, covaried positively, whereas soil disturbances, such as intensive soil and crop management, were negatively correlated with decomposition rates. Interestingly, soil fauna species richness decreased, with the exception of gastropods, and soil fauna abundance increased with urban warming. Our data also show that plant species richness positively affected litter decomposition by increasing soil fauna species richness and microbial activity. A multivariate analysis of organic compounds in litter residues confirmed the importance of soil fauna species richness and garden management on litter decomposition processes. Overall, we showed, that also in intensively managed urban green spaces, such as gardens, biodiversity of plants and soil fauna drives key ecosystem processes. Urban planning strategies that integrate soil protecting management practices may help to maintain important ecosystem services in this heavily used urban environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When managers forage for pests: Implementing the functional response in pest management	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Control; Foraging; Pest; Population dynamics; Predator-prey interactions	SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT; PREY; POPULATION; PREDATION; PATTERN; MODEL	In this study, we explore how the functional response framework can be implemented in pest management. Here, managers take the role of predators foraging on pests and facing monetary costs for survey and control in a spatial domain where the pest distribution and control strategy do not have to be random. To investigate this framework quantitatively, we simulated various management processes on different pest spatial distributions using a spatially -explicit individual-based model and Monte-Carlo simulations, and also confirmed some of the results analytically. By graphing the number of pests controlled versus pest density, we obtained management functional response curves. Whether the management functional response was shaped like a type I, type II or type III functional response depended on the management costs and the search area. However, the management spatial strategy and the pest spatial distribution had little effect on the functional response. We applied our model to the management of mountain pine beetle epidemic in Cypress Hills, Saskatchewan, Canada, with simulations matching the real number of attacked trees controlled by managers. We showed how to make an analogy between functional responses in predator prey interactions and in human pest interactions and thereby, apply insights from the functional response framework to pest management.

With increasing pressure of degradation and deforestation, these forests have been prioritized for conservation and carbon offset through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanisms. We provide the first regional assessment of forest structure and aboveground biomass using measurements from a combination of ground tree inventories and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar). More than 80,000 ha of lidar samples were collected based on a stratified random sampling to provide a regionally unbiased quantification of forest structure of Choco across gradients of vegetation structure, disturbance and elevation. We developed a model to convert measurements of vertical structure of forests into aboveground biomass (AGB) for terra firme, wetlands, and mangrove forests. We used the Random Forest machine learning model and a formal uncertainty analysis to map forest height and AGB at 1-ha spatial resolution for the entire pacific coastal region using spaceborne data, extending from the coast to higher elevation of Andean forests. Results: Upland Choc6 forests have a mean canopy height of 21.8 m and AGB of 233.0 Mg/ha, while wetland forests are characterized by a lower height and AGB (13.5 m and 117.5 Mg/a). Mangroves have a lower mean height than upland forests (16.5 m), but have a similar AGB as upland forests (229.9 Mg/ha) due to their high wood density. Within the terra firme forest class, intact forests have the highest AGB (244.3 +/- 34.8 Mg/ha) followed by degraded and secondary forests with 212.57 +/- 62.40 Mg/ha of biomass. Forest degradation varies in biomass loss from small-scale selective logging and firewood harvesting to large-scale tree removals for gold mining, settlements, and illegal logging. Our findings suggest that the forest degradation has already caused the loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon. Conclusions: Our assessment of carbon stocks and forest degradation can be used as a reference for reporting on the state of the Choco forests to REDD+ projects and to encourage restoration efforts through conservation and climate mitigation policies.

Studies have attempted to make generalizations about how species with similar traits respond to urbanization, although existing results are idiosyncratic across cities and often fail to account for seasonality. Here, we present a comparative study in three US cities: Fresno, California; Tucson, Arizona; and Phoenix, Arizona. Using presence-absence data to define regional bird species pools and urban assemblages in non-breeding (winter) and breeding (spring) seasons, we tested whether urban avian assemblages were a random subset of regional assemblages on the basis of both traits and phylogeny, and whether urbanization was associated with homogenization among avian assemblages. We found evidence for non-random trait filtering into urban assemblages, including of diet guilds, migratory status, and primary habitat, but filtering differed across cities and seasons, being strongest for diet and in Fresno. There was no evidence for non-random phylogenetic-based filtering in urban avian assemblages. Dissimilarity in species and diet guild composition within each season was higher between cities than between regional species pools. These findings show the potential for biotic differentiation as opposed to homogenization as the outcome of environmental filtering processes operating on species traits across cities and seasons.

By the year 2100, the seas north of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe (GIF) topographic ridge are predicted to become largely corrosive to aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate commonly formed by calcifying molluscs. We examine depth-diversity relationships in bivalves and gastropods north and south of the GIF ridge, between 200 and 2000 m depth. We also identify bivalve and gastropod species that could be monitored to identify early signs of changes in benthic communities north of the GIF ridge, due to ocean acidification. Patterns of alpha-diversity were estimated through rarefaction, as E(S-20). Regional and depth related beta-diversity was analyzed and the additive contribution of species replacement (turnover) and species loss/gain (nestedness) to beta-diversity calculated. Despite sharing a significant number of species, diversity patterns differed between the study regions. The diversity patterns also differed between bivalves and gastropods. North of the GIF ridge, the relationship between alpha-diversity and depth was unimodal with a predominant decrease in bivalve and gastropod alpha-diversity between 300 and 2000 m depth. Species assemblages in the deep bathyal zone were partly nested subsets of the assemblages in the shallow bathyal zone. South of the GIF ridge, patterns in alpha-diversity were more ambiguous. Alpha diversity decreased between 300 and 2000 m depth in bivalves, with no clear trend observed in gastropods. This finding contradicts the recognized increase in alpha-diversity in the bathyal zone in the North Atlantic basin, perhaps due to the oceanographic conditions directly south of the GIF ridge. In contrast to that observed north of the GIF ridge, nestedness did not contribute significantly to beta-diversity south of the GIF ridge. This comparative study sheds new light on deep-sea diversity patterns of molluscs in the high-latitude North Atlantic and provides baseline data on species occurrences. This information can inform future assessment of the impact of environmental changes in these regions and management efforts.

Sampling and Processing Methods Impact Microbial Community Structure and Potential Activity in a Seasonally Anoxic Fjord: Saanich Inlet, British Columbia	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						microbial ecology; oxygen minimum zone; standards of practice; filtration methods; amplicon sequencing	OXYGEN-MINIMUM ZONES; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; GENE-EXPRESSION; DIVERSITY; BACTERIAL; BACTERIOPLANKTON; MICROORGANISMS; ECOLOGY; SULFUR; WATERS	The Scientific Committee on Oceanographic Research (SCOR) Working Group 144 Microbial Community Responses to Ocean Deoxygenation workshop held in Vancouver, B.C on July 2014 had the primary objective of initiating a process to standardize operating procedures for compatible process rate and multi-omic (DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite) data collection in marine oxygen minimum zones and other oxygen depleted waters. Workshop attendees participated in practical sampling and experimental activities in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, a seasonally anoxic lord. Experiments were designed to compare and cross-calibrate in situ versus bottle sampling methods to determine effects on microbial community structure and potential activity when using different filter combinations, filtration methods, and sample volumes. Resulting biomass was preserved for small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU or 16S rRNA) and SSU rRNA gene (rDNA) amplicon sequencing followed by downstream statistical and visual analyses. Results from these analyses showed that significant community shifts occurred between in situ versus on ship processed samples. For example, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and Opisthokonta associated with on-ship filtration onto 0.4 mu m filters increased fivefold compared to on-ship in-line 0.22 mu m filters or 0.4 mu m filters processed and preserved in situ. In contrast, Planctomycetes associated with 0.4 mu m in situ filters increased fivefold compared to on-ship filtration onto 0.4 mu m filters and on-ship in-line 0.22 mu m filters. In addition, candidate divisions and Chloroflexi were primarily recovered when filtered onto 0.4 mu m filters in situ. Results based on rRNA:rDNA ratios for microbial indicator groups revealed previously unrecognized roles of candidate divisions, Desulfarculales, and Desulfuromandales in sulfur cycling, carbon fixation and fermentation within anoxic basin waters. Taken together, filter size and in situ versus on-ship filtration had the largest impact on recovery of microbial groups with the potential to influence downstream metabolic reconstruction and process rate measurements. These observations highlight the need for establishing standardized and reproducible techniques that facilitate cross-scale comparisons and more accurately assess in situ activities of microbial communities.

This tundra-taiga turnover would cause a positive vegetation-climate feedback due to albedo decrease. However, reliable estimates of tree migration rates are currently lacking due to the complex processes involved in forest establishment, which depend strongly on seed dispersal. We aim to fill this gap using LAVESI, an individual-based and spatially explicit Larix vegetation simulator. LAVESI was designed to simulate plots within homogeneous forests. Here, we improve the implementation of the seed dispersal function via field-based investigations. We inferred the effective seed dispersal distances of a typical open-forest stand on the southern Taymyr Peninsula (northern central Siberia) from genetic parentage analysis using eight nuclear microsatellite markers. The parentage analysis gives effective seed dispersal distances (median similar to 10 m) close to the seed parents. A comparison between simulated and observed effective seed dispersal distances reveals an overestimation of recruits close to the releasing tree and a shorter dispersal distance generally. We thus adapted our model and used the newly parameterised version to simulate south-to-north transects; a slow-moving treeline front was revealed. The colonisation of the tundra areas was assisted by occasional long-distance seed dispersal events beyond the treeline area. The treeline (similar to 1 tree ha(-1)) advanced by similar to 1.6 m yr(-1), whereas the forest line (similar to 100 trees ha(-1)) advanced by only similar to 0.6 m yr(-1). We conclude that the treeline in northern central Siberia currently lags behind the current strong warming and will continue to lag in the near future.

The best-bet technology packages were selected based on yield gap data from trial sites in Tanzania. A modified extrapolation detection algorithm was used to generate maps on two types of dissimilarities between environmental conditions at the reference sites and the outlying projection domain. The two dissimilarity maps were intersected to generate ESI. Accounting for correlation structure among covariates improved estimate of risk of extrapolating technologies. The covariate that highly limited the suitability of specific technology package in each pixel was identified.

Scaling Contagious Disturbance: A Spatially-Implicit Dynamic Model	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						landscape ecology; fire regime; heterogeneity; adjacency; fragmentation; LANDFIRE	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; FIRE INTERACTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VEGETATION; FOREST; HABITAT; FRAGMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; LANDFIRE; FUTURE	Spatial processes often drive ecosystem processes, biogeochemical cycles, and land-atmosphere feedbacks at the landscape-scale. Climate-sensitive disturbances, such as fire, land-use change, pests, and pathogens, often spread contagiously across the landscape. While the climate-change implications of these factors are often discussed, none of these processes are incorporated into earth system models as contagious disturbances because they occur at a spatial scale well below model resolution. Here we present a novel second-order spatially-implicit scheme for representing the size distribution of spatially contagious disturbances. We demonstrate a means for dynamically evolving spatial adjacency through time in response to disturbance. Our scheme shows that contagious disturbance types can be characterized as a function of their size and edge-to-interior ratio. This emergent disturbance characterization allows for description of disturbance across scales. This scheme lays the ground for a more realistic global-scale exploration of how spatially-complex disturbances interact with climate-change drivers, and forwards theoretical understanding of spatial and temporal evolution of disturbance.

Molecular characterization of phenol degrading bacteria was investigated to gain an insight into the biodegradation in cold areas. The psychrotolerant and psychrophiles bacteria were isolated from alpine soils in the northeast of Iran. These strains belonged to Pseudomonas sp., Stenotrophomonas spp. and Shinella spp. based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. These strains were capable of the complete phenol degradation at a concentration of 200 mg L-1 at 20 degrees C. Moreover, the strains could degrade phenol at a concentration of 400 and 600 mg L-1 at a higher time. Effects of environmental factors were studied using one factor at a time (OFAT) approach for Pseudomonas sp.ATR208. When the bacterium was grown in a liquid medium with 600 mg L-1 of concentration supplemented with optimum carbon and nitrogen sources, more than 99% of phenol removal was obtained at 20 degrees C and 24 h. Therefore, the present study indicated the potential of the local cold tolerant bacteria in the phenol bioremediation.

Aspects related to model aggregation at a high species resolution level (ALL SPP) or using functional groups (F-GR) and at 4 spatial scales (3 reaches and entire system) are cast in 24 balanced carbon flow models with 20 to 57 ENA compartments. Highest biomasses are represented by true phytoplankton, resuspended microphytobenthos, microphytobenthos, benthic bacteria, dissolved and particulate organic carbon. The bivalves Limecola balthica and Mya arenaria represent the highest animal biomass, while Crangon crangon plays a central role in the network connections. In an upstream direction, there are clear gradients in the relative overhead (Phi/DC: 0.610-0.599-0.534 [values for the 3 reaches]) and the relative ascendency (A/DC: 0.390-0.401-0.466). The A/DC values decrease when the non-living compartments (detritus) as well as the living compartments (species, functional groups) are hand-balanced. The A/DC values increase when the models are balanced by the available AVG2 balancing routine. The Phi/DC values show opposite trends. For the ALL SPP models, the geometric mean trophic efficiencies (MTE) decrease in an upstream direction (2.71-1.01-0.89) while the Finn cycling indices (FCI) increase (10-8.4-16.6%), as do the detritivory/herbivory ratios (3.13-4.33-9.03). Application of ENA to reaches instead of a full system is therefore suggested. Since ENA is sensitive to relatively small quantitative changes in biomass input values, the preferred user protocol is to consider all the relevant species separately, and to hand-balance the flows of living as well as non-living compartments.

For each reach, ENA was applied to (1) a set of carbon flow models in which only the living compartments were hand-balanced, and (2) a set in which living and non-living compartments were hand-balanced. The models considered represent a full food web at the highest species resolution level and 4 food web subsets representing benthic macrofauna, benthic macrofauna plus demersal fish and epifauna, all fish, and all birds. Each of the 30 models consist of 11 to 57 compartments (species, functional groups, C-pools). Results demonstrate that the food web subsets are predominantly responsible for the variation in the ENA indices (relative ascendency: 15% of its maximum of 1; internal relative ascendency: 21 %). The use of food web subsets also leads to increased variation in the Finn cycling index, effective link density, trophic depth and robustness. The use of subsets is therefore discouraged. The added value of robustness as a practical index was explored in relation to ascendency-related (i.e. information-related) indices, but its use could not be supported because its range was too limited. The results also indicate that incomplete food webs significantly influence the size of the 'window of vitality'. ENA works well when food web subsets include the full trophic biomass pyramid, but top-down studies focussing on so-called iconic species are not advisable for assessments. The closer to the full food web, the better the results of ENA correspond with those of a full food web.

Low-salinity tolerance of early-stage oyster larvae from a mesohaline estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Crassostrea virginica; Physiological tolerance; Coastal resource management; Chesapeake Bay	CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; EASTERN OYSTER; GROWTH; POPULATION; RESTORATION; SURVIVAL; MODEL; BAY; DISPERSAL; MARYLAND	The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is an important ecosystem engineer which promotes biodiversity, yet some key physiological traits, such as the salinity tolerance of larvae in mesohaline regions, are not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the salinity tolerances of early-stage C. virginica larvae of broodstock from the mesohaline Choptank River, Chesapeake Bay (USA), and to compare results with previous studies conducted with broodstock from the polyhaline Long Island Sound. Three experiments were conducted with broodstock and water from the Choptank River. After spawning, larvae were reared at salinities ranging from 3 to 26 for similar to 48 h post-fertilization. Salinity had a significant effect on larval survival in all experiments. While mean survival differed across experiments, the highest survival occurred between salinities of 7 and 16 in all experiments. The range of salinities which promoted high survival in this study was shifted lower by at least 7 salinity units compared to the range of salinities which promoted high survival of C. virginica larvae from the polyhaline Long Island Sound as reported in the literature. These results show that early-stage C. virginica larvae can survive at lower salinities than previously reported, and support the idea that the salinity of gametogenesis and the genetic background of broodstock influence the survival of larvae. In addition, this work provides the first quantitative estimates of absolute (instead of relative) survival of early-stage C. virginica larvae across salinities, which could be used to improve numerical models that support oyster management.

However, many influences resulting from variability in sampling and data analysis often hinder the ability to determine important patterns in community structure. The study is based on the hypothesis that, using a standard sampling method, an asymptote in the rarefaction curve represents the total (gear-specific) species complement likely to be encountered for the geographical area. Accordingly, an asymptotic species richness estimator was used to predict the full complement of species present within each estuary that could be caught using seine netting. The rarefaction curves and species richness estimator enabled the interrogation of 2 underlying paradigms of ecological species richness: the species-latitude relationship and the species-area relationship. This analysis revealed distinct groups which showed a significant relationship with latitude and size, although the size effect had a smaller influence. In particular, the species-latitude relationship paradigm held true in this study while the species-area relationship paradigm only applied when latitude was considered concomitantly. Marine species in particular appeared to account for the increased fish species number at lower latitudes. The underlying influence of latitude and estuary size suggests that any managerial tool that explores anthropogenic impacts (such as those used in the European Water Framework Directive) should include these aspects. This analysis gives environmental managers an objective cost-beneficial method of identifying when and where further sampling does not give further information for management.

Yet the identity and dynamics of important estuarine prey of many species are either unknown or highly variable between regions. As anthropogenic development in estuaries increases, so does the need to understand how these environments may be supporting economically, culturally, and ecologically important fishes. Here, we examine how important estuary fishes integrate their prey across the seascape and what may influence prey dynamics. Specifically, we surveyed juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka, Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, and surf smelt Hypomesus pretiosus diets along with zooplankton abundance in the estuary of the Skeena River (British Columbia, Canada) at a relatively fine scale. We found diets were highly variable, even within a species, but 1 or 2 prey composed most diet contents per species. Juvenile coho salmon primarily consumed terrestrial insects and larval fish, whereas sockeye salmon primarily consumed harpacticoid copepods. In contrast, small pelagic fish (Pacific herring and surf smelt) primarily consumed calanoid copepods, which were the most abundant prey in the environment. We found that certain prey groups were correlated with biophysical factors. For example, calanoid copepod abundance was positively correlated with salinity, whereas harpacticoid copepod abundance was highest over eelgrass sites. Identifying key prey species and how they distribute within the estuary seascape is an integral link in understanding the food-web foundation of fish habitat use in areas under pressure from anthropogenic development.

This is based on the assumption that changes in seabird populations are driven by changes in their prey. We tested this assumption in a High Arctic seabird community by assessing the relationships between the diet, body condition, and breeding performance of 4 ecologically different species: the little auk AIM alle, black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, Brunnich's guillemot Uria lomvia, and glaucous gull Larus hyperboreus, breeding in Svalbard, Norway. Interannual changes in seabird diet (2009-2015) were assessed by estimating their carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13) during the breeding and non-breeding seasons (i.e. using blood and feather tissues). We found interannual variation in the isotopic ratios during both seasons in all 4 species. These variations differed among species, thus suggesting dietary changes, instead of changes in isotopic baselines, as the most plausible mechanism underlying such patterns. We also found that seabirds had a lower average hatching success when the average delta N-15 during the previous non-breeding season was higher. Our results suggest that changes in the average prey composition during the non-breeding season may partially explain changes in breeding performance of Svalbard seabirds.	[Hovinen, Johanna E.

However, the role of diet in the propensity of individuals to depredate and whether the depredated resource is artificial or part of the natural diet of individuals is often unclear. Using stable isotopes, this study investigated the importance of the commercially exploited Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides in the diet of generalist subantarctic killer whales Orcinus orca depredating this fish at Crozet (45 degrees S, 50 degrees E). The isotopic niche of these killer whales was large and overlapped with that of sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus from the same region, which feed on toothfish both naturally and through depredation. There was no isotopic difference between killer whales that depredated toothfish and those that did not. Isotopic mixing models indicated that prey groups including large/medium sized toothfish and elephant seal Mirounga leonina pups represented similar to 60% of the diet relative to prey groups including penguins, baleen whales and coastal fish. These results indicate that toothfish are an important natural prey item of Crozet killer whales and that switching to depredation primarily occurs when fisheries facilitate access to that resource. This study suggests that toothfish, as a commercial species, may also have a key role as prey for top predators in subantarctic ecosystems. Therefore, assessing the extent to which predators use that resource naturally or from fisheries is now needed to improve both fish stock management and species conservation strategies.

Twelve mesocosms covering a range of pH(T) (pH on the total hydrogen ion concentration scale) from 8.0 to 7.2, corresponding to a range of CO2 partial pressures (pCO(2)) from 440 to 2900 mu atm, at two temperatures (in situ and +5 degrees C; 10 and 15 degrees C) were monitored during 13 days. All mesocosms were characterized by the rapid development of a diatom bloom dominated by Skeletonema costatum, followed by its decline upon the exhaustion of nitrate and silicic acid. Neither the acidification nor the warming resulted in a significant impact on the abundance of bacteria over the experiment. However, warming the water by 5 degrees C resulted in a significant increase in the average bacterial production (BP) in all 15 degrees C mesocosms as compared to 10 degrees C, with no detectable effect of pCO(2) on BP. Variations in total DMSP (DMSPt = particulate + dissolved DMSP) concentrations tracked the development of the bloom, although the rise in DMSPt persisted for a few days after the peaks in chlorophyll a. Average concentrations of DMSPt were not affected by acidification or warming. Initially low concentrations of DMS (< 1 nmol L-1) increased to reach peak values ranging from 30 to 130 nmol L-1 towards the end of the experiment. Increasing the pCO(2) reduced the averaged DMS concentrations by 66% and 69% at 10 and 15 degrees C, respectively, over the duration of the experiment. On the other hand, a 5 degrees C warming increased DMS concentrations by an average of 240% as compared to in situ temperature, resulting in a positive offset of the adverse pCO(2) impact. Significant positive correlations found between bacterial production and concentrations of DMS throughout our experiment point towards temperature-associated enhancement of bacterial DMSP metabolism as a likely driver of the mitigating effect of warming on the negative impact of acidification on the net production of DMS in the LSLE and potentially the global ocean.

Its effect can be partitioned into effect of water energy status (water potential) on cellular activity, effect of water volume on cellular motility, and aqueous diffusion of substrate and nutrients, as well as the effect of air content and gas-diffusion pathways on concentration of dissolved oxygen. However, moisture functions widely used in SOM decomposition models are often based on empirical functions rather than robust physical foundations that account for these disparate impacts of soil water. The contributions of soil water content and water potential vary from soil to soil according to the soil water characteristic (SWC), which in turn is strongly dependent on soil texture and structure. The overall goal of this study is to introduce a physically based modeling framework of aerobic microbial respiration that incorporates the role of SWC under arbitrary soil moisture status. The model was tested by comparing it with published datasets of SOM decomposition under laboratory conditions.

Therefore, collection and organization of information about species in natural environments are essential for conservation, especially in Protected areas (PAs) and their adjacent zones. We present information about the composition and structure of the herpetofauna from Parque Estadual da Serra de Caldas Novas (PESCAN) and its representativeness in comparison to other PAs in the Cerrado. Fieldwork was conducted in 12 sampling sites from February 2009 to February 2010, using active search and pitfall traps. We recorded 41 species of amphibians, with greatest richness in sites with open vegetation and water bodies. Reptiles were represented by 32 species, with the greatest species richness in cerrado open environments. Both amphibian and reptile communities were more similar to those from geographically closer PAs and located in the central region of the Cerrado (State of Goias and Distrito Federal). The PESCAN holds 24.85% and 17.98% of amphibians and reptiles species occurring in Cerrado PAs, respectivelly. This large representativeness and the high number of endemisms (18 amphibians and 7 reptiles) emphasize the importance of the PESCAN, together with other PAs, for the maintenance of regional biodiversity. In addition, we also encourage researches evaluating amphibian and reptile communities outside PM, such as legal reserves, and we suggest new approaches to study the biodiversity of protected areas.

Interactions between plant genome size, nutrients and herbivory by rabbits, molluscs and insects on a temperate grassland	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						genome size; herbivory; plant community ecology; competition; nitrogen; grassland experiment	PLOIDY LEVEL; FOOD QUALITY; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; EVOLUTION; PRODUCTIVITY; TRAITS; BIODIVERSITY; LIMITATION	Angiosperm genome sizes (GS) vary ca 2400-fold. Recent research has shown that GS influences plant abundance, and plant competition. There are also tantalizing reports that herbivores may select plants as food dependent on their GS. To test the hypothesis that GS plays a role in shaping plant communities under herbivore pressure, we exploit a grassland experiment that has experimentally excluded herbivores and applied nutrient over 8 years. Using phylogenetically informed statistical models and path analyses, we show that under rabbit grazing, plant species with small GS generated the most biomass. By contrast, on mollusc and insect-grazed plots, it was the plant species with larger GS that increased in biomass. GS was also shown to influence plant community properties (e.g. competitive strategy, total biomass) although the impact varied between different herbivore guilds (i.e. rabbits versus invertebrates) and nutrient inputs. Overall, we demonstrate that GS plays a role in influencing plant-herbivore interactions, and suggest potential reasons for this response, which include the impact of GS on a plant's response to different herbivore guilds, and on a plant's nutrient quality. The inclusion of GS in ecological models has the potential to expand our understanding of plant productivity and community ecology under nutrient and herbivore stress.

Colonial ascidians strongly preyed upon, yet dominate the substrate in a subtropical fouling community	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						coloniality; competition; latitudinal gradient; marine diversity; predation; tunicates	CHEMICAL DEFENSES; MARINE; PREDATION; ECOLOGY; COMPETITION; ORGANIZATION; METABOLITES; DISTURBANCE; STRATEGIES; DIVERSITY	Higher diversity and dominance at lower latitudes has been suggested for colonial species. We verified this pattern in species richness of ascidians, finding that higher colonial-to-solitary species ratios occur in the tropics and subtropics. At the latitudinal region with the highest ratio, in southeastern Brazil, we confirmed that colonial species dominate space on artificial plates in two independent studies of five fouling communities. We manipulated settlement plates to measure effects of predation and competition on growth and survivorship of colonial versus solitary ascidians. Eight species were subjected to a predation treatment, i.e. caged versus exposed to predators, and a competition treatment, i.e. leaving versus removing competitors, to assess main and interactive effects. Predation had a greater effect on growth and survivorship of colonial compared to solitary species, whereas competition did not show consistent patterns. We hypothesize that colonial ascidians dominate at this subtropical site despite being highly preyed upon because they regrow when partially consumed and can adjust in shape and space to grow into refuges. We contend that these means of avoiding mortality from predation can have large influences on diversification patterns of colonial species at low latitudes, where predation intensity is greater.

Sexual selection, body mass and molecular evolution interact to predict diversification in birds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						sexual selection; speciation rate; life-history traits; mutation rate; substitution rate; body mass	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SPERM COMPETITION; SPECIES RICHNESS; MUTATION-RATES; SPECIATION; CONFLICT; GENOME; SIZE; ADAPTATION; EXTINCTION	Sexual selection is a powerful agent of evolution, driving microevolutionary changes in the genome and macroevolutionary rates of lineage diversification. The mechanisms by which sexual selection might influence macroevolution remain poorly understood. For example, sexual selection might drive positive selection for key adaptations that facilitate diversification. Furthermore, sexual selection might be a general driver of molecular evolutionary rate. We lay out some of the potential mechanisms that create a link between sexual selection and diversification, based on causal effects on other life-history traits such as body mass and the rate of molecular evolution. Birds are ideally suited for testing the importance of these relationships because of their diverse reproductive systems and the multiple evolutionary radiations that have produced their astounding modern diversity. We show that sexual selection (measured as the degree of polygyny) interacts with the rate of molecular evolution and with body mass to predict species richness at the genus level. A high degree of polygyny and rapid molecular evolution are positively associated with the net rate of diversification, with the two factors being especially important for explaining diversification in large-bodied taxa. Our findings further suggest that mutation rates underpin some of the macroevolutionary effects of sexual selection. We synthesize the existing theory on sexual selection as a force for diversity and propose avenues for exploring this association using genome data.

However, the capture of wild animals continues for many purposes where conservation is not the primary focus. Wild-capture hinders long-term conservation goals by reducing remaining wild populations, but the direct and long-term indirect consequences of wild-capture for captive population viability are rarely addressed using longitudinal data. We explored the implications of changes in wild-capture on population dynamics in captivity over 54 years using a multi-generational studbook of working Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) from Myanmar, the largest remaining captive elephant population. Here we show that population growth and birth rates declined between 1960 and 2014 with declines in wild-capture. Importantly, wild-caught females had reduced birth rates and a higher mortality risk. However, despite the disadvantages of wild-capture, the population may not be sustainable without it, with immediate declines owing to an unstable age-structure that may last for 50 years. Our results highlight the need to assess the long-term demographic consequences of wild-capture to ensure the sustainability of captive and wild populations as species are increasingly managed and conserved in altered or novel environments.

Personal information about danger trumps social information from avian alarm calls	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						alarm call; information use; social information; anti-predator	PREDATOR DETECTION; BIRDS; VIGILANCE; RESPONSES; ATTACK; RISK; MECHANISMS; INTENSITY; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR	Information about predators can mean the difference between life and death, but prey face the challenge of integrating personal information about predators with social information from the alarm calls of others. This challenge might even affect the structure of interspecific information networks: species vary in response to alarm calls, potentially because different foraging ecologies constrain the acquisition of personal information. However, the hypothesis that constrained personal information explains a greater response to alarm calls has not been experimentally tested. We used a within-species test to compare the antipredator responses of New Holland honeyeaters, Phylidonyris novaehollandiae, during contrasting foraging behaviour. Compared with perched birds, which hawk for insects and have a broad view, those foraging on flowers were slower to spot gliding model predators, showing that foraging behaviour can affect predator detection. Furthermore, nectar-foraging birds were more likely to flee to alarm call playbacks. Birds also assessed social information relevance: more distant calls, and those from another species, prompted fewer flights and slower reaction times. Overall, birds made flexible decisions about danger by integrating personal and social information, while weighing information relevance. These findings support the idea that a strategic balance of personal and social information could affect community function.

Invasion-mediated effects on marine trophic interactions in a changing climate: positive feedbacks favour kelp persistence	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						global climate change; ocean warming; herbivory; invasive species; Caulerpa filiformis; Ecklonia radiata	OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS; CAULERPA-FILIFORMIS; LIFE-HISTORY; BODY-SIZE; TEMPERATURE; CONSUMPTION; RESPONSES; ECOSYSTEM	The interactive effects of ocean warming and invasive species are complex and remain a source of uncertainty for projecting future ecological change. Climate-mediated change to trophic interactions can have pervasive ecological consequences, but the role of invasion in mediating trophic effects is largely unstudied. Using manipulative experiments in replicated outdoor mesocosms, we reveal how near-future ocean warming and macrophyte invasion scenarios interactively impact gastropod grazing intensity and preference for consumption of foundation macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and Sargassum vestitum). Elevated water temperature increased the consumption of both macroalgae through greater grazing intensity. Given the documented decline of kelp (E. radiata) growth at higher water temperatures, enhanced grazing could contribute to the shift from kelp-dominated to Sargassum-dominated reefs that is occurring at the low-latitude margins of kelp distribution. However, the presence of a native invader (Caulerpa filiformis) was related to low consumption by the herbivores on dominant kelp at warmer temperatures. Thus, antagonistic effects between climate change and a range expanding species can favour kelp persistence in a warmer future. Introduction of species should, therefore, not automatically be considered unfavourable under climate change scenarios. Climatic changes are increasing the need for effective management actions to address the interactive effects of multiple stressors and their ecological consequences, rather than single threats in isolation.

Evidence for non-colligative function of small cryoprotectants in a freeze-tolerant insect	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						freeze tolerance; cold tolerance; acclimation; cryoprotectants; cryopreservation; Gryllus veletis	WOOLLY BEAR CATERPILLAR; COLD TOLERANCE; METABOLOMIC PROFILES; STABILIZATION; SURVIVAL; ACCLIMATION; ORTHOPTERA; TREHALOSE; PROTEINS; GLYCEROL	Freeze tolerance, the ability to survive internal ice formation, facilitates survival of some insects in cold habitats. Low-molecular-weight cryoprotectants such as sugars, polyols and amino acids are hypothesized to facilitate freeze tolerance, but their in vivo function is poorly understood. Here, we use a combination of metabolomics and manipulative experiments in vivo and ex vivo to examine the function of multiple cryoprotectants in the spring field cricket Gryllus veletis. Cold-acclimated G. veletis are freeze-tolerant and accumulate myo-inositol, proline and trehalose in their haemolymph and fat body. Injecting freeze-tolerant crickets with proline and trehalose increases survival of freezing to lower temperatures or for longer times. Similarly, exogenous myo-inositol and trehalose increase ex vivo freezing survival of fat body cells from freeze-tolerant crickets. No cryoprotectant (alone or in combination) is sufficient to confer freeze tolerance on non-acclimated, freeze-intolerant G. veletis. Given that each cryoprotectant differentially impacts survival in the frozen state, we conclude that small cryoprotectants are not interchangeable and likely function non-colligatively in insect freeze tolerance. Our study is the first to experimentally demonstrate the importance of non-colligative cryoprotectant function for insect freeze tolerance both in vivo and ex vivo, with implications for choosing new molecules for cryopreservation.

The purpose of this study is to investigate household food wasting in rural environment in West Bohemia, Czech Republic. This case study combines waste composition analysis of household waste and ethnographic research in a village conducted throughout 2013 and 2014. We describe the nature of waste itself, estimate its financial value using a method combining direct data from wasted packaging and retail survey, explore the differences among the households, interpret local understanding of food, and contribute to the theoretical debates concerning thrift. Our results show low degree of wasting of edible food (7.9 kg corresponding to 13.5 EUR per capita per year) but high variation among the households. Instead of searching for a single-causal explanation we explore a complex set of factors and relationships that shape everyday food-related practices. We approach the local discard practices via the concept of thrift and argue that it should be understood as a multi-dimensional domain that includes economizing via self-denial or creative management of resources, moral discourse entangled with care or responsibility, and social relations that shape the flows of value.

Although PCBs declined in European seas since the 1970s -1980s ban, considerable levels still persist in European and Mediterranean waters. In cetaceans, stranded animals area valuable source of samples for pollutant studies, but may introduce both known and unknown biases. Biopsy samples from live, free-ranging cetaceans offer a better alternative for evaluating toxicological burdens of populations, especially when linked to known histories of identified individuals. We evaluated PCB and other organochlorine contaminants in free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncotus) from the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea), one of the most human-impacted areas in the Mediterranean Sea. Biopsies were collected from 32 male and female dolphins during 2011-2017. All animals were photo-identified and are part of a well-known population of about 150 individuals monitored since 2002. We tested for the effects of sex, parity and social group membership on contaminant concentrations. Males had significantly higher organochlorine concentrations than females, suggesting offloading from reproducing females to their offspring via gestation and/or lactation. Furthermore, nulliparous females had substantially higher concentrations than parous ones, providing further support for maternal offloading of contaminants. Overall, 87.5% of dolphins had PCB concentrations above the toxicity threshold for physiological effects in experimental marine mammal studies (9 mg/kg lw), while 65.6% had concentrations above the highest threshold published for marine mammals based on reproductive impairment in ringed seals (41 mg/kg lw). The potential population-level effects of such high contaminant levels are of concern particularly in combination with other known or suspected threats to this population. We demonstrate the utility of combining contaminant data with demographic parameters such as sex, reproductive output, etc., resulting from long-term studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, commonly used strategies to reduce encroachment show a low medium-term success, calling for a better understanding of its causes. Previous works identified multiple drivers responsible for this phenomenon, including anthropogenic and environmental causes. However, the relative effect of climate, topography and edaphic factors on shrub encroachment is not fully understood nor has been properly quantified in Mediterranean Basin drylands. Also, understanding how these drivers lead to changes in plant communities functional traits associated to shrub encroachment is crucial, considering traits influence ecosystem processes and associated ecosystem services. Here, we studied the understory of a Mediterranean dryland ecosystem composed of savanna-like Holm-oak woodlands, along a regional climatic gradient. We specifically assessed (i) how climatic, topographic and edaphic factors influence understory relative shrub cover (RSC) and (ii) their direct and indirect effects (via RSC) on plant functional traits. We studied the mean and diversity of 12 functional traits related to plant regeneration, establishment, and dispersal, at the community-level. We found that, under similar low-intensity land use, topographic and edaphic factors, namely slope variations and soil C:N ratio, were the most important predictors of shrub encroachment, determining communities' functional characteristics. Climate, namely summer precipitation, had a much lesser influence. Our model explained 52% of the variation in relative shrub cover. Climate had a stronger effect on a set of functional traits weakly involved in shrub encroachment, related to flowering and dispersal strategies. We show that shrub encroachment is largely predicted by topo-edaphic factors in Mediterranean drylands subject to conventional low-intensity land use. Hence, management strategies to reduce encroachment need to take these drivers into account for effluent forecasting and higher cost-effectiveness. Our results suggest that climate change might not greatly impact shrub encroachment in the Mediterranean Basin, but may affect functional structure and reduce functional diversity of plant communities, thus affecting ecosystem functioning.

Linking biodiversity to ecosystem services supply: Patterns across aquatic ecosystems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Linkage Framework; Expert judgement; Weighted-estimates; ES supply score; Freshwaters; Marine waters	FAVORABLE CONSERVATION STATUS; FRESH-WATER; INDICATORS; MARINE; MANAGEMENT; METAANALYSIS; VALUATION; HABITATS; BUNDLES; IMPACT	Global initiatives have been increasingly focusing on mainstreaming the values of biodiversity and ecosystem services into decision-making at all levels. Due to the accelerated rate at which biodiversity is declining and its consequences for the functioning of ecosystems and subsequently, the services they provide, there is need to develop comprehensive assessments of the services and the benefits nature delivers to society. Based on expert evaluation, we identified relevant flow linkages in the supply-side of the socio-ecological system, i.e. from biodiversity to ecosystem services supply for eight case studies across European aquatic ecosystems covering freshwater, transitional, coastal and marine waters realms. Biological mediated services were considered, as well as those reliant on purely physical aspects of the ecosystem, i.e. abiotic outputs, since both have implications for spatial planning, management and decision-making. Due to the multidimensional nature of ecosystems and their biodiversity, our approach used ecosystem components such as habitats and biota as proxies for biodiversity and as the focal point for linkage identification. Statistical analysis revealed the importance of considering mobile biota in the spatial assessment of habitats. Contrary to literature evidences so far, our results showed significantly different and complementary ecosystem services supply patterns across the continuum of aquatic realms. The implemented score of ecosystem services supply has a high potential for integrated aquatic ecosystem service supply assessments in the context of ecosystem-based management.

However, complementarities between species in the use of resources may improve resource use efficiency and result in higher system performance. Cocoa trees have a shallow rooting system while the rooting characteristics of the associated trees are mainly unknown. This work investigates fine root distribution and production in five cocoa production systems: two monocultures and two agroforestry systems under conventional and organic farming, and a successional agroforestry system. In the organic systems a perennial leguminous cover crop was planted and compost was added, while herbicides and chemical fertilizers were applied in the conventional ones. We measured cocoa fine root parameters in the top 10 cm of soil and annual total fine root production at 0-25 and 25-50 cm depth. We related the root data with both the aboveground performance (tree and herbaceous biomass), and the cocoa and system yields. Cocoa fine roots were homogenously distributed over the plot area. Around 80% of the total fine roots were located in the upper 25 cm of soil. The total fine root production was 4-times higher in the agroforestry systems and the organic monoculture than in the conventional monoculture. The roots of the associated tree species were located in the same soil space as the cocoa roots and, in principle, competed for the same soil resources. The cocoa yield was lower in the agroforestry systems, but the additional crops generated a higher system yield and aboveground biomass than the conventional cocoa monocultures, implying effective resource exploitation. The leguminous cover crop in the organic monoculture competed with the cocoa trees for nutrients, which may explain the lower cocoa yield in this system in contrast with the conventional monoculture.

Annually resolved geo-chemical data (mu XRF and CNS) and pollen data were used to find links between changes in catchment land use and lake mixing regime. Furthermore, we tested the applicability of the Fe/Mn ratio for the reconstruction of past water ventilation. Multivariate statistical analyses show that Fe and Mn were mostly independent of terrestrial inputs and lake trophy, meaning that the Fe/Mn ratio mainly responded to changes in redox potential in hypolimnetic waters. Characteristic changes of the Fe/Mn ratio corresponded to transformations of woodland cover in the catchment as registered by changes of the arboreal/non-arboreal pollen ratio. Six main phases of different lake mixing intensity were distinguished. The local landscape was more open during phases of intensified human impact and catchment deforestation, leading to the intensification of lake mixing. At times of negligible human impact, the catchment was mostly wooded, and thus the lake was well sheltered from intense wind- driven mixing. This led to periods of prolonged anoxia. The Fe/Mn record accurately traced past changes in lake mixing intensity and related shifts in water column oxygenation. During the last two millennia, the mixing regime of Lake Zabifiskie mostly depended on human activity in the catchment and landscape openness, while long periods of anoxia were not exclusive to only the most recent sediments.

To gain deeper insights into riverine P processing and transport, the temporal and spatial changes of P compounds along the lowland river Warnow and its tributaries were investigated. Surface water samples were taken monthly between August 2016 and August 2017 and analyzed for the four P fractions: dissolved reactive (DRP), dissolved nonreactive (DNP), particulate reactive (PRP) and particulate nonreactive (PNP) phosphorus. P-composition differed between the courses of the upper Warnow and the impounded middle Warnow clue to differences in their hydrological conditions. In the catchment of the upper course, riverine lakes were the sources of PNP and DRP during the summer and autumn. Prom the catchment of the middle course, mainly PRP and DRP had been introduced into the river. The negative relationship between PRP and the chlorophyll (Chla) concentration (rho = -0.43, p < 0.001) indicated that this P fraction is potentially bioavailable. During the rainy summer of 2017, substantially higher amounts of DRP occurred in the whole Warnow river. The potentially bioavailable P fractions (DRP, PRP, DNP) supported phytoplankton growth in the middle course, and the PNP loads increased with increasing biomass. Total phosphorus (TP) loads increased along the Warnow flow path, due to increasing discharge volume. The annual TP load of 40 t to the estuary was dominated by DRP (32%) and PNP (31%), with smaller contributions by PRP and DNP (19% and 18%, respectively). Our results demonstrate that detailed information on P fractions are helpful to understand P-cycling in rivers and its influence on eutrophication processes. This knowledge should be included in the development of effective management strategies for the improvement of water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of soil horizon stratigraphy on the microbial ecology of alpine paleosols	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							WESTERN ALPS; SINGLE-CELL; METAGENOMICS; ABUNDANCE; ASSEMBLER; PATTERNS; PROJECT	There is remarkable potential for research at the interface between the earth sciences and environmental microbiology that may lead to advances in our understanding of the role of bacterial communities in the surface or subsurface environment of our planet. One mainstay of sedimentary classification is the concept of differential soil and/or paleosol horizons being the result of primarily physical and chemical weathering, with relatively little understanding of how microbial communities between these stratified horizons differ, if at all. In this study we evaluate the differences in microbial community taxonomy and biogeochemical functional potential between stratified soil horizons in an alpine paleosol environment using next-generation sequencing (NGS) shotgun sequencing. Paleosols represent a unique environment to study the effect of differences soil horizon environments on the microbial community due to their relative isolation, and the fact that three distinct stratified soil horizons can be identified within the top 30 cm of the soil. This enables us to assess variation in microbial community composition that will be relatively distinct from variation due to distance alone. We test the hypothesis that variation in soil community composition is linked to variation in the physical and chemical parameters that define stratigraphy. Multivariate statistical analysis of sequencing reads from soil horizons across five sampling sites revealed that 1223 microbial genera vary significantly and consistently in abundance across stratified soil horizons at class level. Specifically Ktedonobacter, Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria responded most strongly to soil depth. Alpha diversity showed a positive correlation with soil depth. Beta diversity, however, did not differ significantly between horizons. Genes involved in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism were found to be more abundant in Ah horizon samples. Closer inspection of carbohydrate metabolism genes revealed that genes involved in CO2 fixation, fermentation and saccharide metabolism decreased in abundance with depth while one-carbon metabolism increased down profile.

These substances may cause adverse effects in aquatic communities as well as in ecosystem functions they provide. The aim of this study was to determine the potential impact of secondary treated wastewater released into a small Swiss stream on leaf litter decomposition based on feeding rates of the amphipod shredder Gammarus fossarum measured in situ. Additionally, endocrine disrupting effects downstream of the WWTP were investigated by measuring vitellogenin (vg) induction in male gammarids exposed in situ, as well as estrogen receptor activation using the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) involving passive sampler and grab water sample extracts. Extracts were also analysed for 424 organic micropollutants and selected transformation products. Gammarid feeding rate was significantly reduced 100, 200 and 400 m downstream of the WWTP effluent relative to the upstream site. While YES results showed significantly elevated estrogenicity at downstream sites, vg production in male gammarids was not induced. A laboratory experiment, in which gammarids were exposed to WWTP effluent, supported this observation. These results, hence, suggest that treated wastewater released into aquatic ecosystems impairs the ecosystem function of leaf litter decomposition. Vg levels in male gammarids measured by UPLC-MS/MS did, however, not alter. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Selective placement of ramets (i.e. foraging behavior) can intensity ramet performance and allocation, and place more ramets in the more favorable microhabitats, which can maximum utilize resource and share risk in heterogeneous environments. Still little is known about whether invasive alien and native clonal plants differ in the selective placement patterns of ramets in invasive clonal plants or not. We used five congeneric pairs of naturally co-occurring invasive alien and native clonal plant species in China. In a glasshouse, we grew all species in pots under a homogeneous and three heterogeneous conditions (i.e. light, soil nutrients or water) subjected to resource-high or -low patches. All biomass parameters and number of ramets significantly increased in resource-high patches in all three types of heterogeneous environments. Interestingly, growth of invasive alien plants benefited significantly more from resource-high patches than native plants in all heterogeneous environments. Overall, invasive had higher biomass parameters per ramet than natives. Ramet parameters of invasive plants also benefited more from resource-low patches than natives. Three different selective placement patterns of ramets in resource-low patches were exhibited in invasive plants: ramet increasing shoot investment (above pattern), increasing root investment (below pattern) and increasing both investments (complete pattern) in the light, soil water and nutrient heterogeneity, respectively. investment on less, larger ramet was the adaptive strategy of invasive plants in resource-poor patches. The results suggest that adaptively selective placement patterns of ramets promote a higher morphology plasticity and performance in invasive clonal plants over natives. When alien clonal plants spread new areas with light, soil nutrients or water heterogeneity, selective placement patterns of ramets might play an important role in plant performance and competitive superior by capitalizing more on additional resources.

Analyzing the likely impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems is crucial in order to understand the potential adaptation of forests, to guide management strategies, as well as to preserve ecosystem services. With the aim to provide information on the possible modifications of geographic ranges, in the medium to long-term, for some Russian dominant forest species under climate change, we applied a Cascade Ensemble System (CES) approach. This consists of combining Ensemble Platform for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to six bias-corrected Earth System Model (ESM) projections, driven in turn by two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) proxies of greenhouse gas emission scenarios, in order to obtain area maps of the future suitability for forest species. The suitability information is then flagged with information about its "likelihood," adopting the IPCC terminology based on a consensus among projections. Maps of aggregated changes were created in order to identify areas potentially more vulnerable to climate change. Results showed that possible impacts of climate change (either gain or loss) were diversified across species with a pronounced Northward shift of the ranges. Further analyses were performed at sub-regional levels revealing the potential for the Arctic Circle to become a refuge area for some conifer species. Species-aggregated change analyses spotted two distinct areas as more vulnerable to habitat change, in the central and south-east portions of the Russian territory. Our findings represent useful and immediate biogeographical information available to Russian policy makers to delineate conservation strategies and forest management plans.

However, the mechanisms underlying this function remain unclear for many species. We examined this question with data on a semi-free ranging group of 16 adult domesticated goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) inhabiting Tsaobis Nature Park, Namibia. All goats wore dataloggers consisting of a GPS and audio recorder for 5-6 h per day for 10 days, providing continuous data on their geolocations and vocal communication. We found that callers were farther from the group centroid than expected by chance and that call production was associated with the cessation of group expansion and subsequent group contraction. We did not find strong evidence for antiphonal call exchange between distant and core group members. Rather, we found that (i) call production by distant group members is associated with a significant reduction of group movement away from the caller, and (ii) call production by core group members is associated with greater, though not significantly greater, group movement toward the caller. These findings suggest that calls may be used by distant, and potentially core, groupmembers to facilitate the contraction of group spread. Results from our study clarify the mechanisms through which social animals can regulate collective movement behavior and the specific role that vocalizations play in this process.

Most organisms make such decisions despite lacking a neural architecture. This is the case of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum that has demonstrated remarkable information processing and problem-solving abilities. Previous studies suggest that the membrane of P. polycephalum plays an important role in integrating and processing information leading to the selection of a resource to exploit. The cyclical contraction-relaxation pattern of the membrane changes with the local quality of the environment, and individual contractile regions within a P. polycephalum can entrain neighboring regions, providing a potential mechanism for information processing and propagation. In this study, we use an information-theoretic tool, transfer entropy, to study the flow of information in single tubule segments of P. polycephalum in a binary choice between two food sources. We test P. polycephalum tubules in two food choice conditions, where the two available options are either symmetric in their nutrient concentrations or with one more concentrated in nutrients than the other (i.e., asymmetric). We measure the contractile pattern of the P. polycephalum membrane and use these data to explore the direction and amount of information transfer along the tubule as a function of the cell's final decision. We find that the direction of information transfer is different in the two experimental conditions, and the amount of information transferred is inversely proportional to the distance between different contractile regions. Our results show that regions playing a leading role in information transfer changes with the decision-making challenges faced by P. polycephalum.

As repeated surveys are planned at medium to long term intervals, the alternation of different operators is often possible. This involves the need to consider the effect of non-sampling errors (e.g., observer errors). Here we relate the trends of lichen communities in repeated surveys with the contribution of different teams of specialists involved in sampling. For this reason, lichen diversity data collected in Italy within several ongoing biomonitoring programs have been considered. The variations of components of gamma diversity between the surveys have been related to the composition of the teams of operators. As a major result, the composition of the teams significantly affected data comparability: Similarity (S), Species Replacement (R), and Richness Difference (D) showed significant differences between "same" and "partially" versus "different" teams, with characteristics trends over time. The results suggest a more careful interpretation of temporal variations in biomonitoring studies.

During 2013-2014, mounds at similar to 600 m water depth were observed for the first time and sampled by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's ROV Doc Ricketts. Active cold seeps were found, but surprisingly one of these mounds was characterized by massive deposits composed of fossil serpulid worm tubes (Annelida: Serpulidae) exhibiting various states of mineralization by authigenic carbonate. No living serpulids with equivalent tube morphologies were found at the site; hence the mound was termed "Fossil Hill." In the present study, the identity of the fossil serpulids and associated fossil community, the ages of fossils and authigenic carbonates, the formation of the fossil serpulid aggregation, and the geological structure of the mound are explored. Results indicate that the tubes were most likely made by a deep-sea serpulid lineage, with radiocarbon dating suggesting that they have a very recent origin during the Late Pleistocene, specifically to the Last Glacial Maximum similar to 20,000 years ago. Additional U-Th analyses of authigenic carbonates mostly corroborate the radiocarbon dates, and also indicate that seepage was occurring while the tubes were being formed. We also document similar, older deposits along the approximate trajectory of the San Pedro Basin Fault. We suggest that the serpulid tube facies formed in situ, and that the vast aggregation of these tubes at Fossil Hill is likely due to a combination of optimal physical environmental conditions and chemosynthetic production, which may have been particularly intense as a result of sea-level lowstand during the Last Glacial Maximum.

The multi-species, multi-gear and data-poor nature of SSF makes implementation of traditional single-species management approaches - like catch-quotas or size limits - particularly challenging and insufficient. A more holistic approach is thus required, which demands assessment of ecological impacts. Here we carried out an estimation of selected ecological indicators of the impact of fisheries (mean length, maximum body size, mean trophic level, trophic and spatial guilds, threatened species and landed by-catch) based on the nominal catch of different gears in three representative SSF along the Colombian Pacific using landings data collected in multiple years (2011-2017). Results showed that taxonomic, size-based, functional and conservation features of the nominal catch vary greatly with geographical location and gear type used. Overall, handlines and longlines tend to select larger sizes and higher trophic levels than nets, but they also catch a higher proportion of intrinsically vulnerable species and species of conservation concern. This challenges the idea that more selective gears have overall lower ecological impacts. In contrast, nets target a wider size range - although focusing on small or medium sized fish - and include a higher diversity of trophic and spatial guilds, which could arguably be considered a more "balanced harvest" type of fishing that retains ecosystem structure and functionality. Bottom trawls, though, exhibited a relatively high percentage of landed by-catch, an undesirable feature for any fisheries in terms of sustainability. We propose that the assessment of a suite of ecological indicators, like those implemented here, should be included as part of periodic evaluations of multi-gear and multi-species SSF in tropical coastal areas, as a practical step toward ecosystem-based fisheries management.

Here, we demonstrate that, although in low relative abundance (i.e., fungal reads made up 1.4-2.9% of the metagenomes), fungi contribute to both phylogenetic and functional microbial diversity with a conserved fungal presence in global marine samples. Universally distributed taxa and functions implicate them in complex carbon and fatty acid metabolism, with depth stratification along pelagic zones. Functional differences in observed genes between epipelagic and mesopelagic waters indicate changes in UV protection, shift to carbohydrate limited diets, as well as alternative energy sources. Metagenomic data also provided evidence for a latitudinal gradient in fungal diversity linked to temperature shifts. Our results suggest that fungi contribute to multiple biogeochemical cycles in the pelagic ocean, and could be integral for ecosystem functioning through provision of key nutrients.

However, exactly how the host animal responds to varying environmental conditions remains unclear. In this study, we tested two relevant environmental factors that can have deleterious effects on corals: heat and sediment. We examined among-genotype responses of Pocillopora acuta to these factors with RNA-Seq in concert with widely-used tools for assessing the physiological conditions of corals. Heat and sediment treatments were applied in a 2 x 2 crossed experimental design: (1) similar to 30 degrees C without sediment (control, "C"), (2) similar to 30 degrees C with sediment (sediment-only, "S"), (3) similar to 32 degrees C without sediment (heat-only, "H"), (4) similar to 32 degrees C with sediment (heat + sediment, "H+S") over four consecutive days (3-h daily exposure) in ex situ aquarium conditions. A clear differentiation in gene expression patterns was observed in corals exposed to heat alone and to heat with sediment, relative to the control treatment. Few transcripts (similar to 3) were found to be differentially expressed for corals exposed to sediment only. The greater impact of heat was supported by photo-physiological measurements that showed significant effects on maximum quantum yield and average symbiont density among genotypes of P acute. The combined effect of heat and sediment caused a greater reduction in average symbiont density than the effect of sediment alone. Furthermore, "H+S" disrupted the ability of corals to maintain processes involving assembly and disassembly of cilium which suggests a synergistic effect between the two factors. We also found that host-specific genes which were expressed differentially may not be related to their interactions with algal symbionts. Rather, these genes are involved in a variety of biological functions including, but not limited to, cilium biogenesis and degradation, cilia motility, innate and adaptive immune responses, cell adhesion and bone mineralization, and processes involved in the cell cycle. These results reflect the complex response of the host alone. Overall, our findings indicate that acute heat stress in tandem with sediment can depress photo-physiological performance and trigger considerable changes in host gene expression.

We studied the origin and role of rock biofilms in geomorphic processes of hard lime and dolomitic rocks that feature comparable weathering morphologies, although these two rock types originate from arid and hyperarid environments, respectively. We hypothesized that weathering patterns are fashioned by salt erosion and mediated by the rock biofilms that originate from the adjacent soil and dust. We used a combination of microbial and geological techniques to characterize rock morphologies and the origin and diversity of their biofilms. Amplicon sequencing of the SSU rRNA gene suggested that bacterial diversity is low and dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. These phyla only formed laminar biofilms on rock surfaces that were exposed to the atmosphere and burrowed up to 6 mm beneath the surface, protected by sedimentary deposits. Unexpectedly, the microbial composition of the biofilms differed between the two rock types and was also distinct from the communities identified in the adjacent soil and settled dust, showing a habitat-specific filtering effect. Moreover, the rock bacterial communities were shown to secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that form an evaporation barrier, reducing water loss rates by 65 %75 %. The reduced water transport rates through the rock also limit salt transport and its crystallization in surface pores, which is thought to be the main force for weathering. Concomitantly, the biofilm layer stabilizes the rock surface via coating and protects the weathered front. Our hypothesis contradicts common models, which typically consider biofilms to be agents that promote weathering. In contrast, we propose that the microbial colonization of mineral surfaces acts to mitigate geomorphic processes in hot, arid environments.

The objectives of the research work were to identify best vegetation index and multivariate model based on canopy reflectance and LAI measured at different growth stages of wheat. Comparison of existing indices revealed optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) as the best index based on R-2 of calibration, validation and root mean square error of validation. Proposed ratio index (RI; R-670, R-845) and normalized difference index (NDI; R-670, R-845) provided comparable performance with the existing vegetation indices (R-2 = 0.65 and 0.62 for RI and NDI, respectively, during validation). Among the multivariate models, partial least squares regression (PLSR) model with Hyperion band configuration performed the best during validation (R-2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 0.58 m(2) m(-2)). Our results manifested the opportunities for developing biophysical products based on satellite sensors.

NOV.; REDUCTION; SULFIDE; COMMUNITIES; VARIABILITY	During transport of wastewater in force mains, sulphide and possibly methane formation take place due to prokaryotic activity. Sulphide has several detrimental effects and addition of ferrous or ferric iron for abatement by precipitation is commonly applied. Precipitation stoichiometry and efficiency of this process have been investigated in detail. However, it is largely unknown how ferrous and ferric iron influence prokaryotic populations of sewer biofilms. The microbiomes of iron-treated force main biofilms were, together with an untreated control, examined by sequencing of the 16S rDNA V3+ V4 regions. Differences in distribution and abundance of several bacterial and archaeal genera were observed, indicating that treatment with ferrous and ferric iron for sulphide abatement differentially changed sewer force main microbiomes. Furthermore, differences at the functional level (KEGG orthologs, KOs) indicate that ferrous and ferric iron treatment possibly can decrease methane formation, whereas functions related to dissimilatory sulphate reduction seemed unaffected.

High resolution characterisation of E. coli proliferation profiles in livestock faeces	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agricultural waste management; Diffuse pollution; Faecal indicator organism; Microbial die-off; Survival curves	FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA; SOURCE-TRACKING MARKERS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; DIE-OFF; SURVIVAL; WATER; MANURE; RISK; VARIABILITY; GROWTH	Agricultural intensification can lead to high volumes of livestock faeces being applied to land, either as solid or liquid manures or via direct defecation, and can result in reservoirs of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) persisting within farmland. Understanding the survival of FIOs, e.g. E. coli, in agricultural environments, and in particular within different livestock faeces, is key to developing catchment management practices for the protection of ecosystem services provided by clean water. Frequently, controlled laboratory studies, under constant temperature regimes, are used to determine the impact of environmental factors on E. coli persistence in livestock faeces; however, such studies oversimplify the diurnal variations and interactions of real world conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of E. coli using a controlled environment facility, which simulated diurnal variation of temperatures typically experienced during a British spring and summer. The approach provided a comparison of E. coli persistence profiles within faeces of sheep, beef cattle and dairy cattle to allow novel interpretations of E. coli regrowth patterns in contrasting livestock faeces in the period immediately post-defecation. Thus, the coupling of a tightly controlled environment facility with high resolution monitoring enabled the development of a new non-linear, asymptotic description of E. coli proliferation in livestock faeces, with increased potential for E. coli growth observed during warmer temperatures for all livestock types. While this study focused on temperatures typical of the UK, the occurrence of a phase of E. coli regrowth has implications for microbial water quality management worldwide. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Meteorological parameters were recorded at an on-site weather station, while LFG data were recorded when entering the gas engine. LFG CH4 concentration, LFG flow and CH4 flow correlated highly with both barometric pressure and changes in barometric pressure, and the correlations were statistically significant. A higher correlation was observed when studying changes in barometric pressure in comparison to the absolute value of barometric pressure. LFG recovery data correlated highly and significantly with wind speed during winter, but not during summer. Ambient temperature and solar radiation were not major meteorological parameters affecting LFG recovery, as low correlation coefficients were observed between these two parameters and the LFG recovery data.

The management consisted of the establishment of 3 m(2) patches of sown plant species or spontaneous natural vegetation between trees along tree lines. The sown plant species in the mixtures were Sinapis alba L. (Brassicaceae), Glebionis segetum (L.) Fourr. and Glebionis coronaria (L.) Cass. ex Spach (Asteraceae), Vicia saliva L. and Pisum sativum L. (Fabaceae), Borago officinalis L. (Boraginaceae). Coriandrum sativum L. and Pimpinella anisum L. (Apiaceae). Sowing was performed in autumn or spring and the peak flowering period occurred at the end of March to end of April, and at the end of May to end of June, respectively. Visual estimation of flower cover, counts of pollinator landings on flowers and presence of beneficial arthropods (suction sampling) were performed in three 7-10 day intervals during peak flowering, for each experimental year. Overall, patches with sown plant mixtures attracted higher numbers of pollinating Hymenoptera compared to native vegetation, especially mining bees and honey bees (Apis mellifera) as well as megachilids and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Sinapis alba, present in both sown and native vegetation patches, attracted mainly mining bees and honey bees. The flowering mixture with C. sativum and B. officinalis was more attractive to honey bees than the one with G. coronaria as main flowering species but they were both equally attractive to mining bees, although the species composition may well have been different. Hymenopterous parasitoids, primarily Braconidae and Chalcidoidea, were sampled from the patches and the olive fruit fly parasitoid Opius concolor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was recorded on olive trees adjacent to the flowering patches. Large numbers of predators, namely Orius sp. (Hemiptera: Miridae) and lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), were recorded in the patches, principally in those with the mixture containing mostly S. alba. Our results suggest that ground cover in patches with suitable flowering species could be part of a sustainable olive crop management system, providing food and refuge for pollinating insects and beneficial arthropods.

On the performance of a pilot hybrid constructed wetland for stormwater recovery in Mediterranean climate	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						alternate feeding; decentralised treatment; hybrid constructed wetland; hydraulic conductivity; stormwater	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; NITROGEN REMOVAL; SYSTEM	The overall efficiency of a pilot-scale hybrid constructed wetland (H-CW), located on a retail store's parking area in Eastern Sicily, for alternative treatment of stormwater runoff and of sequential batch reactor (SBR) effluent was evaluated. Experimental activities were focused on system performances, including wastewater (WW) quality and hydraulic monitoring. System design, macrophyte growth and seasonal factors influenced the pilot plant performance. Very high removal efficiency for microbial indicators were reported within the subsurface horizontal flow unit (HF), playing a strategic role for Clostridium perfringens. The algal growth occurred in the free water surface (FWS) unit and inhibited removal efficiencies of total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), impairing water quality. The whole H-CW showed good efficiency in trace metals removal, especially for Pb, Zn, and Cu. Preliminary results suggested the reliability of the H-CW technology in decentralised water treatment facilities for enhancing water recovery and reuse.

While Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) methods can be used to acquire such ecological information (e.g., abundance, movement patterns, and habitat use), these techniques assume that all individuals of the study population are equally trappable. To test whether urban rats adhere to this assumption, we conducted a 4-week CMR study in an urban neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada, to evaluate whether rat characteristics (i.e., age, sex, size, wound status, and infection with the pathogen Leptospira spp.) were associated with trappability. We found that the majority of rats entered traps in the first 2 weeks of trapping, and that larger rats were caught earlier in the trapping period. However, smaller, sexually immature rats were recaught more often than were larger, sexually mature rats, suggesting that prior capture affects the ability to recapture urban Norway rats. This highlights the need for CMR studies to account for size, sexual maturity, and prior capture when interpreting data.

Detailed Mapping of Hydrothermal Vent Fauna: A 3D Reconstruction Approach Based on Video Imagery	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						3D reconstruction; hydrothermal vents; random forest; faunal assemblages; spatial distribution; terrain variables	LAU SPREADING CENTER; CENTRAL INDIAN RIDGE; VALU FA RIDGE; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; MULTIBEAM BATHYMETRY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; TEMPORAL-CHANGE; LUCKY STRIKE; UNDERWATER; ENVIRONMENT	Active hydrothermal vent fields are complex, small-scale habitats hosting endemic fauna that changes at scales of centimeters, influenced by topographical variables. In previous studies, it has been shown that the distance to hydrothermal fluids is also a major structuring factor. Imagery analysis based on two dimensional photo stitching revealed insights to the vent field zonation around fluid exits and a basic knowledge of faunal assemblages within hydrothermal vent fields. However, complex three dimensional surfaces could not be adequately replicated in those studies, and the assemblage structure, as well as their relation to abiotic terrain variables, is often only descriptive. In this study we use ROV video imagery of a hydrothermal vent field on the southeastern Indian Ridge in the Indian Ocean. Structure from Motion photogrammetry was applied to build a high resolution 3D reconstruction model of one side of a newly discovered active hydrothermal chimney complex, allowing for the quantification of abundances. Likewise, the reconstruction was used to infer terrain variables at a scale important for megabenthic specimens, which were related to the abundances of the faunal assemblages. Based on the terrain variables, applied random forest model predicted the faunal assemblage distribution with an accuracy of 84.97 %. The most important structuring variables were the distances to diffuse- and black fluid exits, as well as the height of the chimney complex. This novel approach enabled us to classify quantified abundances of megabenthic taxa to distinct faunal assemblages and relate terrain variables to their distribution. The successful prediction of faunal assemblage occurrences further supports the importance of abiotic terrain variables as key structuring factors in hydrothermal systems and offers the possibility to detect suitable areas for Marine Protected areas on larger spatial scales. This technique works for any kind of video imagery, regardless of its initial purpose and can be implemented in marine monitoring and management.

Here it either enters long-term storage in sediments or enters the atmosphere as gaseous carbon through a combination of biotic and abiotic processes. There are, however, increasing concerns over the long-term stability of terrestrial carbon stores in blanket peatland catchments as a result of anthropogenic pressures and climate change. We analysed sub-annual and interannual changes in river water colour (a reliable proxy measurement of dissolved organic carbon; DOC) using 6 years of weekly data, from 2011 to 2016. This time-series dataset was gathered from three contiguous river sub-catchments, the Black, the Glenamong and the Srahrevagh, in a blanket peatland catchment system in western Ireland, and it was used to identify the drivers that best explained observed temporal change in river colour. The data were also used to estimate annual DOC loads from each catchment. General additive mixed modelling was used to identify the principle environmental drivers of water colour in the rivers, while wavelet cross-correlation analysis was used to identify common frequencies in correlations. At 130 mg Pt Co L-1, the mean colour levels in the Srahrevagh (the sub-catchment with lowest rainfall and higher forest cover) were almost 50% higher than those from the Black and Glenamong, at 95 and 84 mg Pt Co L-1 respectively. The decomposition of the colour datasets revealed similar multi-annual, annual and event-based (random component) trends, illustrating that environmental drivers operated synchronously at each of these temporal scales. For both the Black and its nested Srahrevagh catchment, three variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit, SMD, and the weekly North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) combined to explain 54% and 58% of the deviance in colour respectively. In the Glenamong, which had steeper topography and a higher percentage of peat intersected by streams, soil temperature, the log of stream discharge and the NAO explained 66% of the colour concentrations. Crosswavelet time-series analysis between river colour and each environmental driver revealed a significant high common power relationship at an annual time step. Each relationship however, varied in phase, further highlighting the complexity of the mechanisms driving river colour in the subcatchments. The estimated mean annual DOC loads for the Black and Glenamong rivers to Lough Feeagh were similar at 15.0 and 14.7 t C km(-2) yr(-1) respectively. The important role of past and current precipitation and, in particular, temperature emphasises the vulnerability of blanket peatland carbon stores to projected climate change and highlights the interaction of local and regional climate in controlling aquatic carbon export. Our results show that water colour (and hence DOC) concentrations can vary considerably between neighbouring catchments and also that regional-scale climatic drivers control the trends in intra-and inter-annual flux of DOC through the system. The combination of locally determined concentrations and regionally controlled fluxes produces aquatic DOC loads that vary over both the annual cycle and over multiple years.

Quantifying pollutant loading from channel sources: Watershed-scale application of the River Erosion Model	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Phosphorus pollution; Sediment pollution; Model uncertainty; Water quality management; Stream restoration	BANK STABILITY; STREAMBANK EROSION; EVOLUTION MODEL; PHOSPHORUS; SEDIMENT; UNCERTAINTY; SOILS; LAND; MOBILIZATION; FRAMEWORK	Phosphorus and fine sediment pollution are primary causes of water quality degradation. Streambank erosion is a potentially significant source of fine sediment and particulate phosphorus to watersheds, but it remains difficult to quantify the magnitude of this loading. A new, easily applied, watershed scale model was used to simulate the potential for future phosphorus and sediment loading from channel erosion in two watersheds: Big Dry Creek, Colorado and Lick Creek, North Carolina. The projected magnitude of loading for phosphorus is about an order of magnitude higher in Big Dry Creek compared to Lick Creek (similar to 280 kg/yr and 50 kg/yr, respectively), while sediment loading results are similar (similar to 950 ton/yr). In both watersheds, model results suggest that channel erosion will not contribute a significant amount of phosphorus to the watershed (similar to 1-4% of historic watershed total from all pollutant sources) but will contribute a large amount of sediment (30-100% of historic watershed total). Uncertainty in these estimates is high, but quantifying confidence in model projections is important for understanding and using model results. Importantly, modeling shows no decrease in loading over the 40-year model time frame in either watershed, suggesting that the channels are not adjusting to a new stable state and erosion will continue to be a pollutant source. Lick Creek model results are sensitive to upstream sediment supply while Big Dry Creek's are not, reinforcing the importance of considering alterations to both the hydrologic and sediment regimes when analyzing potential channel changes - at least in vertically active channels. This new modeling approach is useful for estimating historic and future phosphorus and sediment loading from channel erosion, an important first step in effective management to improve water quality.

EcoAnthromes of Alberta: An example of disturbance-informed ecological regionalization using remote sensing	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Ecological regionalization; Multivariate clustering; EcoAnthrome; Anthropogenic disturbance; Habitat; Ecological classification	ENVIRONMENTAL DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION; EARTH OBSERVATION DATA; LANDSAT TIME-SERIES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; FOREST CHANGE; FRAMEWORK; PATTERNS; RECOVERY; FRAGMENTATION; ECOREGIONS	Humans influence ecosystems on magnitudes that often exceed that of natural forces such as climate and geology; however, frameworks rarely include anthropogenic disturbance when delineating unique ecological regions. A critical step toward understanding, managing and monitoring human-altered ecosystems is to incorporate disturbance into ecological regionalizations. Furthermore, quantitative regionalization approaches are desirable to provide cost-effective, repeatable and statistically sound stratification for environmental monitoring. We applied a two-stage multivariate clustering technique to identify 'EcoAnthromes' across a large area - the province of Alberta, Canada - at 30 m spatial resolution, and using primarily remotely sensed inputs. The EcoAnthrome clusters represent regions with unique ecological characteristics based on a combination of natural ecological potential (e.g., climatic and edaphic factors) and disturbance, both natural and anthropogenic. Compared to existing expert-derived Natural Subregions in Alberta, the model-based EcoAnthromes showed greater class separation and explained more variance for an assortment of variables related to land cover, disturbance and species intactness. The EcoAnthromes successfully separated important ecological regions that are defined by complex assemblages of topography, climate and disturbance, such as gravel-bed river valleys, boreal forests, grasslands, post-fire recovery areas and highly disturbed agricultural, industrial and urban landscapes. In addition to presenting a flexible method for EcoAnthrome regionalization, we group and describe the EcoAnthromes created for Alberta and discuss how they can complement expert-derived regionalizations to aid in environmental management efforts, such as species recovery planning and monitoring for threatened species.

The Nottawasaga River Watershed (NRW) is dominated by agricultural land-use, and drains into Nottawasaga Bay, Georgian Bay (Lake Huron). A fundamental feature of the NRW is the Minesing Wetlands, a Ramsar site and the largest inland wetland in southern Ontario. We used total phosphorus (TP) concentration-discharge relationships to estimate annual loading from six sub-watersheds and compared these against published models, which did not offer a way to account for the unique properties of the Minesing Wetlands. We developed predictive loading models specifically for the NRW to account for these characteristics, which accurately predict daily summer base-flow TP (r(2) = 0.76, p = < 0.0001) and total suspended solids (TSS; r(2) = 0.65, p = < 0.0001) loads for 11 subwatersheds using geomorphic and land-cover variables. Drainage area and % pasture land were the most significant predictive variables driving spatial variability in TP and TSS loading rates among subwatersheds. The positive relationship between TP and % wetland (r(2) = 0.22, p = 0.0063) also suggested that the Minesing Wetlands are a source of nutrients to the Nottawasaga River. Watershed geomorphology (e.g. slope) was a good predictor of land cover, and produced accurate loading estimates. This study is the first to offer a new approach to predict TP and TSS loading rates during the growing season using readily available geospatial data.

Previous studies indicate that mapping these natural habitats from single-date remotely sensed imagery remains challenging because some communities have similar physiognomy. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellites are a promising opportunity for monitoring vegetation. This article assesses the advantages of Sentinel-2 time-series for discriminating plant communities in wet grasslands. An annual Sentinel-2 time-series was compared respectively to single-date and single-band datasets derived from this time-series for mapping grassland plant communities in a temperate floodplain located near Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, which is included in the long-term ecological research network "ZA Armorique" (France). At this 475 ha site, 123 vegetation releves were collected and assigned to seven plant communities to calibrate and validate the Sentinel-2 data. Satellite images were classified using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that the SVM classifier performs slightly better than the RF classifier (overall accuracy 0.78 and 0.71, respectively). They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70). The results also reveal that discrimination of plant communities is more sensitive to temporal resolution (Delta = 0.34 in overall accuracy) than spectral resolution (Delta = 0.12 in overall accuracy).

Freshwater systems play an active role in the carbon cycle as it receives, and decomposes, terrestrial litter material alongside decomposing aquatic plant litter. Decomposition of organic matter in the aquatic environment is directly controlled by water temperature and nutrient availability, which are continuously affected by global change. We adapted the Tea Bag Index (TBI), a highly standardized methodology for determining soil decomposition, for lakes by incorporating a leaching factor. By placing Lipton pyramid tea bags in the aquatic environment for 3 h, we quantified the period of intense leaching which usually takes place prior to litter (tea) decomposition. Standard TBI methodology was followed after this step to determine how fast decomposition takes place (decomposition rate, k(1)) and how much of the material cannot be broken down and is thus sequestered (stabilization factor, S). A Citizen Science project was organized to test the aquatic TBI in 40 European lakes located in four climate zones, ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic systems. We expected that warmer and/or eutrophic lakes would have a higher decomposition rate and a more efficient microbial community resulting in less tea material to be sequestered. The overall high decomposition rates (k(1)) found confirm the active role lakes play in the global carbon cycle. Across climate regions the lakes in the warmer temperate zone displayed a higher decomposition rate (k(1)) compared to the colder lakes in the continental and polar zones. Across trophic states, decomposition rates were higher in eutrophic lakes compared to oligotrophic lakes. Additionally, the eutrophic lakes showed a higher stabilization (S), thus a less efficient microbial community, compared to the oligotrophic lakes, although the variation within this group was high. Our results clearly show that the TBI can be used to adequately assess the decomposition process in aquatic systems. Using "alien standard litter" such as tea provides a powerful way to compare decomposition across climates, trophic states and ecosystems. By providing standardized protocols, a website, as well as face to face meetings, we also showed that collecting scientifically relevant data can go hand in hand with increasing scientific and environmental literacy in participants. Gathering process-based information about lake ecosystems gives managers the best tools to anticipate and react to future global change. Furthermore, combining this process-based information with citizen science, thus outreach, is in complete agreement with the Water Framework Directive goals as set in 2010. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Trace organic contaminant removal in six full-scale integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) systems treating municipal wastewater	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Endocrine disrupting compounds; Trace organic contaminants; Estrogenic activity; Municipal wastewater; Integrated fixed-film activated sludge	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS; TREATMENT-PLANT; ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS; MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR; MICROPOLLUTANT REMOVAL; TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; SURFACE WATERS; IN-VIVO	Trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) often pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (CAS-WWTPs) and are discharged into surface waters, where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health, largely due to the hormone disrupting effects of certain TrOCs. The integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process is a cost-effective means of upgrading CAS-WWTPs by adding free-floating carrier media, which promotes biofilm formation in the well-mixed suspended growth reactors, providing a potential niche for slow-growing microorganisms. Although IFAS upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal, limited bench- and pilot-scale data indicate that TrOC removal may also be improved. However, only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full-scale IFAS-WWTPs have been published to date, and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full-scale IFAS-VVWTPs. In this study, six full-scale IFAS-WWTPs were surveyed to quantify TrOC and estrogenic activity removal. Twenty-four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent (pre-disinfection) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), estrogenic activity, and 98 TrOCs. The biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase (i.e. mixed liquor) and IFAS media was also assessed. All IFAS-WWTPs performed well in terms of TSS, COD, and ammonia removal. TN removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal. Total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2.5 to 7.6 g, with 40-60% attached to media. TrOCs with no detection (17) and those with high median removal (23, >= 90% average removal) were observed. Other TrOCs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies. Qualitative comparison with CAS literature shows potentially higher IFAS removal efficiencies for a number of compounds including several which have been previously indicated in bench- or pilot-scale studies (atenolol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, DEET, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tertoctylphenol), as well as the chlorinated flame retardants TCIPP and TDCIPP. Effluent estrogenic activity was found to be similar to that reported for full-scale CAS-WWTPs. These results provide the first survey of multiple full-scale IFAS-WWTPs employing mobile plastic carrier media in terms of basic chemical endpoints (removal of ammonia, TN, TP, and COD), the distribution of solids within the systems, and the removal of TrOCs and estrogenic activity.

However, the direct and indirect effects of functional diversity on aboveground biomass via tree crown complementarity in natural forests remain unclear, and this potential ecological mechanism is yet to be understood across large-scale ecological gradients. Here, we hypothesized that tree crown complementarity would link positive functional diversity and aboveground biomass due to increasing species coexistence through efficient capture and use of available resources in natural tropical forests along large-scale ecological gradients. We quantified individual tree crown variation, functional divergence of tree maximum height, and aboveground biomass using data from 187,748 trees, in addition to the quantifications of climatic water availability and soil fertility across 712 tropical forests plots in Hainan Island of Southern China. We used structural equation modeling to test the tree crown complementarity hypothesis. Aboveground biomass increased directly with increasing functional diversity, individual tree crown variation and climatic water availability. As such, functional diversity enhanced individual tree crown variation, thereby increased aboveground biomass indirectly via individual tree crown variation. Additional positive effects of climatic water availability and soil fertility on aboveground biomass were accounted indirectly via increasing individual tree crown variation and/or functional diversity. This study shows that tree crown complementarity mediates the positive effect of functional diversity on aboveground biomass through light capture and use along large-scale ecological gradients in natural forests. This study also mechanistically shows that tree crown complementarity increases species coexistence through maintenance of functional diversity, which in turn enhances aboveground biomass in natural tropical forests. Hence, managing natural forests with the aim of increasing tree crown complementarity holds promise for enhancing carbon storage while conserving biodiversity in functionally-diverse communities.

Turning down the heat: An enhanced understanding of the relationship between urban vegetation and surface temperature at the city scale	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban vegetation; Land surface temperature (LST); Urban heat island (UHI); Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Machine learning	EXTREME HEAT; ISLAND; VALIDATION; RESOLUTION; REFINEMENTS; AUSTRALIA; IMPACT; TREES	Guiding urban planners on the cooling returns of different configurations of urban vegetation is important to protect urban dwellers from adverse heat impacts. To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km(2) increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 degrees C (5 degrees C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales.

How significant is atmospheric metal contamination from mining activity adjacent to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area? A spatial analysis of metal concentrations using air trajectories models	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						HYSPLIT; Lake; Metal contamination; Metal spatial distribution; Enrichment factor; Extremely severe enrichment	MACQUARIE HARBOR; TRACE-ELEMENTS; HEAVY-METALS; SEDIMENTS; POLLUTION; ENRICHMENT; COPPER; WATER; ZINC; PB	This study investigated metal contamination from historical mining in lakes in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA) and surrounding region. The largest increase in sedimentation and metal contamination occurred ca. 1930 when open-cut mining commenced and new mining technology was introduced into the region. The geochemical signal of lake sediments changed from reflecting the underlying geology and lithology to that reflecting mining activities. The HYSPLIT air particle trajectory model explains metal distribution in the lakes, with those in the northwest region closest to the mines having the highest metal contamination. Lake metal concentrations since mining activities commenced are in the order: Owen Tarn > Basin Lake > Perched Lake > Lake Dove > Lake Dobson > Lake Cygnus, with Perched Lake and Lakes Dove, Dobson and Cygnus in the TWWHA. Metal contamination affected centres up to 130 km down-wind of mining sites. Enrichment factors (EF) for Pb, Cu, As and Cd are >1 for all lakes, with Owen Tarn and Basin Lake having very high EFs for Cu and Pb (98 and 91, respectively). Pb, Cu, As and Cd concentrations are above the Australia/New Zealand lower sediment guidelines, with Pb, Cu and As above the high guidelines in Owen Tarn and Basin Lake. This study demonstrated the legacy of metal contamination in the TWWHA by mining activities and the consequences of a lack of execution of environmental regulations by past governments in Tasmania.

This region abuts a fast-growing Dallas-Fort Worth urban area with increasing air quality concerns. Air quality information for 2011-2015 from two urban and three non-urban monitoring sites within the Barnett Shale region were analyzed to identify the spatial and temporal trends of volatile organic compounds (VOC) concentrations. The non-urban sites had higher mean concentrations of total non-methane organic compounds (TNMOC) at 123.6 ppb-C than 77.06 ppb-C at the urban sites. Alkanes, which includes ethane, propane and n-butane, were the dominant VOC group at all five monitoring sites, with 88% of TNMOC at urban sites and 95% at the non-urban sites. Alkenes, alkynes and aromatics composition at urban sites accounted for 3.96%, 0.72% and 4.72% of TNMOC, and at the non-urban sites these were 1.55%, 0.43% and 1.94%, respectively. Seasonal variations were noted in the VOC profiles with high concentrations during the winter months and low during summer months. The alkane/TNMOC ratio also showed a similar seasonal pattern, with a median value of 0.8 at the urban sites and 0.9 at non-urban sites. Alkene/TNMOC ratios were highest during the summer months, while alkyne/TNMOC ratios were highest during spring and low in winter, due to the influence of localized urban emissions. Higher concentrations of isoprene were measured at one of the urban sites as a result of biogenic emissions from nearby urban forests. Spatial and temporal analysis of measured VOC concentrations at ambient air monitoring stations in North Texas revealed strong influence of source regions with high oil and gas activities in close proximity.

Total Hg and methylmercury dynamics in a river-floodplain system in the Western Amazon: Influence of seasonality, organic matter and physical and chemical parameters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Hg; Floodplain; Stable isotopes; Organic matter; Methylation; Amazon	MERCURY METHYLATION; RIO-NEGRO; SEDIMENTS; CARBON; LAKE; WATER; NITROGEN; PLANKTON; IDENTIFICATION; GEOCHEMISTRY	Total mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) circulation in a connected river-floodplain system composed of two black water (a small forest river, igarape, and Cunia Lake) and a white water body (Madeira River), located in the Madeira River Basin were evaluated during the rising-water, early and late falling-water periods. We assessed organic matter (C and N composition, (C: N) a; and delta C-13 isotopic signature), and physical and chemical influences (pH, dissolved O-2, electric conductivity) in relationship to Hg and MeHg concentrations. Hg and MeHg concentrations in a sediment profile and three aquatic macrophytes (E. crassipes, E. azuera and Oryza sp.) were measured. Igarape and Cunia Lake showed higher Hg and MeHg concentrations (115-709; 10-25 ng g(-1)) in the suspended particulate matter compared (SPM) compared to the Madeira River (Hg: 5-16; MeHg: 0.2-0.3 ng g(-1)), partially independent of seasonality (p = 0.06). Total Hg had higher affinity for the SPM(1.75 times) than for dissolved organic matter. Organic matter characteristics correlated with MeHg concentrations (delta C-13 and (C: N) a; r(2) = 0.79; p < 0.0001), as well as physical and chemical parameters of the water column (dissolved O-2 and pH; r(2) = 0.80; p < 0.0001), demonstrating that physical and chemical changes between the river-floodplain system affect MeHg circulation and production. The inverse correlation of MeHg and SO42- concentrations (r(2) = 0.73; p < 0.0001) suggests the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Total Hg and MeHg concentrations as well as % MeHg were detected in the sediment profile (Hg: 24-51; MeHg: 0.6-3.2 ng g(-1); % MeHg: 1.8-6.2) and aquatic macrophytes (Hg: 1-30; MeHg: 0.3-7.5 ng g(-1); % MeHg: 1.6-33.7). We conclude that the highest Hg and MeHg concentrations in Cunia Lake, compared to the Madeira River, are due to the physical and chemical differences between these environments.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological and biochemical adjustments adopted by pomegranate (Punica granatum L. cv. Dente di cavallo) under realistic field conditions. One-year-old saplings were exposed to O-3 [two levels denoted as ambient (AO) and elevated (EO) O-3 concentrations] and salinity [S (salt, 50 mM NaCl)] for three consecutive months. No salt (NS) plants received distilled water. Despite the accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in the aboveground biomass, no evidence of visible injury due to salt (e.g. tip yellow-brown lesions) was found. The maintenance of leaf water status (i.e. unchanged values of electrolytic leakage and relative water content), the significant increase of abscisic acid, proline and starch content (+ 98, + 65 and + 59% compared to AO_NS) and stomatal closure (-24%) are suggested to act as adaptive mechanisms against salt stress in AO_S plants. By contrast, EO_NS plants were unable to protect cells against the negative impact of O-3, as confirmed by the reduction of the CO2 assimilation rate (-21%), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (+ 10 and + 225% of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide) and malondialdehyde by-product ( about 2-fold higher than AO_NS). Plants tried to preserve themselves from further oxidative damage by adopting some biochemical adjustments [i.e. increase in proline content (+41%) and induction of catalase activity (8-fold higher than in AO_NS)]. The interaction of the two stressors induced responses considerably different to those observed when each stressor was applied independently. An analysis of the antioxidant pool revealed that the biochemical adjustments adopted by P. granatum under EO_S conditions (e.g. reduction of total ascorbate; increased activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase) were not sufficient to ameliorate the O-3-induced oxidative stress.

We conceptualize a water-quality trend as an additive function of these two trend components. We found that for most of these records the water quality trends were more strongly affected by changes in watershed management as opposed to trends in streamflow. However, the importance of these trend components on water quality varied by estimate type (i.e. concentration versus load trends), parameter, and site. Trends in load were more influenced by changes in the streamflow regime than trends in concentration. Trends in major ions, salinity, and sediment were more sensitive to changes in streamflow than nutrients. When results were aggregated by site, 25% of the sites had at least 1 parameter where streamflow trends attributed >7.5% to the water quality trend for concentrations. For loads, this was the case for 66% of the sites. The findings of this work have important implications for the analysis of water-quality trends. Understanding the relative role of streamflow and management changes can help to isolate the effects of pollution control efforts on water quality and provide clearer understanding of progress, or lack thereof, towards water-quality goals.

This has aroused increasing interest in the use of correlates for biodiversity assessment and has demonstrated their reliability with respect to proxies based on environmental data alone. Although covar iation of species richness and composition in forests has been discussed in the literature, only a few studies have explored these elements in forest plantations, which are generally thought to be poor in biocliversity, being aimed at timber production. Based on this premise our aims were 1) to test if cross-taxon congruence across different groups of organisms (bacteria, vascular plants, mushrooms, ectomycorrhizae, mycelium, carabids, microarthropods, nematodes) is consistent in artificial stands; 2) to evaluate the strength of relationships due to the existing environmental gradients as expressed by abiotic and biotic factors (soil, spatial topographic, denclromeixic variables). Correlations between groups were studied with Mantel and partial Mantel tests, while variance partition analysis was applied to assess the relative effect of environmental variables on the robustness of observed relationships. Significant cross-taxon congruence was observed across almost all taxonomic groups pairs. However, only bacteria/mycelium and mushrooms/mycelium correlations remained significant after removing the environmental effect, suggesting that a strong abiotic influence drives species composition. Considering variation partitioning, the results highlighted the importance of bacteria as a potential indicator: bacteria were the taxonomic group with the highest compositional variance explained by the predictors used; furthermore, they proved to be involved in the only cases where the variance attributed solely to the pure effect of biotic or abiotic predictors was significant. Remarkably, the co-dependent effect of all predictors always explained the highest portion of total variation in all dependent taxa, testifying the intricate and dynamic interplay of environmental factors and biotic interactions in explaining cross-taxon congruence in forest plantations.

Social equity shapes zone-selection: Balancing aquatic biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services delivery in the transboundary Danube River Basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem-based management; Species distribution model; Ecosystem services; ARIES; Marxan with Zones; Model coupling	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; FRESH-WATER BIODIVERSITY; WORLDS; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; ACCURACY; NETWORK; SUPPORT; THREATS	Freshwater biodiversity is declining, despite national and international efforts to manage and protect freshwater ecosystems. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has been proposed as an approach that could more efficiently and adaptively balance ecological and societal needs. However, this raises the question of how social and ecological objectives can be included in an integrated management plan. Here, we present a generic model-coupling framework tailored to address this question for freshwater ecosystems, using three components: biodiversity, ecosystem services (ESS), and a spatial prioritisation that aims to balance the spatial representation of biodiversity and ESS supply and demand. We illustrate this model-coupling approach within the Danube River Basin using the spatially explicit, potential distribution of (i) 85 fish species as a surrogate for biodiversity as modelled using hierarchical Bayesian models, and (ii) four estimated ESS layers produced by the Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) platform (with ESS supply defined as carbon storage and flood regulation, and demand specified as recreation and water use). These are then used for (iii) a joint spatial prioritisation of biodiversity and ESS employing Marxan with Zones, laying out the spatial representation of multiple management zones. Given the transboundary setting of the Danube River Basin, we also run comparative analyses including the country-level purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) and each country's percent cover of the total basin area as potential cost factors, illustrating a scheme for balancing the share of establishing specific zones among countries. We demonstrate how emphasizing various biodiversity or ESS targets in an EBM model-coupling framework can be used to cost-effectively test various spatially explicit management options across a multi-national case study. We further discuss possible limitations, future developments, and requirements for effectively managing a balance between biodiversity and ESS supply and demand in freshwater ecosystems.

However, how urbanization affects personalities remains incompletely understood, especially because different urban stressors could affect personality traits in opposing ways, whereas most previous studies have considered only one urban disturbance factor. For instance, novel habitat features could favor reduced neophobia, whereas exposure to pollutants could increase risk sensitivity through neurotoxic or hormonal effects. To address this contingency, we studied object neophobia in four urban populations of great tits (Parus major) that vary in exposure to metal pollution and anthropogenic disturbance, as quantified by proximity to roads and pathways. We measured the return latency of incubating females when flushed from the nest and presented with up to two different novel objects, allowing quantification of behavioral repeatability and plasticity. To separate neophobia from sensitivity to disturbance, we also conducted baseline trials, in which females were flushed but no object was presented. We additionally measured exploration behavior and aggression (hissing) during nest defense, to explore whether suites of behaviors covary with urbanization, and examined whether neophobia affects reproductive success. Sensitivity to disturbance and neophobia were repeatable, and thus represent personality traits. Moreover, females occupying territories near roads and pathways had shorter return latencies during novel object but not baseline trials, suggesting a specific reduction in neophobia in disturbed areas. Plasticity in neophobia also increased with disturbance level. In contrast, metal exposure did not affect neophobia or sensitivity to disturbance, despite negatively correlating with exploration behavior. Neophobia correlated with exploration behavior, but not aggression or reproductive success. Results suggest that shifts in personality types in urbanized areas might involve specific reductions in neophobia, rather than general reductions in sensitivity to disturbance, and unexpectedly indicate no effect of toxic metals on risk sensitivity.

There is a need to better understand the influence of the surrounding landscape on farm wetlands to recommend land management options that minimize water quality impacts from agricultural practices. We tested hypothesized relationships between landscape structure and multiple water quality measures in farm drainage ditches in a multi-landscape study in Eastern Ontario, Canada. We measured physicochemical water quality (levels of atrazine, glyphosate, neonicotinoid insecticides, inorganic nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen), and biological water quality indicators (aquatic macroinvertebrate richness, leaf litter decomposition, and Ceriodaphnia dubia population responses) in 27 farm ditches, and measured the amounts of forest cover and high-intensity crop cover (landscape composition), and field edge cover (landscape configuration) in 1-km radius landscapes surrounding each ditch sampling site. We used confirmatory path analysis to simultaneously model the direct and indirect relationships between the landscape predictors and water quality variables. Landscape composition measures were the strongest predictors of water quality: pesticides decreased as surrounding forest cover increased, and nitrogen increased with increasing amounts of high-intensity crop cover. Crop cover was also indirectly negatively related to macroinvertebrate richness via its effects on nitrogen and dissolved oxygen. We found no effects of landscape configuration on agrichemical levels, but there was some support for a positive relationship between macroinvertebrate richness and field edge cover. Our results indicate that aquatic macroinvertebrate richness is strongly impacted by fertilizer use in our region, and that macroinvertebrate richness is a more sensitive biotic indicator of farmland water quality than leaf litter decomposition or C. dubia responses. We conclude that, in our region, landscape management to improve farmland water quality should focus primarily on landscape composition. Such management should aim to increase amounts of non-crop cover such as forest, and reduce amounts of crop cover with high agrichemical inputs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In spite of the increasing appreciation of jellyfish as an important component in marine ecosystem, there are still considerable gaps in understanding how the phase transition from the benthic polyp to the pelagicmedusa stage is influenced bymultiple environmental factors, including nutrition. To investigate survival, growth, and phase transition of Aurelia aurita polyps, we designed a factorial experiment manipulating food quantity (20 mu g C, 5 mu g C and 1.5 mu g C polyp-1 every other day), food quality (Artemia salina and two dietary manipulated Acartia tonsa), and temperature (13 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 27 degrees C). Temperaturewas the key factor determining phase transition of polyps and negatively affecting their survival rate and growth at 27 degrees C, which reflected a summer heatwave scenario. Furthermore, at polyps' optimum tolerance temperature (20 degrees C) in our study, budding reproduction benefits from high food concentrations. Interestingly, polyps fed with food containing high level highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) were able to compensate for physiological stress caused by the extreme temperature, and could enhance budding reproduction at optimumtemperature. Moreover, benthic-pelagic coupling (strobilation) was determined by temperature but affected significantly by food conditions. Mild temperature together with optimum food conditions contributes to inducing more polyps, which may potentially bring about great ephyrae recruitments during overwintering. In contrast, heatwave events can potentially regulate plankton community structure accompanied by changes of nutritional conditions of primary and secondary producers and thus, negatively affect the population dynamics of polyps. We suggest a novel polyp tolerance curve, which can help to understand jellyfish population dynamics in different seasons and ecosystems. This sets up a baseline for understanding how anticipated global warming and food conditions may affect the population size of benthic polyps and consequently pelagic medusae. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To prevent flood risks and channel migration on managed rivers, civil engineering techniques have been widely used. Recently, ecological restoration of rivers has become a major issue. However, given the alteration of natural disturbance regimes induced by human infrastructures, the real added-value of these restoration actions is questionable. Thus, a major challenge is to better understand whether changes in abiotic conditions induced by human activity influence the response of plant communities to environmental gradients. Studying a highly degraded large river, we evaluated the effect of the elevation and soil texture gradients on plant functional composition and assessed whether human-mediated environment gradients, achieved through maintenance and restoration measures, shape community structure. In the summer of 2017, we sampled 17 geomorphic surfaces, mostly gravel bars, along the Rhone River and its tributaries that were either repeatedly cleared (brush clearing vs plowing), newly reprofiled or naturally rejuvenated by high flows. The results show shifts in trait values with elevation and convergence in plant traitswith increasing proportion of fine sediments. The co-occurrence of species with contrasting traits was higher in highly disturbed environments, revealing the importance of rejuvenation processes. However, the influence of both environmental gradients was mediated by human activity. For maintenancemeasures, plowingwas better able to promote species diversity and limited biotic homogenization along environmental gradients. Among the three geomorphic surfaces, naturally rejuvenated barswere themost stressful environments, hosting distinct functional assemblages, while communities on newly reprofiled banks were in the same ecological trajectories as repeatedly cleared bars. To promote an effective ecological restoration of riparian zones, (i) a greater variability of the minimum flow is needed, (ii) bedload transport restoration should be a priority and (iii) reprofiled banks should better mimic the landforms of natural river margins.

Though significant scholarship has considered the limiting roles of resources and infrastructure, recent research has highlighted the importance of local learning and knowledge. Rather than being driven by forces exogenous to local communities, it is increasingly recognized that adaptation may be limited by perceptions and processes within them. Here, we explore knowledge production and adaptive response within a small-scale fishery in the central Gulf of California following system perturbation. Using mixed methods from the natural and social sciences, we (1) identify local drivers of social-ecological change, (2) document knowledge concerning their causes and consequences across a diverse group of small-scale fishermen, and (3) identify patterns of intracultural agreement and disagreement associated with divergent adaptive response. Results indicate that perceptions of social-ecological change were heterogeneous and that gear ownership and target species diversification were critical factors in determining the cultural models through which fishermen understood and responded to changes in the resource system. Unlike other user groups, owner-operator fishermen pursuing generalist livelihood strategies held consensus beliefs regarding changes to system structure and function and demonstrated increased ability to modify fishing tactics with the best practices for sustainable use. Our findings highlight how local knowledge can be used to assess the proximate impacts of external drivers of change and provide insight into the cultural models influencing in situ decision-making and adaptive response within modern fishery systems.

Summer habitat selection by ringed seals (Pusa hispida) in the drifting sea ice of the northern Barents Sea	POLAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Arctic; Svalbard; climate change; marginal ice zone; RSF; sea ice-associated marine mammals	PHOCA-HISPIDA; MARINE MAMMALS; POLAR COD; SVALBARD; POPULATION	Ringed seals are a central component of the Arctic ecosystem; they have a circumpolar distribution and are both important predators of lower trophic animals (invertebrates and fishes) and prey for polar bears and coastal human populations. They depend on sea ice for reproduction, moulting and resting, and they consume significant amounts of ice-associated prey. The population of ringed seals in Svalbard, Norway, uses both coastal and offshore habitats, the latter being important during seasonal migrations undertaken by some animals, mostly juveniles. This study examined habitat preferences of 18 satellite-tracked ringed seals (mostly young animals, but also a few adults) during late summer/autumn migrations to the drift ice in the northern Barents Sea. Resource selection functions showed that ringed seals preferred being close to the 50% sea-ice concentration threshold; a 120 km increase in the distance to the 50% sea-ice concentration threshold halved the probability of selection of a given area. In addition, higher sea-ice concentrations (80-100%) were between 1.4 and 2.2 times as likely to be selected as lower sea-ice concentrations or open water. Ringed seals use the marginal ice zone of the Barents Sea during - summer/autumn. This offshore habitat has shifted northward during recent decades, which is likely causing negative effects on ringed seals by increasing the energetic cost of offshore migrations.

We studied the effects of these two drivers on Ellisolandia elongate, an intertidal coralline algae that is known to host a rich biodiversity of associated fauna. We cultured turfs of E. elongate in experimental conditions of increased temperature and OA (using the values of the IPCC scenario RCP- 8.5 expected for 2100: actual mean temperature +3 degrees C and pH = 7.78), and estimated alteration of algal linear growth and community structure, focusing especially on peracarid crustaceans and annelids. Our findings revealed a decrease in linear growth, yet with no significant changes on structural integrity, and a simplification of associated community, in particular for peracarids. Our study contributes to understand community-level response to CC drivers, highlighting the vulnerability of the fauna associated to an important Mediterranean marine habitat.

We describe the nest and nesting behaviour of this species and investigate geographical variation in breeding traits in the genus using data from the literature, museum collections, and citizen science projects. We located 21 nests of the gray-headed tody-flycatcher, 13 of which we monitored. Nest height above the ground averaged 3.3 +/- 3.4 m (n = 21). Nests were built over a 16.8 +/- 5.6-day period (n = 6) by both adults. Clutch sizes ranged from two to three eggs, with a mean of 2.9 +/- 0.3 eggs (n = 10). Eggs measured 16.6 +/- 0.5 x 12.0 +/- 0.5 mm (n = 23) and weighed 1.1 +/- 0.1 g (n = 19). Mean incubation period was 17 days (n = 3) and mean nestling period was 15.5 days (n = 2). Apparent reproductive success was 30.8%, with predation being the primary cause of nest failure (46.1%). Mayfield's reproductive success was 25.9%, and daily survival rates for eggs and nestlings were 0.957 and 0.971, respectively. Clutch sizes increased with latitude, but temperature and precipitation seasonality had very low importance in explaining clutch size variation.

Our main aims were to describe the temporal distribution, seed damage, and notes on the natural history of these two species on their host plant. We hypothesised that: (a) healthy seeds from infested fruits would have worse germination rate than healthy seeds from noninfested fruits, and (b) females of seed beetles would lay more eggs on large fruits. We made field observations and an experimental field study with the presence of seed beetles versus their exclusion on plants. Results revealed that seed beetles are synchronised with fruiting, with a temporal partitioning in occurrence. Attacked seeds did not germinate, whereas healthy seeds from infested fruits had worse germination rate than healthy seeds from noninfested fruits. Females of seed beetles laid more eggs on large fruits. These results suggest that seed beetles avoid competition through a temporal partitioning curcial for their coexistence, and select large fruits to oviposit as these fruits probably provide more food resource for their offspring. Furthermore, plants might perceive seed beetles' damage and then reduce resource allocation on infested fruits.

Kilimanjaro	WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; SMALLHOLDER IRRIGATION; MT. KILIMANJARO; RIVER-BASIN; TANZANIA; CHAGGA; OPPORTUNITIES; RAINFALL; TRENDS; IMPACT	On the southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro like in many other regions in East Africa, agriculture strongly depends on irrigation. Water is supplied to farms by an extensive network of open unlined canals, most of them built centuries ago. However, information about the distribution of these irrigation canals and the dynamics of their discharge is rare thus hampering the implementation of sustainable solutions for agricultural water management. We suppose that several factors like topography, soil properties, shifts of cropping patterns, and weak institutions affect availability and management of agricultural water. Therefore, in this study we determined (i) the distribution of irrigation canals, (ii) their discharge patterns, and (iii) constraints to their sustainable management. Mixed-method approach consisting of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used. The discharge of canals was measured at 11 locations along an altitudinal gradient and selected canals were mapped to understanding their distribution, physical characteristics, and potential risks that limits their optimal discharge. Terrain attributes were derived from the Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and soil physical and hydraulic conductivity were measured to understand permeability and stability of the soil. Additionally, we conducted focus group discussions with participants from 15 villages and 10 key informants interviews. We found that during the dry season the discharge of canals was higher than in the short rainy season. The discharge of canals increased with decreasing elevation. The median daily discharges equaled 12.6, 9.5, and 7.0 l/s in the lower, mid and upper areas, respectively. Landscape in the central part of the study area was the steepest (slope > 60%) and the roughest (Topographic Ruggedness Index > 80 m). We attribute this to terrain heterogeneity across the landscape, thus community decisions about distribution and maintenance of canals could differ across different villages. Furthermore, current shifts of cropping patterns increased irrigation water demands. Both formal and informal water institutions were constrained with several challenges that affected overall management of canals and their sources. Findings of this study could contribute to various efforts dedicated to improve management of water resources around Mt. Kilimanjaro.

Fine-Scale Effects of Boat Moorings on Soft Sediment Communities Masked in Large-Scale Comparisons	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						moorings; soft sediment communities; monitoring; spatial variability; marine infrastructure; boating	ECOLOGICAL IMPACT; TAXONOMIC RESOLUTION; SUBTIDAL EPIBIOTA; URBAN STRUCTURES; OCEAN SPRAWL; MARINE; ASSEMBLAGES; POLLUTION; INFRASTRUCTURE; BIODIVERSITY	Population growth is driving the demand for recreational marine infrastructure, resulting in extensive coastal habitat modification. Boat moorings, for example, are popular for vessel storage and are known to damage seagrass communities, yet little is known about how they influence unvegetated sediment habitats. Here we investigate the effects of boat moorings on sediment infauna using metrics of community composition, diversity, total abundance and abundances of individual functional groups and dominant taxa. Metrics were compared at fine and larger spatial scales, to investigate how spatial variability affects the ecological assessments in soft-sedimentary environments. Fine-scale models revealed changes in community composition and mollusk abundance with the distance from moorings, while sediment grain size was also an important predictor for composition, bivalve and polychaete abundances, although the direction of effects varied. When the same metrics were compared at larger scales (i.e., boating infrastructure present or lacking) we found that spatial variability among locations was detected, but no effect for moorings. With increased urbanization and industrialization of coastal areas there is a clear need to account for the scale of potential ecological effects in investigations of coastal infrastructure developments.

While attention has been paid mostly to anthropogenic sources of MEK, recently it has been shown that biogenic sources are globally as important as anthropogenic ones. However, the origin of biogenic MEK has yet to be completely elucidated. We present the full mechanism by which within-plant transformation of methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and, to a minor extent, of 2-butanol and 3-buten-2-ol, is a source of biogenic MEK. Such transformation is observed in red oak for both exogenous MVK, taken up from the atmosphere, and endogenous MVK generated within a plant when it experiences stress (e.g. heat stress). Endogenous MVK emitted by plants is typically explained by within-plant oxidation of isoprene caused by oxidative stress. In this study we show that MVK and MEK emissions caused by heat stress are not related to isoprene in isoprene-emitting plants, implying that the massive carbon investment that plants commit to isoprene production is not explained by a direct antioxidant role. The presented mechanism can be important for inclusion in plant emission and in plant- atmosphere interaction models.

A Single Meal Containing Phytosterols Does Not Affect the Uptake or Tissue Distribution of Cholesterol in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						phytosterols; cholesterol; cholesterol uptake; zebrafish; aquaculture	BREAM SPARUS-AURATA; DIETARY PHYTOSTEROLS; LIPID-METABOLISM; LDL-CHOLESTEROL; BETA-SITOSTEROL; SOY SAPONINS; ABSORPTION; SOLUBILITY; LIVER; SITOSTANOL	Increased plant oil inclusion in aquaculture feeds has led to higher dietary phytosterol concentrations and speculation about whether this affects the metabolism and health of the fish. The mechanisms of cholesterol absorption and how phytosterols may affect this is unknown in fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to study the effects of phytosterols on the uptake and organ distribution of dietary cholesterol in fish. One meal of diets containing a constant addition of cholesterol (cold and [4-C-14] cholesterol) and varying types and concentrations of phytosterols were fed to fish in individual compartments. The fish were not previously conditioned on the experimental diets. Activity of C-14 was then measured in water and fish tissues to quantify the tissue distribution and excretion of cholesterol. There were no effects of the moderate dietary concentrations of phytosterols on the excretion or tissue distribution of dietary cholesterol 24 h after the meal.

Whilst there are calls for the indicators to be standardised, and criticism of the difficulties in applying them, little effort has been made to understand their scientific rationale. This article employs a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to investigate the use of environmental indicators from the Tianjin Eco-City Key Performance Indicators by the international scientific community working on urban sustainability. The findings draw a clear picture of the place of Tianjin Eco-City's indicators in the international scientific literature. China's ecological problems are found to attract interest not only from domestic researchers but also researchers outside the country. The indicators are used not only for urban planning and management but also for a wide range of urban-related and non-urban-related purposes. The scientific rationale of the eleven indicators is specifically addressed, revealing a number of underlying questions about the Tianjin Eco-City indicators. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Impacts of soil salinization are long lasting and impact agriculture productivity, reduce plant diversity and cause increase soil erosion due a reduction or loss in surface vegetation. Generally, remediation of saline soil relies on soil washing methods and phytoremediation to translocate salts below the rooting depth of plants. However, standard methods can often be unsuccessful as leached salts are able to return to the rooting zone through subsequent capillary rise in the soil. Surface application of iron (III) ferrocyanide has been used to remediate salt contaminated soil as the ferrocyanide complex induces salts to efflorescence at the soil surface as water evaporates rather than crystallising within the soil matrix. However, surface application of iron (III) ferrocyanide tends to be less successful in clay textured soil and does not workwell when subsequent reapplications of water are made for further salt removal. In this study we investigate a biomimetic approach to desalinate soil by mimicking the capillary transport mechanisms employed by vascular plants. Our approach uses evapotranspiration to translocate saline soil water above the soil surface where it is effloresced with ferrocyanides. After 30 days of treatment, the biomimetic approach used 2.1 pore volume equivalents of water and was able to reduce the concentration of salts from 8% (g.NaCl/g.soil) to 0.8% (g.NaCl/g.soil), resulting in a reduction of soil EC from 120mS/cm to 14 mS/cm. Our findings indicate that the method, with further refinement and expansion to field based trials, could be an effective tool to desalinate soil and reduce global soil salinization.

High fire severity causes partial or total removal of vegetation, reduction of soil aggregate stability and increased water repellency, which are associated with high runoff and erosion. The spatial connection among these runoff sources is an important factor to consider when evaluating fire-induced changes on hillslope and catchment hydrology, as fire generates connected areas of bare soil, which may increase hydrological connectivity and hence post-fire runoff and erosion. The aim of this studywas to quantify changes in hydrological connectivity and efficiency in two burned areas in central Mexico. By integrating rainfall simulation and spatial analysis, an index of connectivity (IC) and the lateral hydrological efficiency index (LHEI) were computed based on land/cover use, fire severity and topography within 287 burned sub-basins. Post-fire IC and LHEI were compared with the pre-fire scenario, and the relationship between LHEI and the proportion of burned area was assessed at the sub-basin level. Thresholds of the burned area per fire severity needed to increase LHEI were determined by a classification tree. The index of connectivity and LHEI were higher after wildland fires. The burned area was positively related with LHEI, and at least 43.3% of area burned with high severity is sufficient to produce the highest LHEI. The results are evidence of the effect of fire on hydrological connectivity and efficiency which adds to the understanding of fire-hydrology relations and can be used for integrated catchment management, ecological restoration and risk assessment.

However, there are few large-scale empirical studies on patterns of diversity and density of large old trees in human-dominated landscapes. We present the results of the first nationwide study in China to investigate the patterns of diversity and density of large old trees in human-dominated landscapes. We collated data on 682,730 large trees >= 100 years old from 198 Chinese regions to quantify tree species diversity, tree density and maximum tree age patterns. We modelled the effects of natural environmental variables (e.g. climate and topography) and anthropogenic variables (e.g. human population density and city age) on these measures. We found a low density of large old trees across study regions (0.36 trees/km(2)), and large variation in species richness among regions (ranging from 1 to 232 species). More than 95% of trees were <500 years old. The best fit models showed that: (1) Species diversity (species richness adjusted by region size) was positively associated with mean annual rainfall and city age; (2) Density of clustered trees, which are mostly remnants of ancient woods, was negatively influenced by human population density and rural population (% of total population). In contrast, the density of scattered trees, which are mostly managed by local people, was positively correlated with mean annual rainfall and human population density. To better protect large old trees in cities and other highly-populated areas, conservation policy should protect ancient wood remnants, mitigate the effects environmental change (e.g. habitat fragmentation), minimize the negative effects of human activities (e.g. logging), and mobilize citizens to participate in conservation activities (e.g. watering trees during droughts).

Along with industrial and economic growth related to oil sands development, environmental concerns have increased in recent decades, including those about potential effects on fish. We measured major and trace element concentrations in Trout-perch otoliths from the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers in the LAR, to illustrate spatial variations and identify possible industrial impacts. Both laser ablation ICP-MS and solution-based ICP-MS methods were employed. Of the trace elements enriched in bitumen (V, Ni, Mo and Re), only Ni and Re were above the limits of detection using at least one of the methods. The only significant differences in element concentrations between upstream and downstream locations were found for Li, Cu, and Pb which were more abundant upstream of industry. For comparison and additional perspective, otoliths from the same fish species, but taken from the Batchawana River in northern Ontario, were also examined. The fish from Alberta yielded greater concentrations of Ba, Bi, Li, Mg, Na, Re, Sc, Th and Y, but the Ontario fish had more Cr, Rb and Tl, likely because of differences in geology.

Assessment of biochar and zero-valent iron for in-situ remediation of chromated copper arsenate contaminated soil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Metal-contaminated soils; Soil remediation; Biochar; Zero-valent iron; Bioavailability; Whole-cell biosensors	PSEUDOMONAS-FLUORESCENS; HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM; BIOAVAILABLE COPPER; COMPOST AMENDMENTS; WOOD PRESERVATION; ZEROVALENT IRON; MOBILITY; CU; IMMOBILIZATION; STABILIZATION	Chromated copper arsenates (CCA) have been extensively used as wood impregnation agents in Europe and North America. Today, CCA contaminated sites remain abundant and pose environmental risks that need to be properly managed. Using a TRIAD approach that combined chemical, ecotoxicological and ecological assessment of soil quality, we investigated the abilities of biochar and zero-valent iron (ZVI) to remediate CCA contaminated soil in a microcosm experiment. Soil samples from a highly contaminated CCA site (1364, 1662 and 540 mu g g(-1) of As, Cu and Cr, respectively) were treated with two different biochars (fine and coarse particle size; 1% w w(-1)) and ZVI (5% w w(-1)), both as sole and as combined treatments, and incubated for 56 days at 15 degrees C. In general, bio-available As (As-bio) and Cu (Cu-bio) determined by whole-cell bacterial bioreporters corresponded well to water-extractable As and Cu (As-water and Cu-water). However, in biochar treatments, only Cu-bio and not Cu-water was significantly reduced. In contrast, under ZVI treatments only Cu-water and not Cu-bio was reduced, demonstrating the value of complementing analytical with bacterial bioreporter measurements to infer bioavailability of elements to soil microorganisms. The combined fine particle size biochar and ZVI treatment effectively reduced water extractable concentrations of Cr, Cu, and As on site by 45%, 45% and 43% respectively, and led to the highest ecological recovery of the soil bacterial community, as measured using the [H-3] leucine incorporation technique. We conclude that the combined application of biochar and ZVI as soil amendments holds promise for in-situ stabilization of CCA contaminated sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, only a few studies, with inconsistent results, have investigated the effects of PM2.5 exposure during early pregnancy. This study aims to evaluate the association between prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and CHDs occurrence. We selected 782 births reported to have CHDs between 2007 and 2014 from the Taiwanese Birth Registry and randomly selected 4692 controls without any birth defects using a population-based case-control design. Data of exposure to ambient air pollutants, mainly PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O-3 during weeks 3-8 of pregnancy were retrieved from air quality monitoring stations and interpolated to every township using ordinary kriging. We applied unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders to evaluate the associations. The results revealed a positive correlation between increased PM2.5 exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.03-1.42, per interquartile range change= 13.4 mu g/m(3)) during early pregnancy and overall CHDs occurrence. Furthermore, we found that atrial septal defect (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.01-2.02), endocardial cushion defect (aOR = 2.37, 95% CI= 1.01-5.58), and pulmonary artery and valve stenosis (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.06-2.78) were significantly associated with PM2.5 exposures. No similar effects were observed for the other air pollutants.

One such contaminant is the anxiolytic oxazepam, a psychoactive pharmaceutical that is frequently detected in surface waters globally. Despite growing interest in understanding how wildlife respond to anxiolytics, synergistic effects of pharmaceuticals and other abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. predation risk) stressors remain unclear. Here, using amulti-stressor approach, we investigated effects of 7-day oxazepam exposure (6.5 mu g/L) on anxiety-related behaviours in juvenile European perch (Perca fluviatilis). The multi-stressor approach was achieved by exposing perch to oxazepam at two temperatures (10 degrees C and 18 degrees C), and at two predation risk regimes-generated using chemical cues from the northern pike (Esox lucius). Our exposures resulted in a successful uptake of the drug from the water, i.e., oxazepam was measured in perch muscle tissue at 50 +/- 17 ng/g (mean +/- SD). We found significant oxazepam-induced effects on boldness, with 76.7% of the treated fish entering the white background (i.e. 'exposed' area where exposure to presumed risks are higher) within the first 5 min, compared to 66.6% of the control fish. We also found a significant effect of temperature on total time spent freezing (i. e. staying motionless). Specifically, fish in the low temperature treatments (oxazepam, predation) froze for longer than fish in high temperatures. Our multi-stressor study is the first to uncover how anxiety-related behaviours in wild juvenile fish are altered by changes in water temperature and perceived predation risk. Importantly, our findings highlight the need to focus on multiple stressors to improve understanding of how organisms not only survive, but adapt to, human-induced environmental change.

However, SS may have high concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTE), representing a potential risk for soil and the whole ecosystem. This paper was aimed to assess the toxicity of PTE in unfertile tropical soils amended with SS in a commercial Eucalyptus plantation, with an integrated multiple approaches combining: i) the use of a battery of bioassays (Daphnia magna, Pseudokcrichirella subcapitata, Lactuca sativa, and Allium cepa); and ii) the evaluation of some PTE (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and their availability into the pedoenvironment. Differences in total and available PTE between SS doses and time of treatments were evaluated using ANOVA; correlations between PTE and bioassays by a sparse partial robust M-regression (SPRM), while multiple correlations among parameters were performed by principal factor analysis (PFA). Results show that PTE contents in soils tended to increase with SS application doses. However this cannot be assumed as a general rule since in all the investigated treatments the PTE concentrations were consistently below both soil natural background concentrations and quality reference values. Bioassays showed a generalized low eco- and genotoxicity of SS with an increase in toxicity at increasing SS doses but with a clear decreasing trend as time went by. A. cepa was the most sensitive bioassay followed by P. subcapitata > D. magna > L. sativa. Overall, the results indicate that in realistic open field conditions SS risk may be lower than expected due to dynamic decrease in PTE toxicity with time after application. This study has an important implication that open-field trials should be strongly encouraged for evaluating environmental risk of SS application in forestry. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There is however, limited knowledge about the chemical composition and sources of street dust in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The total carbon (TC), nitrogen (TN), sulfur (TS) and the stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) contents of street dust sampled from 25 sites distributed across Kumasi (a metropolis in Ghana with a population of ca.2 million) were determined. In addition, black carbon (BC) and their subunits (soot and char) in these samples were also determined. The concentrations of TC, TN and TS in the dusts were 5-71 mg g(-1), 0.3-4.3 mg g(-1) and 0.2-1.4 mg g(-1), respectively. The concentrations of TC, TN and TS were higher than at the background site of the metropolis by a factor of 5.1 (range: 1.7-12), 3.9 (1.1-13) and 2.8 (0.7-5), respectively. The BC, char and soot concentrations in these samples averaged 1.6 mg g(-1) (0.13-4.4), 1.2 mg g(-1) (0.08-3.7) and 0.36 mg g(-1) (0.05-1.5), respectively. The concentrations of BC, char and soot in the street dust were higher than in the background location by factors of 5 (range: 0.8-13), 6 (0.7-17) and 3 (0.5-12), respectively. The TC, TN, TS, BC, soot and char concentrations were positively correlated with each other and with polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs, oxygenated PAHs and azaarenes from a previous study), indicating their common origin and fate. The delta C-13 values ranged from -27 to -24 [parts per thousand], with more polluted sites being more depleted in C-13. Based on the chemical composition of the street dusts, the 25 sites could be clustered into four groups by hierarchical cluster analysis which reflect areas of varying anthropogenic influence and, accordingly, exposure to hazardous chemicals.

Tradeoffs with Growth and Behavior for Captive Box Turtles Head-Started with Environmental Enrichment	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						antipredator behavior; behavioral assay; growth rate; captive-rearing; foraging behavior; Terrapene carolina	REINTRODUCTION; COMPLEXITY; EXPERIENCE; AMPHIBIANS; AVOIDANCE; SURVIVAL; REPTILES; WELFARE	Head-starting is a conservation strategy that entails releasing captive-reared animals into nature at sizes large enough to better resist post-release predation. However, efforts to maximize growth in captivity may jeopardize development of beneficial behaviors. Environmental enrichment can encourage natural behaviors before release but potentially comes with a tradeoff of reduced growth in complex enclosures. We compared growth and behavior of enriched and unenriched captive-born juvenile box turtles (Terrapene carolina). Enriched turtles grew slower than unenriched turtles during the first eight months in captivity, although growth rates did not differ between treatments from 9-20 months old. After five months post-hatching, unenriched turtles became and remained larger overall than enriched turtles. During two foraging tasks, unenriched turtles consumed more novel prey than enriched turtles. In a predator recognition test, eight-month-old enriched turtles avoided raccoon (Procyon lotor) urine more than unenriched turtles of the same age, but this difference was not apparent one year later. The odds of turtles emerging from a shelter did not differ between treatments regardless of age. Although our results suggest turtles raised in unenriched environments initially grew faster and obtained larger overall sizes than those in enriched conditions, tradeoffs with ecologically-relevant behaviors were either absent or conditional.

On coral reefs, the macroalga Lobophora is known to negatively impact coral recruitment, though the scales at which it affects coral larvae is unclear. We used aquarium experiments to mechanistically assess the response of larvae from 3 Acropora species to Lobophora at multiple spatial scales, and complemented these experiments with an analysis of the effects of Lobophora on Acropora spp. field recruitment patterns. The smallest scale (0-10 cm) focused on the effects of the distribution of Lobophora across an experimental tile, with settlement declining 60% for 2 of the species when a 15 cm(2) piece of Lobophora was distributed throughout a 100 cm(2) tile, compared to the control. The intermediate scale (5-15 cm) focused on the effects of increasing algal biomass on settlement, with settlement for all species negatively associated with algal biomass. Settlement decreased almost 50% in the highest treatment (6.2 g of Lobophora in the tanks), compared to the control. The mechanism of settlement inhibition was also tested at this scale, with waterborne compounds highlighted as a key settlement inhibitor. Lobophora also impaired overall settlement at the largest scale (0-100 cm), decreasing settlement by 40-50%, regardless of its location relative to the settlement substrate. Finally, Acropora field recruitment patterns also demonstrated a negative effect of Lobophora on coral recruitment in situ. Our results reveal the ability of Lobophora to inhibit coral settlement at multiple spatial scales, which may contribute to large-scale recruitment failure on coral reefs following disturbances.

Knowledge of connectivity patterns in marine populations is fundamental for defining population viability and progressing with management and conservation goals. Here, we developed a biophysical, individual-based larval dispersal model to assess the effect of oceanographic variability and biological traits (i.e. larval diel vertical migration [DVM] and temperature-dependent larval development [PLD]) on recruitment success, dispersal distance, and alongshore connectivity patterns. We selected 2 species exploited by Chilean artisanal fisheries: Loxechinus albus (PLD: 20 d) and Fissurella latimarginata (PLD: 5 d). A sensitivity analysis was used to examine the effect of intrinsic (DVM and PLD) and extrinsic (release depth, latitude, and timing) processes. Release location and timing of release explained respectively 24.30 and 5.54% (F. latimarginata) and 34.8 and 4.19% (L. albus) of the variability observed in recruitment success, and 23.80 and 6.94% (F. latimarginata) and 26.10 and 19.60% (L. albus) of the variability observed in dispersal distance. Most recruitment to local populations was allochthonous, presenting low levels of self-recruitment and local retention, including species with short PLD. Similar geographic patterns of source and destination strengths were observed in both species, showing a geographic mosaic of source and sink populations with relatively higher importance towards the northern region of the study area. Our findings allow us to identify primary determinants of recruitment success and dispersal distance for 2 important exploited species in Chile.

Grouping reduces the metabolic demand of a social squid	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Social facilitation; Metabolism; Group dynamics; Oxygen consumption; Hypoxia; Cephalopod; Squid	DOSIDICUS-GIGAS; OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION; HUMBOLDT SQUID; JUMBO SQUID; BEHAVIOR; CEPHALOPODA; CALIFORNIA; JUVENILE; HYPOXIA; COSTS	Many squids are social cephalopods and demonstrate exceptionally high metabolic rates. However, all prior investigations of metabolism in social cephalopods have utilized individual animals. We measured oxygen consumption of the social squid Doryteuthis opalescens both in groups and with solitary individuals to examine the influence of grouping on energy demand and performance under hypoxic conditions. On average, the presence of conspecifics reduced routine metabolic rate by 21% but did not influence the critical oxygen partial pressure below which a stable rate of oxygen uptake is not maintained. In addition, displays of chromatic behaviors associated with relaxation were observed more frequently in groups, whereas behaviors associated with stress or vigilance were observed more frequently in solitary individuals. We hypothesize that through a potential reduction in energy consumption, grouping may be relevant in allowing social squids to exploit habitats with marginal oxygen availability that may impose a physiological constraint.

Environmental and demographic factors influence the spatial genetic structure of an intertidal barnacle in central-northern Chile	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Notochthamalus scabrosus; Seascape genetics; Larval dispersal; Coastal oceanography; Marine connectivity	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; LARVAL DISPERSAL; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SEASCAPE GENETICS; NOTOCHTHAMALUS-SCABROSUS; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; COASTAL TOPOGRAPHY; TEMPORAL VARIATION; ALLELE FREQUENCY	Understanding the multiplicity of processes producing genetic patterns in natural populations can shed light on the ecology and evolution of species, and help guide effective management and conservation strategies. Here we investigated the role of environmental, demographic, and geographic factors in shaping the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation of the intertidal barnacle Notochthamalus scabrosus along the central-northern coast of Chile (28-34 degrees S). We analyzed genetic data from 7 microsatellite loci genotyped for 300 individuals sampled from 10 sites and combined this information with 8 site-specific environmental (4), demographic (2), and geographic (2) variables using least squares linear regressions, generalized linear models, and matrix regression analyses. We found a strong association between the spatially structured genetic diversity of N. scabrosus and patterns of temporal variability in chlorophyll a, and among-site differences in seawater temperature and adult abundance. Our results illustrate that population size, partly driven by recruitment success, can leave a signal on genetic structure of this highly dispersive marine species. The significant effect of temperature and chlorophyll a stresses that local adaptation may be key to understanding the spatial genetic structure of our model species. Hence, the results of this work represent an advance towards understanding the usually complex causal relationships between environmental variables, gene flow, and genetic diversity patterns of coastal populations.

Global baselines and benchmarks for fish biomass: comparing remote reefs and fisheries closures	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Baselines; Coral reef fish; Fisheries and ecological indicators; Pristine or virgin biomass; Sustainability	MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; CORAL; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; RECOVERY; EXPLOITATION; DEGRADATION; ASSEMBLAGES	Baselines and benchmarks (B&Bs) are needed to evaluate the ecological status and fisheries potential of coral reefs. B&Bs may depend on habitat features and energetic limitations that constrain biomass within the natural variability of the environment and fish behaviors. To evaluate if broad B&Bs exist, we compiled data on the biomass of fishes in similar to 1000 reefs with no recent history of fishing in 19 ecoregions. These reefs spanned the full longitude and latitude of Indian and Pacific Ocean reefs and included older high-compliance fisheries closures (>15 yr closure) and remote reef areas (>9 h travel time from fisheries markets). There was no significant change in biomass over the 15 to 48 yr closure period but closures had only similar to 40% of the biomass (740 kg ha(-1), lower confidence interval [LCI] = 660 kg ha(-1), upper confidence interval [UCI] = 810 kg ha(-1), n = 157) of remote tropical reefs (1870 [1730, 2000] kg ha(-1), n = 503). Remote subtropical reefs had lower biomass (950 [860, 1040] kg ha(-1), n = 329) than tropical reefs. Closures and remote reef fish biomass responded differently to environmental variables of coral cover, net primary productivity, and light, indicating that remote reefs are more limited by productivity and habitat than closures. Closures in fished seascapes are unlikely to achieve the biomass and community composition of remote reefs, which suggests fisheries benchmarks will differ substantially from wilderness baselines. A fishery benchmark (B-0) of similar to 1000 kg ha(-1) adjusted for geography is suggested for fisheries purposes. For ecological purposes, a wilderness baseline of similar to 1900 kg ha(-1) is appropriate for including large and mobile species not well protected by closures.

Here, we combined citizen science with remote sensing to learn about environmental and biological factors that explain fine-scale distribution of Weddell seal haul-outs in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. We employed the crowd-sourcing platform Tomnod (DigitalGlobe) to host high-resolution (similar to 0.5-0.6 m) satellite imagery of the Antarctic fast ice during November in 2010 and 2011 and asked volunteers to identify seals on images. We created a 5 km x 5 km grid of seal presence per year, and modeled habitat suitability for seals using a generalized linear model. The top Ross Sea-wide model that best explained seal presence included proximity to fast-ice cracks, deep water, and emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri colonies. This model also revealed that seal presence decreased with proximity to Adelie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae colonies and size of the nearest emperor penguin colony, suggesting the potential for trophic competitive exclusion by large penguin colonies. With respect to 3 sub-regions within the Ross Sea (North and South Victoria Land in the western Ross Sea, and Marie Byrd Land in the east), we found that 3 habitat variables differed in their effects among sub-regions: proximity to emperor penguin colonies, proximity to deep water, and relative ice width. Our results represent a step toward effectively monitoring Weddell seal population trends, and disentangling biological and environmental factors influencing locations of Weddell seal haul-outs around Antarctica.

To contribute to a better understanding of these challenges, we describe here part of a large-scale seagrass restoration program conducted in a Marine Park in Portugal. The goal of this study was to infer if it was possible to recover seagrass habitat in this region, in order to restore its ecosystem functions. To infer which methods would produce better long term persistence to recover seagrass habitat, three factors were assessed: donor seagrass species, transplant season, source location. Monitoring was done three times a year for 8 years, in which areas and densities of the planted units were measured, to assess survival and growth. The best results were obtained with the species Zostera marina transplanted during spring and summer as compared to Zostera noltii and Cymodocea nodosa. Long-term persistence of established (well rooted) transplants was mainly affected by extreme winter storms but there was evidence of fish grazing effects also. Our results indicate that persistence assessments should be done in the long term, as all transplants were successful (survived and grew initially) in the short term, but were not resistant in the long term after a winter with exceptionally strong storms. The interesting observation that only the largest (11 m(2)) transplanted plot of Z marina persisted over a long time, increasing to 103 m(2) in 8 years, overcoming storms and grazing, raised the hypothesis that for a successful shift to a vegetated state it might be necessary to overpass a minimum critical size or tipping point. This hypothesis was therefore tested with replicates from two donor populations and results showed effects of size and donor population, as only the larger planting units (PUs) from one donor population persisted and expanded. It is recommended that in future habitat restoration efforts large PUs are considered.

Winter home range and habitat selection differs among breeding populations of herring gulls in eastern North America	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bird; Non-breeding; Home range; Habitat use; Tracking	LARUS-ARGENTATUS; GREAT-LAKES; ADULT SURVIVAL; ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; WITLESS BAY; EGGS; TRENDS; DIET; CONTAMINANTS; NEWFOUNDLAND	Background: Recognizing the factors influencing migratory individuals throughout their annual cycle is important for understanding the drivers of population dynamics. Previous studies have found that Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) in the Atlantic region have lower survival rates than those in the Great Lakes and the Arctic. One possible explanation for divergent survival rates among these populations is differences in their non-breeding habitats. Methods: We tracked Herring Gulls from five populations, breeding in the eastern Arctic, the Great Lakes, Newfoundland, Sable Island, and the Bay of Fundy. We assessed the extent of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering sites, and tested if there were differences in home range size or habitat selection among these populations during the winter. Results: The tracked Herring Gulls had strong migratory connectivity between their breeding and wintering areas. We found that Herring Gulls from the Arctic spent most of the winter in marine habitats, while the other populations used a wider variety of habitats. However, the Newfoundland and Sable Island populations selected for urban habitats, and almost all individuals the specialized in urban habitats came from one of the three Atlantic populations. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there could potentially be a link between urban habitat use during the winter and reduced adult survival in Atlantic Canada Herring Gulls.

We also used reconstructions of in-lake nutrients concentrations, air temperature fluctuations, and sedimentary organic matter dynamics to study impacts of past environmental and climatic changes on MOB community composition. DNA preservation in lake sediments is sufficient, and qPCR amplification was successfully applied to the analysis of MOB aDNA. Temporal changes in MOB community showed different patterns between lakes, and drivers of past MOB dynamics slightly differed between lakes and among MOB groups. Overall, MOB developments were generally correlated to proxies of organic matter quality/quantity and climate data. Moreover, our results could emphasize the importance of nutrients availability in structuring MOB community, and the higher ability of MOB type 2 to access nutrients under nitrogen/nutrients limited conditions. Therefore, our study provides an operational and time-effective method to reconstruct past CH4 oxidation in lakes and could help to identify the driving factors of past temporal dynamics of MOB community.

Food shortages are often assumed to be driven by reduced total food abundance, but here we propose that climate change may cause short-term food shortages for foraging specialists without affecting overall food availability. We frame this hypothesis around the special case of birds that forage on flying insects for whom effects mediated by their shared food resource have been proposed to cause avian aerial insectivores' decline worldwide. Flying insects are inactive during cold, wet or windy conditions, effectively reducing food availability to zero even if insect abundance remains otherwise unchanged. Using long-term monitoring data from a declining population of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), we show that nestlings' body mass declined substantially from 1977 to 2017. In 2017, nestlings had lower body mass if it rained during the preceding 3 days, though females increased provisioning rates, potentially in an attempt to compensate. Adult body mass, particularly that of the males, has also declined over the long-term study. Mean rainfall during the nestling period has increased by 9.3 +/- 0.3 mm decade(-1), potentially explaining declining nestling body mass and population declines. Therefore, we suggest that reduced food availability, distinct from food abundance, may be an important and previously overlooked consequence of climate change, which could be affecting populations of species that specialize on foraging on flying insects.

Narrow habitat breadth and late-summer emergence increases extinction vulnerability in Central European bees	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						bee life-history traits; Bayesian hierarchical models; Central Europe; Red List; extinction vulnerability	FORAGING RANGES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SENSITIVITY; IMPACTS	Evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic traits that predispose species to local extinction is important for targeting conservation efforts. Among the species of special concern in Europe are bees, which, along with butterflies, are the best monitored insects. Bees are most species-rich in Mediterranean-type climates with short winters, warm springs, and dry summers. In Central Europe, climate warming per se is, therefore, expected to benefit most bee species, while pesticides and the loss of habitats and plant diversity should constitute threats. Here, we use the bee fauna of Germany, which has been monitored for Red Lists for over 40 years, to analyse the effects of habitat breadth, pollen specialization, body size, nesting sites, sociality, duration of flight activity, and time of emergence during the season. We tested each factor's predictive power against changes in commonness and Red List status, using phylogenetically informed hierarchical Bayesian (HB) models. Extinction vulnerability is strongly increased in bees flying in late summer, with a statistical model that included flight time, habitat preference, and duration of activity correctly predicting the vulnerability status of 85% of the species. Conversely, spring emergence and occurrence in urban areas each reduce vulnerability, pointing to intensive land use especially harming summer-active bees, with the combination of these factors currently shifting Germany's bee diversity towards warm-adapted, spring-flying, city-dwelling species.

As the resident queen can be killed during this process, host colonies may lose their entire future reproductive output. Selection thus favours the evolution of defence mechanisms, before and after parasite intrusion. Most studies on social parasites focus on host worker discrimination of parasite queens and their offspring. However, ant larvae can also influence brood composition by consuming eggs. This raises the question whether host larvae can aid in preventing colony takeover by consuming eggs laid by parasite queens. To test whether larvae could play a role in anti-parasite defence, we compared the rates at which larvae of a common host species, Formica fusca, consumed eggs laid by social parasite, non-parasite, nest-mate, or conspecific non-nest-mate queens. Larvae consumed social parasite eggs more than eggs laid by a heterospecific non-parasite queen, irrespective of the chemical distance between the egg cuticular profiles. Also, larvae consumed eggs laid by conspecific non-nest-mate queens more than those laid by nest-mate queens. Our study suggests that larvae may act as players in colony defence against social parasitism, and that social parasitism is a key factor shaping discrimination behaviour in ants.

The demise of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks constitutes a text book example of the consequences of overexploiting marine living resources, yet the drivers of these nearly synchronous collapses are still debated. Moreover, it is still unclear why rebuilding of collapsed fish stocks such as cod is often slow or absent. Here, we apply the stochastic cusp model, based on catastrophe theory, and show that collapse and recovery of cod stocks are potentially driven by the specific interaction between exploitation pressure and environmental drivers. Our statistical modelling study demonstrates that for most of the cod stocks, ocean warming could induce a nonlinear discontinuous relationship between fishing pressure and stock size, which would explain hysteresis in their response to reduced exploitation pressure. Our study suggests further that a continuing increase in ocean temperatures will probably limit productivity and hence future fishing opportunities for most cod stocks of the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, our study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the importance of climate and fishing effects on commercially exploited fish stocks, highlighting the importance of considering discontinuous dynamics in holistic ecosystem-based management approaches, particularly under climate change.

Transmission typically occurs indirectly via environmental exposure, with devastating consequences for human and animal health, as well as pastoralist economies. India has a high annual occurrence of anthrax in some regions, but a country-wide delineation of risk has not yet been undertaken. The current study modelled the geographical suitability of anthrax across India and its associated environmental features using a biogeographic application of machine learning. Both biotic and abiotic features contributed to risk across multiple scales of influence. The elephant-livestock interface was the dominant feature in delineating anthrax suitability. In addition, water-soil balance, soil chemistry and historical forest loss were also influential. These findings suggest that the elephant-livestock interface plays an important role in the cycling of anthrax in India. Livestock prevention efforts targeting this interface, particularly within anthropogenic ecotones, may yield successes in reducing ongoing transmission between animal hosts and subsequent zoonotic transmission to humans.

For this, animal venoms represent ideal study systems: they are complex, variable, yet easily quantifiable molecular phenotypes with a clear function. Rattlesnakes display tremendous variation in their venom composition, mostly through strongly dichotomous venom strategies, which may even coexist within a single species. Here, through dense, widespread population-level sampling of the Mojave rattlesnake, Crotalus scutulatus, we show that genomic structural variation at multiple loci underlies extreme geographical variation in venom composition, which is maintained despite extensive gene flow. Unexpectedly, neither diet composition nor neutral population structure explain venom variation. Instead, venom divergence is strongly correlated with environmental conditions. Individual toxin genes correlate with distinct environmental factors, suggesting that different selective pressures can act on individual loci independently of their co-expression patterns or genomic proximity. Our results challenge common assumptions about diet composition as the key selective driver of snake venom evolution and emphasize how the interplay between genomic architecture and local-scale spatial heterogeneity in selective pressures may facilitate the retention of adaptive functional polymorphisms across a continuous space.

However, our understanding of this history remains limited because regenerative ability has only been evaluated in a tiny fraction of species. Available comparative regeneration studies have identified losses of regenerative ability, yet clear documentation of gains is lacking. We assessed ability to regenerate heads and tails either through our own experiments or from literature reports for 35 species of Nemertea spanning the diversity of the phylum, including representatives of 10 families and all three orders. We generated a phylogenetic framework using sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of head and tail regenerative ability across the phylum and found that all evaluated species can remake a posterior end but surprisingly few could regenerate a complete head. Our analysis reconstructs a nemertean ancestor unable to regenerate a head and indicates independent gains of head regenerative ability in at least four separate lineages, with one of these gains taking place as recently as the last 10-15 Myr. Our study highlights nemerteans as a valuable group for studying evolution of regeneration and identifying mechanisms associated with repeated gains of regenerative ability.

Cross-Shelf Variation in Coral Community Response to Disturbance on the Great Barrier Reef	DIVERSITY-BASEL			English	Article						Acropora; benthic assemblages; chronic stressor; disassembly; disturbance; Great Barrier Reef; hard coral cover; reassembly	WATER-QUALITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; RECOVERY; BIODIVERSITY; RESILIENCE; PATTERNS; COVER; RATES	Changes in coral reef health and status are commonly reported using hard coral cover, however such changes may also lead to substantial shifts in coral community composition. Here we assess the extent to which coral communities departed from their pre-disturbance composition following disturbance (disassembly), and reassembled during recovery (reassembly) along an environmental gradient across the continental shelf on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. We show that for similar differences in coral cover, both disassembly and reassembly were greater on inshore reefs than mid- or outer-shelf reefs. This pattern was mostly explained by spatial variation in the pre-disturbance community composition, of which 28% was associated with chronic stressors related to water quality (e.g., light attenuation, concentrations of suspended sediments and chlorophyll). Tropical cyclones exacerbated the magnitude of community disassembly, but did not vary significantly among shelf positions. On the outer shelf, the main indicator taxa (tabulate Acropora) were mostly responsible for community dissimilarity, whereas contribution to dissimilarity was distributed across many taxa on the inner shelf. Our results highlight that community dynamics are not well captured by aggregated indices such as coral cover alone, and that the response of ecological communities to disturbance depends on their composition and exposure to chronic stressors.

Effect of Various Natural Dissolved Organic Carbon on Copper Lability and Toxicity to the Tropical Freshwater Microalga Chlorella sp.	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TETRA PARACHEIRODON-AXELRODI; BIOTIC LIGAND MODEL; MATTER SOURCE; CHEMICAL-EQUILIBRIUM; METAL SPECIATION; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; TRACE-METALS; FISH GILLS; THIN-FILMS; BINDING	This study adds further critical information to the limited body of knowledge on the ameliorative ability of Australian dissolved organic carbon (DOC), reinforcing the importance of DOC source and concentration as significant factors controlling the risk copper poses to organisms in freshwater systems. The ameliorative ability of five unstudied DOCs on the chronic toxicity of copper to the tropical alga Chlorella sp. was compared. Sensitivity to copper varied dramatically; effect concentrations at the 50 percent effect level (EC50) increased by up to 22-fold in the high DOC treatment compared to controls and more than 2-fold between DOCs at the same concentration. The analytical techniques, diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and Chelex column, were used to understand whether differences in copper toxicity could be explained by copper lability. Labile copper mirrored the trends seen in the toxicity tests; lability decreased with increasing DOC concentration and varied between DOCs at the same concentration. The equilibrium model, WHAM VII, was also used to better understand the role of the free copper ion on the toxicity observed. Disagreement between EC50 values derived using the WHAM-predicted free Cu2+ concentrations and agreement between DGT-labile and the maximum dynamic concentration (c(max)(dyn)) suggest free copper is not the sole contributor to toxicity and that the source of the specific DOCs also plays a role.

Safely Managed Hygiene: A Risk-Based Assessment of Handwashing Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							HAND SURFACE-AREA; FELINE CALICIVIRUS; DRINKING-WATER; EFFICACY; SOAP; CONTAMINATION; CHILDREN; AGENTS; HARARE; INTERVENTIONS	Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 6.2.1 requires household handwashing facilities to have soap and water, but there are no guidelines for handwashing water quality. In contrast, drinking water quality guidelines are defined: water must be "free from contamination" to be defined as "safely managed" (SDG Indicator 6.1.1). We modeled the hypothesized mechanism of infection due to contaminated handwashing water to inform risk-based guidelines for microbial quality of handwashing water. We defined two scenarios that should not occur: (1) if handwashing caused fecal contamination, indicated using Escherichia coli, on a person's hands to increase rather than decrease and (2) if hand-to-mouth contacts following handwashing caused an infection risk greater than an acceptable threshold. We found water containing <1000 E. soli colony-forming units (CFU) per 100 mL removes E. coli from hands with>99.9% probability. However, for the annual probability of infection to be <1:1000, handwashing water must contain <2 x 10(-6) focus-forming units of rotavirus, <1 x 10(-4) CFU of Vibrio cholerae, and <9 x 10(-6) Cryptosporidium oocysts per 100 mL. Our model suggests that handwashing with nonpotable water will generally reduce fecal contamination on hands but may be unable to lower the annual probability of infection risks from hand-to-mouth contacts below 1:1000.

The effects of salinity are manifold, making it difficult to summarize for risk assessments. In this study, we separated and quantified the multiple effects of salinity on cadmium (Cd) in a toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic framework. The estuarine clam, Potamocorbula laevis, was used as a model organism. Cd bioaccumulation was measured using a stable-isotope-tracer technique; in parallel, toxicity tests were conducted. With the increase of salinity from 5 to 30, Cd uptake decreased monotonically. In contrast, the intrinsic sensitivity of organisms, measured by the toxicodynamic parameters, reached its minimum at intermediate salinities (i.e., 10 to 20). The overall salinity effects were dominated by the effects on Cd bioaccumulation; therefore, Cd toxicity decreased monotonically with the increases of salinity. The mode developed in this study could provide predictions of no-effect concentration (1.7 to 34.9 mu g L-1, end point mortality) and the median lethal concentration (LC50) of Cd at different salinities. In conclusion, we developed a framework for quantifying the multiple effects of salinity and a method for estimating no-effect concentration from acute toxicity tests, which can be used for better assessments of metal risks in estuarine waters.

Here we studied genetic mechanisms driving parasite resistance in a large herbivore through a comprehensive approach combining measurements of neutral (16 microsatellites) and adaptive (MHC DRB1 exon 2) genetic diversity and two types of gastrointestinal parasites (nematodes and coccidia).ResultsWhile accounting for other extrinsic and intrinsic predictors known to impact parasite load, we show that both neutral genetic diversity and DRB1 are associated with resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes. Intermediate levels of multi-locus heterozygosity maximized nematodes resistance, suggesting that both in- and outbreeding depression might occur in the population. DRB1 heterozygosity and specific alleles effects were detected, suggesting the occurrence of heterozygote advantage, rare-allele effects and/or fluctuating selection. On the contrary, no association was detected between genetic diversity and resistance to coccidia, indicating that different parasite classes are impacted by different genetic drivers.ConclusionsThis study provides important insights for large herbivores and wild sheep pathogen management, and in particular suggests that factors likely to impact genetic diversity and allelic frequencies, including global changes, arealso expected to impact parasite resistance.

We know very little about how or why people choose amphibians as pets, but amphibian owners share large numbers of videos on freely accessible platforms, such as YouTube. We aimed to use videos of captive amphibians to determine which species are kept, their life-history stage and the types of videos uploaded. We watched and categorized 1,162 videos by video type, type of amphibian behavior and amphibian taxonomy (superfamily, family, and species). We used data on the amphibian trade from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), on conservation status from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, and on potential environmental impact from published Environmental Impact Classification of Alien Taxa (EICAT) records, to determine potential conflicts of owning pet amphibians. We recorded 173 captive species in 847 videos with a taxonomic overrepresentation of salamandroids and pipoids, and an underrepresentation of ranoids and plethodontoids. When compared to videos of wild amphibian species, videos of captive animals featured disproportionate amounts of adults feeding, being handled and moving. The videos watched had a smaller proportion of threatened amphibian species, but a higher proportion of invasive species, than would be expected by chance, with the proportion present in CITES appendices (18%) being non-significant. We suggest that such data can be used to profile potential pets for trade and attempt to avoid conflicts with threatened and highly impacting alien species.

Sludge is mechanically separated by drum filters and disposed of to the detriment of overall system water budgets. Dissolved nitrogen compounds are reduced via nitrification-denitrification filters, requiring commercial external carbon sources. The reuse of sludge after ozone pre-treatment may represent the next step in RAS optimization. The present study analyzes the content of sludge from RAS and tests ozonation as a pre-treatment for recycling as carbon source. The dissociative effect of ozone and the physicochemical changes due to ozonation lead to a significant increase in soluble carbon availability. Predominantly long-chain fatty acid (FA) (saturated and unsaturated) with 16 and 18 carbon atoms independently of the treatment were found in the profiles. Saturated FA concentrations in solution increased after 20, 40, and 60 min ozonation. The solid content of the sludge was practically unaffected by ozonation in terms of FA profile: only saturated FA slightly increases after 40 min treatment. The implications of these findings for denitrifying bacteria are discussed.

Biomass Recovery Method for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Quantification Following UV Disinfection	OZONE-SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Adenosine triphosphate (ATP); coliforms; disinfection efficacy; luminase; microbial enumeration; UV disinfection; viable but nonculturable	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; WATER; IRRADIATION; QUALITY	A biomass recovery method was developed to monitor UV disinfection efficacy using adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Typically, disinfection monitoring at wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) involves quantifying fecal and total coliforms or colony forming units, the results of which take a minimum of 24 h to produce. ATP quantification immediately before and after UV treatment, which takes only minutes, shows little reduction and often an increase in the microbial population since UV irradiation results in cells that are viable (i.e., still producing ATP) but not culturable. To overcome this, our biomass recovery method incorporates an incubation step to encourage life cycling of microbes. Average log reductions in cellular ATP (cATP) were found to be -0.28 +/- 0.19, -0.011 +/- 0.153, -0.17 +/- 0.32, and 0.065 +/- 0.074 using direct ATP measurements on UV-treated samples from WWTFs A, B, C, and D, respectively, while those using the recovery method were correspondingly 0.17 +/- 0.34, 1.8 +/- 0.8, 0.20 +/- 0.35, and 0.72 +/- 0.26. The response of the biomass recovery-ATP method indicated a significant direct correlation to the microbial population reduction observed in heterotrophic plate count (HPC) and Colilert (R) methods using both pure Escherichia coli culture and secondary municipal wastewater effluent.

In this study, methane emissions from a currently in-use Spanish landfill were modeled as well as being experimentally measured using a two-step method. The first step involved a qualitative walkover survey to detect where gases were being emitted on the surface of the landfill. The second stage comprised a quantitative analysis of these surface methane emissions at a selected number of points on the landfill surface using a specially designed flux chamber. The statistical analysis of the data obtained was based on the Sichel function and resulted in an average emission rate of 74.9 g.m(-2).day(-1), with 27.8 and 202.1 g.m(-2).day(-1) as the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval, respectively. The total emission for the landfill, with an emitting surface of 335,000 m(2), is 9.16 x 10(3) ton/yr. These values have been compared with those from three different models, with the model results being above the calculated mean emissions measured at the landfill, but below the upper confidence limit at 95%. Implications: One of the main environmental problems arising from the presence of landfills is the emission of biogas (which mainly contains methane and carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere. Several experimental methods as well as models have been developed to quantify these emissions.

Investigating the geomorphic characteristics of an Amazonian headwater stream draining a paramo ecosystem	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Paramo; Andes; hydraulic geometry; fluvial geomorphology; headwater streams	SCALE CHANNEL GEOMETRY; HYDRAULIC GEOMETRY; PINE PLANTATIONS; LAND-USE; RIVER; GRASSLANDS; WATER; CLASSIFICATION; NORTHERN; POOL	Paramos are neotropical alpine grasslands located in the northern Andes of South America. Although they cover important headwater regions, little is known about the hydro-geomorphic characteristics of paramo river systems, which are increasingly being impacted by human use and climate change. The objective of this research is to characterize the geomorphology of the Ningar River, Ecuador, an Amazonian headwater river that drains a 22.7 km2 paramo sub-basin, by (1) classifying the geomorphology based on common geomorphic classifications, (2) deriving downstream hydraulic geometry relationships, and (3) performing a global comparison with mountain river systems. Common geomorphic field surveying techniques were used to acquire the necessary data. Results suggest that the Ningar River has similar form-function characteristics as other known mountain headwater streams and corresponds to commonly known stream classification systems, but displays more of an alluvial character than might be expected for montane headwater streams as a result of a convexity in the stream's longitudinal profile. Additionally, preliminary analyses suggest that other paramo headwater streams may exhibit similar characteristics; thus, the findings of this research are important for future management and protection of these valuable headwater ecosystems.

Its capacity to deliver these outcomes is challenging, particularly for marginalized groups. This is especially true if the introduction of novel technologies is applied with incomplete understanding of socio-economic and bio-physical contexts. We examined what socio-economic factors affect people's perceptions of adoption of lobster aquaculture in rural households in Indonesia. We used multiple linear regression with model averaging to test the influence of five capital assets (human, social, natural, physical, and financial), including agency, equity, and household sensitivity, on people's perceived ability to adopt lobster aquaculture. Agency and sensitivity had the greatest influence on the dependent variable. We then used correlation analysis to develop a heuristic model of potential indirect causal mechanisms affecting people's perceptions of adoption. Our results point to the existence of a sensitivity trap', where more sensitive or marginalized households are less likely to engage in new economic opportunities. We emphasize the value of multifaceted programs for improving livelihoods, particularly for poorer, more vulnerable households as one way to support the UN's commitment to using aquaculture as a pathway to achieving sustainable development.

This study evaluates the contributions of an asset-based community-driven local development project, which has an objective to enhance farmer livelihoods through context-specific agricultural and agroforestry training, in line with farmers' identities, interests, and preferences. The project was implemented in two areas of the wider Nyando river basin: the Lower and Middle Nyando sites. The project effects on farmer livelihoods were evaluated by analyzing overall income enhancement through the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices via the computation of total values of harvest. Socioeconomic data from 183 households, half of which were involved in the project, were considered. The findings showed that locality played an important role in the adoption and success of good agricultural practices. Additional significant positive factors included project participation, size of land operated, horticulture farming, livestock ownership, ownership of a title deed, hours worked, and crop species richness. The number of years farmed had a significant negative correlation with the value of harvest. Considering the stark differences in livelihood effects in both sites, researchers conclude that external support for climate-smart agriculture uptake needs to be considerate of, and respond to, biophysical and socioeconomic context.

T4 is necessary for DA-synthesis and it binds to transthyretin (TTR) being transported into the brain. PCBs can displace T4 by binding to TTR itself, being transported into the brain and disturbing DA-synthesis, where depressive symptoms might occur. Consequently, the free T4-concentration (fT4) increases when PCBs bind to TTR. The interaction of PCBs with fT4 and its associations with the main DA metabolite, homovanillic acid (HVA), and depressive symptoms were investigated. In total, 116 participants (91.6% men) were investigated, who took part in three annual examinations (t1-t3) of the HELPcB health surveillance program. Blood was collected for measuring PCBs, hydroxy PCBs (OH-PCBs), and fT4 and urine for HVA. Depressive Symptoms were assessed with a standardized questionnaire. Interactions were tested cross-sectionally with multiple hierarchical regressions and longitudinally with mixed effect models. Related to HVA, an interaction was cross-sectionally found for lower-chlorinated PCBs (LPCBs) and dioxin-like PCBs (dlPCBs); longitudinally only for LPCBs. Related to depressive symptoms, the interaction was found for LPCBs, dlPCBs, and OH-PCBs; longitudinally again only for LPCBs. The results give first hints that a physiological process involving the thyroid and DA system is responsible for depressive symptoms after PCB exposure.

In this study, we sought to utilize geotagged tweetsspecifically, the frequency and type of food mentionsto understand the neighborhood food environment and the social modeling of food behavior. Additionally, we examined associations between aggregated food-related tweet characteristics and prevalent chronic health outcomes at the census tract level. We used a Twitter streaming application programming interface (API) to continuously collect similar to 1% random sample of public tweets in the United States. A total of 4,785,104 geotagged food tweets from 71,844 census tracts were collected from April 2015 to May 2018. We obtained census tract chronic disease outcomes from the CDC 500 Cities Project. We investigated associations between Twitter-derived food variables and chronic outcomes (obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure) using the median regression. Census tracts with higher average calories per tweet, less frequent healthy food mentions, and a higher percentage of food tweets about fast food had higher obesity and hypertension prevalence. Twitter-derived food variables were not predictive of diabetes prevalence. Food-related tweets can be leveraged to help characterize the neighborhood social and food environment, which in turn are linked with community levels of obesity and hypertension.

Population sizes, Rhinocyllus conicus use, and patterns of genetic variation of Cirsium ownbeyi, a rare native thistle, in Wyoming	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article							CURCULIONIDAE; CONSEQUENCES; COLEOPTERA; FITNESS; PLANT; DEMOGRAPHY; ASTERACEAE; BIOLOGY; AGENT	Cirsium ownbeyi is a habitat-specific, endemic, polycarpic thistle in northwest Colorado, northeast Utah, and southwest Wyoming. In 1998, seven C. ownbeyi populations, which ranged from 4 to > 30,000 plants, were known from Wyoming. The population genetics of C. ownbeyi and the threat posed by an exotic flower head-feeding weevil, Rhinocyllus conicus, in Wyoming are unknown. Between 2014 and 2016, we visited Wyoming C. ownbeyi populations to determine (1) changes in population sizes since 1998, (2) extent of R. conicus use, and (3) amount and distribution of genetic variation within and between populations. We quantified densities of plants within populations by life stage, population spatial extents, and, for 10 plants per population, proportion of flower heads with R. conicus ovipositions. Data at 6 simple sequence repeat loci were also collected. Three C. ownbeyi populations were < 10% of their 1998 estimated size, 3 populations were unchanged, and one population was substantially larger than in 1998. We found Rhinocyllus conicus oviposition in all Wyoming C. ownbeyi populations, and we interpret increasing use by this weevil over our monitoring period as indicating recent colonization. Low F-ST and F-IS values suggest that levels of C. ownbeyi inbreeding were low and that there was considerable gene flow among populations. Genetic variation increased with population size, although a small C. ownbeyi population was the most divergent. We conclude that C. ownbeyi was less abundant in Wyoming in 2015-2016 than was estimated in 1998. Causes of changes in population sizes are unknown and likely vary among populations. The positive relationship between population size and genetic diversity notwithstanding, protecting small populations can preserve unique local gene pools in this rare species.	[Russell, F.

While AMF hold potential for sustainable MTE management and conservation, they have been under investigated on this ecosystem and little is known about AMF spore bank dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the effect of physico-chemical soil factors, phytobiont species, and seasonality on the AMF spore soil density in two sclerophyllous forests (Malloa and San Vicente). We sampled soil once per season during 1 year and beneath four representative tree species for each site. The results show a strong season effect at both sites, while physical-chemical parameters differed between sites. At Malloa, clay content and electrical conductivity were positively correlated with spore density, while available phosphorous showed a negative correlation. At San Vicente, clay content and total nitrogen were positively correlated with spore density, while soil organic matter showed a negative effect. Overall, spore number reached a minimum value in winter and higher values during the growing season at both sites. These results indicate a strong regulation of AMF spore density by seasonal climate, while physico-chemical soil properties exert a host-independent but site-specific effect in both forests.

Nest-defense Behavior in Response to the Chatter Call in Tachycineta bicolor (Tree Swallow)	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							PARENTAL DEFENSE; USURPATION; INVESTMENT; PERIOD	Birds produce a variety of vocalizations ranging in function from attracting a mate to alerting others of danger. One vocalization of Tachycineta bicolor (Tree Swallow), the chatter call, is reported to serve as both a mate-attraction call and a nest-defense call. We used playback techniques to investigate the nest-defense behavior of Tree Swallows to calls of Toxostoma rufum (Brown Thrasher; control) and Sialia sialis (Eastern Bluebird; nest competitor), and Tree Swallow shriek (alarm call) and chatter calls. We measured time spent foraging, remaining in the nest box, and on nest defense. Tree Swallows spent 80% of their time on nest defense in response to the chatter call. The chatter-call and shriek-call nest-defense responses were nearly identical. Our data show that the chatter call functions as an alarm call and elicits nest-defense behavior.	[Phillips, J.

We aimed to identify vertebrate scavenger species, measure how long carcasses remained available, and examine differences in carrion consumption between grassland and shrubland vegetation types. This information is important for management decisions concerning a reintroduced population of a federally endangered obligate scavenger, Nicrophorus americanus (American Burying Beetle), on Nantucket Island. Carcasses were removed or consumed within 2.7 +/- 1.8 d, and vertebrates removed the carcass in 74% of trials. Carcasses persisted for similar lengths of time between the 2 vegetation types, but avian scavengers were significantly more common on Bobwhite Quail carcasses in grassland, and mammalian scavengers were significantly more common on House Mouse carcasses in shrubland habitats. Avian species appear to be significant competitors for carrion appropriate for American Burying Beetle reproduction.

Stand Dynamics and Structure of Two Primary Champlain Valley Clayplain Forests, Vermont	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							OAK FORESTS; NEW-ENGLAND; DISTURBANCE; SCALE; PRESETTLEMENT; VEGETATION; HISTORY; WOOD	Understanding natural forest dynamics is critical for informing forest restoration and conservation efforts. However, such information is often difficult to generate for areas that have a long history of intense land use, such as the Champlain Valley of Vermont. We used dendroecological methods and assessments of forest structural conditions to describe the tree recruitment history and structural dynamics of 2 examples of valley clayplain forest, a rare natural community that has been drastically reduced in extent by agricultural land use in the Champlain Valley. Although historic selective harvesting had occurred in the areas sampled, these sites represent the best remaining examples of semi- natural valley clayplain forests in the region, thus providing an opportunity to document long- term patterns of structural and compositional conditions and tree recruitment in areas with limited land- use. Age structures in these 2 areas were strongly uneven-aged, with older cohorts composed of Quercus alba (White Oak), including an individual dating to the 1640s, and recruitment over the past 2 centuries dominated by Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock). Size distributions of live trees also reflected these patterns of recruitment, with White Oak occurring exclusively in larger diameter classes (> 35 cm) and Eastern Hemlock predominating across all smaller size classes. We observed sparse regeneration of Quercus spp. (oaks) in these areas, suggesting that this historically important component of valley clayplain forests may disappear over time in the absence of large, stand- scale natural disturbances or management activities focused on the perpetuation of this species group.

Gascho			Reproductive Phenology of Elliptio complanata in an Upper Susquehanna River Tributary of New York	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							FRESH-WATER MUSSELS; PATTERNS; HOST; SEX	Elliptio complanata (Eastern Elliptio) is typically an abundant species in lotic systems throughout the northeastern US; however, as with many other freshwater mussel species, some populations of Eastern Elliptio are in decline. Freshwater mussels have complex life cycles, which are important to understand for their conservation and management. The goal of this study was to determine the timing of Eastern Elliptio spawning, brooding, and glochidia release. Throughout the spawning season, we used gonad and gill extracts and drift nets to track the timing of reproduction in Otego Creek, NY, a tributary to the Susquehanna River. Females began brooding fertilized eggs by mid-May, and by early June, all females collected were brooding fertilized eggs or d-shaped glochidia. The temperature was 18 degrees C when all females contained glochidia. Peak glochidia-drift occurred similar to 1 week after we recorded the highest levels of brooding and continued at low levels for several weeks. Phenology modeling helped us to determine that accumulated thermal units was the best predictor of reproductive activity. Our work highlights the environmental cues responsible for spawning, brooding, and glochidia release in a population of Eastern Elliptio. This empirical approach to predicting reproductive activity has great potential as a tool for timing the collection of brood stock for propagation or other important conservation measures.

Using Copaifera oblongifolia (Fabaceae), we evaluated the organization of their associated gall-inducing insect species in different spatial scales considering the following hypotheses: (i) the community of gall-inducing insects will be different between different populations of C. oblongifolia; (ii) plant individuals with a greater number of neighbours (host plant density) will have a greater diversity of gall-inducing insects; (iii) and more structurally complex plants will support a greater diversity of gall-inducing insects. Data were collected from the three different populations of C. oblongifolia located in abandoned pastures of three different municipalities in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. We recorded a total of 17,843 galls belonging to 15 different gall-inducing insect species associated to 60 C. oblongifolia plants sampled in the three populations (20 individuals per population). Abundance, richness and composition of gall-inducing insect species were different between the populations, suggesting that local environmental conditions influenced the gall-inducing insect community at a regional scale. Host plant density negatively affected the richness and abundance of gall-inducing insects per plant. Our data did not corroborate the hypothesis of resource concentration, perhaps due to the effect of resource dilution. The biomass of the host plant positively influenced the abundance of gall-inducing insects per plant. However, the interaction between plant density and biomass of the plant suggests that plants with greater structural complexity are more attacked by gall-inducing insects in plots with lower number of neighbours.

Do the temporal trends of habitat specialists differ from those of habitat generalists? Has there been a homogenization of the grassland vegetation? Location Different regions in Germany and the UK. Methods We conducted a formal meta-analysis of re-survey vegetation studies of semi-natural grasslands. In total, 23 data sets were compiled, spanning up to 75 years between the surveys, including 13 data sets from wet grasslands, six from dry grasslands and four from other grassland types. Edaphic conditions were assessed using mean Ellenberg indicator values for soil moisture, nitrogen and pH. Changes in species richness and environmental variables were evaluated using response ratios. Results In most wet grasslands, total species richness declined over time, while habitat specialists almost completely vanished. The number of species losses increased with increasing time between the surveys and were associated with a strong decrease in soil moisture and higher soil nutrient contents. Wet grasslands in nature reserves showed no such changes or even opposite trends. In dry grasslands and other grassland types, total species richness did not consistently change, but the number or proportions of habitat specialists declined. There were also considerable changes in species composition, especially in wet grasslands that often have been converted into intensively managed, highly productive meadows or pastures. We did not find a general homogenization of the vegetation in any of the grassland types. Conclusions The results document the widespread deterioration of semi-natural grasslands, especially of those types that can easily be transformed to high production grasslands. The main causes for the loss of grassland specialists are changed management in combination with increased fertilization and nitrogen deposition. Dry grasslands are most resistant to change, but also show a long-term trend towards an increase in more mesotrophic species.

Comparisons of niches and effects of closely related native and invasive species enable the investigation of this topic. Does Spartina anglica invade European salt marshes through competitive exclusion of the native Spartina maritima or due to the occurrence of an empty ecological niche in highly anoxic conditions? Study Site The Arcachon Bay (France). Methods At three intertidal levels, we quantified competitive response and effect abilities of the two species through a cross-transplantation removal experiment. We also compared the biomass, root/shoot ratio, productivity and environmental conditions (elevation, salinity, redox potential and soil moisture) of salt marsh communities dominated by the exotic Spartina anglica or the native Spartina maritima at three intertidal levels. Results Both established species showed similar biotic resistance to the invasion of the other species, but the exotic showed important intraspecific facilitation for growth. Species had similar niches and total biomass along a gradient of anoxic conditions, but the exotic had a much higher root/shoot ratio and productivity than the native. Owing to its rhizome density, the exotic showed high ability to increase sediment oxygenation, likely to explain its important intraspecific facilitation. Conclusions Our results showed that the invasion success of S. anglica cannot be explained by the competitive exclusion of the native or by its ability to fill an empty niche along a gradient of anoxia. Its behaviour as a self-facilitator invasive engineer very likely explains its rapid spread in the Bay and biotic resistance to the colonization of other congeneric species when established in dense patches. Additionally, we suggest that physical disturbance in marsh communities dominated by the native S. maritima may disrupt its biotic resistance against the invasion of S. anglica.

Forest gaps affect species coexistence (and ecosystem functions) as suggested by the gap and gap-size partitioning hypotheses (GPH, G(S)PH). Here we test these hypotheses in the context of high-elevation forest bryophyte communities and their functional attributes. Study Site Spruce-fir forests on Whiteface Mountain, NY, USA. Methods We characterized canopy openness, microclimate, forest floor substrates, vascular vegetation cover, and moss layer (cover, common species, and functional attributes) in three canopy openness environments (gap, gap edge, forest canopy) across 20 gaps (fir waves) (n = 60); the functional attributes were based on 16 morphologic, reproductive, and ecological bryophyte plant functional traits (PFTs). We tested GPH and G(S)PH relative to bryophyte community metrics (cover, composition), traits, and trait functional sensitivity (functional dispersion; FDis) using indicator species analysis, ordination, and regression. Results Canopy openness drove gradients in ground-level temperature, substrate abundance and heterogeneity (beta diversity), and understory vascular vegetation cover. The GPH was consistent with (a) the abundance patterns of forest canopy indicator species (Dicranum fuscescens, Hypnum imponens, and Tetraphis pellucida), and (b) FDis based on three PFTs (growth form, fertility, and acidity), both increasing with canopy cover. We did not find support for GPH in the remaining species or traits, or for G(S)PH in general; gap width (12-44 m) was not related to environmental or bryophyte community gradients. Conclusions The observed lack of variation in most bryophyte metrics across canopy environments suggests high resistance of the bryophyte layer to natural canopy gaps in high-elevation forests. However, responses of forest canopy indicator species suggest that canopy mortality, potentially increased by changing climate or insect pests, may cause declines in some forest canopy species and consequently in the functional diversity of bryophyte communities.

Partitioning beta diversity can provide fundamental insights into the processes that determine the spatial variation of species assemblages. However, studying beta diversity is conventionally based only on species composition data, ignoring the structural component of communities. Study site Temperate mixed broadleaf-conifer forest in Jiaohe, Jilin Province, northeastern China. Methods We characterized the variation of community assemblages in terms of species composition, size structure, or considering both components. We then employed environmental and spatial variables as explanatory factors to partition the variation in both compositional and structural components of community assemblage and assess the relative contributions of the niche and neutral processes to community assembly. Results The values of overall beta diversity (BD statistics) and the relative contribution of individual sampling units to beta diversity (LCBD indices) depended on whether the species composition, size structure, or both together had been taken into account. The value of compositional-structural beta diversity was the largest, followed by traditional compositional beta diversity; the smallest was the structural beta diversity. The sites with high contributions to beta diversity (LCBD values) varied among structural and compositional components. The explanatory power of the environmental variables and the spatial variables also varied widely with different components of a community. The combination of environmental and spatial variables explained the highest proportion of variation (43.8%) in the compositional component and explained the lowest proportion of variation (25.4%) in the structural component of community assemblage. Conclusion Both deterministic and stochastic processes are acting to determine community assemblages in terms of species composition and structure in our temperate forest site. Our study highlights the importance of considering the structural component of forest communities, in addition to compositional data, when studying beta diversity.

The importance of local environmental, hydrogeomorphological and spatial variables for beta diversity of macrophyte assemblages in a Neotropical floodplain	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						dispersal limitation; disturbances; floodplain lakes; hydrogeomorphology; macrophytes; nestedness; neutral processes; spatial processes; species sorting; turnover; variation partitioning	AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; SPECIES TURNOVER; RIVER; DISPERSAL; LAKES; FISH; COMPETITION; NESTEDNESS; FRAMEWORK; PATTERNS	Questions Understanding the processes that determine the variation in community composition (beta-diversity) is a major challenge in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Here we assess the importance of abiotic variables associated with local environmental features, hydrogeomorphology, and space to explain beta-diversity patterns in macrophytes by addressing the following questions: (1) Which are the sets of environmental, hydrogeomorphological, and spatial variables that contribute significantly to the spatial variation of macrophytes? (2) Which are their relative contributions to explaining the total beta-diversity, nestedness and turnover of macrophyte assemblages? Study Site Middle Parana River floodplain, Argentina. Methods We sampled 20 lakes at low and high water levels in the Middle Parana River floodplain. To investigate the relationship of total beta-diversity, turnover and nestedness with explanatory variables, we used the constrained analysis of principal coordinates (CAP). We used variation partitioning to assess the proportion of the variation related to each subset of variables (environmental, hydrogeomorphological and spatial). Results Among four alternatives considered to explain the spatial structure, the distance between lakes by watercourses best described the spatial organization of beta-diversity. Species turnover was largely explained by hydrogeomorphological variables, followed by spatial descriptors, whereas nestedness was exclusively related to spatial variables. Conclusions In the Middle Parana River floodplain beta-diversity of macrophyte communities is partly shaped by turnover (mainly driven by the hydrogeomorphology of the floodplain) and nestedness (resulting from dispersal limitation by watercourses), but it also seems to be randomly organized (possibly because of random colonization and extinction, due to disturbances such as floods). Our work indicates that environmental pressures reflect differences between macrophyte communities of lakes with different geomorphological and hydrographical conditions. This suggests that certain ecological processes (such as species sorting) are driven at a higher degree by hydrogeomorphology than by local environment.

Leaf and root nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry along aridity and soil fertility gradients	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						aridity index gradient; dryland; ecological stoichiometry; fine root; intraspecific variation; nitrogen fixer; plant functional type; soil fertility gradient; species turnover	PLANT FUNCTIONAL-GROUP; PRECIPITATION GRADIENT; NITROGEN; TRAITS; CLIMATE; ECOSYSTEM; TEMPERATURE; PHOSPHATASE; NUTRITION; FIXATION	Questions Leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) concentrations and N : P ratio have been extensively studied along environmental gradients, but whether and how leaves and roots show similar responses to climatic and fertility gradients is little studied. Also, the responses of leaf and root N and P in different plant functional types (PFT; legumes, grasses, forbs and shrubs) to environmental gradients are poorly known. We examined the following two hypotheses: (a) P concentration and N : P ratios in leaves or fine roots would not be modulated by soil N for legumes while they would be for non-legume PFTs; (b) Species turnover would have stronger influence on the responses of N and P concentrations and N : P ratios of plant tissues along aridity and soil fertility gradients than intraspecific variation. Study site Ordos Plateau, China. Methods We collected samples of leaf and fine roots covering 95 species of 28 families across 17 sites affiliated to four vegetation types on the dry Ordos Plateau of North China and compared variations in N and P concentrations and N : P ratios in both leaves and fine roots among PFTs. Results We found that legumes had higher N concentrations in leaves and fine roots than the non-legume PFTs. Leaf and fine root P and N : P ratios increased with increasing soil N for most non-legume PFTs, but the relationships were decoupled for legumes. Species turnover had a stronger contribution to these relationships of N and P in leaves and fine roots along aridity and soil N gradients than intraspecific variation. Conclusions When modeling vegetation nutrient stocks and cycling, the predictive power could be improved by taking into account not only influences of soil fertility but also of climate on leaf and root tissue N and soil N on tissue P and N : P ratio, especially for non-legume functional types.

However, beta-diversity patterns and especially the relative role of species replacement and nestedness in these situations with time-lagged extinctions and colonisations remain unknown. We aim to (a) quantify beta-diversity change, species replacement and nestedness for vascular plants along a grassland-forest succession with time-lagged biodiversity change for more than 50 years; (b) check its consistency between all species, grassland specialists and forest specialists, and (c) identify the role of forest encroachment relative to other drivers. Study site Prades Mountains, Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). Methods We sampled 18 sites representing a gradient in past and current grassland area and connectivity, and in forest encroachment intensity, to obtain plant composition of all species, grassland specialists and forest specialists. We quantified overall beta-diversity and its components at each species classification group along the forest encroachment gradient and other drivers. Then, we used general linear models to study (a) the change rate of beta diversity along the forest encroachment gradient and (b) the relative importance of the drivers in explaining beta diversity. Results Following the forest encroachment gradient, we found an overall noticeable species replacement, while nestedness was the main component for habitat specialists. Landscape differences contributed to explaining most compositional differences (both nestedness and replacement), while soil characteristics and geographic distance had a more restricted contribution. Conclusions Species replacement due to environmental sorting occurred over the succession, triggered by selective extinctions of grassland specialists and selective colonisations of forest specialists. Nonetheless, historical landscape characteristics, current landscape characteristics and geographic distance modulate plant extinctions and colonisations, suggesting biological inertia, mass effects and habitat isolation, respectively. Partitioning beta-diversity into nestedness and replacement components and exploring the extinction and colonisation patterns of habitat specialist groups might provide relevant insight into the drivers and processes of community shift after land-use change.

Both temporal and spatial comparisons along urbanization gradients are widely used in related studies, but there has been a lack of consistency in the results. Moreover, there is a need for studies that determine species assembly mechanisms through immigration and extinction. Therefore, two questions were addressed: (a) How do the phylogenetic and functional structures of ruderal species respond to urbanization, and do their shifts follow a similar pattern along temporal and spatial urbanization gradients? (b) What are the key underlying processes, i.e., either extinction- or colonization-caused clustering, that determine the phylogenetic and functional structures of ruderal species under urbanization? Study site Two metropoles (Shanghai and Harbin) experiencing rapid urbanization in China. Methods We collected occurrence data on ruderal species from 1955 and the present in two cities. Standardized effect sizes of mean pairwise phylogenetic distance and of mean pairwise functional distance values (MPDSES and MFDSES, resp.) were calculated to test whether there was phylogenetic and/or functional structure clustering along spatial or temporal urbanization gradients. beta-MPDSES and beta-MFDSES values were used to quantify the similarities among colonists, extinct species, and residents. Results Along both the spatial and temporal gradients, the MPDSES values in each city decreased from significantly positive to significantly negative with increasing urbanization. Inconsistently, along the temporal gradients, the beta-MPDSES values of the colonists/extinct species to the residents were significantly negative; along the spatial gradients, the beta-MPDSES values of extinct species to residents were significantly positive with increasing urbanization. Conclusions We found there was a clear phylogenetic clustering of ruderal species with increasing spatial and temporal urbanization gradients. Our analysis showed that the changes across the urban-rural gradient are mainly driven by species going extinct that are phylogenetically dissimilar to the resident species. The temporal dynamics are, however, primarily driven by colonist species that are phylogenetically similar to the resident species.

We hypothesize that functional diversity matters more than species richness and that, after major disturbances, the pioneer plant community will first show a ruderal composition, that subsequently changes into successional stages in which competitive and stress-tolerating species become dominant life-forms. We expect this process to be revealed by the community's functional signature. Location Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico (19 degrees 1 ' 0 '' N, 98 degrees 37 ' 0 '' W) which has undergone large eruptive activity that has caused lahars formation. Methods In 2002, survey plots were established in the bottom of the Huiloac gorge. Species composition and abundance data were thereafter collected for 10 years. In 2013, data on three functional traits leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content and LA of 67 species were obtained and each species was assigned to a strategy according to the CSR (Competitive, Stress-Tolerant or Ruderal) scheme. A community-functional signature was calculated for each year. Also, a parallel ordination of plots strategies composition in time was performed to confirm functional shift trends. Results Initial successional phases were dominated by ruderal and competitive species. Thereafter, the communities went through a phase of increasing heterogeneity of strategies, which was followed by dominance of competitive and stress-tolerant strategists in the later years. Parallel ordination confirmed the gradient of functional differentiation through time. Conclusions The change from ruderal/competitive to stress-tolerant and competitive species with time suggests that the most recent lahar event played a major role in sorting species according to their tolerance for disturbances. Thereafter, a major trend has been the gradual shift from ruderal to stress-tolerant species (conifers and alpine grasses).

A high-resolution mill pond record from eastern Virginia (USA) reveals the impact of past landscape changes and regional pollution history	ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article						Mill pond; Legacy sediment; Lead pollution; Atlantic Coastal Plain; Williamsburg; Virginia	ISOTOPIC SOURCE SIGNATURES; LEAD ISOTOPES; SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION; ATMOSPHERIC LEAD; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; UNITED-STATES; TRACE-METALS; RIVER; LEGACY; BASIN	Mill ponds appeared throughout the eastern United States following European settlement. Sedimentation in these systems records centuries of past landscape change. To date, mill ponds on the Atlantic Coastal Plain have received little attention, yet this region had the earliest colonial settlements. Mill ponds here also have potential to record geomorphic change and pollution histories at high-resolution because of easily erodible underlying unconsolidated sediments. This paper presents a c. 300-year record of sedimentation in Lake Matoaka, a former mill pond in Williamsburg, Virginia. We used lead (Pb) and , cesium (Cs) isotopes ((210)pb,Cs-137), Pb concentrations, stable Pb isotopes (Pb-206/Pb-207), and chronostrati-graphic horizons to develop a chronology, which shows remarkably high sedimentation rates, similar to 0.5 cm/yr. Sedimentological data including the analysis of organic matter, grain size, and elemental compositions, revealed past conditions within the lake and its watershed. These data are linked to the operation of the mill c. CE 1700-1910, changes in the dam structure, and other historic developments of the region. Tracing pollution history with (206) Pb/Pb-207 showed mid-1800s atmospheric deposition from smelting of Upper Mississippi Valley district Pb ores, and a sharp maxima in total Pb of 134 mu g/g in the 1970s from the peak use of leaded gasoline in North America. Mass accumulation rates climbed from c. 0.08 to 0.28 g/cm/yr during the 18th and 19th centuries from deforestation and agriculture, which is somewhat lower than sediment yields documented in other regions. We suggest that stream channel storage may buffer pond sedimentation within low gradient, coastal plain landscapes. This study contributes to the understanding of sedimentation in mill ponds for reconstructing historic landscape changes and regional pollution history. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Establishment success and crop growth effects of an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus inoculated into Swiss corn fields	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Symbiosis; Maize; SMRT sequencing; Rhizoglomus irregulare; Phosphorous; Soil ecological engineering	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SOIL; METAANALYSIS; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; DIVERSITY; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY; INTRARADICES; RESPONSES	A major strategy to increase the sustainability of agricultural systems consists of enhancing internal ecosystem processes that support crop production and reduce external resource inputs. However, specific approaches to achieve this goal still need to be identified. Here, we investigated whether inoculation with a high dose of a well characterized strain of a plant symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus into Swiss corn fields leads to successful establishment of the fungus in plant roots and can generate agronomic benefits for maize production. We used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing to assess community composition of native AM fungi and identified environmental management and biological factors affecting AM fungal abundance, establishment success of the introduced fungus and effects of AMF inoculation on corn yield. While native AM fungal abundance was negatively related to soil P contents, we found significantly positive relationships between soil P contents and establishment success of the inoculated fungus. There was a significantly negative relationship between inoculum establishment and abundance of native AM fungi. Although molecular quantification using strain-specific qPCR indicated that the inoculated strain strongly increased in abundance in roots from most soils investigated, total AM fungal root colonization was only significantly increased in one soil, indicating successful competition of the inoculant for root niche space against native AM fungi. Positive effects on corn yield were only observed when inoculation increased root colonization and were negatively correlated to P fertilization levels. The results imply that phosphorus plays a major role in defining the abundance of native AM fungi and the composition of their communities and that these effects can determine establishment success of the inoculant. The results further indicate that positive effects on crop yield may only be expected when potentially achievable root colonization levels are not yet reached and AMF communities are not well developed.

There has therefore been increased interest in biodegradable plastic mulches as alternative to polyethylene mulch; however, little is known about their impact on soil health. We evaluated the effects of four biodegradable plastic mulches on soil health at two sites (Knoxville, TN and Mount Vernon, WA) under pie pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) production. Cellulosic paper, polyethylene, and no-mulch served as controls. Soil health was first assessed in May 2015, and then every six months until May 2017, by measuring 19 soil properties (physical, chemical, and biological). Soil properties were converted to index scores and aggregated into six soil health indicators and five soil functions. The results showed poor correlations and high spatial variations for most of the soil properties. We performed repeated measure analyses using raw values and change scores to account for the initial variations. The soil properties, soil health indicators, and soil functions were affected more by site and time than by the mulch treatments. Nonetheless, we did observe significant effects of some of the mulch treatments on six soil properties (aggregate stability, infiltration, soil pH, electrical conductivity, nitrate-N, and exchangeable potassium), four soil health indicators (hydraulic, biological, fertility, and salinity & sodicity), and one soil function (nutrient cycling). However, these effects were not consistent among all the biodegradable plastic mulches, across the two sites, and the sampling times. Overall, biodegradable plastic mulches may be a viable alternative to polyethylene. However, evaluation under long-term studies is needed to better establish their effects on soil health.

Due to the decline in extensively grazing livestock numbers, an increasing area of formerly grazed grasslands has being used as mown grasslands. However, we have scarce information on how arthropod assemblages are influenced by mowing in formerly grazed pastures. We assessed the effects of mowing compared to grazing on the species richness, abundance and functional diversity of arthropods in three grassland complexes in Hungary. Since 2005, these salt grasslands have been divided into two management units: extensive grazing management has been continued in one part, while annual late cutting has been established in the other part. In each management unit five sites were sampled. Spiders and ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps, orthopterans and true bugs were sampled using sweep nets twice before cutting in 2015. In total, the data relating to 12,576 adult individuals of 334 species were analysed using mixed-models. Plant-dwelling true bugs and orthopterans responded more sensitively to mowing than ground-dwelling spiders and ground beetles. Beside the general negative effect of mowing on the species richness and abundance of plant-dwelling arthropods, the shifts in the community weighted mean values of these assemblages suggested the importance of the body size, trophic behaviour and dispersal ability of species in the functional response of these assemblages to the different management regimes. Ground beetles and spiders were rather influenced by the differences in the moisture conditions and vegetation properties. Presumably, strong abiotic stressors such as drought can partly override management effects on ground-dwelling arthropods. The effect of uniform and simultaneous biomass removal on large areas, and the direct mortality caused by mowing was the most disadvantageous for plant-dwelling arthropods. Based on our results, traditional management practices should be prioritized in grassland conservation, as alternative management practices might be less effective in preserving grassland biodiversity.

As a food source for earthworms, this type of organic fertilizer is of lower quality than the traditionally used farmyard manure consisting of dung with some urine and mixed with bedding material such as straw. Earthworms living in dairy farmland belong to two distinct ecotypes, the detritivores and the geophages. Detritivores rely on farmyard manure as a food source more than geophages and therefore the type of organic fertilizer is expected to determine their relative abundances. In turn, this would affect higher trophic levels, as detritivores, when they come to the surface to collect food, are particularly important as prey for birds and mammals. Here we tested the hypothesis that dairy farmland fertilized with slurry will contain fewer detritivorous earthworms (thereby becoming less attractive for earthworm predators) by quantifying the abundance of the two earthworm ecotypes in 45 grasslands fertilized with either slurry, farmyard manure, or both. To determine the availability of detritivores for earthworm predators, we quantified earthworm surface availability by counting surfacing earthworms in the field and compared these numbers with densities belowground. To study the direct effects of different organic fertilizer types on earthworms, we measured their growth rates under controlled constant conditions using either slurry or farmyard manure, with hay as a control. We found that detritivores occurred in the highest densities in grasslands only fertilized with farmyard manure and that they also grew better on farmyard manure than on slurry. These differences were not found in geophages. Detritivores made up 25% of the total earthworm abundance in the soil, but contributed 83% to the surfacing earthworms at night; detritivore earthworms will thus be the main prey for visually hunting earthworm predators. The few dairy farmers using farmyard manure to fertilize their grasslands today will thus encourage the presence and availability of an earthworm ecotype which benefits higher trophic levels such as the endangered meadow birds.

As a consequence, there is an urgent need to implement effective conservation and habitat restoration measures in agricultural landscapes. Over the last 40-50 years, due to the cessation of traditional management practices, the majority of UK farmland ponds have become highly terres-trialised, resulting in major reductions in the diversity and abundance of aquatic plant and invertebrate assemblages. Recent research undertaken at farmland ponds in early summer, has shown restored open-canopy, macrophyte-dominated ponds support an increased abundance and diversity of farmland birds, compared to non-managed, overgrown ponds. Here, we expand on this previous research with a year-long field study to assess the implications of pond management for farmland birds by comparing bird diversity, abundance and activity at managed open-canopy ponds with those at unmanaged overgrown ponds. Driven strongly by pond management and connectivity to semi-natural landscape features such as hedgerows and woodland patches, bird abundance and species richness, as well as foraging and parental behaviour, were all significantly higher at managed open-canopy ponds. Further, a wider landscape analysis found that terrestrial land-use patterns in the vicinity of the ponds were not significant predictors of bird communities at the pond sites. In light of the numerous potential benefits to conservation-listed birds and other wildlife, we conclude that farmland pond management has been undervalued as a conservation measure to assist farmland birds. Consequently, we conclude that future agri-environment schemes, should more fully embrace farmland ponds.

We studied the influence of local factors (orchard management and adjacent habitats) and of landscape composition on the abundance and community composition of predatory arthropods in apple orchards in three European countries. To elucidate how local and landscape factors influence natural enemy effectiveness in apple production systems, we calculated community energy use as a proxy for the communities' predation potential based on biomass and metabolic rates of predatory arthropods. Predator communities were assessed by standardised beating samples taken from apple trees in 86 orchards in Germany, Spain and Sweden. Orchard management included integrated production (IP; i.e. the reduced and targeted application of synthetic agrochemicals), and organic management practices in all three countries. Predator communities differed between management types and countries. Several groups, including beetles (Coleoptera), predatory bugs (Heteroptera), flies (Diptera) and spiders (Araneae) benefited from organic management depending on country. Woody habitat and IP supported harvestmen (Opiliones). In both IP and organic orchards we detected aversive influences of a high-quality surrounding landscape on some predator groups: for example, high covers of woody habitat reduced earwig abundances in German orchards but enhanced their abundance in Sweden, and high natural plant species richness tended to reduce predatory bug abundance in Sweden and IP orchards in Spain. We conclude that predatory arthropod communities and influences of local and landscape factors are strongly shaped by orchard management, and that the influence of management differs between countries. Our results indicate that organic management improves the living conditions for effective predator communities.

Water quality monitoring is therefore essential for public health risk evaluation and the management of water bodies. This study investigated the feasibility of using bacteriophages of Enterococcus faecalis as sewage-specific faecal indicators, together with physicochemical (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and total suspended solids) and biological parameters, to assess coastal water quality using multivariate analysis incorporating non-detects. The principal component and cluster analyses demonstrated that coastal water quality was mostly influenced by biological parameters, including Escherichia coli and total coliforms, which were found in all 31 sampling sites, and enterococci, which was found in all but two sampling sites. The enterococcal bacteriophages AIM06 and SR14 were detected in 17 and 18 samples at concentrations up to 1,815 and 2,790 PFU/100 mL, respectively. Both bacteriophages co-presented in approximately 80% of phage-positive samples, and the concentrations at each site were not significantly different. Overall, either bacteriophage could be used to differentiate high- and low-level coastal water pollution, as grouped by cluster analysis. This study is the first to investigate the suitability of sewage-specific bacteriophages of E. faecalis for monitoring coastal water quality and emphasises the importance of a multivariate analysis with non-detects to facilitate coastal water quality monitoring and management.

Population size can also fluctuate widely, driven largely by changes in juvenile mortality in response to food availability, but these relationships have only been explored on a limited number of sites and over short periods. Aims The present study aimed to investigate and quantify the numerical response of feral pig populations to changes in their food supply in north-eastern Australia. Methods Pig population densities were determined from aerial surveys conducted over a 21-year period on 10 regional blocks (2000-6000 km(2)) throughout the Queensland rangelands. Densities were used to calculate annual exponential rates of increase (r), which were then corrected for anthropogenic mortality (baiting and commercial harvesting). Six proxy measures of annual food supply, including rainfall, pasture biomass and pasture growth (using the AussieGRASS model), were calculated for each survey block, and assessed as predictors of corrected r. The rates of increase predicted from the first half of the data series were then applied to initial population densities to estimate successive pig densities during the second period in each bioregion. Key results The most parsimonious model of the numerical response had parameters common to three bioregions, with rainfall in the 12 months between surveys being the best predictor variable. Modelled densities for each bioregion were a good fit to actual, observed densities. Relationships between r and each measure of food supply at the individual block level were inconsistent. Conclusions Using rainfall as a measure of food supply, the numerical response relationship provides a method for predicting the dynamics of feral pig populations at the bioregional scale. Predicting population dynamics at any one site using this relationship is less precise, suggesting that differences in landscape composition affect utilisation of resources supporting population growth. Implications The results from the present study could be used to predict feral pig population changes at the bioregional level, supplementing or reducing the need for more frequent, expensive population surveys. This improved ability to predict fluctuations in regional feral pig populations can help guide future management actions.

Implementation of an occupancy-based monitoring protocol for a widespread and cryptic species, the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis)	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						co-occurrence models; lagomorphs; species distribution models; Sylvilagus transitionalis; wildlife management	ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; DYNAMICS; HABITAT; MODELS; COOCCURRENCE; POPULATIONS; LAGOMORPHS; PACKAGE; STATES; RANGE	Context Designing effective long-term monitoring strategies is essential for managing wildlife populations. Implementing a cost-effective, practical monitoring program is especially challenging for widespread but locally rare species. Early successional habitat preferred by the New England cottontail (NEC) has become increasingly rare and fragmented, resulting in substantial declines from their peak distribution in the mid-1900s. The introduction of a possible competitor species, the eastern cottontail (EC), may also have played a role. Uncertainty surrounding how these factors have contributed to NEC declines has complicated management and necessitated development of an appropriate monitoring framework to understand possible drivers of distribution and dynamics. Aims Because estimating species abundance is costly, we designed presence-absence surveys to estimate species distributions, test assumptions about competitive interactions, and improve understanding of demographic processes for eastern cottontails (EC) and New England cottontails (NEC). The survey protocol aimed to balance long-term management objectives with practical considerations associated with monitoring a widespread but uncommon species. Modelling data arising from these observations allow for estimation of covariate relationships between species status and environmental conditions including habitat and competition. The framework also allows inference about species status at unsurveyed locations. Methods We designed a monitoring protocol to collect data across six north-eastern USA states and, using data collected from the first year of monitoring, fit a suite of single-season occupancy models to assess how abiotic and biotic factors influence NEC occurrence, correcting for imperfect detectability. Key results Models did not provide substantial support for competitive interactions between EC and NEC. NEC occurrence patterns appear to be influenced by several remotely sensed habitat covariates (land-cover classes), a habitat-suitability index, and, to a lesser degree, plot-level habitat covariates (understorey density and canopy cover). Conclusions We recommend continuing presence-absence monitoring and the development of dynamic occupancy models to provide further evidence regarding hypotheses of competitive interactions and habitat influences on the underlying dynamics of NEC occupancy. Implications State and federal agencies responsible for conserving this and other threatened species can engage with researchers in thoughtful discussions, based on management objectives, regarding appropriate monitoring design to ensure that the allocation of monitoring efforts provides useful inference on population drivers to inform management intervention.

However, little is known about the population-level impact of vehicle mortality on native mammals in the island state. AimsThe aims were to investigate the predictability of roadkill on a given route, based on models of species distribution and live animal abundance for three marsupial species in Tasmania - the Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii), Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and the bare-nosed wombat (Vombatus ursinus) - and to assess the possibility of predicting the magnitude of state-wide road mortality based on live animal abundance. MethodsRoad mortality of the three species was measured on eight 15-km road segments in south-eastern Tasmania, during 16 weeks over the period 2016-17. Climate suitability was predicted using state-wide geographical location records, using species distribution models, and counts of these species from 190 spotlight survey roads. Key resultsThe Tasmanian pademelons were the most frequently killed animal encountered over the study period. Live abundance, predicted by fitting models to spotlight counts, did not correlate with this fatality rate for any species. However, the climate suitability index generated by the species distribution models was strongly predictive for wombat roadkill, and moderately so for pademelons. ConclusionsAlthough distributional and wildlife abundance records are commonly available and well described by models based on climate, vegetation and land-use predictors, this approach to climate suitability modelling has limited predictability for roadkill counts on specific routes. ImplicationsRoad-specific factors, such as characteristics of the road infrastructure, nearby habitats and behavioural traits, seem to be required to explain roadkill frequency. Determining their relative importance will require spatial analysis of roadkill locations.	[Nguyen, Hanh K.

However, for recovery to occur, the matrix around the fire must support source populations of immigrants. Therefore, the landscape context of fires may be a critical determinant of the species pool available for (re)colonisation, hence post-fire community composition. Increasingly, fires occur in fragmented systems, and there is limited knowledge of how the surrounding landscape interacts with post-fire community recovery. Aim The present study aimed to examine how landscape context influences faunal communities after large wildfires. Methods Three reserves burnt by wildfire were examined 18 months before the study in the Mallee region of south-eastern Australia. In all cases the burnt area consisted of natural mallee woodland. Two fires occurred within a matrix of extensive natural vegetation, while the third fire burnt >80% of a reserve situated within a highly fragmented, largely agricultural landscape. Birds, reptiles and mammals were surveyed at 90 sites inside and outside the fire boundaries, and relationships of species occurrence to reserve location, burnt versus unburnt status and distance from fire edge were all examined. Key results Post-fire faunal communities reflected the species in the surrounding unburnt landscape. Notably, open habitat specialists, invasive species and species that can persist in small habitat patches were prominent within the fragmented system. Post-fire fauna communities were also influenced by variation of the natural vegetation surrounding the fire. The occurrence of species with low dispersal ability (i.e. reptiles) was influenced by local (patch scale) vegetation structure. 2Conclusions The landscape context of fires is a major driver of the composition of post-fire faunal communities. Our results highlight the potential loss of species sensitive to fragmentation from fire-prone natural vegetation within modified landscapes, and that a reduced pool of potential immigrants leads to attenuated succession', compromising recovery of the pre-fire community. Implications Post-fire colonists reflect the surrounding landscapes species pool, such that reserves surrounded by fragmented or otherwise low quality habitat are at risk of attenuated succession after fire. Landscape context should be incorporated into conservation planning in fire-prone ecosystems, including consideration of surrounding habitat quality and connectivity and protecting long unburnt vegetation.

Understanding how pheromones have arisen has been supported by studies with the model organism Leptopilina heterotoma, a parasitoid wasp whose defensive compound (-)-iridomyrmecin also evolved as a component of the female sex pheromone and as a cue to avoid competition with other females during host search. To understand how compounds can evolve from being non-communicative to having a communicative function and to shed light on the evolution of the multi-functional use of iridomyrmecin in the genus Leptopilina, the chemical communication of two additional species, L. ryukyuensis and L. japonica, was studied. We demonstrate that in both species a species-specific mixture of iridoids is produced and emitted by wasps upon being attacked, consistent with their putative role as defensive compounds. In L. ryukyuensis these iridoids are also used by females to avoid host patches already exploited by other conspecific females. However, females of L. japonica do not avoid the odor of conspecific females during host search. We also show that the sex pheromone of female L. ryukyuensis consists of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), as males showed strong courtship behavior (wing fanning) towards these compounds, but not towards the iridoid compounds. In contrast, males of L. japonica prefer their females' iridoids but CHCs also elicit some courtship behavior. The use of iridoid compounds as defensive allomones seems to be common in the genus Leptopilina, while their communicative functions appear to have evolved in a species-specific manner.

However, we generally know little about the energy- and time-demands of developing toxicity in animals, which determines the efficiency of chemical defence and its trade-off with other risk-induced phenotypic responses. In this study we examined how immersion into norepinephrine solution inducing the release of stored toxins, administration of mild stress mimicking predator attack or simple handling during experimental procedure affected the quantity and number of toxin compounds present in common toad (Bufo bufo) tadpoles as compared to undisturbed control individuals, and investigated how fast toxin reserves were restored. We found that total bufadienolide quantity (TBQ) significantly decreased only in the norepinephrine treatment group immediately after treatment compared to the control, but this difference disappeared after 12 h; there were no consistent differences in TBQ between treatments at later samplings. Interestingly, in the norepinephrine treatment approximately half of the compounds characterized by > 700 m/z values showed the same changes in time as TBQ, but several bufadienolides characterized by < 600 m/z values showed the opposite pattern: they were present in higher quantities immediately after treatment. The number of bufadienolide compounds was not affected by any treatments, but was positively related to TBQ. Our study represents the first experimental evidence that toxin quantities returned to the original level following induced toxin release within a very short period of time in common toad tadpoles and provide additional insights into the physiological background of chemical defence in this model vertebrate species.

Cardenolide Intake, Sequestration, and Excretion by the Monarch Butterfly along Gradients of Plant Toxicity and Larval Ontogeny	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Asclepias; Cardiac glycoside; Caterpillar developmental stage; Danaus plexippus; Plant-insect interactions; Milkweed; Sequestration; Sodium-potassium ATPase	LAYER-CHROMATOGRAPHY PROFILES; DANAUS-PLEXIPPUS LEPIDOPTERA; CHEMICAL DEFENSE; CARDIAC-GLYCOSIDES; PHYSIOLOGICAL-MECHANISMS; ASCLEPIAS-SYRIACA; NATURAL-SELECTION; COMMON MILKWEED; HEART POISONS; LEAF BEETLES	Monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus, migrate long distances over which they encounter host plants that vary broadly in toxic cardenolides. Remarkably little is understood about the mechanisms of sequestration in Lepidoptera that lay eggs on host plants ranging in such toxins. Using closely-related milkweed host plants that differ more than ten-fold in cardenolide concentrations, we mechanistically address the intake, sequestration, and excretion of cardenolides by monarchs. We show that on high cardenolide plant species, adult butterflies saturate in cardenolides, resulting in lower concentrations than in leaves, while on low cardenolide plants, butterflies concentrate toxins. Butterflies appear to focus their sequestration on particular compounds, as the diversity of cardenolides is highest in plant leaves, lower in frass, and least in adult butterflies. Among the variety of cardenolides produced by the plant, sequestered compounds may be less toxic to the butterflies themselves, as they are more polar on average than those in leaves. In accordance with this, results from an in vitro assay based on inhibition of Na+/K+ ATPase (the physiological target of cardenolides) showed that on two milkweed species, including the high cardenolide A. perennis, extracts from butterflies have lower inhibitory effects than leaves when standardized by cardenolide concentration, indicating selective sequestration of less toxic compounds from these host plants. To understand how ontogeny shapes sequestration, we examined cardenolide concentrations in caterpillar body tissues and hemolymph over the course of development. Caterpillars sequestered higher concentrations of cardenolides as early instars than as late instars, but within the fifth instar, concentration increased with body mass. Although it appears that large amounts of sequestration occurs in early instars, a host switching experiment revealed that caterpillars can compensate for feeding on low cardenolide host plants with substantial sequestration in the fifth instar. We highlight commonalities and striking differences in the mechanisms of sequestration depending on host plant chemistry and developmental stage, which have important implications for monarch defense.

Mechanisms of Resistance to Insect Herbivores in Isolated Breeding Lineages of Cucurbita pepo	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Cucurbita pepo; Cucurbitacins; Herbivore induced plant volatiles; Plant-herbivore interactions; Trichoplusia ni	CROP DOMESTICATION; GENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; BEETLES COLEOPTERA; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; PLANT VOLATILES; WILD RELATIVES; LIFE-HISTORY; EVOLUTION; CHRYSOMELIDAE; SPECIALIST	Although crop wild ancestors are often reservoirs of resistance traits lost during domestication, examining diverse cultivated germplasm may also reveal novel resistance traits due to distinct breeding histories. Using ten cultivars from two independent domestication events of Cucurbita pepo (ssp. pepo and texana), we identified divergences in constitutive and induced resistance measured by growth of generalist caterpillars and leaf traits. C. p. texana cultivars were consistently more resistant to Trichoplusia ni and Spodoptera exigua, and this was not due to expected mechanisms including cucurbitacins, nitrogen, sticky phloem sap, or toxicity. Although more susceptible on average, C. p. pepo cultivars showed stronger induced resistance, suggesting a trade-off between constitutive and induced resistance. To test the hypothesis that leaf volatiles accounted for differences in resistance to caterpillars, we devised a novel method to evaluate resistance on artificial diet while larvae are exposed to leaf volatiles. In both subspecies, cultivar-specific induced volatiles that reduced T. ni growth were present in highly inducible cultivars, but absent in those that showed no induction. These results have important agricultural implications as cultivar-specific resistance to caterpillars mirrored that of specialist beetles from field trials. Overall, the eponymous cucurbitacin defenses of the Cucurbitaceae are not the mechanistic basis of differences in constitutive or induced resistance between C. pepo subspecies or cultivars. Instead, deterrent cultivar-specific volatiles appear to provide general resistance to insect herbivores. Divergence during breeding history within and between subspecies revealed this pattern and novel resistance mechanism, defining new targets for plant breeding.

Factors influencing the movement of livestock guardian dogs in the Edwards Plateau of Texas: implications for efficacy, behavior, and territoriality	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Canis lupus familiaris; livestock guardian dog; nonlethal predator control; site fidelity; Texas; wildlife damage management	PROTECTION DOGS; SHEEP; CATTLE	Livestock guardian dog (Canis lupus familiaris; LGD) breeds of domestic dog worldwide provide a degree of control over predation losses. The application of LGDs as a wildlife damage management tool evolved as a cultural practice in the Old World. In the 1970s, this tool emerged in North America. Despite several decades of science and application, gaps still exist in our knowledge regarding applications for LGDs. From February 2016 to November 2017, we deployed global positioning system transmitters on 4 LGDs on a 20-km(2) ranch in Menard County, Texas, USA operated by Texas A&M AgriLife Research to investigate their fine scale movement and activity patterns, site fidelity to livestock management units ( i.e., pastures), and fidelity to anthropogenic features, such as feed and water locations. he LGDs remained within study site boundaries for 90% of the study period. Additionally, daily activity patterns differed for dogs associated primarily with sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). All of the LGDs we studied were active throughout the 24-hour day. We determined that feed and water locations concentrated LGD activity to an extent, likely reflecting a livestock affinity for water sources, and provide an additional method by which to distribute them over the landscape. Our results, based on a small sample size, suggest that LGDs may provide effective association with livestock management areas, maintain a high fidelity to area perimeter boundaries, and distribute themselves across the area of use.

Most research regarding the efficacy of LGDs has been based on queries of rancher satisfaction with LGD performance, yet little is known regarding LGD influence on mesocarnivores, including those species against which they protect livestock. Here, we provide some preliminary observations regarding the effect of LGDs deployed with sheep and goat herds from May 2016 to April 2017 on the detected activity of mesocarnivores within occupied pastures on a 2,027-ha ranch in Menard County, central Texas, USA. Specifically, we were interested in learning if the presence of LGDs might affect the activity of nontarget mesocarnivores (i.e., mammalian predators that do not pose a predation threat to sheep or goats) apart from carnivores that do. To conduct this research, we deployed global positioning system radio-collars on 4 LGDs to record their positions and evaluate their spatial distribution across the ranch over the course of the study. To detect and quantify the presence of these carnivores across the ranch, we established a grid of remote cameras that continuously surveyed for their presence over the course of a year. We detected 8 mesocarnivore species and documented variable effects on activity by each species in relation to the locations of the radio-marked LGDs. Environmental factors rather than LGD presence accounted for most of the variation we observed in mesocarnivore activity. Mesocarnivore activity was also highest in areas without livestock. For those concerned with livestock-wildlife coexistence, our results suggest that LGD presence does not alter the activity of mesocarnivores not typically identified as a threat to sheep and goats. For those managing for livestock predation, our results suggest that LGD presence may negatively influence the activity of bobcats (Lynx rufus), though this effect was not independent from the influence of elevation.

Capsaicin as a tool for repelling southern flying squirrels from red-cockaded woodpecker cavities	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS			English	Article						capsaicin; deterrent; Dryobates borealis; Glaucomys volans; red-cockaded woodpecker; southern flying squirrel		The southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is an important kleptoparasite of cavities excavated by the imperiled red-cockaded woodpecker (Dryobates borealis). Flying squirrel usurpation of cavities may affect woodpecker productivity, but current efforts to manage flying squirrels are costly and time consuming. We assessed whether capsaicin could deter flying squirrel use of woodpecker cavities on a site in southwest Georgia, USA. Twenty-nine cavity tree clusters received 4 treatments: capsaicin, water, air, and a control (no treatment). Only capsaicin both removed more flying squirrels from the cavity immediately after its application and decreased the probability of a flying squirrel occupying the cavity the next day. The data presented supports the potential of capsaicin to provide a more efficient way for dealing with this common kleptoparasite.

Predicting black bear activity at back-country campsites in Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS			English	Article						black bears; Bryce Canyon National Park; campsite assessment; human-bear interactions; Paunsaugunt Plateau; Ursus americanus; Utah	GRIZZLY BEAR; BROWN; RIVER; CONFLICT; BEHAVIOR; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; SIZE	Developing the capacity to predict black bear (Ursus americanus; bear) activity in a diversity of habitats will help conserve bear populations and their habitats and minimize human-bear conflicts. This capacity will be particularly important in areas that provide bear habitat and offer backcountry hiking and camping experiences. Bryce Canyon National Park (BRCA), located on the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau in southern Utah, USA, provides important bear habitat and offers visitors 12 backcountry campsites. To effectively manage these areas to minimize human-bear conflicts, park managers will need better information about black bear use of these campsites and other anthropogenic features in the BRCA. From 2014-2016, we studied the nature and frequency of bear activity within BRCA, with an emphasis on bear-campsite relationships, by analyzing bear activity data using radio-collared bears, remote camera monitoring of areas containing features of interest, campsite assessments, and analysis of human-bear interaction reports. We further assessed and ranked each backcountry campsite regarding its bear habitat quality, bear displacement potential, and human-bear conflict potential. Model selection showed bear preference for campsites and springs and avoidance of trails and roads. During site assessments, we identified a number of modifications to existing campsites that may help minimize human- bear interactions. Foremost among these changes is the relocation of campsites farther off-trail to avoid bears using trails. Specifically, we recommend that campsites be no closer than 200 m to permanent water sources. Finally, while the park requires the use of bear-resistant food containers, we recommend backcountry visitors also be encouraged to carry bear spray.

The ratio of L-asparaginase to beta-D-glucosidase activities had a significant negative correlation with potentially mineralizable N. In addition, the ratio of arylsulfatase to beta-D-glucosidase activities showed a significant negative correlation with available S. Thus, it seems plausible that microorganisms in the soil would allocate their resources to synthesis of N-center dot and S-acquiring enzymes in response to variation in the nutrient availability caused by fertilization and over time. Also, the ratio of microbial biomass C/P had a significant negative correlation with available P, suggesting that this stoichiometry could reflect P availability in the soil. These results imply that microbial biomass and ecoenzymatic stoichiometries are useful for evaluating nutrient availability in soils.

The OPAL Water Survey is a citizen science approach to assessing water quality by recording the presence/absence of 13 easily identifiable freshwater invertebrate groups. The survey generates a score (the Pond Health Score) that can usefully inform urban freshwater wildlife conservation, as well as engaging urban residents with nature. The main aim of this study was to investigate the capability of the OPAL Pond Health Score to assess the overall ecological status of urban drainage ponds. We applied linear regression between the OPAL Score from 78 drainage ponds across Scotland and a measure of ecological status obtained by the dimension reduction (Principal Coordinate Analysis) of five widely-used ecological indicators: taxonomic richness of amphibians, macroinvertebrates and macrophytes, and adjacent terrestrial habitat richness and degree of urbanization. The OPAL Pond Health Score was strongly correlated with ponds' ecological status established using the five ecological indicators (Pearson's r = 0.86, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, this relationship was generally consistent, both across the entire range of OPAL Scores, and in relation to the different invertebrate groups involved. Thus, the OPAL Pond Health Score has great value as a quick stand-alone assessment method, and offers clear opportunities for collaboration between citizen scientists, government agencies and professional researchers.

Considerable uncertainty exists in the responses of global soil organic and microbial carbon to future climate change. In this study, future changes in the global soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial carbon (MBC) pools are simulated using TRIPLEX-MICROBE, which considers and predicts microbial activity, under three future representative concentration pathways (RCPs) in the 21st century. Between 2013 and 2100, TRIPLEX-MICROBE simulates decreases in SOC from 1099 Pg (petagrams, 10(12) kg) to 1032 Pg, 996 Pg and 924 Pg under RCP scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, representing reductions of approximately 6.1%, 9.4% and 15.9%, respectively. The MBC reaches a stable state after 2030 under RCP2.6, and it increases from 20.89 Pg to 23.78 Pg between 2013 and 2100. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, MBC increases by 20.3% and 39.6%, respectively, between 2013 and 2100. The SOC stored in the Arctic declines under the priming effect; however, as the climate gradually warms from the equator to the mid-latitudes, the Northern Hemisphere becomes a larger carbon sink, which could offset the carbon losses from high-latitude and high-altitude regions. The latitude where the MBC reaches its maximum during the coldest season of a year in the Northern Hemisphere moves northward approximately 10 degrees under the three RCPs from the latitude in the historical period. Tropical and temperate vegetation expand northward gradually with warming, and vegetation fixes more carbon as it migrates northward to offset the increase in atmospheric CO2.

In India about 40% of the floral species have long been recognized to be aliens, but the need for priority conservation efforts has only been felt since the turn of the century. Thus, it is now of utmost importance to predict the potential distribution of invasive alien species and identify suitable environmental conditions that allow the species to spread rapidly. The invasive plant Mikania micrantha was chosen as the test species. Native occurrence records (longitude and latitude) were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). For Indian occurrences, GBIF records were supplemented with occurrences from herbaria label data and information gathered from published literature. Nineteen climatic variables were obtained from World-Clim datable. To predict the potential distribution, species distribution models (SDMs) were built by using logistic regression and the climatic variables were chosen by using two cross-validated regularization methods induced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) and the ridge penalty function. This approach has twofold benefits; it deals with the multicollinearity problem efficiently and selects the raw environmental covariates. F-j3-score was utilized to measure the models' performance. Combining the data from both native and alien ranges, seven environmental predictors were selected using four different background choices. Using lasso penalty, mean diurnal range (mean of monthly (max temp min temp)) (BIO2), Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (x 100) (BIO3), Temperature Annual Range (BIOS-BIO6) (BIO7), Precipitation of Wettest Month (BIO13), Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (BIO15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) were found to be strong correlates for all four backgrounds. The predicted probabilities from the model containing these seven selected variables, demonstrated higher invasion risk in the central part of India than the model containing all the predictors. Accurate analysis of present distributions and effective predictive modelling of future distributions of invasive alien species is of vital importance for the early detection of the invasion and rapid remedial actions downstream. This study may aid in the adoption of management initiatives like early detection and rapid response. This could result in identifying both new populations and established populations to be prioritized for management.

However, we currently lack a clear understanding under which circumstances proposed biodiversity indicators are valid indicators and when they are not. Here we conducted a large-scale restoration experiment by emulating natural disturbances through prescribed burning and gap-cutting. From this experiment data of resident forest birds was used to, (1) identify biodiversity indicators in the middle and northern boreal zone, (2) test the effect of forest restoration practices on biodiversity indicators and (3) explore the patterns when biodiversity indicator analyses are performed across a wider range of forest types including both restored and unrestored sites. Additionally, to understand the occurrence of species we correlated their occurrence with local habitat structures across different forest types. We found that both the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tri-dactylus) and Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) were important biodiversity indicators for the middle/northern boreal zone. The occurrence of these species can generally be used to identify species rich areas across different forest types. However, the three-toed woodpecker, the best indicator for unrestored forest, lost its indicator value after prescribed burning; in these stands the goldcrest (Regulus regulus) was the best biodiversity indicator. Based on habitat associations, we suggest that biodiversity indicators in boreal forest not only indicate high species richness but also structural habitat complexity. Our results draw attention to the fact that one must be careful about using previously identified biodiversity indicators in ecosystems subjected to ecological restoration.

Resolving taxonomic ambiguities: Effects on rarity, projected richness, and indices in macroinvertebrate datasets	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Resolution; Biodiversity; Non-parametric; Ambiguous; Benthos; Macro-invertebrate	SPECIES RICHNESS; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; PERFORMANCE; ESTIMATORS; CONSERVATION; STREAMS; FOREST; FAUNA; SIZE	Biodiversity information is an important basis for ecological research and environmental assessment, and can be impacted by choices made in the manipulation and analysis of taxonomic data. Such choices include methods for resolving multiple redundant levels of taxonomic resolution, as typically arise with morphological identification of damaged or immature aquatic macro-invertebrates. In particular, the effects of these processing choices on number of rare taxa are poorly understood yet potentially significant to the estimation of projected taxa richness and related evaluations such as biodiversity conservation value and survey sufficiency. Using aquatic macro invertebrate data collected for two nearshore areas of Lake Superior, we determined how multiple methods of resolving taxonomic redundancies influence two commonly-used estimates of projected richness, Chaol and Chao2, which hinge on the ratio of taxa that are singletons to doubletons (i.e., just one versus two individuals found) or uniques versus duplicates (i.e., just one versus two occurrences). We also determined how choice of ambiguous taxa method, including some modified specifically to retain rare taxa and others taken from the literature, influenced effort to reach 95% of projected richness, site-level richness and abundance, and representative invertebrate IBI scores. We found that Chaol was more sensitive to method choice than Chao2, because singleton and doubleton status was more frequently affected when taxa were deleted, merged, or reassigned in the process of resolving taxonomic redundancies than was unique and duplicate status. Methods that eliminated redundant taxa at the site scale but not the study-area scale tended to overinflate study area and projected richness, and resulted in a significant loss of abundance. The method that aggregated or deleted redundant taxa depending on abundance resulted in a decrease in site and study area richness, abundance, and an underestimation of projected richness. Methods which re-assigned parents to common children retained a majority of richness and abundance information and a more realistic estimate of projected taxa richness; however, the identity of poorly-identified parents was imputed. All methods resulted in little effect to typical IBI scores. Overall, no one method is fully capable of removing spurious richness at the study-area scale while preserving all taxa occurrence, abundance and rarity patterns. Therefore, the most appropriate method for making comparisons among sites may be different than the most appropriate method for comparing among surveys or among study areas, or if a goal is to estimate projected taxa richness or retain rare taxa information.

Modifications in the environment, especially those caused by mankind, are considered the leading cause for species extinction. Such a response from the species is not random, with patterns that can follow functionality and/or morphology of each taxa. In this context, the objective of this study was to assess how environmental factors affect adult Odonata species, testing the hypotheses: a) that the environment acts as a filter upon the species by means of facilitating or excluding specific characteristics and b) that because of the order's requirements for thermoregulation and reproduction, thorax width and oviposition type are the variables most affected in the group. A total of 97 streams were sampled in eastern Amazonia, distributed along a gradient of different states of preservation, from completely preserved to heavily impacted by plantations and livestock. Six functional characteristics and seven environmental descriptors were selected, and to assess their relationships, a combination of Fourth Corner and RLQ analysis was used. The Habitat Integrity Index was the descriptor with the biggest impact on the Odonata community, presenting a negative correlation with wing width, thorax width and exophytic oviposition, and a positive correlation with endophytic oviposition. Macrophyte cover was the next most relevant environmental descriptor, showing a negative correlation with abdomen length, and positive correlation with thorax width and exophytic oviposition. The results show that poorly preserved environments favour the occurrence of organisms with a wider thorax and the substitution of endophytic oviposition with the exophytic type. Since changes to the environment do not usually alter Odonata richness but rather the composition, these results show a favouritism for groups with mentioned characteristics, such as Libellulidae, to the detriment of other groups (especially Zygoptera), which can result in community homogeneity and both biodiversity and functional loss. The maintenance of well-preserved environments is therefore indispensable in assuring Odonata biodiversity, as well as the best way to preserve the different behavioural and ecophysiological groups in the order. The Odonata community's response, directed through its morphological and behavioural characteristics, sheds light on ecological patterns, and thus the addition of oviposition habits in conservation measures aimed at preserving the order can render them more adequate, as this is a critical aspect of population maintenance and colonization of new sites.

We tested if the response of littoral macroinvertebrate communities to human shoreline alterations is consistent among geographical regions. We compared community composition and diversity of human altered with those of unmodified littoral zones from 51 lakes across seven European countries in four geographical regions based on pooled composite as well as habitat-specific macroinvertebrate samples. Taxon richness and community composition differed among shore types and different habitats in all geographic regions, with morphological alteration having an overall negative effect on macroinvertebrate taxon richness. In addition, habitat heterogeneity also had a strong effect on littoral communities, with highest taxon richness found in the structurally complex macrophyte habitats in all regions. Average proportional densities of Diptera and Oligochaeta taxa generally increased in morphologically altered shores in all geographical regions, while Bivalvia, Crustacea, Ephemeroptera, Gastropoda and Trichoptera showed comparatively lower numbers in many anthropogenically altered sites. Furthermore, taxon richness was positively correlated with habitat diversity. We were able to relate changes in littoral communities to anthropogenic shoreline alterations, and linked the effect to the loss of habitats and habitat complexity. The results of our study demonstrate that littoral macro invertebrates respond consistently negative to the influence of morphological alterations across European geographical regions in terms of biodiversity. While macroinvertebrates have previously been identified to be useful descriptors of morphological change in single countries/regions, we can now validate that they can be used to assess the ecological status of lakes in terms of morphological alterations across European regions. Our results can be used to further improve ealready existing WFD-compliant multimetric indices, for example by including taxa groups, which show a strong reaction to shoreline alterations. This could be supported by the inclusion of a suit of indicator taxa reflecting the loss of complex habitats such as macrophytes in the lake littoral.
