Grizzly bear response to spatio-temporal variability in human recreational activity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						grizzly bear; habitat selection; human activity; iSSA; linear disturbance; movement ecology; recreation; trails	RESOURCE SELECTION; HABITAT-SELECTION; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; PREDATION RISK; ROADS; CARIBOU; ALBERTA; WOLVES; ELK	Outdoor recreation on trail networks is a growing form of disturbance for wildlife. However, few studies have examined behavioural responses by large carnivores to motorised and non-motorised recreational activity - a knowledge gap that has implications for the success of human access management aimed at improving habitat quality for wildlife. We used an integrated step selection analysis of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) radiotelemetry data and a spatio-temporal model of motorised and non-motorised human recreational activity to examine how human recreational activity on trails affects both habitat selection and movement behaviour of individual bears. Grizzly bears were captured and radiocollared in the west-central Alberta Rocky Mountains and Foothills, and trail cameras were deployed on trails to obtain data on human recreational activity. We found that models including data on recreational activity outperformed trail-proximity models when interactions with movement covariates were included. Responses were highly variable among individuals and across classes: males, females, and females with cubs. Male and solitary female grizzly bears increased avoidance of trails with a high probability of motorised activity as well as displaying increased movement rates in response to motorised recreation. Females with cubs did not increase avoidance, however they had the largest response in terms of higher movement rates. In contrast, for all classes, selection for proximity to trail increased when probability of non-motorised activity was high, and the effect on movement was dampened relative to the motorised response. Synthesis and applications. By combining selection and movement into a unified modelling framework, we show that bears alter selection and movement behaviour in response to trails and recreation, and that such responses are determined by the type of recreational activity. Reduced selection and increased movement in proximity to motorised trails could affect bears' ability to exploit foraging opportunities in these areas. Future access management actions for grizzly bear recovery should consider frequency and type of linear feature use by humans rather than solely relying on thresholds relating to feature densities.

However, recreation can also have severe ecological impacts. The recreational value of landscapes and natural areas is often used to generate support for public spending in conservation. However, we still don't know whether nature-based recreationists place greater recreational value on natural areas that have high conservation value compared to other green spaces. Here, we determine which attributes of nature-based tourism provide recreational services. We used pictures of wildlife posted on Flickr to quantify wildlife watching activities in Scotland. We then determined the environmental variables key to attracting wildlife watchers to a destination, such as protected areas (PAs), the perceived naturalness, and the presence of different types of infrastructure. Infrastructure best predicts the intensity of wildlife watching activities in Scotland, while areas of high natural value are rarely used. PAs are weak attractors of wildlife watchers, with PAs designated to protect threatened habitats or species having low recreational value. In accessible and highly visited areas, higher biodiversity increases the intensity of wildlife watching activities. Synthesis and applications. Areas of high natural and conservation value and areas of high recreational value do not tend to overlap. Recreational ecosystem services are mainly provided by the wider countryside and highly transformed landscapes, as opposed to wild ecosystems and protected areas designated to protect environmental features of high conservation value. These results question the synergy between the goals of recreation and those of conservation and the use of recreation as a justification for economic investment in conservation. During wildlife watching activities most people experience an urbanised, highly transformed nature; it is important to determine how this human-dominated nature can influence support for conservation of wild and remote areas.

Flow-ecology relationships are spatially structured and differ among flow regimes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						environmental flows; fish; hydrology; life-history strategies; spatial autocorrelation; spatial stream network models; streams; traits	LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; MOVING-AVERAGE APPROACH; GLOBAL-SCALE ANALYSIS; FRESH-WATER FISHES; HYDROLOGIC ALTERATION; STATISTICAL-MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAM; TRAITS; DIVERSIFICATION	In streams, hydrology is a predominant driver of ecological structure and function. Providing adequate flows to support aquatic life, or environmental flows, is therefore a top management priority in stream systems. Flow regime classification is a widely accepted approach for establishing environmental flow guidelines. However, it is surprisingly difficult to quantify relationships between hydrology and ecology (flow-ecology relationships) while describing how these relationships vary across classified flow regimes. Developing such relationships is complicated by several sources of spatial bias, such as autocorrelation due to spatial design, flow regime classification and other environmental or ecological sources of spatial bias. We used mixed moving-average spatial stream network models to develop flow-ecology relationships across classified flow regimes and to assess spatial patterns of these relationships. We compared relationships between fish traits and life-history strategies with hydrologic metrics across flow regimes and assessed whether spatial autocorrelation influenced these relationships. Trait-hydrology relationships varied between flow regimes and across all streams combined. Some relationships between traits and hydrologic metrics fit predictions based on life-history theory, while others exhibited unexpected relationships with hydrology. Spatial factors described a large proportion of variability in fish traits and different patterns of spatial autocorrelation were observed in different flow regimes. Synthesis and applications. Further work is needed to understand why flow-ecology relationships vary across classified flow regimes and why these relationships may not fit predictions based on life-history theories. Managers determining environmental flow standards need to be aware that different hydrologic metrics are often important drivers of fish trait diversity in different flow regimes. Flow-ecology relationships may therefore be confounded by spatial structure inherent in flow regime classification and much existing biological data. Complex patterns of spatial bias should be considered when managing stream systems within an environmental flows framework.

A nonpolar product of microbial degradation derived from the surfactant nonylphenol polyethoxylate, 4-nonylphenol is capable of long-range transport attached to particulates. Bioactive concentrations of 4-nonylphenol have been found in the surface water, soils, snow, and particulate matter of the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains (USA) hundreds of miles from their origins. As a result of particulate deposition, seasonal and glacial snow pack concentrations measured 20 to 100 times higher than in surface waters. Batch desorption assays were run on particulate matter dosed with 4-nonylphenol. Desorption was measured in 63 to 500 mu m particles under 2 different temperature conditions with varying fractions of organic carbon in turbulent or undisturbed states. Lower temperatures (4 degrees C) decreased the mean percentage of 4-nonylphenol released from particulates in disturbed and undisturbed conditions, whereas the mean percentage of 4-nonylphenol released at 20 degrees C was reduced by agitation. The effect of agitation at 4 degrees C was not practically or statistically significant. Particulates with a higher percentage of organic carbon (75%) released very little of the bound 4-nonylphenol (0.53%) compared with particulates containing 4 to 5% of organic carbon that released up to 13%. Larger particles released the least amount of 4-nonylphenol, whereas smaller particles released the most amount. Water and sediment samples taken from below the Palisades Glacier in the Sierra Nevada Mountains showed the greatest 4-nonylphenol concentrations directly below the glacier, implying that glacial particulates will release adsorbed 4-nonylphenol.

Baseline transdermal kinetics in adult aquatic and arboreal frog species have recently been reported; however, there is little information regarding absorption kinetics in adult terrestrial species. The present study investigated the in vitro absorption kinetics of 3 model chemicals-caffeine, benzoic acid, and ibuprofen-through different skin regions in the terrestrial toad Rhinella marina. Caffeine flux was consistently higher than that of the other 2 chemicals (p < 0.001), whereas the fluxes of the moderately and highly lipophilic chemicals (benzoic acid and ibuprofen) were similar, regardless of skin region. When considering individual chemicals, caffeine demonstrated increased flux through the ventral pelvic skin compared with the ventral thoracic or dorsal skin regions. Flux did not differ between skin regions for either benzoic acid or ibuprofen. These findings have implications for management of environmental contamination in frog habitats, as many environmental xenobiotics are of moderate to high lipophilicity and would be expected to be equally absorbed from all skin surfaces in terrestrial toads.

Broadcast spawning species release gametes into the water column for external fertilization, directly exposing sperm to potential aquatic stressors. To determine if cyanobacteria can disrupt reproduction in freshwater broadcast spawners, we evaluated sublethal effects of cyanobacteria exposure on quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) sperm. In laboratory studies, sperm were collected after inducing mussels to spawn using serotonin and exposed to 11 cultures of cyanobacteria including Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Dolichospermum lemmermannii, Gloeotrichia echinulata, 5 cultures of Microcystis aeruginosa, M. wesenbergii, and Planktothrix suspensa. Sperm motility, using endpoints of cumulative distance traveled and mean velocity, was calculated for a minimum of 10 individual sperm using a novel optical biotracking assay method. The distance and velocity at which sperm traveled decreased when exposed to Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and 2 M. aeruginosa cultures. Our findings indicate that cyanobacteria impede the motility of quagga mussel sperm, which can potentially result in reproductive impairments to mussels and potentially other broadcast spawning species.

Target site model: Predicting mode of action and aquatic organism acute toxicity using Abraham parameters and feature-weighted k-nearest neighbors classification	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Mode of action; Environmental modeling; Pesticide risk assessment; Aquatic toxicology	CLASSIFYING ENVIRONMENTAL-POLLUTANTS; DISCRIMINATING TOXICANT CLASSES; NARCOTIC CHEMICALS; TECHNICAL BASIS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CONSTRUCTION; PARTITION; POLAR; QSAR	A database of 1480 chemicals with 47 associated modes of action compiled from the literature encompasses a wide range of chemical classes (alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and polar compounds) and includes toxicity data for 79 different aquatic genera. The data were split into a calibration group and a validation group (80/20) to apply k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) methodology to predict the toxic mode of action for the compound. Other approaches were tested (support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis) as well as variations in the k-NN technique (distance weighting, feature weighting). Best-prediction results were found with k = 3, in a voting platform with optimized feature weighting. Using the predicted mode of action, the appropriate polyparameter target site model for that mode of action is applied to calculate the 50% lethal concentration (LC50). Predicted LC50s for the validation database resulted in a root-mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.752. This can be compared to an RMSE of 0.655 for the same validation set using the reference mode of action labels. The complete database resulted in an RMSE of 0.793 for reference mode of action labels. This confirms that the classification model has sufficient accuracy for predicting the mode of action and for determining toxicity using the target site model. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:375-386.

Honey bee colony models can control exposures and other environmental factors, as well as assess links among pollen and nectar residues in the landscape, their influx into the colony, and the resulting exposures and effects on bees at different developmental stages. We extended the colony model BEEHAVE to represent exposure to the insecticide clothianidin via residues in pollen from treated cornfields set in real agricultural landscapes in the US Midwest. We assessed their potential risks to honey bee colonies over a 1-yr cycle. Clothianidin effects on colony strength were only observed if unrealistically high residue levels in the pollen were simulated. The landscape composition significantly impacted the collection of pollen (residue exposure) from the cornfields, resulting in higher colony-level effects in landscapes with lower proportions of semi-natural land. The application of the extended BEEHAVE model with a pollen exposure-effects module provides a case study for the application of a mechanistic honey bee colony model in pesticide risk assessment integrating the impact of a range of landscape compositions.

Because soil properties and reaction time can alter metal speciation, speciation should influence metal bioaccessibility. For example, under gastrointestinal conditions, it is expected that metal species will differ in bioaccessibility depending on their stability in acidic pH environments. We studied the links between metal speciation and bioaccessibility. A combination of synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was used to identify the zinc (Zn) speciation in spiked and smelter-affected soils. After conducting in vitro digestion tests on the soil samples, XANES and linear combination fitting were carried out on the residual pellets to identify the species of Zn that remained after digesting the soils in the simulated gastric and duodenal fluids. The metal species that were not present in the residual pellets were inferred to have been dissolved and, thus, more bioaccessible. Sphalerite (ZnS), ZnO, and outer-sphere Zn contributed more to Zn bioaccessibility than franklinite (ZnFe2O4) and Zn incorporated into a hydroxy interlayer mineral (Zn-HIM). The bioaccessibility of Zn-aluminum layered double hydroxides (Zn-Al-LDH) was found to be inversely proportional to its residence time in soil. It was also observed that the relatively high pH of the duodenum favors metal reprecipitation and readsorption, leading to a reduction in bioaccessible metal concentration. These results imply that metal speciation mainly controls metal bioaccessibility. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:448-459. (c) 2018 SETAC.

Senescence can be affected by trade-offs and behavioural strategies in adults but may also be affected by developmental stress. Developmental stress can accelerate telomere degradation, with long-term longevity and fitness consequences. Little is known regarding whether variation in developmental stress and telomere dynamics contributes to patterns of senescence during adulthood. We investigated this question in the dimorphic white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), a species in which adults of the two morphs exhibit established differences in behavioural strategy and patterns of senescence, and also evaluated the relationship between oxidative stress and telomere length. Tan morph females, which exhibit high levels of unassisted parental care, display faster reproductive senescence than white females, and faster actuarial senescence than all of the other morph-sex classes. We hypothesized that high oxidative stress and telomere attrition in tan female nestlings could contribute to this pattern, since tan females are small and potentially at a competitive disadvantage even as nestlings. Nestlings that were smaller than nest mates had higher oxidative stress, and nestlings with high oxidative stress and fast growth rates displayed shorter telomeres. However, we found no consistent morph-sex differences in oxidative stress or telomere length. Results suggest that oxidative stress and fast growth contribute to developmental telomere attrition, with potential ramifications for adults, but that developmental oxidative stress and telomere dynamics do not account for morph-sex differences in senescence during adulthood.

Strikingly high levels of heterozygosity despite 20 years of inbreeding in a clonal honey bee	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						fitness; heterozygosity; honey bees; inbreeding	APIS-MELLIFERA-CAPENSIS; THELYTOCOUS-PARTHENOGENESIS; LAYING WORKERS; CENTRAL FUSION; RECOMBINATION; GENOME; CONSEQUENCES; HETEROSIS; LINEAGE; MAINTENANCE	Inbreeding (the mating between closely related individuals) often has detrimental effects that are associated with loss of heterozygosity at overdominant loci, and the expression of deleterious recessive alleles. However, determining which loci are detrimental when homozygous, and the extent of their phenotypic effects, remains poorly understood. Here, we utilize a unique inbred population of clonal (thelytokous) honey bees, Apis mellifera capensis, to determine which loci reduce individual fitness when homozygous. This asexual population arose from a single worker ancestor approximately 20 years ago and has persisted for at least 100 generations. Thelytokous parthenogenesis results in a 1/3 of loss of heterozygosity with each generation. Yet, this population retains heterozygosity throughout its genome due to selection against homozygotes. Deep sequencing of one bee from each of the three known sub-lineages of the population revealed that 3,766 of 10,884 genes (34%) have retained heterozygosity across all sub-lineages, suggesting that these genes have heterozygote advantage. The maintenance of heterozygosity in the same genes and genomic regions in all three sub-lineages suggests that nearly every chromosome carries genes that show sufficient heterozygote advantage to be selectively detrimental when homozygous.

Costs of weaponry: Unarmed males sire more offspring than armed males in a male-dimorphic mite	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						Acaridae; alternative reproductive phenotype; alternative reproductive tactic; diet; major; minor; reproduction; sexual selection	ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS; 2 MALE MORPHS; BULB MITE; RHIZOGLYPHUS-ROBINI; SPERM COMPETITION; SEXUAL SELECTION; LIFE-HISTORY; TRADE-OFFS; TRAITS; EVOLUTION	Morphological structures used as weapons in male-male competition are not only costly to develop but are also probably costly to maintain during adulthood. Therefore, having weapons could reduce the energy available for other fitness-enhancing actions, such as post-copulatory investment. We tested the hypothesis that armed males make lower post-copulatory investments than unarmed males, and that this difference will be most pronounced under food-limited conditions. We performed two experiments using the male-dimorphic bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini, in which males are either armed "fighters" or unarmed "scramblers." Firstly, we tested whether fighters and scramblers differed in their reproductive output after being starved or fed for 1 or 2 weeks. Secondly, we measured the reproductive output of scramblers and fighters (starved or fed) after one, two or three consecutive matings. Scramblers sired more offspring than fighters after 1 week, but scramblers and fighters only sired a few offspring after 2 weeks. Scramblers also sired more offspring than fighters at the first mating, and males rarely sired offspring after consecutive matings. Contrary to our hypothesis, the fecundity of starved and fed males did not differ. The higher reproductive output of scramblers suggests that, regardless of nutritional state, scramblers make larger post-copulatory investments than fighters. Alternatively, (cryptic) female choice generally favours scramblers. Why the morphs differed in their reproductive output is unclear. Neither morph performed well relatively late in life or after multiple matings. It remains to be investigated to what extent the apparent scrambler advantage contributes to the maintenance and evolution of male morph expression.	[Van den Beuken, Tom P.

The evolution of call traits is expected to be associated with the evolution of anatomical and behavioural traits due to the physics of call emission and transmission. The evolution of vocalizations might imply trade-offs with other energetically costly behaviours, such as parental care. Here, we investigated the association between body size, calling site, parental care and call properties (call duration, number of notes, peak frequency, frequency bandwidth and call structure) of the advertisement calls of glassfrogs (Centrolenidae)-a family of Neotropical, leaf-dwelling anurans-using phylogenetic comparative methods. We also explored the tempo and mode of evolution of these traits and compared them with those of three morphological traits associated with body size, locomotion and feeding. We generated and compiled acoustic data for 72 glassfrog species (46% of total species richness), including representatives of all genera. We found that almost all acoustic traits have significant, but generally modest, phylogenetic signal. Peak frequency of calls is significantly associated with body size, whereas call structure is significantly associated with calling site and paternal care. Thus, the evolution of body size, calling site and paternal care could constrain call evolution. The estimated disparity of acoustic traits was larger than that of morphological traits and the peak in disparity of acoustic traits generally occurred later in the evolution of glassfrogs, indicating a historically recent outset of the acoustic divergence in this clade.

Releasing small ejaculates slowly increases per-gamete fertilization success in an external fertilizer: Galeolaria caespitosa (Polychaeta: Serpulidae)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						broadcast spawning; external fertilization; natural selection; reproductive phenology; sexual selection; sperm competition	SPERM COMPETITION GAMES; SEX-CHANGE; BROADCAST SPAWNERS; SIZE; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; STRATEGIES; SELECTION; DENSITY; HERMAPHRODITISM	The idea that male reproductive strategies evolve primarily in response to sperm competition is almost axiomatic in evolutionary biology. However, externally fertilizing species, especially broadcast spawners, represent a large and taxonomically diverse group that have long challenged predictions from sperm competition theory-broadcast spawning males often release sperm slowly, with weak resource-dependent allocation to ejaculates despite massive investment in gonads. One possible explanation for these counter-intuitive patterns is that male broadcast spawners experience strong natural selection from the external environment during sperm dispersal. Using a manipulative experiment, we examine how male reproductive success in the absence of sperm competition varies with ejaculate size and rate of sperm release, in the broadcast spawning marine invertebrate Galeolaria caespitosa (Polychaeta: Serpulidae). We find that the benefits of Fast or Slow sperm release depend strongly on ejaculate size, but also that the per-gamete fertilization rate decreases precipitously with ejaculate size. Overall, these results suggest that, if males can facultatively adjust ejaculate size, they should slowly release small amounts of sperm. Recent theory for broadcast spawners predicts that sperm competition can also select for Slow release rates. Taken together, our results and theory suggest that selection often favours Slow ejaculate release rates whether males experience sperm competition or not.

Different species of frugivorous birds perch in these trees, dropping fruit and seeds in their shade. This species, constantly exposed to intense winds from the north, favors and has a selective effect on the establishment of species from the seasonal dry forest beneath its canopy. In this study we evaluated the direction of prevailing wind and its relationship to canopy shape (thigmotropism). We also evaluated differences in the abundance and richness of the plants that establish in the shade of D. americana by comparing trees exposed and not exposed (control) to the prevailing winds. The results indicate that the prevailing winds come from the north and that D. americana is sensitive to both wind strength and direction (F(3)=13.43, P<0.001). Its canopy stretches towards the south, where we find greater plant cover (F(3)=29.61 P<0.001) and a different species composition compared with the cover to the north. Canopy asymmetry results in differences in the abundance and composition of the species below, and this may have consequences to the process of succession. D. americana trees contribute to the regeneration and conservation of seasonal forest on the coast of central Veracruz, Mexico.

Rainfall interception by six urban trees in San Juan, Puerto Rico	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Interception; Rainfall intensity; Urban trees; Subtropical; Puerto Rico	GROSS RAINFALL; WATER-BALANCE; GREEN SPACE; FOREST; STEMFLOW; THROUGHFALL; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; CANOPY; STREET	Rainfall interception is an important part of the urban hydrological cycle. Understanding is limited about the role of urban trees and other vegetation in the interception process. This study quantified interception losses by six trees in the Caribbean coastal city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, three representing a broadleaf evergreen, and three representing a broadleaf deciduous species. Rainfall was partitioned into throughfall for 13 storms to compare the results between tree types. Total rainfall ranged from 2.9 to 72.4mm, and storm duration spanned 1h to several days. Six of the storms analyzed were characterized by maximum hourly intensity rainfall rates categorized as heavy (> 7.6mm/h). Strong northeasterly winds brought rain in sustained gusts up to 35km/h. Average interception losses totaled 19.7% for both tree types, 22.7% for the deciduous trees, and 16.7% for the evergreen trees. Throughfall exceeded 90% of total rainfall for each of the six trees on one or more occasions, and heavy intensity storms produced negative interception losses in one individual. The effect of tree type on interception was significant for storms of low and moderate intensity, but not heavy intensity. Differences in interception losses between storms of similar intensity and between the two tree types were influenced by leaf area and wind. Results suggest that individual urban tree canopies function as spatio-temporally dynamic storage reservoirs whose interception capacity can vary as micro-meteorological conditions change. These findings help advance understanding about interception processes in humid tropical urban settings.

To assess habitat quality of stormwater management ponds and adjacent urban uplands for wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), we compared life history characteristics between populations breeding across an urbanization gradient. Specifically, we compared body size, ages of breeding adults, and female reproductive investment among urban, suburban, and rural populations in Baltimore County, Maryland, USA. Although there was variation in age at maturity among populations, ages of breeding adults did not differ among urban, suburban, and rural areas. Maternal body size strongly influenced reproductive investment in both species, but relationships did not vary among urban, suburban, and rural populations. Adult wood frogs and American toads from more urbanized landscapes were significantly smaller at age than conspecifics from rural landscapes; the magnitude of differences was similar across adult age classes. Our results suggest that in the urban and rural landscapes that we studied, adult habitats are similar in quality, but either larval or juvenile habitats may be of lower quality in urban areas.

Culturally protected areas including sacred sites are known to contribute to biodiversity conservation in semi-urban and rural areas, but their role in dense urban settings is critically understudied. We, therefore, assessed biodiversity patterns of two types of Hindu places of worship (temples, kattes) and underlying environmental parameters in the Indian megacity of Bengaluru. We analyzed how variables of the urban matrix (age of development, housing density) and type of sacred sites related to biodiversity measures (species abundance, richness, beta diversity), differentiated for cultivated, spontaneous (i.e., wild growing), native and non-native plant species. Native species prevailed in cultivated (66%) and spontaneous (93%) species assemblages, and urbanization parameters significantly related to some biodiversity measures. Beta diversity was highest in sacred sites located in the newest quarters, while abundance of cultivated and non-native species increased with decreasing housing density. Higher richness in low density (i.e., wealthier) quarters demonstrates luxury effect' for sacred sites. Plots in temples showed higher diversity measures than in kattes, likely due to different management practices. While results demonstrate effects of urbanization on biodiversity measures for temples and kattes, these sites still function as habitats for native species in Bengaluru - and not as foci for invasive alien species as noticed for other urban green spaces. We conclude that urban sacred sites allow people to benefit from multiple ecosystems services and thus play an important role in the urban green infrastructure of quickly growing megacities.

Parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC), an unsupervised multi-way analysis approach, was compared to a supervised peak-picking approach. Both approaches produced sensitive regression models capable of predicting contaminant concentration with mean absolute errors (MAE) that ranged from 0.032 to 0.293 mu g L-1 for lake water, and 0.052 to 0.921 mu g L-1 for river water. In addition, results showed accurate detection of contaminant concentrations exceeding 0.25 mu g L-1. However, concentration and variability of natural organic matter (NOM) in natural waters presented unique challenges to peak-picking, PARAFAC, and regression analysis, which were mitigated by expert supervision as well as site-specific and timely calibration.

Productive instability of coral reef fisheries after climate-driven regime shifts	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							FISH POPULATIONS; NURSERY HABITAT; INDIAN-OCEAN; DIPOLE MODE; IMPACTS; SEYCHELLES; VULNERABILITY; DEGRADATION; RECRUITMENT; RESILIENCE	Tropical coastal communities are highly reliant on coral reefs, which provide nutrition and employment for millions of people. Climate-driven coral bleaching events are fundamentally changing coral reef ecosystems and are predicted to reduce productivity of coral reef fish and fisheries, with significant implications for food security and livelihoods. Yet evidence of long-term bleaching impacts on coral reef fishery productivity is lacking. Here, we analyse over 20 years of fish abundance, catch and habitat data to assess long-term impacts of climate-driven coral mass mortality and regime shifts on nearshore artisanal coral reef fisheries in the Seychelles. Contrary to expectations, total catch and mean catch rates were maintained or increased after coral bleaching, consistent with increasing abundance of herbivorous target species in underwater surveys, particularly on macroalgal-dominated reefs. Catch instability increased as habitats followed divergent post-disturbance trajectories and the distribution of target species became more spatially variable, potentially impacting fisher incomes and local market supply chains. Although coral bleaching increased fishery dependence on herbivore species, our results show that climate-impacted reefs can still provide livelihoods and fish protein for coastal communities.

Reef fish functional traits evolve fastest at trophic extremes	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							STABILIZING SELECTION; BODY-SIZE; MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION; DRIVE DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; ATLANTIC TRUMPETFISH; TELEOST FISHES; PLANT DEFENSE; EVOLUTION; DIVERSITY	Trophic ecology is thought to exert a profound influence on biodiversity, but the specifics of the process are rarely examined at large spatial and evolutionary scales. We investigate how trophic position and diet breadth influence functional trait evolution in one of the most species-rich and complex vertebrate assemblages, coral reef fishes, within a large-scale phylogenetic framework. We show that, in contrast with established theory, functional traits evolve fastest in trophic specialists with narrow diet breadths at both very low and high trophic positions. Top trophic level specialists exhibit the most functional diversity, while omnivorous taxa with intermediate trophic positions and wide diet breadth have the least functional diversity. Our results reveal the importance of trophic position in shaping evolutionary dynamics while simultaneously highlighting the incredible trophic and functional diversity present in coral reef fish assemblages.

However, how this sensitivity is affected by long-term thermal regimes is uncertain. There is an expectation that soil microbial respiration rates adapt to the ambient thermal regime, but whether this adaptation magnifies or reduces respiration sensitivities to temperature fluctuations remains unresolved. This gap in understanding is particularly pronounced for drylands because most studies conducted so far have focused on mesic systems. Here, we conduct an incubation study using soil samples from 110 global drylands encompassing a wide gradient in mean annual temperature. We test how mean annual temperature affects soil respiration rates at three assay temperatures while controlling for substrate depletion and microbial biomass. Estimated soil respiration rates at the mean microbial biomass were lower in sites with higher mean annual temperatures across the three assayed temperatures. The patterns observed are consistent with expected evolutionary trade-offs in the structure and function of enzymes under different thermal regimes. Therefore, our results suggest that soil microbial respiration adapts to the ambient thermal regime in global drylands.

While we have some appreciation of how environmental stochasticity can moderate the variability and persistence of communities, we know little about its implications for the nature and predictability of ecological responses to large perturbations. Here, we show that shifts in the temporal autocorrelation (colour) of environmental noise provoke trade-offs in ecological stability across a wide range of different food-web structures by stabilizing dynamics in some dimensions, while simultaneously destabilizing them in others. Specifically, increasingly positive autocorrelation (reddening) of environmental noise increases resilience by hastening the recovery of food webs following a large perturbation, but reduces their resistance to perturbation and increases their temporal variability (reduces biomass stability). In contrast, all stability dimensions become less predictable, showing increased variability around the mean response, as environmental noise reddens. Moreover, we found environmental reddening to be a considerably more important determinant of stability than intrinsic food-web characteristics. These findings reveal the fundamental and dominant role played by environmental stochasticity in determining the dynamics and stability of ecosystems, and extend our understanding of how the multiple dimensions of stability relate to each other beyond simple white noise environments.

Many factors have been hypothesized to affect the uneven distribution of polyploid plants across the globe. Nevertheless, the lack of large comparative datasets has restricted such studies to local floras and to narrow taxonomical scopes, limiting our understanding of the underlying drivers of polyploid plant distribution. We present a map portraying the worldwide polyploid frequencies, based on extensive spatial data coupled with phylogeny-based polyploidy inference for tens of thousands of species. This allowed us to assess the potential global drivers affecting polyploid distribution. Our data reveal a clear latitudinal trend, with polyploid frequency increasing away from the equator. Climate, especially temperature, appears to be the most influential predictor of polyploid distribution. However, we find this effect to be mostly indirect, mediated predominantly by variation in plant lifeforms and, to a lesser extent, by taxonomical composition and species richness. Thus, our study presents an emerging view of polyploid distribution that highlights attributes that facilitate the establishment of new polyploid lineages by providing polyploids with sufficient time (that is, perenniality) and space (low species richness) to compete with pre-adapted diploid relatives.

In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, extensive information on phenotypic and genotypic variation is available, but comparable information on environmental variation within the native range of the species is lacking. Here, we compile 204 geoclimatic variables to describe the local environments of Arabidopsis accessions with known collection sites encompassing a wide geo-environmental range, and fully sequenced genomes from the 1001 Genomes Project. We identify candidate adaptive genetic variation associated with these environmental variables, and validate this approach through comparison with previous experimental studies, and by targeted confirmation of a role of the heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit, AGG3, in cold tolerance, as newly predicted from our environmental genome wide association study (GWAS). To facilitate identification of adaptive variation, we created Arabidopsis CLIMtools: interactive web-based databases of the environment x genome associations and correlations between the local environments and 131 phenotypes compiled from previous experimental GWASs. Our study presents an extensive analysis of the local environments, landscape genomics and phenotypic variation of Arabidopsis, and illustrates how 'in silico GWAS' approaches can inform and complement experimental phenomics studies.

However, the process of within-host de novo mutant generation and evolutionary selection that underlies these antigenic sweeps is poorly understood. Here, we investigate mutational patterns between evolutionarily closely related human seasonal influenza viruses using host age as a proxy for immune experience. The systematic analysis of >25,000 virus sequences showed that individuals with substantially differing immune histories were frequently (30-62%) infected by viruses with identical amino acid sequences. Viruses from immunologically inexperienced individuals were as likely to possess substitutions with potential phenotypic relevance as highly experienced individuals. Mutations likely to cause antigenic changes were rare among closely related viruses and not associated with extent of host immune experience. These findings suggest that individual immune positive selection plays a limited role in the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses.

In addition, the widely accepted notion that immediate post-release active swimming is an indicator of shark condition has never been tested. This study assessed the effects of deck exposure by analysing postrelease behaviour of two species of shark, the draughtboard (Cephaloscyllium laticeps) and the piked spurdog (Squalus megalops) in-situ using a remote-operated-vehicle and in a replicated experiment in controlled conditions. In total, 67 sharks were caught with demersal fish trawls and commercial longlines and subjected to different deck exposures and release environments. Tailbeat rates of deck-exposed sharks were significantly lower than the control sharks, but this effect differed between in-situ and experimental environments. Results indicate that capture has species-specific effects, that post-release effects may last longer than 5 min, and that controlled experiments may not be reliable indicators of post-release effects. Immediate post-release swimming was not a good predictor of post-release behaviour, suggesting capture and release fisheries may have significant sub-lethal effects on some species of shark, and that limiting capture or handling time may reduce post-release effects.

Planktonic copepods display behavioral plasticity and small-scale behaviors associated with different foraging strategies that can affect starvation tolerance. However, little is still known about the influence of behavior on starvation tolerance in zooplankton. Here, we experimentally investigated behavioral changes and survival of planktonic copepods (adults and nauplii) with different foraging strategies under prolonged starvation. The behavioral response to starvation varied depending on the foraging strategy. The strict ambusher Oithona nana showed a low and, almost constant, motile activity (relocation jumps, < 4% of the time) whereas the feeding-current feeder Temora longicornis swam for most of the time (similar to 100%) without reducing their activity under prolonged starvation. The switching-behavior feeder Acartia tonsa move actively in the presence of food but had a low motile activity in absence of food (similar to 12%) and decreased its motile activity during starvation (from similar to 12% to 3%). The observed behavioral responses to the absence of food can be broadly classified in terms of motility as: (i) "sit-and-wait" strategy for copepods with low motile activity under starvation (mostly relocation jumps) and (ii) "searching" strategy for copepods with high motility activity (swimming/cruising) under starvation. Median survival time in absence of food increased with increasing copepod body weight and it was similar to 1.75 fold lower in active feeders ("searching" strategy under starvation) than in ambush and switching-behavior feeders ("sit-and-wait" strategy under starvation). Thus, copepods with foraging strategies linked to a low motility (ambush feeders) and/or with behavioral plasticity to reduce motility in absence of food (switching -behavior feeders) would cope better with resource limitation/fluctuation than some active feeders. We demonstrate that behavioral plasticity and motile activity associated with foraging strategy significantly influences starvation tolerance in planktonic copepods. These results help to quantify the main trade-offs (gain vs costs) of the main zooplankton foraging strategies and emphasize that behavior is a key trait to understand the distribution of planktonic copepods in marine environments depending on trophic conditions.

Exhalant jet speed of single-osculum explants of the demosponge Halichondria panicea and basic properties of the sponge-pump	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Filtration rate; Osculum area; Scaling; Contraction; Aquiferous module; Video-microscope recording	TETHYA-WILHELMA; FILTRATION-RATE; CONTRACTIONS; TEMPERATURE; GLUTAMATE; PORIFERA; SYSTEM; GABA	Sponges are modular organisms in which each aquiferous module draws water through a canal system by means of pumping units (choanocyte chambers, CC), and the filtered water leaves the module as an exhalant jet through a single opening (osculum). A constant density of CCs in sponges would imply that the filtration rate must be proportional to the sponge volume, but it is less obvious how the osculum cross-sectional area (OSA) scales to sponge volume. Here, we present data obtained on single-osculum sponge explants (i.e. single aquiferous modules) of the demosponge Halichondria panicea to gain insight into important basic properties of the sponge-pump. In the experimental study of 27 explants (volume V-s = 14 to 1977 mm(3)), osculum cross sectional area (OSA), exhalant jet speed (U-0) and filtration rate (F = OSA x U s ) were measured. The observed scaling with size (OSA similar to V-s(0.66); U-0 similar to OSA(0.45) ; F similar to OSA(1.45)) was found to be close to that inferred from the hypothesis of volume based CC density. Thus, the volume-specific filtration rate (= pumping rate) could be approximated as F (ml min(-1)) approximate to 2.3V(s) (cm(3)) which is of the same order of magnitude as that of the demosponge Haliclona urceolus, F (ml min(-1)) approximate to 3.5V(s)(cm(3)). This suggests that for the two sponge species CCs are very likely of similar size, with similar individual pumping rate, and of similar uniform distribution over the sponge volume. By comparing the observed increase of U-0 with increasing OSA to literature data on other leuconoid sponge species this revealed a power function with an identical exponent 0.45 and maximum values of U-0 = 6 to 8 cm s(-1). This indicates that U-0 of a single-osculum explant, or U-0 of an individual osculum in a multi-oscula sponge approaches an upper limit as the sponge grows, implying that a module of a multi-oscula sponge may increase only to a certain size. Time-lapse video-microscope recordings of sponge explants showed temporal variation in OSA during spontaneous contractions. Exposure to a neurotransmitter (GABA) as well as overloading with ink particles triggered contractions that correlated with both decreasing OSA and U-0 that eventually became zero. Video-microscope recordings revealed that it was contraction of the endopinacoderm lining the excurrent canals that effectively restricted or stopped the water flow.

Emergent intraspecific multiple predator effects shape estuarine trophic dynamics across a gradient of habitat complexity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Multiple predator effects; Habitat complexity; Predator-prey interactions; Estuarine landscape ecology; Fish ecology	DRUM SCIAENOPS-OCELLATUS; RED DRUM; PREY SIZE; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; GROWTH; FISH; DENSITY; BAY; LANDSCAPES; COMMUNITY	Estuarine ecosystems are characterized by heterogeneity in species assemblages and habitat complexity, so prey in these systems are often threatened by multiple predators across a mosaic of habitats. When several predator species or conspecifics co-occur, behavioral interactions between them can introduce non-independence to their predator-prey dynamics, which can alter the fate of shared prey. Habitat complexity may regulate these interactions and further impact prey survivorship. We conducted an experiment that manipulated the densities and identities of two ecologically similar estuarine-dependent predators, Red Drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and Spotted Seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), within three habitat complexities. The resulting survivorships of two shared prey types were utilized to determine whether these predators are substitutable, to examine their inter- and intra-specific trophic interactions, and to investigate the impact of habitat structural complexity on their trophic dynamics. The predators differed in their prey preferences and predation pressures, indicating they are generally not substitutable. Interactions between conspecific predators were particularly important in shaping trophic dynamics, and often resulted in combined predation impacts that either enhanced or reduced the survivorship of shared prey as compared to expected values based on foraging rates of individuals. Minimal evidence of interspecific trophic interactions was detected. The observed emergent multiple predator effects differed among the habitats, and were generally intense in intermediate habitat complexity but were either intense or weak in high habitat complexity, depending on the predator combination. These results collectively indicate that prey regulation in this estuarine trophic system is highly dependent on the predator-prey assemblage and habitat context, and enhances our understanding of how multiple predators interactively shape their shared ecosystem.

Here, we examined the outer bark structure of Moquiniastrum polymorphum (Asteraceae) and Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (Rutaceae), co-occurring species in cerrado sensu stricto, cerradao, semideciduous seasonal forest and rainforest. Cerrado sensu stricto is a savanna with relatively intense solar radiation and winds. Cerradao, semi-deciduous seasonal forest and rainforest are progressively more closed and humid. We tested if trees in cerrado sensu stricto have relatively thicker outer and total bark than trees in the other three environments. For individuals of each species from each habitat, we described the morphological and anatomical features of the outer bark, including the origin of the first periderm. We compared the relative thickness of outer and total bark among habitats by means of ANOVA. In both species, we observed no qualitative differences in the morphological and anatomical features of the outer bark; therefore, these features are diagnostic for each species. For all habitats, the deep-seated origin of the first periderm and formation of a rhytidome in M. polymorphum produce a grooved bark with a loose appearance, whereas the subepidermal origin and formation of a single periderm in Z. rhoifolium produce a more uniform and smooth-appearing bark. Zanthoxylum rhoifolium trees in cerrado sensu stricto and cerradao have a thinner periderm, whereas M. polymorphum trees do not vary in rhytidome thickness among the habitats. In summary, trees from cerrado sensu stricto did not have relatively thicker outer bark and total bark than trees in cerradao, semi-deciduous seasonal forest and rainforest, suggesting that seasonal drought, intense solar radiation and winds do not seem to affect the total thickness of the outer bark.

We modeled the climatic niche of six oaks (Q. agrifolia, Q. cedrosensis, Q. chrysolepis, Q. devia, Q. palmeri and Q. peninsularis), some rare and others widely distributed, occurring within the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, and projected future distributions under two contrasting scenarios of global warming. We also estimated the breadth of the climatic niche of each species and associated it with current and future distributions. We found that climate warming will modify the distribution of suitable habitat for the six oak species, with considerable variation in changes among species. We observed that the breadth of climate niche is related to the potential geographic distribution of the species and that the loss of area under future scenarios of global warming is significantly correlated with the climatic niche size. To keep pace with climate change, oak populations will need to colonize new areas, because a large part of their present ranges will not retain suitable climatic conditions. The oaks are dominant elements in the Mediterranean-climate region and pine-oak forests of the Baja California Peninsula, so changes in their distributions will probably affect other species that closely interact with them. Further studies on the demography and ecological interactions of these oaks are recommended to refine predictions concerning effects of climate change and to identify conservation management options.

Here, we aim to describe and analyze the distribution patterns of the group in Brazil, in search for possible areas of endemism. We then discuss our results to contribute to the debate on the Atlantic Forest history and endemism patterns. Our research relies on an updated database from herbarium collections and expert points, including taxonomic validation and georeferencing procedures. We performed both Parsimony and Endemicity analysis (PAE and NDM, respectively) and evaluated the contribution of narrowly distributed and widespread species to the overall pattern, testing if they are unevenly distributed at different latitudes of the Atlantic Forest. We recovered areas of endemism already found in other studies using other groups as study model. We identified five areas at different latitudes, according to PAE analysis: four in the Atlantic Forest, between Bahia and Rio de Janeiro states, and one in the Amazon. The latter area was not recovered by NDM analysis and we discuss that this is actually an artifact of PAE analysis due to collection bias. Although the widespread species have contributed more than the narrowly distributed ones for the overall pattern, the distribution of the group is more explained by species of medium-range distribution. We discuss our results considering current models based on historical events as Quaternary refugia forest and alternative hypothesis of vicariance.

However, they have mostly been addressed through the invader impacts on other species of the plant community and rarely through the way plant communities can contain alien species. Understanding such mechanisms would help in designing restoration projects using plant community competitive properties to control invasive populations. In this study, we looked at the role of competitive interactions in the success of Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decraene using a native willow frequently used in bioengineering techniques: Salix viminalis L. S. viminalis has a high growth rate and is, as such, a potential candidate to compete with F. japonica in restoration projects of invaded areas. Both species were grown in semi-controlled conditions in mesocosms (truck dumpsters), alone or in competition. Morphological traits (plant height, specific leaf area) as well as biomass (aboveground and underground) were measured on each species during two growing seasons. We also quantified spatial expansion of F. japonica. Even under a dense canopy of S. viminalis, F. japonica was able to survive and grow. However, its performance was significantly reduced compared to monocultures and its spatial colonization was less extended. Although S. viminalis biomass was affected by F. japonica, F. japonica expressed competitive stress through a modification of ramet density and height. There was no significant effect of F. japonica on S. viminalis height, enabling this species to dominate. Synthesis and applications: We conclude that S. viminalis succeeded in reducing F. japonica growth by developing a competitive canopy. Bioengineering techniques aiming at restoring a competitive neighborhood can control F. japonica. However, F. japonica's broad underground extension should be taken into account in any management strategy in order to successfully limit its development and spatial spread.

Organoleptic quality of Ethiopian Arabica coffee deteriorates with increasing intensity of coffee forest management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Afromontane forest; Agroforestry; Coffea arabica; Crop wild relative; Cup quality	BIOCHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; BEVERAGE QUALITY; CUP QUALITY; L.; SHADE; POLLINATOR; FRAGMENTATION; AGRICULTURE; VARIETIES	Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica L.) grows naturally as an understory shrub in the moist evergreen montane forests of Southwest Ethiopia. In response to an increasing local human population pressure and a growing coffee demand on the world market, coffee producing forests are increasingly managed to boost coffee yield. Here we compared organoleptic coffee quality between natural coffee producing forests, large coffee agroforests, and small coffee agroforests. Accounting for variability in Arabica coffee genotype and environment, we found that blind consensus scores, given by a panel of certified Q-Grade cuppers, were negatively affected by increasing forest management intensity. Importantly, only coffee from natural coffee producing forests qualified as specialty coffee following the Specialty Coffee Association of America's standards. We suggest that the most important drivers of deteriorating coffee quality include decreased shade levels and changing micro-climate and biotic interactions. Due to the low yields of coffee in natural coffee producing forests and the lack of quality price premiums, Ethiopian smallholder farmers are inclined to optimize for coffee quantity, rather than for quality, causing a significant challenge for the conservation of Ethiopian natural coffee producing forests.

Here the relationship between earthquake DELs and earthquake magnitude (Ms), asset value exposure (K), proportion of non-steel-concrete residential buildings (H) and physical environment instability (E) is quantified using the concept of economic elasticity. Earthquake disaster event-based DEL records over the period from 1990 to 2016 for the mainland of China are fitted to a regression model. Elasticity values for Ms, K, H and E are 7.63, 0.75, 4.92 and 0.91, respectively, indicating that on average, DEL changes are more sensitive to changes in Ms and H-a 13% increase in Ms or a 20% increase in H would double earthquake DELs, while it may take a 133% increase in K or a 110% increase in E to cause the same economic losses. In turn, this suggests that human factors-decreasing H and K-could be efficient ways to reduce earthquake risk, while these two factors will become increasingly relevant for risk assessment in the future with continued economic growth. The elasticity estimate results could be used for studying future change in earthquake risks and for supporting disaster risk reduction strategies.

Loons (Gavia spp.) are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic activities and are also of high conservation status, making them particularly relevant to marine planning processes. We investigated the effects of OWF construction and ship traffic on Loon distributions in the German North Sea on a large spatial scale, using a 'before-after' control impact analysis approach and a long-term data set. Many OWFs were built in or close to core areas of Loon distributions. Loons showed significant shifts in their distribution in the 'after' period and subsequently aggregated between two OWF clusters, indicating the remaining suitable habitat. The decrease in Loon abundance became significant as far as about 16 km from the closest OWF. Ship traffic also had a significant negative impact on Loons, indicating that OWFs deterred Loons through the combined effect of ship traffic and the wind turbines themselves. This study provides the first analysis of the extensive effects of OWFs and ships on Loons on a large spatial scale. The results provide an essential baseline for future marine spatial planning processes in the German North Sea and elsewhere.

However, it remains unclear about the effects of climate change, land use shifts, plant diversity, and their interactions on productivity partitioning above- and below-ground components in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. To answer this question, we conducted field surveys at 33 grazed vs. fenced paired sites that are distributed across the alpine meadow, steppe, and desert-steppe zones on the northern Tibetan Plateau in early August of 2010-2013. Generalized additive models (GAMs) showed that aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) linearly increased with growing season precipitation (GSP) while belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) decreased with growing season temperature (GST). Compared to grazed sites, short-term fencing did not alter the patterns of ANPP along climatic gradients but tended to decrease BNPP at moderate precipitation levels of 200 mm < GSP < 450 mm. We also found that ANPP and BNPP linearly increased with species richness, ANPP decreased with Shannon diversity index, and BNPP did not correlate with the Shannon diversity index. Fencing did not alter the relationships between productivity components and plant diversity indices. Generalized additive mixed models furtherly confirmed that the interaction of localized plant diversity and climatic condition nonlinearly regulated productivity partitioning of alpine grasslands in this area. Finally, structural equation models (SEMs) revealed the direction and strength of causal links between biotic and abiotic variables within alpine grassland ecosystems. ANPP was controlled directly by GSP (0.53) and indirectly via species richness (0.41) and Shannon index (- 0.12). In contrast, BNPP was influenced directly by GST (- 0.43) and indirectly by GSP via species richness (0.05) and Shannon index (- 0.02). Therefore, we recommend using a joint approach of GAMs and SEMs for better understanding mechanisms behind the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function under climate change and human disturbance.

Impact of culvert flooding on carnivore crossings	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Animal movement; Mitigation measures; Road ecology; Dry ledges; Passage efficacy; Wildlife corridors	NON-WILDLIFE PASSAGES; MELES-MELES; DRAINAGE CULVERTS; HIGHWAY; UNDERPASSES; ROAD; MORTALITY; PERMEABILITY; VERTEBRATES; ATTRIBUTES	Along many roads worldwide, drainage culverts are the only structures wildlife can safely use to cross. However, culverts inundate and can become unavailable to terrestrial fauna during rainy periods. We conducted a field study over wet and dry seasons in southern Portugal to assess the effect of culvert flooding on crossings by medium-sized carnivores. We set up track stations inside 30 culverts along intermediate-level traffic roads to evaluate complete crossings (n = 1211) and used mixed-effects models to quantify the effects. Carnivores were more likely to cross and crossed more frequently if the culvert had a natural dry pathway at the time of the crossing. Carnivores were also more likely to cross culverts with streams running through them. Moreover, culverts with flowing streams during the wet season were still more likely to be crossed during the dry season when the streams were dry. The significance of the difference in crossing rates between wet and dry seasons was species-specific. Our study reveals that flowing water and dry pathways jointly contribute to promoting crossings by this carnivore community. Culverts including streams may act as a continuation of riparian corridors, being incorporated into carnivores' movement routes. Our results lend empirical support to recommendations advising the implementation of dry pathways to provide crossing paths. Interventions to offset the transient impacts of water flooding in new or existing culverts can be a cost-effective solution promoting connectivity across roads allowing movement of individuals.

Climate and environmental change are altering their fire regimes. In particular, more frequent summer droughts will result in higher severity wildfires. This could alter the plant community composition of Callus habitats and thereby influence ecosystem function. To study the effect of fire severity on community composition we used rain-out shelters to simulate drought prior to experimental burns at two Ca/lima-dominated sites, a raised bog and a heathland. We analysed species abundance in plots surveyed ca. 16 months after fire in relation to burn severity (indicated by fire-induced soil heating). We found that fire severity was an important control on community composition at both sites. Higher fire severity increased the abundance of ericoids, graminoids and acrocarpous mosses, and decreased the abundance of pleurocarpous mosses compared to lower severity fires. At the raised bog, the keystone species Sphagnum capillifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum showed no difference in regeneration with fire severity. Species and plant functional type beta-diversity increased following fire, and was similar in higher compared to lower severity burns. Our results further our understanding of the response of Cantina-dominated habitats to projected changes in fire regimes, and can assist land managers using prescribed fires in selecting burning conditions to achieve management objectives.

Water quality and greenhouse gas fluxes for stormwater detained in a constructed wetland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						GHG emissions; Constructed wetland; Stormwater management; Water quality	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; WASTE-WATER; FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; NITROUS-OXIDE; WIND-SPEED; EMISSIONS; METHANE; CO2; PONDS	Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been extensively used to deal with stormwater runoff and prevent flooding, as well as to improve water quality. However, some studies indicate that runoff from CWs can be a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere, as well as have increased levels of organic matter and nitrogen that may affect the environment and water quality of receiving waterways. We collected water samples at five different locations within a constructed stormwater detention wetland and determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3-), as well as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations and fluxes. Results showed that the water had high levels of DOC and NO3-. Analysis of DOC quality showed that the organic matter is mainly derived from soil and plant litter, but it has some contribution from microbial sources as well. Additionally, the water was supersaturated with CO2 and CH4 with respect to the atmosphere, which resulted in high evasion fluxes of 4.1 g CO2 -Cm(-2)d(-1)and 45 mg CH4-Cm(-2)d(-1). N2O flux was low, 36.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2) d(-1), and varied between uptake and emission throughout the study period. Consideration of water quality and GHG emissions is key to evaluate the environmental performance of stormwater management systems.

However, the accuracy of a tree-height measurement may vary in relation to many factors. The work described here thus sought to evaluate the accuracy of ground-based tree-height measurements for major forest-forming tree species of the temperate and boreal zones. The focus was on the importance of factors affecting accuracy of the measurements in question at larger geographical scales. In line with the above research goals, data were gathered from 299 stands throughout Poland and heights of 2388 sample trees of eight species, growing in different stands and site conditions, were measured; heights were then compared with measured lengths of felled trees as a reference. In total, 10 variables to determine factors that may influence ground-based tree-height measurement accuracy were used. We merged them into 4 groups: measurements, topography, stand and biometric-related factors. Results showed that biometric and topographic factors had the greatest relative influence on the accuracy of measurements of tree height. Tree length and species, followed by the slope of the terrain, tree age, and height above sea level were the most important factors found to affect accuracy. In most of the cases studied the terrestrial tree-height measurements were underestimated when set against definitive measurements of length. This was true for all species studied except oak, for which height measurements were typically overestimated. Notwithstanding the broad geographical scope of the work, the particular device used and the team factor were only found to have a marginal influence on measurement accuracy.

Towards high throughput assessment of canopy dynamics: The estimation of leaf area structure in Amazonian forests with multitemporal multi-sensor airborne lidar	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lidar; Leaf area estimation; LAI; Leaf area profiles; Forest degradation; Tropical forest monitoring; Forest dynamics	RAIN-FOREST; INDEX LAI; ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE; BIOMASS ESTIMATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCAN ANGLE; PROFILES; PREDICTIONS; SENSITIVITY; BALANCE	Leaf area dynamics offer information about changes in forest biomass and canopy function critical to understanding the role of forests in the climate system and carbon cycle. Airborne small footprint lidar is a potential major source for the detection of variation in leaf area density (LAD), LAD vertical profiles, and total leaf area (leaf area index, LAI), from sites to regional scales. However, the sensitivities of lidar-based LAD and LAI estimation are not yet well known, particularly in dense forests, over landscape heterogeneity, sensor system, and survey differences, and through time. To address these questions, we compared 16 pairs of multitemporal airborne lidar surveys with four different laser sensors across six Amazon forest sites with resurvey intervals ranging from one to nine years. We tested whether the different laser sensors, and the pulse return density of laser sampling (variable between and within each survey) introduce systematic biases. Laser sensors created consistent biases that accounted for up to 18.20% of LAD differences between surveys, but biases could be corrected with a simple regression approach. Lidar pulse return density had little appreciable bias impact when above 20 returns per m(2). After correction, repeated mean and site maximum LAI estimates became significantly correlated (R-2 similar to 0.8), while LAD profiles revealed site differences. Heterogeneity and change in LAD structure were detectable at the ecologically relevant 1/4 ha forest neighborhood grid scale, as evidenced by the high correlation of profile variation between surveys, with the strength of correlation (R-2 value) significantly decreasing with increasing survey interval (0.74 to 0.16 from one to nine years), consistent with accumulating effects of forest dynamics. Sensor-induced biases trended towards correlation with lidar footprint (beam width). The LAD estimation and bias correction approach developed in this study provides the standardization critical for heterogeneous lidar networks that offer high throughput functional ecological monitoring of climatically important forests like the Amazon.

A fusion approach to forest disturbance mapping using time series ensemble techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Landsat time series; Forest disturbance; Random Forests; Ensembles	TEMPORAL PATTERNS; LANDSAT; PERFORMANCE; RECOVERY; TRENDS; AREA; CLASSIFICATION; DYNAMICS	Time series analysis of Landsat data is widely used for assessing forest change at the large-area scale. Various change detection algorithms have been proposed, each employing different techniques to characterise abrupt disturbance events and longer term trends. However, results can vary significantly, depending on the algorithm, parameters and the spectral index (or indices) chosen. This mismatch in results has led to researchers hypothesizing that an ensemble based approach may increase accuracy. In this study we assess two change detection algorithms (LandTrendr and the R package strucchange), each with three indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI, the Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR, and Tasseled Cap Wetness or TCW). We test their ability to detect abrupt disturbances in sclerophyll forests over a 29 year time period, and subsequently evaluate a number of ensembles, using simple fusion rules and Random Forests models. A total of 4087 manually interpreted reference pixels, sampled from 9 million ha of forest, were used for training and validation. In addition, we assess the effects of priming the Random Forests classifier with confusing cases (commission errors from the time series algorithms). Our results clearly show that ensembles combining multiple change detection techniques out-perform any one method. Our most accurate Random Forests model, using an ensemble of all 6 algorithm outputs, along with 3 bi-temporal change rasters (change in NBR, NDVI and TCW), had an overall error rate of 7%, compared with the most accurate single algorithm/index approach (LandTrendr with NBR), which had an overall error of 21%. Our findings also indicate that acceptable results (14% error) can be achieved without the use of traditional change detection algorithms, by using robust reference data and Random Forests classification. However, by priming the classifier with confusing cases informed by the change detection algorithms, commission errors decreased substantially, at the expense of slight increases in omission errors. In fact, a Random Forests ensemble, using the primed training data and only 3 bi-temporal change rasters, was more accurate than any one individual algorithm, with an overall error of 11%. By including some additional metrics derived from Landsat time series (e.g. 2 year changes and overall means) this error was further reduced to 8%. Given that most change detection algorithms have large processing requirements, this suggests that algorithms can be applied to a sample of pixels only, for the sole purpose of training a machine learning classifier. We demonstrate the feasibility of this previously unexplored approach, by creating annual disturbance maps over a large area of forest (9 million ha) and long time period (29 years).

Newly available, satellite-derived time-series of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) across North America and Europe could provide new insights into the physiological response of evergreen trees to climate change by tracking changes in foliar pigment pools that have been linked to photosynthetic phenology. However, before implementing these data for such purpose at these evergreen dominated systems, it is important to increase our understanding of the fine scale mechanisms driving the connection between PRI and environmental conditions. The goal of this study is thus to gain a more mechanistic understanding of which environmental factors drive changes in PRI during late-season phenological transitions at the FTE including factors that are susceptible to climate change (i.e., air- and soil-temperatures), and those that are not (photoperiod). We hypothesized that late-season phenological changes in foliar pigment pools captured by PRI are largely driven by photoperiod as opposed to less predictable drivers such as air temperature, complicating the utility of PRI time-series for understanding climate change effects on the FTE. Ground-based, time series of PRI were acquired from individual trees in combination with meteorological variables and photoperiod information at six FTE sites in Alaska. A linear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to determine the significance (alpha = 0.001) and effect size (i.e., standardized slope b*) of environmental factors on late-seasonal changes in the PRI signal. Our results indicate that photoperiod had the strongest, significant effect on late season changes in PRI (b* = 0.08, p < 0.001), but environmental variables susceptible to climate change were also significant (i.e., daily mean solar radiation (b* = 0.03, p < 0.001) and daily mean soil temperature (b* = 0.02, p < 0.001)). These results suggest that interpreting PRI time-series of late-season phenological transitions may indeed facilitate our understanding of how northern treeline responds to climate change.

A machine learning approach to map tropical selective logging	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Brazil; Conservation; Degradation; Landsat; Random Forest; Selective logging; Surface reflectance; Texture measures; Tropical forests	FOREST DEGRADATION; CANOPY DAMAGE; LANDSAT; CLASSIFICATION; DEFORESTATION; BIODIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; COVER; THRESHOLDS; INTENSITY	Hundreds of millions of hectares of tropical forest have been selectively logged, either legally or illegally. Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (> 20 m(3) ha(-1)). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondonia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (< 15 m(3) ha(-1)) We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Park northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes.

This study is aimed at accounting for uncertainties in bivariate analysis of extreme rainfall-runoff frequency in the Taleghan watershed, one of the major watersheds in northern Iran, using copulas. Two types of paired rainfall and runoff data, including annual maximum series (AMS) and peaks over threshold (POT) are adopted to investigate the uncertainties that arose due to the input data. The Cramer von-Mises goodness-of-fit test and Akaike information criteria (AIC) reveal that the Student's t copula is the best-fit copula for P (AMS)-Q (AMS) with Gaussian-Pearson III (P3) margins, while the Plackett copula is the best-fit copula for P (POT)-Q (POT) with generalized Pareto (GPAR-GPAR) margins. A nonparametric bootstrapping method for sampling from p-level curves is established to investigate the effects of univariate and bivariate models selection and uncertainties induced by input data. The results indicated that the sampling uncertainty reduces POT data compared to AMS data due to the increased sample size. However, the parameterization uncertainty of the POT data increases because of the weaker dependence structure between rainfall and runoff for the POT data. The results also reveal that the larger sampling uncertainties are associated with higher p-level curves for both AMS and POT data which are induced by lower data density in the upper tail. For the study area, the input-data uncertainty is most significant in bivariate rainfall-runoff frequency analysis and quantile estimation, while the uncertainty induced by probabilistic model selection is least significant.

Assessing runoff generation in riparian wetlands: monitoring groundwater-surface water dynamics at the micro-catchment scale	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Riparian; Wetlands; Peat; Isotopes; Runoff; Groundwater-surface water interactions	HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY; HYDROPEDOLOGICAL UNITS; STORAGE DYNAMICS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; FLOW; STREAMFLOW; BASEFLOW; TRACERS; ZONES; CONCEPTUALIZATION	Riparian wetlands (RW) are important variable source areas for runoff generation. They are usually characterised by a combination of groundwater exfiltrationwhich maintains saturated conditions in low-lying organic-rich soilsand direct precipitation. Both processes interact to generate overland flow as a dominant runoff process. The small-scale details of groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions are usually not well understood in RW. Here, we report the results of a study from an experimental catchment in the Scottish Highlands where spatio-temporal runoff processes in RW were investigated using isotopes, alkalinity and hydrometric measurements. We focused on perennial micro-catchments within the RW and ephemeral zero-order channels draining peatland hollows and hummocks to better understand the heterogeneity in GW-SW interactions. The 12-month study period was dominated by the wettest winter (December/January) period on record. Runoff generation in the RW was strongly controlled by the local groundwater response to direct rainfall, but also the exfiltration of groundwater from upslope. This groundwater drainage is focused in the hollows in ephemeral and perennial drainage channels, but in wet conditions, as exfiltration rates increase, can affect hummocks as well. The hollows provide the dominant areas for mixing groundwater, soil water and direct rainfall to deliver water to the stream network as hollows fill and spill to increase connectivity. They also provide wet areas for evaporation which is evident in enriched isotope signatures in summer. Although there is some degree of heterogeneity in the extent to which groundwater influences specific micro-catchments, particularly under low flows, the overall isotopic response is quite similar, especially when the catchment is wet and this responses can explain the isotope signatures observed in the stream. In the future, more longitudinal studies of micro-catchments are needed to better explain the heterogeneity observed.

Economic impacts of early unconventional gas mining: Lessons from the coal seam gas industry in New South Wales, Australia	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Coal seam gas; Coalbed methane; Causal inference; Economic spillovers; Resource economics; Impact assessment	PANEL-DATA MODELS; POPULATION-DENSITY; SOCIAL LICENSE; UNITED-STATES; GROWTH; BOOM; EXTRACTION; INCOME; EMPLOYMENT; KNOWLEDGE	Globally, the development of the unconventional natural gas (UNG) industry is expected to continue as gas consumption increases in the transition to cleaner energy sources. However, social and regulatory factors may constrain UNG activity at regional scales. Robust impact assessments of the effects of the UNG industry at different phases of development could help reduce trade-offs of energy policy and promote overall welfare improvements. We assessed if the early phases of the coal seam gas (CSG, a type of UNG) industry in New South Wales, Australia produced regional economic changes between 2001 and 2011. We combined spatial econometrics, genetic matching algorithms and seemingly unrelated regressions with instrumental variables to control for multiple factors influencing regional economic patterns (e.g., climate, human capital) to estimate the effect of the CSG industry on local income and employment. Results show that regions with CSG activity had 7% (+/- 5%, 95% C.I.) higher family income than regions without CSG mining. No statistical evidence of indirect employment multiplier effects from CSG activity were found. The analysis can inform social license and regulatory decisions related to the CSG industry that impact competing social priorities such as energy and water security, economic growth and environmental health.

In this paper, we consider changes in adult bodyweight and fecundity in populations of red deer in upland Scotland, before, during and after substantial reductions in population. Using generalised linear mixed models, we analysed changes in bodyweight and fecundity for 15,401 male and 21,053 female red deer culled from 9 different properties over periods from 9 to 35 years. After controlling for the effects of age, bodyweight in males showed a significant negative relationship with density and a significant positive relationship with the magnitude of reduction in density from that of the previous year as well as from population density recorded 2 and 3 years previously, implying that although main effects may relate to immediate reductions in density from that of the preceding year, increases in male bodyweight may be responding to cumulative reductions in densities as much as 3 years later. Analyses of female bodyweight yielded similar results with a direct and measurable effect of current density on age-related female bodyweight and significant effects of reductions in density in immediately preceding years. In this case, the model of best fit (lowest AIC score) is that incorporating a 3-year time lag, implying that bodyweight may be responding to the effects of cumulative culls over a preceding period of up to 3 years. Pregnancy rates among females were strongly influenced by bodyweight and prevailing (current) density (with females of higher bodyweight more likely to be pregnant), but there was no consistent effect of reduction of density on the probability of pregnancy of young females (aged < 4 years) or older animals (4 years or older). The probability of a lactating female becoming pregnant again in the same year was however significantly higher 1 year after a reduction in population density. While we focus in this paper on red deer, the results are applicable to other mammalian species where bodyweight is a major driver of fecundity. Our analyses suggest that some improvement in fertility and individual animal quality (bodyweight) may be expected where population densities of resource-limited populations are sufficiently reduced.

AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						ant-plant interactions; extrafloral nectaries; herbivory; indirect plant defences	EXTRAFLORAL NECTAR; HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS; FACULTATIVE MUTUALISM; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; CONDITIONAL OUTCOMES; INDUCED DEFENSE; HYMENOPTERA; PROTECTION	The results of ecological interactions depend on the costs and benefits involved in different ecological contexts. Turnera subulata is a shrubby plant with extrafloral nectaries that are associated with ants. Here, we test the hypotheses that the association between T. subulata and ants results in: (i) positive effects on host plant growth and reproduction; (ii) plant herbivory reduction and (iii) inhibition of the host plant visitation by beneficial organisms. Thirty experimental plots were established in northeastern Brazil, either in association with ants or without ants (N = 15 plots/treatment), with four plants each (total 120 plants). Vegetative growth (plant height and number of leaves), reproductive investment (flowers and fruits), herbivory rates and numbers of beneficial visitors were quantified during all phenological stages of the host plant. Data were analysed using generalized linear mixed models. At the host plant maturation stage, we found a trade-off between growth and reproduction. Plants with ants had lower mean height; however, they invested more in reproduction (a higher number of flowers and fruits) compared to plants without ants. During the flowering stage, the abundance of sucking herbivores was higher in plots without ants but chewing herbivore abundance increased in the maturation stage in plots with ants. The cumulative proportion of leaves with herbivore damage did not differ between treatments, and the presence of ants reduced the number of beneficial visitors (e.g. pollinators and natural enemies) to the host plants. Our results show that association with ants results in some costs for the host plant, however, these costs appear to be offset by the defensive role of ants, which favours plant reproductive investment. In general, our results help to elucidate mechanisms involved in trophic interactions within the complex network of interactions involving ants and plants.

Are stacked species distribution models accurate at predicting multiple levels of diversity along a rainfall gradient?	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Boosted Regression Trees; Formicidae; macroecological models; MaxEnt; Maxlike; species distribution models	LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; RICHNESS; PATTERNS; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; RESPONSES	We use observed patterns of species richness and composition of ant communities along a 1000 mm rainfall gradient in northern Australian savanna to assess the accuracy of species richness and turnover predictions derived from stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) and constrained by macroecological models (MEMs). We systematically sampled ants at 15 sites at 50 km intervals along the rainfall gradient in 2012 and 2013. Using the observed data, we created MEMs of species richness, composition and turnover. We built distribution models for 135 of the observed species using data from museum collections and online databases. We compared two approaches of stacking SDMs and three modelling algorithms to identify the most accurate way of predicting richness and composition. We then applied the same beta diversity metrics to compare the observed versus predicted patterns. Stacked SDMs consistently over-predicted local species richness, and there was a mismatch between the observed pattern of richness estimated from the MEM, and the pattern predicted by S-SDMs. The most accurate richness and turnover predictions occurred when the stacked models were rank-ordered by their habitat suitability and constrained by the observed MEM richness predictions. In contrast with species richness, the predictions obtained by the MEM of community similarity, composition and turnover matched those predicted by the S-SDMs. S-SDMs regulated by MEMs may therefore be a useful tool in predicting compositional patterns despite being unreliable estimators of species richness. Our results highlight that the choice of species distribution model, the stacking method used, and underlying macroecological patterns all influence the accuracy of community assembly predictions derived from S-SDMS.

A commensal network of epiphytic orchids and host trees in an Atlantic Forest remnant: A case study revealing the important role of large trees in the network structure	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						host-plants; modularity; nestedness; Orchidaceae; Phorophyte; tropical forest	VASCULAR EPIPHYTES; POLLINATION NETWORKS; SPECIES ABUNDANCE; NESTEDNESS; MODULARITY; SPECIALIZATION; COMMUNITIES; FLOWERS	Application of metrics derived from network theory could elucidate the structural organization of orchid assemblages, and help identify the host tree species on which they depend, as well as predicting the impacts of removing host tree species. In this study, we used nestedness, modularity, connectance and robustness, to identify the factors that predict the structure of a quantitative orchid-host tree network in a remnant of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. The network exhibited low nestedness (NODF = 14.07; P = 0.03; WNODF = 5.3; P = 0.02) and no modularity. It was highly robust to the random elimination of host tree species, but showed low robustness when host trees with more interactions started to be eliminated. The nested pattern found was attributed to a combination of two main host tree traits, height and diameter (given by DBH measure). Thus, our analyses reflect the importance of tall and large host tree species, which seem to play an important role in the network structure, providing a substrate for orchid species with different habitat associations and representing a decisive factor in both nested and robust patterns found.

Independent trophic behavior and breeding success of a resident flycatcher and a coexisting migratory congener	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						foraging; intratropical migration; nestling; resource phenology; stable isotope analysis	DEPENDENT NEST PREDATION; STABLE-ISOTOPE RATIOS; NEOTROPICAL SAVANNA; DENSITY; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; MIGRANTS; NICHE; FRACTIONATION; TEMPERATE	Historical biases towards the study of Palearctic and Nearctic bird migration systems has resulted in a dearth of information on the ecology of intratropical migrants, which likely also play important ecological roles within their communities. For instance, there is little information on the foraging ecology and breeding biology of co-occurring migrants and residents within the intratropical migratory system. Thus, we used two congeneric flycatchers - the resident Plain-crested Elaenia Elaenia cristata (Aves: Tyrannidae), and the migrant Lesser Elaenia E. chiriquensis (Tyrannidae) - to check whether either of them showed foraging niche plasticity mediating their coexistence and the effects of such syntopy on their breeding behavior and fitness. To do so, we used an ensemble of methods that included the evaluation of food resource phenology, foraging behavior observations, stable isotope ratio analysis in birds' tissues, and nest monitoring. Our results confirmed that residents have foraging behavior plasticity but reveals its trophic behavior and breeding success is independent of the coexistence with migrants. Since such results depart from the predictions based on the current (and often Northern-biased) theories of bird migration, we discuss alternative hypotheses explaining our findings, including the influence of physiology on diet and the behavioral responses of nest predators. Once there is a clear knowledge gap about the interspecific interactions between residents and intratropical migrants, our study represents a simple, yet important, step towards understanding the mechanisms underlying this system.

Seed set in Sorghum stipoideum, and not fire, determines the timing of breeding by Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae)	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						annual Sorghum; fire regime; grass finches; seed phenology; tropical savanna	YINBERRIE HILLS AREA; CAPE-YORK PENINSULA; SAVANNA WOODLAND; GRASS; GERMINATION; HABITAT; SEASON; VEGETATION; DORMANCY; BIOLOGY	Seeds of native grasses are an important food source for granivorous finches throughout the tropical savannas of northern Australia. The iconic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), a threatened species endemic to these savanna grasslands, relies almost exclusively on the grass seeds of annual Sorghum spp. when breeding, and appears to time breeding with the availability of these seeds. Fire is common throughout the savanna grasslands of northern Australia and has the potential to alter Sorghum spp. seed germination and plant reproductive phenology which in turn could alter the Gouldian finch breeding phenology window. This study examines if the temporal relationship between breeding by Gouldian finches in the north-east Kimberley region of Australia relates to fire and Sorghum stipoideum seed phenology. The availability of S. stipoideum seed was monitored at Gouldian finch breeding sites in association with local fire history and Gouldian finch breeding data. The effect of experimental fire (heat and smoke) on S. stipoideum seed dormancy and germination was also investigated. We found that the first heavy rainfalls preceded germination of S. stipoideum in November/December. Synchronous seed set by S. stipoideum plants the following March/April coincided with the start and duration of the Gouldian finch breeding season. The timing of dry season fires had no relationship with seed dormancy or the phenology of seed germination and seed set. Nor did the effects of smoke or heat affect seed dormancy and germination. These findings support the importance of the seed phenology of annual grass species, such as S. stipoideum, to breeding Gouldian finches, and also suggest that the occurrence of fire at a breeding site in the previous year does not alter the S. stipoideum seed or finch breeding window. The implications of these results for threatened Gouldian finch ecology and management are discussed in relation to previously published fire impacts on S. stipoideum seed nutrition and finch breeding site selection.

Sources of variation in endohelminth parasitism of common eiders over-wintering in the Canadian Arctic	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bird; Polynya; Arctic; Polar; Non-migratory; Resident	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOMATERIA-MOLLISSIMA; BIASED PARASITISM; SEX; MERCURY; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; ECOLOGY	Documenting how climate change will affect Arctic ecosystems and food web dynamics requires an understanding of current sources of variation in species distributions, frequency, and abundance. Host-parasite interactions are expected to be altered in the coming decades under warming conditions. However, in many Polar Regions, there is little information describing parasite-host assemblages. We examine how gastrointestinal helminths of northern common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima sedentaria) in the low Arctic vary with host age, sex and sampling year. We found that the prevalence of an acanthocephalan (Profilicollus sp.) varied in eiders with age, sex and year, while a cestode (Microsomacanthus sp.) varied with host sex. Two other species of endohelminths (Lateriporus sp., Corysonoma sp.) were not found to vary with sex, age or sampling year, and another species (Microphallus sp.) did not vary with sex or age. Our results highlight the complexity inherent in Arctic host-parasite assemblages, and the need for more detailed studies to better understand how changing climatic conditions may affect species distributions, frequency or abundance.

We explored this issue in Notothenia rossii (NOR) and N. coriiceps (NOC) at Potter Cove in summer 2016 to test: (1) their preference among different benthic groups, primarily species of algae and amphipods and (2) differences between these nototheniids given their distinct morphology but their known similar general ecology in the fjords. The methodology included a comparative analysis of benthic organisms identified in the stomachs and those collected on macroalgal beds (Ivlev Index). Benthic amphipods, mainly Gondogeneia antarctica and Cheirimedon femoratus, followed by macroalgae, mainly Palmaria decipiens and Desmarestia spp., were the most important and frequent dietary items (IRI%) for both nototheniids. However, NOC was more herbivorous and fed more intensively on a wider diversity of benthic organisms such as certain algal-associated groups like gastropods and bivalves, whereas NOR fed on a greater proportion of epibenthic amphipods and other epibenthic prey. Although in the last three decades the physiognomy of the inner cove has been changed due to theretreat of the Fourcade Glacier, at our sampling site in the outer cove the abundance and vertical distribution of macroalgae did not show substantial changes compared with those reported in the literature in 1994-1996. Temporal differences in the feeding selectivity of NOC on amphipod species, between contemporary and historical samples, may be explained by variations in the assemblage of the algal-associated epifauna. We suggest factors that may have produced these changes.

Seasonal variation in diet and prey selection may be the result of fluctuations in the physiological demands during the different annual life cycles, and ecological factors such as resource availability, which may influence the foraging behavior. Moreover, the competition for the feeding territories between conspecifics in a population or with other predators may also lead to diversification of the diet. In this work, we determined the diet of breeding and non-breeding Brown Skuas (Stercorarius antarcticus lonnbergi) at Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, to understand prey selection and the feeding habits of groups with different physiological and energy demands. To assess the breeders' diet, 204 pellets were collected near the nests, while for non-breeders, 330 pellets were obtained from different areas where they usually group, and prey items were determined. Pellet dimensions were larger in non-breeding skuas. Breeding skuas' pellets showed a higher content of energy-rich items such as penguin eggs, fishes and molluscs, while in non-breeding skuas, pellets consisted mainly of penguin feathers and bones. The differences in diet between the groups may be a consequence of the supplementation of the food obtained on land by traveling to the ocean by breeding skuas, in order to compensate the energetic demands during reproduction. Our results highlight differences in the feeding habits and prey selection, as well as a variation in the flexibility of the foraging strategy of both groups.

Bottom trawl surveys in the northern Bering Sea indicate recent shifts in the distribution of marine species	POLAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cold pool; Climate shift; Arctic; Biogeography	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ROCK SOLE; FISH; ICE; COD; COMMUNITIES; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS; SHELF	The climate regime in the eastern Bering Sea has recently been dominated by a pattern of multi-year stanzas, in which several successive years of minimal sea-ice formation and warm summer temperatures (e.g., 2002-2005, 2014-2017) alternate with several years of relatively extensive sea-ice formation and cold summer temperatures (e.g., 2006-2013). This emerging climate pattern may be forcing long-term changes in the spatial distributions of the Bering Sea's marine fauna. The National Marine Fisheries Service's Alaska Fisheries Science Center recently conducted two bottom trawl surveys covering the entire Bering Sea shelf from the Alaska Peninsula to the Bering Strait. The first, in the summer of 2010, was conducted during a cold year when the majority of the continental shelf was covered by a pool of cold (<2 degrees C) water. The second, in the summer of 2017, was during a warmer year with water temperatures above the long-term survey mean. These two surveys recorded significantly different spatial distributions for populations of several commercially important fish species, including walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and several flatfish species, as well as jellyfishes. Population shifts included latitudinal displacement as well as variable recruitment success. The large-scale distributional shifts reported here for high-biomass species raise questions about long-term ecosystem impacts, and highlight the need for continued monitoring. They also raise questions about our management strategies for these and other species in Alaska's large marine ecosystems.

Certain fishes and other aquatic organisms construct nests and provide parental care in the intertidal zonean environment characterized by fluctuating water levels, which can exert intermittent and sometimes extreme abiotic stress on the animals that live there including dramatic changes in temperature and dissolved oxygen level. In this study, we used the plainfin midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus, to test whether (1) nest site preferences and reproductive success vary across an intertidal elevation gradient, and (2) fish that nest at higher elevations pay greater physiological costs due to prolonged exposure to more extreme abiotic conditions. We found that fish preferred nests lower in the intertidal zone, with larger males outcompeting smaller males for these sites. Broods at high elevations suffered greater offspring mortality than broods at lower elevations. The average microhabitat temperature of nests was also warmer and more variable at higher elevations compared to lower elevations. While isolated from the ocean during low tides, care-giving parents increased their use of anaerobic metabolism, and potentially draw upon oxygen reserves in the swim bladder. Our results suggest that the choice of nesting location can have profound effects on a parent's physiology and may generate significant variation in reproductive success among individuals.

Hatching plasticity and the adaptive benefits of extended embryonic development in glassfrogs	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Centrolenidae; Embryo behavior; Frog; Development; Environmentally cued hatching; Phenotypic plasticity	RED-EYED TREEFROG; PARENTAL CARE; ANURA CENTROLENIDAE; ESCAPE BEHAVIOR; PREDATION RISK; TRADE-OFFS; EVOLUTION; SIZE; FROG; RESPONSES	Phenotypic plasticity in hatching age has been documented in many animals. A growing body of research indicates that embryos can rapidly hatch to escape egg-stage risk. However, fewer studies have tested whether selective tradeoffs in post-hatching stages favor trait plasticity. We assessed hatching plasticity and its benefits to the larval stage in five species of Neotropical glassfrogs (Centrolenidae). Glassfrog embryos develop on terrestrial vegetation and larvae in benthic stream sediments; thus hatching involves a dramatic habitat shift, when hatchlings must dive past stream fish to reach larval refuges. We found that all five species have extensive plasticity in hatching age and can delay hatching to more than double their minimum embryonic period. Along a stream in Panama, we found evidence that early hatching is induced by the risk of embryo predation, dehydration, and fungal infections. Differences in hatching timing were coupled with changes in hatchling phenotypes, such that younger hatchlings were smaller and less developed than older individuals. To assess locomotor function we measured diving speed, a key performance trait for newly hatched larvae. Older hatchlings dove 1.4-3.8 times faster than younger ones, which would reduce their exposure to predators in the water column. To assess the potential for exotrophic growth, we measured digestive system morphology and feeding onset across hatching ages. Younger hatchlings had intact yolk sacs and spent 4.5-6days as larvae before feeding, while older hatchlings entered the water with well-developed guts and fed immediately. Therefore, while early hatching enables embryos to escape egg-stage risk, it is associated with initial performance costs and a lag before feeding in the larval stage. We recovered consistent results across multiple genera of glassfrogs, supporting that hatching plasticity is widespread, ancient, and has been maintained by shared selective trade-offs in this family.

UV patches may be condition-dependent signals of mate quality. In the current study, we investigated associations between the morphological properties of two male wing patterns (one signalling and one non-signalling trait) and between these patterns and various environmental variables in seven species of the genus Gonepteryx (G. rhamni, G. nepalensis, G. maxima, G. amintha, G. aspasia, G. niphonica and G. cleopatra). We collected UV photographs of a total of 320 male specimens and analysed them using geometric morphometrics. Our results show that the shape of UV patches (a signalling trait) is more asymmetric than the wing venation (a non-signalling trait). In both examined traits, however, relationship between the environment and fluctuating asymmetry is significant only in a minority of species. Our results thus do not support the hypothesis that fluctuating asymmetry is a reliable indicator of an individual's quality, in other words, that UV patches are condition-dependent trait. Examination of correlations between the two investigated shapes and the environment yielded similar results, and while the shape of UV patterns tended to be more strongly associated with the environment than the venation patterns, the correlation reached a level of significance only in a minority of cases. Due to the ambiguity of our findings, we cannot corroborate the hypothesis that UV patches act as biological signals of male quality in Gonepteryx butterflies, which is the case in various other related butterfly species. Finally, we found that UV patches discriminate among various Gonepteryx species better than the venation patterns do, which indicates that UV patches play a role in species recognition. It also suggests that UV patterns could be a useful taxonomic trait.

Here, we explore the relative importance and synergies between two key drivers-propagule pressure and landscape disturbance-in determining the invasion of native forest remnants by dogs, one of the most abundant, widely distributed, and harmful invasive species worldwide. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods Combining a camera trap dataset (96 sites in forest remnants) and censuses of populations of dogs raised by humans across 12 landscapes (2,830 ha each), we used N-mixture models that account for imperfect detection to confront alternative hypotheses of invasion drivers. We then used this empirical evidence to predict the intensity of dog invasion across the Atlantic Forest hotspot. Results Propagule pressure (density of raised dogs, positive effect) and landscape disturbance (forest cover, negative effect) were equally important drivers of dog invasion, presenting additive rather than synergistic effects. Dogs invade forest remnants far from their homes, making the density of raised dogs the key component of propagule pressure (relative to dog spatial distribution). Forest cover was more important than either the length or density of forest edges, suggesting that both reduced area of forested barriers to long-distance movements and increased proximity of forests to edges facilitate dog access to forests. Across the Atlantic Forest, the combination of high human population density and extensive deforestation makes dog invasion an additional and widespread threat. Main conclusion Combined with available maps of priority areas for biodiversity conservation, our spatial prediction of dog invasion can help target areas for integrated management actions. These actions should go beyond measures to control dog populations and encompass the maintenance and restoration of native forests and strategic planning of afforestation through planted forests.

Methods We utilized generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) to analyse an 11-year data series on species richness of butterfly assemblages collected on 245 transects across Germany, located inside and outside N2000 sites, and comprising a total of 122 butterfly species. Results Butterfly species richness was highest inside N2000 protected areas, while outside it constantly declined with increasing distance from N2000 sites. We found an overall decline in species richness by 10% within 11 years. This decline neither differed between transects located inside or outside the N2000 network nor varied with distance from N2000 sites. Main conclusions The higher species richness inside the N2000 network underlines their proper designation and their potential for the conservation of biodiversity. However, the current negative trend in butterfly species richness across Germany is not mitigated by the N2000 network, and we assume insufficient management or measures targeted at other organisms than butterflies as potential reasons.

We explored (a) the effects of inter-annual variation in winter weather conditions on non-breeding distributional abundance of waterbirds exploiting different habitats (deep-water, shallow water, farmland) and (b) the long-term shift in the population centroid of these species and investigate its link to changes in weather conditions. Location Europe. Methods We fitted generalized additive mixed Models to a large-scale, 24-year dataset (1990-2013) describing the winter distributional abundance of 25 waterbird species. We calculated the annual and long-term (3-year periods) population centroid of each species and used the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index to explain the inter-annual and long-term shifts in their location. Results (a) Year-to-year southwestwards shifts in the population centroids of deep- and shallow-water species were linked to negative NAO values. Shallow-water species shifted northeastwards associated with positive NAO values and the distance shifted increased with increasing NAO. Deep-water species shifted northeastwards up to zero NAO indices, but showed no further increase at higher NAO values. (b) Deep-water species showed long-term northeastwards shifts in distributional abundance throughout the 1990s and the 2000s. Shallow-water species, on the other hand, shifted northeastwards during the 1990s and early 2000s, but southwestwards thereafter. There were no significant links between the NAO and year-to-year movements or long-term shifts in farmland species' population centroid. Main Conclusions We provide evidence for a link between both year-to-year and long-term changes in waterbird winter distributional abundances at large geographical scales to short- and long-term changes in winter weather conditions. We also show that species using shallow water, deep-water and farmland habitats responded differently, especially at high NAO values. As well as important ecological implications, these findings contribute to the development of future conservation measures for these species under current and future climate change.

However, for many taxa, in many regions, issues with currently available biological data curtail the application of spatial biodiversity models. Here we develop techniques to model spatial patterns of diverse subterranean invertebrate fauna (troglofauna and stygofauna) in the Pilbara region, to better inform biodiversity planning and management for these groups. In this context, the available data are highly biased in their distribution, with specimens often identified only at coarse taxonomic resolution, and individual community surveys sampling a relatively small proportion of the total assemblage at a location. Location: Pilbara bioregion, NW Australia. Methods: To overcome the challenges presented by the subterranean fauna data sets, we developed a community-level spatial biodiversity modelling framework, and applied this to model and project patterns in species richness and compositional turnover, for both troglofauna and stygofauna, using fine-resolution (similar to 30 m) environmental layers. Results: While there was a large amount of inherent noise in the collated data, our spatial models detected potential environmental drivers of community diversity that align with existing knowledge. For troglofauna, species richness was associated with iron-bearing geologies, while community compositional turnover was most strongly related to geographic distance. For stygofauna, groundwater depth was the primary predictor for richness and turnover, alongside other physicochemical groundwater attributes. We identified areas of high biodiversity significance by combining richness and turnover predictions. Main Conclusions: The spatial projections from our biodiversity models indicate the importance of the central Hamersley Range in harbouring unique and diverse subterranean assemblages. These models and projections provide an advanced platform for various biodiversity assessments, including identifying priorities for new surveys, and assessing the likely impacts of proposed development activities on the long-term persistence of subterranean species in the Pilbara.

Yet, this knowledge is still scarce for many marine top predators. Here, we aim to analyse movement patterns and spatial structuring of a large predator, the short-finned pilot whale Globicephala macrorhynchus, over a wide geographical area. Location North-east Atlantic, in Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Madeira and Canaries) and Iberian Peninsula (Sagres). Methods We used likelihood techniques to estimate residency times and transition probabilities and carried out social analysis from individual photographic identification data, and analysed year-round distribution from effort-related sightings, collated between 1999 and 2015. Results The best-fitting models included emigration and reimmigration and showed different residency times within each archipelago. A total of 26 individual movements from 21 individuals (from a sample of >2,300 individuals) were recorded between Madeira and the neighbouring archipelagos, and heterogeneous transition probabilities were estimated within and between areas. A social network diagram showed associations from animals with distinct residency patterns. Higher significant sighting rates were recorded during autumn in the Azores and Madeira. Main conclusions The variation in site fidelity and year-round occupancy among areas of the Macaronesia is consistent with some degree of population structuring, which combined with a connectivity network and seasonal inflows from animals inhabiting offshore waters, support the development of a complex social and geographical ecology in short-finned pilot whales. The combination of techniques applied in this study was an effective way to estimate parameters of movement, which could be a good practice to be used for other scenarios and species.

The biogeography of invasion in tropical and temperate seagrass beds: Testing interactive effects of predation and propagule pressure	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						biogeography; biotic interactions hypothesis; biotic resistance; invasion; latitude; propagule pressure	BIOTIC RESISTANCE; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; ECOLOGICAL RESISTANCE; DIDEMNUM-VEXILLUM; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; GLOBAL PATTERNS; MARINE; RECRUITMENT; STRONGER; DETERMINANTS	Aim Recent work has documented latitudinal gradients of biotic resistance, revealing diminished invasion success in the tropics as compared to the temperate zone. However, no studies have explored the biogeography of biotic resistance simultaneously with propagule pressure, which can greatly influence invasion dynamics and covary with latitude. Location 9-41 degrees latitude, north-western Atlantic seagrass beds. Methods We conducted field experiments to test the interactive effects of propagule pressure (experimentally placed recruits) and biotic resistance (predation) on invader performance in temperate and tropical seagrass beds. For these experiments, we used marine invertebrate propagules from bryozoans (Bugula neritina) and tunicates (Didemnum spp.). We also quantified natural recruitment with and without exposure to predators. Results Surprisingly, predation substantially reduced invader survival at almost all latitudes. Overall, invaders experienced 15%-27% survival with predation as opposed to 75%-87% survival without predation. These patterns did not change when we increased local scale propagule pressure of Bugula by over 2-fold. However, predation had no effect on invader survival in Florida, where natural recruitment was up to 500-fold greater than other sites. We also measured substantial in situ recruitment of Bugula onto bare experimental surfaces that was not diminished with exposure to predators at mid-latitudes, suggesting a regional scale predator swamping effect. Conclusions Contrary to recent findings of latitudinal variation in biotic resistance, we found that predation strongly reduced invader success in both temperate and tropical seagrass beds. However, our results also indicate that propagule pressure (natural recruitment) can influence invasion at the regional scale to overwhelm native communities. Our data suggest that predation and propagule pressure act at varying spatial scales to affect biogeographic patterns of invasion. The importance of latitudinal variation in these interactions is largely untested but deserves attention given that globalization will continue to facilitate opportunities for invasion.

Habitat discontinuities form strong barriers to gene flow among mangrove populations, despite the capacity for long-distance dispersal	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Avicennia marina; genotyping-by-sequencing; habitat discontinuities; mangrove; marine connectivity; propagule dispersal; seascape genomics	AVICENNIA-MARINA; SEASCAPE GENETICS; GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE; PROPAGULE DISPERSAL; PACKAGE; DIFFERENTIATION; CONNECTIVITY; OCEANOGRAPHY; ASSOCIATION; TERRESTRIAL	Aim Mangrove forests are among the world's most important ecosystems but are declining rapidly worldwide. Effective conservation management requires a better understanding of the patterns and drivers of gene flow across a range of spatial scales. Despite the capacity for long-distance propagule dispersal, field studies suggest that mangrove propagules tend not to disperse far from the release point, which has important implications for the impact of habitat discontinuities on gene flow. We use a comprehensive seascape genomics approach to investigate this concept in the world's most widely distributed mangrove species, Avicennia marina. Location Twenty-one sites along 2,400 km of Western Australian coastline. Methods We used 6,162 neutral SNP loci and a hierarchical sampling design to investigate patterns of gene flow and structuring among 21 populations of A. marina. We combined these data with GIS spatial analyses in a regression model to test the relative influence of habitat continuity and geographic distance on patterns of genetic differentiation. Results We found a complex pattern of gene flow; broadscale isolation-by-distance, disrupted by strong genetic discontinuities that coincided with gaps in mangrove distribution. These genetic discontinuities formed seven discrete subpopulations with negligible evidence for recent migration among them. The regression model combining marine geographic distance and habitat continuity as explanatory variables best fit the data, explaining 86% of the total genetic variation. Main Conclusions Our results validate previous assertions that propagule dispersal in A. marina is spatially limited and demonstrate that significant gaps in mangrove distribution present strong barriers to stepping-stone gene flow in this species. This reiterates that dispersive life history features cannot be assumed to lead to widespread connectivity and demonstrates that effective management of these important ecosystem builders should prioritize restoring habitat continuity and minimizing further fragmentation.

In this study, we aimed to map the patterns of genetic diversity and divergence of plant species in this region, and to identify potential evolutionary hotspots for conservation planning. Location Region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Methods We compiled published molecular data for 60 plant species, and calculated intra-population genetic diversity and inter-population genetic divergence using haplotype sequences (chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA). We analysed the relationships between genetic diversity and longitude, latitude and elevation. We mapped the landscapes of genetic diversity and divergence for each species in GIS, and combined the resulting landscapes in order to identify hotspots of high genetic diversity and divergence. Results There were no significant relationships between genetic diversity and longitude, latitude and elevation. For most species, areas characterized by high genetic diversity and divergence were located across the Hengduan Mountains. Nine evolutionary hotspots across the region of the QTP were identified. Main conclusions The Hengduan Mountains are a remarkable hotspot of all three dimensions of biodiversity (genes, species and ecosystems), yet patterns of genetic diversity were partially incongruent with the distribution of species diversity. For example, several hotspots of genetic diversity were located on the QTP proper, which is relatively species poor. This partial geographic mismatch between species and genetic diversity highlights the need to consider both aspects in conservation programs. Our study suggests that more protected areas in the region of the QTP need to be established in order to protect genetic diversity and thus adaptive potential.

A Test of Two Spatial Frameworks for Representing Spatial Patterns of Wetness in a Glacial Drift Watershed	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; FLOW-DIRECTION ALGORITHMS; BIOGEOCHEMICAL HOT-SPOTS; NORTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN; SOIL-MOISTURE PATTERNS; ECOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; HYDROLOGIC CONNECTIVITY; TOPOGRAPHIC CONTROLS; CONIFER ECOSYSTEMS; FORESTED CATCHMENT	In forest ecosystems, soil water availability is an important indicator and driver of biogeochemical transformations, pedogenesis, and surface water-groundwater linkages. Given the importance of soil moisture and shallow groundwater to ecosystem processes, field measurements are critical. We investigated the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of moisture conditions in a forested first-order watershed in northern Michigan. We measured soil volumetric water content (VWC, %) and water table levels across a range of glacial parent materials and landforms. We also assessed the utility of using two different spatial frameworks (Landscape Ecosystem classification, Topographic Wetness Index) to represent spatial patterns of soil moisture and water table levels across the watershed. At the lowest landscape position (outwash-lake plain swamp), saturation was perennial, with a median soil VWC of 53% and the water table 8 cm below ground surface. Among upland ecosystems, outwash landforms had consistently low VWC (16%) and showed no evidence of groundwater within 4 m of the surface; moraine ecosystems (till parent material) possessed mixed hydrologic conditions, with VWC ranging from 18 to 25% and water table levels 6 to 65 cm below the surface. In low-variability dry or wet areas with relatively homogenous soils, larger ecosystem classification map units provide good representations of moisture conditions. In the more heterogeneous till soils, a finer-scale spatial framework that accounts for local soil variation is optimal. A combination of both spatial frameworks is most appropriate for estimating moisture conditions in this glaciated landscape and can be used to identify biogeochemically important sites and to inform land management decisions.

But our knowledge of indicator species autoecology, the base of paleoenvironmental reconstructions, remains limited and commonly lacks robust statistical support and comprehensive comparison with environmental data. We analyzed marginal marine ostracod taxa at 52 sites in Hong Kong for which comprehensive environmental data are available. We applied linear regression models to reveal relationships between species distribution and environmental factors for 18 common taxa (mainly species, a few genera) in our Hong Kong dataset and identified indicator species of environmental parameters. For example, Sinocytheridea impressa, a widely distributed euryhaline species throughout the East and South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific, indicates eutrophication and bottom-water hypoxia. Neomonoceratina delicata, a widely known species from nearshore and estuarine environments in the East and South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific, indicates heavy metal pollution and increased turbidity. The 18 taxa used for this study are widely distributed geographically and divided into the following groups: widespread (throughout the northwestern Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions), temperate (South China Sea to Russia (Sea of Japan coast) and Japan), subtropical (Indo-Pacific to the East China Sea), tropical (Indo-Pacific and South China Sea), and globally distributed. With statistical support from ecological modeling and comprehensive environmental data, these results provide a robust baseline for ostracod-based Quaternary-Anthropocene paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the tropical-extratropical northwestern Pacific and Indo-Pacific. Highlights. 1. We provide a robust baseline for ostracod-based (microscopic Arthropods) paleoenvironmental reconstructions from Quaternary and Anthropocene marginal marine sediments. 2. The studied species have wide distributions over the tropics and extratropics of the northwestern Pacific and Indo-Pacific. 3. Ecological modeling has established ostracod species as reliable indicators for paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

What causes deforestation in Indonesia?	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						deforestation; drivers of deforestation; land cover change; Indonesia	OIL PALM; DRIVERS; FOREST; LAND	We investigate the causes of deforestation in Indonesia, a country with one of the highest rates of primary natural forest loss in the tropics, annually between 2001 and 2016. We use high spatial resolution imagery made available on Google Earth to characterize the land cover types following a random selection of deforestation events, drawn from the Global Forest Change dataset. Notorious in the region, large-scale oil palm and timber plantations together contributed more than two-fifths of nationwide deforestation over our study period, with a peak in late aughts followed by a notable decline up to 2016. Conversion of forests to grasslands, which comprised an average of one-fifth of national deforestation, rose sharply in dominance in years following periods of considerable fire activity, particularly in 2016. Small-scale agriculture and small-scale plantations also contributed one-fifth of nationwide forest loss and were the dominant drivers of loss outside the major islands of Indonesia. Although relatively small contributors to total deforestation, logging roads were responsible for a declining share of deforestation, and mining activities were responsible for an increasing share, over the study period. Direct drivers of deforestation in Indonesia are thus spatially and temporally dynamic, suggesting the need for forest conservation policy responses tailored at the subnational level, and new methods for monitoring the causes of deforestation over time.

Krill (Euphausia superba) distribution contracts southward during rapid regional warming	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							ANTARCTIC KRILL; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEA-ICE; ANNULAR MODE; COMMUNITIES; VARIABILITY; ECOSYSTEMS; HABITATS; GROWTH	High-latitude ecosystems are among the fastest warming on the planet(1). Polar species may be sensitive to warming and ice loss, but data are scarce and evidence is conflicting(2-4). Here, we show that, within their main population centre in the southwest Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba (hereafter, 'krill') has contracted southward over the past 90 years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have declined sharply and the population has become more concentrated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruitment, including a reduced density of juveniles following positive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and the survival of larval krill(5). However, the total post-larval density has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, suggesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred food web(6) and may affect biogeochemical cycling(7,8). Rapid climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems(3).

Physiology and iron modulate diverse responses of diatoms to a warming Southern Ocean	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; GROWTH; MODEL; WILL	Climate change-mediated alteration of Southern Ocean primary productivity is projected to have biogeochemical ramifications regionally, and globally due to altered northward nutrient supply(1,2). Laboratory manipulation studies that investigated the influence of the main drivers (CO2, light, nutrients, temperature and iron) on Southern Ocean diatoms revealed that temperature and iron exert major controls on growth under year 2100 conditions(3,4). However, detailed physiological studies, targeting temperature and iron, are required to improve our mechanistic understanding of future diatom responses. Here, I show that thermal performance curves of bloom-forming polar species are more diverse than previously shown(5), with the optimum temperature for growth (T-opt) ranging from 5-16 degrees C (the annual temperature range is -1-8 degrees C). Furthermore, iron deficiency probably decreases polar diatom T-opt and T-max (the upper bound for growth), as recently revealed for macronutrients and temperate phytoplankton(6). Together, this diversity of thermal performance curves and the physiological interplay between iron and temperature may alter the diatom community composition. T-opt will be exceeded during 2100 summer low iron/warmer conditions, tipping some species close or beyond T-max, but giving others a distinct physiological advantage. Future polar conditions will enhance primary productivity(2-4), but will also probably cause floristic shifts, such that the biogeochemical roles and elemental stoichiometry of dominant diatom species will alter the polar biogeochemistry and northwards nutrient supply.

Many studies have examined which factors motivate individuals to adapt. However, a comprehensive overview of the key motivating factors of various adaptation behaviours is lacking. Here, we conduct a series of meta-analyses using data from 106 studies (90 papers) conducted in 23 different countries to examine how 13 motivational factors relate to various adaptation behaviours. Descriptive norms, negative affect, perceived self-efficacy and outcome efficacy of adaptive actions were most strongly associated with adaptive behaviour. In contrast, knowledge and experience, which are often assumed to be key barriers to adaptation, were relatively weakly related to adaptation. Research has disproportionally focused on studying experience and risk perception, flooding and hurricanes, and preparedness behaviours, while other motivational factors, hazards and adaptive behaviours have been understudied. These results point to important avenues for future research.

In this context, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can produce an excellent platform for toxicant removal from water environments. In the current investigation, eight MOFs (ZIF-67-NO3, ZIF-67-CI, ZIF-67-SO4, ZIF-67-OAC, ZIF-8-Octahedron, ZIF-8-Leaf, ZIF-8-Cuboid, and ZIF-8-Cube) with different chemical and textural compositions were synthesized, and furthermore, the adsorption of Tetracycline (TC) by them was evaluated. Also, the key experimental conditions were modeled using response surface methodology (RSM). Among the prepared MOFs, the highest tendency for TC removal was nominated to ZIF-67- Acetate (ZIF-67-OAC). By model optimization approach, the optimum system conditions as contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH and adsorbed antibiotic concentration were reported as 26.8 min, 0.63 a, 5.9, and 74.6 mg/L, respectively. The proposed equilibrium model showed that the TC accumulated on ZIF-67-OAC surface is reversible in multilayer with the highest monolayer capacity of 446.9 mg/g. Furthermore, based on separation factor (K-L), TC adsorption is more favorable at a higher amount of MOFs added. Moreover, according to the fitted kinetic model, the process was controlled by chemisorption. ZIF-67-OAC shows excellent structural stability during mechanical agitation in an aqueous environment, and the TC removal capacities of regenerated adsorbent did not change considerably at the end of cycle 4 compared to the first cycle. Considering the findings among the examined MOFs, the ZIF-67-OAC can be approached as a promising adsorbent for the removal of antibiotics from aqueous environments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently, low-cost sensors have been used to collect high-resolution spatial and temporal air pollution data in real-time. In this paper, for the first time, Envirowatch E-MOTEs are employed for air quality monitoring as a case study in Sheffield. Ten E-MOTEs were deployed for a year (October 2016 to September 2017) monitoring several air pollutants (NO, NO2, CO) and meteorological parameters. Their performance was compared to each other and to a reference instrument installed nearby. E-MOTEs were able to successfully capture the temporal variability such as diurnal, weekly and annual cycles in air pollutant concentrations and demonstrated significant similarity with reference instruments. NO2 concentrations showed very strong positive correlation between various sensors. Mostly, correlation coefficients (r values) were greater than 0.92. CO from different sensors also had r values mostly greater than 0.92; however, NO showed r value less than 0.5. Furthermore, several multiple linear regression models (MLRM) and generalised additive models (GAM) were developed to calibrate the E-MOTE data and reproduce NO and NO2 concentrations measured by the reference instruments. GAMs demonstrated significantly better performance than linear models by capturing the non-linear association between the response and explanatory variables. The best GAM developed for reproducing NO2 concentrations returned values of 0.95, 3.91, 0.81, 0.005 and 0.61 for factor of two (FAC2), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), normalised mean biased (NMB) and coefficient of efficiency (COE), respectively. The low-cost sensors offer a more affordable alternative for providing real-time high-resolution spatiotemporal air quality and meteorological parameter data with acceptable performance.

Studies of tropical species are particularly lacking, hence we grew juvenile trees of Alchornea glandulosa under conditions of elevated temperature (+ 1.5 degrees C, eT) and elevated CO2 (+400ppm, eC) in a factorial open top chamber experiment. We addressed three questions: i) To what extent does stomatal conductance (g(s)) reduce with eT and eC treatments?; ii) Is there an interactive effect of eT and eC on g(s)?; iii) Does reduced g(s) as a result of eT and/or eC cause an increase in leaf temperature?; iv) Do the photosynthetic temperature optima (T-opt) and temperature response of photosynthetic capacities (V-cmax, J(max)) shift with higher growth temperatures? The experiment was performed during an anomalously hot period, including a heatwave during the acclimation period. Our key findings are that: 1) the eT treatment reduced g(s) more than the eC treatment, 2) reduced g(s) caused an increase in leaf temperatures, and 3) net photosynthesis and photosynthetic capacities showed very high temperature tolerances with no evidence for acclimation to the eT treatment. Our results suggest that A. glandulosa may be able to cope with increases in air temperatures, however reductions in g(s), may cause higher leaf temperatures beyond those induced by an air temperature rise over the coming century.

Many areas across Australia have high variability patterns of rainfall and inadequate rainfall records which has various effects on the availability of food and water. Modelling spatial and temporal rainfall is essential for prediction and simulation purposes in numerous aspects of planning, agriculture, forestry, meteorology and hydrology. Two different models are generally used to describe the two main features of rainfall: the occurrence and the amount. This paper describes the occurrence probability of 5-day average rainfall (successive 5-day rainfall mean) in Australia. Daily accumulated rainfall observations of 105 meteorological stations spanning from 1950 to 2013 were collected from Australian Bureau of Meteorology for the study. Logistic regression is applied to predict rainfall probability of occurrence in all the meteorological stations using nine observational rainfall stations as case studies. Weather conditions such as the 5-day periods which is defined as the consecutive 5-day average rainfall in a year and the annual rainfall which is defined as the annual daily rainfall mean factors were used as the predictors. The fitted logistic regression models predicted the occurrence and non-occurrence 5-day average rainfall events quite well with good accuracies. The predictors significantly affected the fitted models in all stations. Analysis of the levels of each of the predictors showed that the parameters of the 5-day period factors were more influential in all the models, particularly during the rainy season in most stations relative to that of the annual factors. The fitted models could be used to simulate rainfall probabilities for the stations with insufficient rainfall histories and could assist agronomist and various stakeholders in the planning of their various operations.

The following parameters were monitored: temperature (Temp), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate as N (NO3--N), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity (Turb), thermotolerant coliforms (TCol), water level (WL), total agricultural area (AGR), total pasture area (PAS), total precipitation in 1 day (Pr1d), 10 days (Pr10d), and 30 days (Pr30d) prior to water sampling date. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA)/factor analysis (FA) were utilized to evaluate the data. The results indicate the predominance of organic and biological pollutants in the Siriri River basin, which are related to agricultural activities and urban sewage, mainly in the wet periods. The ANOVA indicates significant influence of locality on pH, EC, TDS, DO, TCol, Chl-a, Turb, TN, TP, and WL. Seasonality factor has a significant influence on Temp, NO3--N, Chl-a, Turb, TN, TP, Pr1d, Pr10d, and Pr30d. The PCA highlights the influence of agricultural activities in component 1 (PC1), explaining 26% of the variance of the river water quality in the watershed.

Such individual differences are potentially associated with differences in foraging efficiency and in fitness. Furthermore, behavioral responses may be correlated in specific suites of so-called behavioral syndromes that are consistent across different contexts and with time. Here, we present a field investigation on individual differences between wild, free-flying nectarivorous bats (Glossophaga commissarisi) in the foraging context. We further investigated how individual differences affect choice performance, and we examined their interdependence within hypothesized behavioral syndrome structures. Free-ranging bats were individually identified as they visited an array of 24 artificial flowers with nectar of high or low sugar concentration. We found that three behavioral measures of foraging behavior were individually stable over the two-month observation period. We investigated the link between individual behavioral measures and measures of choice performance using generalized linear mixed models. Individual measures of choice performance showed significant repeatability, and we found evidence that bats making more visits per bout tend to be slower in learning to avoid unprofitable flowers. We used a multi-response generalized linear mixed model to estimate between-individual correlations and compare hypothesized syndrome structures. There were no clear patterns of between-individual correlations among the behavioral measures in our study, despite the measures exhibiting significant repeatability. This may indicate that foraging behavior depends on multiple individual behavior dimensions that are not adequately described by simple models of behavioral syndromes.Significance statementNectar-feeding bats, like other animals including humans, have their own peculiar ways of consuming food that differ among individuals of the same species. We characterized the feeding habits of individuals in a population of wild, free-flying bats that were trained to gather nectar from computer-automated artificial flowers in a Costa Rican rainforest. Individual bats responded to the experimental conditions in different ways, but consistently over the two-month observation period. For example, some bats frequently returned to the same flowers, while others tended to meticulously probe most flowers they encountered before returning to a previously visited location. Interestingly, bats also consistently differed in how fast they learned to avoid flowers with dilute nectar and the faster learners were the bats that made only a few visits on each feeding trip. This suggests that individual foraging strategies might be associated with differences in foraging efficiency.

Here, we used information on previous egg-rejection experiments to explore the recognition abilities of both males and females of Eurasian blackbirds Turdus merula towards experimental eggs with a variable degree of mimicry. We found that both sexes recognized non-mimetic eggs, supporting the idea that visits to the nest can favor the evolution of rejection abilities. In contrast, only females recognized mimetic eggs, indicating that although recognition abilities can evolve in both sexes, they are subsequently refined in females probably due to their more frequent interaction with parasitic eggs. Clutch size affected nest attendance since females, but not males, spent more time at the nest and visited it more frequently in larger clutches. Finally, our recordings showed that blackbird males are able not only to recognize, but also to eject parasitic eggs. Our results provide new insights into the main anti-parasitic defense in birds, egg rejection, and highlight the need of considering the role of the non-incubating sex in egg-rejection studies.Significance statementGiven the high costs associated to avian brood parasitism, both sexes are expected to evolve anti-parasitic defenses. However, in those species in which only females incubate, females have traditionally been assumed to be the responsible for egg rejection. Here, using the Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula), we investigated the existence of egg-rejection abilities in non-incubating males and compared them to those exhibited by females. We found that males can recognize non-mimetic eggs, although their recognition abilities were less fine-tuned compared to females, who also recognized mimetic eggs. Even though females were the responsible for most documented egg-ejection events, recordings confirmed that males could also be involved in egg ejection, which could have important implication for the evolution of anti-parasitic defenses in host populations.

To investigate the sustainability of seafood consumption, we propose a methodology to examine the impact of seafood supply chains across national boundaries: the seafood consumption footprint. The seafood consumption footprint is expressed as the biomass of domestic and imported seafood production required to satisfy national seafood consumption, and is estimated using a multi-regional input output model. Thus, we reconstruct for the first time the global fish biomass flows in national supply chains to estimate consumption footprints at the global, country and sector levels (capture fisheries, aquaculture, distribution and processing, and reduction into fishmeal and fish oil) taking into account the biomass supply from beyond national borders.

Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: 6-98) want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: 87-96) want to retain or own more livestock over the next 5-10years. Understanding current and future resource use will help plan context-specific conservation efforts that are better aligned with reducing specific pressures around protected areas.

To provide a high flexibility to end-users but keep BioTOOL easily manageable, the approach uses a pre-trained artificial neural networks library consisting of different variable combinations. In BioTOOL's workflow, end-user will be asked for current measurements disregarding the combination of those. BioTOOL uses a seek-and-implement method to find the correct stored network for the entered input. This approach results in predictions similar to the optimized pre-trained network.

However, most existing studies make no distinction between direct and indirect effects of climate, which substantially hinders our understanding of how climate constrains biodiversity globally. Using data from 35 large forest plots, we test hypothesised relationships amongst climate, topography, forest structural attributes (stem abundance, tree size variation and stand basal area) and tree species richness to better understand drivers of latitudinal tree diversity patterns. Climate influences tree richness both directly, with more species in warm, moist, aseasonal climates and indirectly, with more species at higher stem abundance. These results imply direct limitation of species diversity by climatic stress and more rapid (co-)evolution and narrower niche partitioning in warm climates. They also support the idea that increased numbers of individuals associated with high primary productivity are partitioned to support a greater number of species.

Predation risk has been shown to regulate mutualism dynamics in species-specific case studies; however, we lack studies which investigate whether predation can also explain broader patterns of mutualism evolution. We report that fish-anemone mutualisms have evolved on at least 55 occasions across 16 fish families over the past 60 million years and that adult body size is associated with the ontogenetic stage of anemone mutualisms: larger-bodied species partner with anemones as juveniles, while smaller-bodied species partner with anemones throughout their lives. Field and laboratory studies show that predators target smaller prey, that smaller fishes associate more with anemones, and that these relationships confer protection to small fishes. Our results indicate that predation is likely driving the recurrent convergent evolution of fish-anemone mutualisms and suggest that similar ecological processes may have selected convergence in interspecies interactions in other animal clades.

Yet, how populations of consumers respond to allochthonous inputs at a macroecological scale is still unclear. Using a meta-analysis spanning several biomes, we show that the abundance of recipient populations is 36-57% larger with increased allochthonous inputs. The strength of direct effects on the recipients of these inputs as well as the indirect effects on the consumers of these recipients (i.e. ascending indirect effects) are constant across a latitudinal gradient spanning subtropical, arid, temperate, boreal and arctic ecosystems. However, indirect effect on the in situ resources of the input recipient (i.e. descending indirect effects) decreases with latitude. Our results suggest that the influence of allochthonous inputs can vary across large-scale gradients of ecosystem productivity and may be driven by the types of trophic interactions within recipient food webs.

Along elevation gradients, a general pattern is that herbivores and predators are abundant at low elevation and progressively diminish at higher elevations. To determine whether plant adaptation along such a gradient influences top-down control of herbivores, we manipulated soil predatory nematodes, root herbivore pressure and plant ecotypes in a reciprocal transplant experiment. Plant survival was significantly higher for low-elevation plants, but only when in the presence of predatory nematodes. Using olfactometer bioassays, we showed correlated differential nematode attraction and plant ecotype-specific variation in volatile production. This study not only provides an assessment of how elevation gradients modulate the strength of trophic cascades, but also demonstrates how habitat specialisation drives variation in the expression of indirect plant defences.

Chemical ecology has been biased towards studying effects of individual metabolites even though effective plant defenses are comprised of diverse mixtures of metabolites. We tested the phytochemical landscape hypothesis, positing that trophic interactions are contingent upon their spatial location across a phytochemically diverse landscape. Specifically, intraspecific phytochemical changes associated with vertical strata in forests were hypothesised to affect herbivore communities of the neotropical shrub Piper kelleyi Tepe (Piperaceae). Using a field experiment, we found that phytochemical diversity increased with canopy height, and higher levels of phytochemical diversity located near the canopy were characterised by tradeoffs between photoactive and non-photoactive biosynthetic pathways. For understory plants closer to the ground, phytochemical diversity increased as direct light transmittance decreased, and these plants were characterised by up to 37% reductions in herbivory. Our results suggest that intraspecific phytochemical diversity structures herbivore communities across the landscape, affecting total herbivory.

Feeding experiments with nine related stick insect species revealed that insects retain the ability to use ancestral host plants after shifting to novel hosts, with host plant shifts generating fundamental feeding niche expansions. These expansions were, however, not accompanied by expansions of the realised feeding niches, as species on novel hosts are generally ecologically specialised. For shifts from angiosperm to chemically challenging conifer hosts, generalist fundamental feeding niches even evolved jointly with strong host plant specialisation, indicating that host plant specialisation is not driven by constraints imposed by plant chemistry. By coupling analyses of plant chemical compounds, fundamental and ecological feeding niches in multiple insect species, we provide novel insights into the evolutionary dynamics of host range expansion and contraction in herbivorous insects.

Some mammalian species have adapted to these novel environments, but it remains unclear which characteristics allow them to persist. To address this question, we identified 190 mammals regularly recorded in urban settlements worldwide, and used phylogenetic path analysis to test hypotheses regarding which behavioural, ecological and life history traits favour adaptation to urban environments for different mammalian groups. Our results show that all urban mammals produce larger litters; whereas other traits such as body size, behavioural plasticity and diet diversity were important for some but not all taxonomic groups. This variation highlights the idiosyncrasies of the urban adaptation process and likely reflects the diversity of ecological niches and roles mammals can play. Our study contributes towards a better understanding of mammal association to humans, which will ultimately allow the design of wildlife-friendly urban environments and contribute to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.

Least concern to endangered: Applying climate change projections profoundly influences the extinction risk assessment for wild Arabica coffee	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						area of occupancy; climate change; coffee; extent of occurrence; generation length; IUCN Red List; population metrics	IUCN RED LIST; CONSERVATION	Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) is a key crop in many tropical countries and globally provides an export value of over US$13 billion per year. Wild Arabica coffee is of fundamental importance for the global coffee sector and of direct importance within Ethiopia, as a source of harvestable income and planting stock. Published studies show that climate change is projected to have a substantial negative influence on the current suitable growing areas for indigenous Arabica in Ethiopia and South Sudan. Here we use all available future projections for the species based on multiple general circulation models (GCMs), emission scenarios, and migration scenarios, to predict changes in Extent of Occurrence (EOO), Area of Occupancy (AOO), and population numbers for wild Arabica coffee. Under climate change our results show that population numbers could reduce by 50% or more (with a few models showing over 80%) by 2088. EOO and AOO are projected to decline by around 30% in many cases. Furthermore, present-day models compared to the near future (2038), show a reduction for EOO of over 40% (with a few cases over 50%), although EOO should be treated with caution due to its sensitivity to outlying occurrences. When applying these metrics to extinction risk, we show that the determination of generation length is critical. When applying the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red list of Threatened Species (IUCN Red List) criteria, even with a very conservative generation length of 21 years, wild Arabica coffee is assessed as Threatened with extinction (placed in the Endangered category) under a broad range of climate change projections, if no interventions are made. Importantly, if we do not include climate change in our assessment, Arabica coffee is assessed as Least Concern (not threatened) when applying the IUCN Red List criteria.

Combined with other anthropogenic drivers, the impacts may alter species spatio-temporal distributions and contribute to population declines and local extinctions. To provide timely management and conservation of fishes, it is relevant to identify species that will be most impacted by climate change and those that will be resilient. Species traits are considered a promising source of information on characteristics that influence resilience to various environmental conditions and impacts. To this end, we collated life-history traits and climatic niches of 443 European freshwater fish species and compared those identified as susceptible to climate change to those that are considered to be resilient. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in their distribution, life history, and climatic niche, with climate-change-susceptible species being distributed within the Mediterranean region, and being characterized by greater threat levels, lesser commercial relevance, lower vulnerability to fishing, smaller body and range size, and warmer thermal envelopes. Based on our results, we establish a list of species of highest priority for further research and monitoring regarding climate-change susceptibility within Europe. The presented approach represents a promising tool to efficiently assess large groups of species regarding their susceptibility to climate change and other threats, and to identify research and management priorities.

Twenty-first-century climate change impacts on marine animal biomass and ecosystem structure across ocean basins	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; ensemble modeling; future projection; marine animal biomass; marine ecosystem models; model intercomparison; ocean basins; uncertainty	OXYGEN LIMITATION; GLOBAL OCEAN; FISHERIES; MODEL; BIOGEOGRAPHY; COMMUNITIES; PROJECTIONS; COASTAL	Climate change effects on marine ecosystems include impacts on primary production, ocean temperature, species distributions, and abundance at local to global scales. These changes will significantly alter marine ecosystem structure and function with associated socio-economic impacts on ecosystem services, marine fisheries, and fishery-dependent societies. Yet how these changes may play out among ocean basins over the 21st century remains unclear, with most projections coming from single ecosystem models that do not adequately capture the range of model uncertainty. We address this by using six marine ecosystem models within the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP) to analyze responses of marine animal biomass in all major ocean basins to contrasting climate change scenarios. Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), total marine animal biomass declined by an ensemble mean of 15%-30% (+/- 12%-17%) in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific, and the Indian Ocean by 2100, whereas polar ocean basins experienced a 20%-80% (+/- 35%-200%) increase. Uncertainty and model disagreement were greatest in the Arctic and smallest in the South Pacific Ocean. Projected changes were reduced under a low (RCP2.6) emissions scenario. Under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, biomass projections were highly correlated with changes in net primary production and negatively correlated with projected sea surface temperature increases across all ocean basins except the polar oceans. Ecosystem structure was projected to shift as animal biomass concentrated in different size-classes across ocean basins and emissions scenarios. We highlight that climate change mitigation measures could moderate the impacts on marine animal biomass by reducing biomass declines in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins. The range of individual model projections emphasizes the importance of using an ensemble approach in assessing uncertainty of future change.

Arctic browning: Impacts of extreme climatic events on heathland ecosystem CO2 fluxes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						arctic; browning; Calluna vulgaris; climate change; dwarf shrub; extreme events; snow cover; stress; winter	WINTER WARMING EVENTS; VEGETATION; ANTHOCYANINS; RESPIRATION; TUNDRA; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; BOREAL; TRENDS; GROWTH; DAMAGE	Extreme climatic events are among the drivers of recent declines in plant biomass and productivity observed across Arctic ecosystems, known as "Arctic browning." These events can cause landscape-scale vegetation damage and so are likely to have major impacts on ecosystem CO2 balance. However, there is little understanding of the impacts on CO2 fluxes, especially across the growing season. Furthermore, while widespread shoot mortality is commonly observed with browning events, recent observations show that shoot stress responses are also common, and manifest as high levels of persistent anthocyanin pigmentation. Whether or how this response impacts ecosystem CO2 fluxes is not known. To address these research needs, a growing season assessment of browning impacts following frost drought and extreme winter warming (both extreme climatic events) on the key ecosystem CO2 fluxes Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and soil respiration (R-soil) was carried out in widespread sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland, incorporating both mortality and stress responses. Browning (mortality and stress responses combined) caused considerable site-level reductions in GPP and NEE (of up to 44%), with greatest impacts occurring at early and late season. Furthermore, impacts on CO2 fluxes associated with stress often equalled or exceeded those resulting from vegetation mortality. This demonstrates that extreme events can have major impacts on ecosystem CO2 balance, considerably reducing the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem, even where vegetation is not killed. Structural Equation Modelling and additional measurements, including decomposition rates and leaf respiration, provided further insight into mechanisms underlying impacts of mortality and stress on CO2 fluxes. The scale of reductions in ecosystem CO2 uptake highlights the need for a process-based understanding of Arctic browning in order to predict how vegetation and CO2 balance will respond to continuing climate change.

Projected global changes urge the question how this interplay will be affected by browning (increasing input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter), nutrient enrichment and warming. We explored this with a process-based model of a shallow lake food web consisting of benthic and pelagic components (abiotic resources, primary producers, grazers, carnivores), and compared model expectations with the results of a browning and warming experiment in nutrient-poor ponds harboring a boreal lake community. Under low nutrient conditions, the model makes three major predictions. (a) Browning reduces light and increases nutrient supply; this decreases benthic and increases pelagic production, gradually shifting productivity from the benthic to the pelagic habitat. (b) Because of active habitat choice, fish exert top-down control on grazers and benefit primary producers primarily in the more productive of the two habitats. (c) Warming relaxes top-down control of grazers by fish and decreases primary producer biomass, but effects of warming are generally small compared to effects of browning and nutrient supply. Experimental results were consistent with most model predictions for browning: light penetration, benthic algal production, and zoobenthos biomass decreased, and pelagic nutrients and pelagic algal production increased with browning. Also consistent with expectations, warming had negative effects on benthic and pelagic algal biomass and weak effects on algal production and zoobenthos and zooplankton biomass. Inconsistent with expectations, browning had no effect on zooplankton and warming effects on fish depended on browning. The model is applicable also to nutrient-rich systems, and we propose that it is a useful tool for the exploration of the consequences of different climate change scenarios for productivity and food web dynamics in shallow lakes, the worldwide most common lake type.

Miami heat: Urban heat islands influence the thermal suitability of habitats for ectotherms	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Anolis; canopy cover; operative temperature; thermal performance; thermal preference; thermoregulation; urbanization	ANOLIS-SAGREI; TEMPERATURE REGULATION; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; GENETIC-VARIATION; NICHE SHIFT; LIZARD; CLIMATE; INVASION; THERMOREGULATION; URBANIZATION	The urban heat island effect, where urban areas exhibit higher temperatures than less-developed suburban and natural habitats, occurs in cities across the globe and is well understood from a physical perspective and at broad spatial scales. However, very little is known about how thermal variation caused by urbanization influences the ability of organisms to live in cities. Ectotherms are sensitive to environmental changes that affect thermal conditions, and therefore, increased urban temperatures may pose significant challenges to thermoregulation and alter temperature-dependent activity. To evaluate whether these changes to the thermal environment affect the persistence and dispersal of ectothermic species in urban areas, we studied two species of Anolis lizards (Anolis cristatellus and Anolis sagrei) introduced to Miami-Dade County, FL, USA, where they occur in both urban and natural habitats. We calculated canopy openness and measured operative temperature (T-e), which estimates the distribution of body temperatures in a non-thermoregulating population, in four urban and four natural sites. We also captured lizards throughout the day and recorded their internal body temperature (T-b). We found that urban areas had more open canopies and higher T-e compared to natural habitats. Laboratory trials showed that A. cristatellus preferred lower temperatures than A. sagrei. Urban sites currently occupied by each species appear to lower thermoregulatory costs for both species, but only A. sagreihad field T-b that were more often within their preferred temperature range in urban habitats compared to natural areas. Furthermore, based on available T-e within each species' preferred temperature range, urban sites with only A. sagrei appear less suitable for A. cristatellus, whereas natural sites with only A. cristatellus are less suitable for A. sagrei. These results highlight how the thermal properties of urban areas contribute to patterns of persistence and dispersal, particularly relevant for studying species invasions worldwide.

Global warming and changes in human land use, such as grazing pressure and afforestation, have been suggested to be major threats for biodiversity in the mountain areas, affecting species abundance and causing distribution shifts towards mountaintops. Population shifts towards poles and mountaintops have been documented in several areas, indicating that climate change is one of the key drivers of species' distribution changes. Despite the high conservation concern, relatively little is known about the population trends of species in mountain areas due to low accessibility and difficult working conditions. Thanks to the recent improvement of bird monitoring schemes around Europe, we can here report a first account of population trends of 44 bird species from four major European mountain regions: Fennoscandia, UK upland, south-western (Iberia) and south-central mountains (Alps), covering 12 countries. Overall, the mountain bird species declined significantly (-7%) during 2002-2014, which is similar to the declining rate in common birds in Europe during the same period. Mountain specialists showed a significant -10% decline in population numbers. The slope for mountain generalists was also negative, but not significantly so. The slopes of specialists and generalists did not differ from each other. Fennoscandian and Iberian populations were on average declining, while in United Kingdom and Alps, trends were nonsignificant. Temperature change or migratory behaviour was not significantly associated with regional population trends of species. Alpine habitats are highly vulnerable to climate change, and this is certainly one of the main drivers of mountain bird population trends. However, observed declines can also be partly linked with local land use practices. More efforts should be undertaken to identify the causes of decline and to increase conservation efforts for these populations.

Projected changes in wind assistance under climate change for nocturnally migrating bird populations	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						global climate change; migration altitude; nocturnal migration; North America; seasonal bird migration; weather surveillance radar; wind assistance	LOW-LEVEL JET; FLIGHT ALTITUDE; WEATHER; MIGRANTS; DISTANCE; PRECIPITATION; CIRCULATION; PHENOLOGY; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Current climate models and observations indicate that atmospheric circulation is being affected by global climate change. To assess how these changes may affect nocturnally migrating bird populations, we need to determine how current patterns of wind assistance at migration altitudes will be enhanced or reduced under future atmospheric conditions. Here, we use information compiled from 143 weather surveillance radars stations within the contiguous United States to estimate the daily altitude, density, and direction of nocturnal migration during the spring and autumn. We intersected this information with wind projections to estimate how wind assistance is expected to change during this century at current migration altitudes. The prevailing westerlies at midlatitudes are projected to increase in strength during spring migration and decrease in strength to a lesser degree during autumn migration. Southerly winds will increase in strength across the continent during both spring and autumn migration, with the strongest gains occurring in the center of the continent. Wind assistance is projected to increase across the central (0.44 m/s; 10.1%) and eastern portions of the continent (0.32 m/s; 9.6%) during spring migration, and wind assistance is projected to decrease within the central (0.32 m/s; 19.3%) and eastern portions of the continent (0.17 m/s; 6.6%) during autumn migration. Thus, across a broad portion of the continent where migration intensity is greatest, the efficiency of nocturnal migration is projected to increase in the spring and decrease in the autumn, potentially affecting time and energy expenditures for many migratory bird species. These findings highlight the importance of placing climate change projections within a relevant ecological context informed through empirical observations, and the need to consider the possibility that climate change may generate both positive and negative implications for natural systems.

Many studies have focused on the role of abiotic factors, especially temperature, in generating clines, but biotic factors, including the introduction of non-native species, may also drive clinal variation. We assessed the impact of invasion by predatory fire ants on latitudinal clines in multiple fitness-relevant traits-morphology, physiological stress responsiveness, and antipredator behavior-in a native fence lizard. In areas invaded by fire ants, a latitudinal cline in morphology is opposite both the cline found in museum specimens from historical populations across the species' full latitudinal range and that found in current populations uninvaded by fire ants. Similarly, clines in stress-relevant hormone response to a stressor and in antipredator behavior differ significantly between the portions of the fence lizard range invaded and uninvaded by fire ants. Changes in these traits within fire ant-invaded areas are adaptive and together support increased and more effective antipredator behavior that allows escape from attacks by this invasive predator. However, these changes may mismatch lizards to the environments under which they historically evolved. This research shows that novel biotic pressures can alter latitudinal clines in multiple traits within a single species on ecological timescales. As global change intensifies, a greater understanding of novel abiotic and biotic pressures and how affected organisms adapt to them across space and time will be central to predicting and managing our changing environment.

Effects of climate and demography on reproductive phenology of a harvested marine fish population	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						age truncation; hatch dates; ichthyoplankton; larval fish; match-mismatch; recruitment; spawning; temperature; walleye pollock	POLLOCK THERAGRA-CHALCOGRAMMA; LARVAL WALLEYE POLLOCK; ANNUAL EGG-PRODUCTION; SHELIKOF-STRAIT; ATLANTIC COD; BERING-SEA; EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT; OVARIAN MATURATION; NORTHERN GULF; SPAWNING TIME	Shifts in phenology are a well-documented ecological response to changes in climate, which may or may not be adaptive for a species depending on the climate sensitivity of other ecosystem processes. Furthermore, phenology may be affected by factors in addition to climate, which may accentuate or dampen climate-driven phenological responses. In this study, we investigate how climate and population demographic structure jointly affect spawning phenology of a fish species of major commercial importance: walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). We use 32 years of data from ichthyoplankton surveys to reconstruct timing of pollock reproduction in the Gulf of Alaska and find that the mean date of spawning has varied by over 3 weeks throughout the last >3 decades. Climate clearly drives variation in spawn timing, with warmer temperatures leading to an earlier and more protracted spawning period, consistent with expectations of advanced spring phenology under warming. However, the effects of temperature were nonlinear, such that additional warming above a threshold value had no additional effect on phenology. Population demographics were equally as important as temperature: An older and more age-diverse spawning stock tended to spawn earlier and over a longer duration than a younger stock. Our models suggest that demographic shifts associated with sustainable harvest rates could shift the mean spawning date 7 days later and shorten the spawning season by 9 days relative to an unfished population, independent of thermal conditions. Projections under climate change suggest that spawn timing will become more stable for walleye pollock in the future, but it is unknown what the consequences of this stabilization will be for the synchrony of first-feeding larvae with production of zooplankton prey in spring. With ongoing warming in the world's oceans, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying reproductive phenology can improve our ability to monitor and manage species under changing climate conditions.

A spatio-temporal, landscape perspective on Acacia dealbata invasions and broader land use and cover changes in the northern Eastern Cape, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Acacia dealbata; Dynamic; Invasion; Landscapes; Scales; Transitions	PLANT INVASIONS; ALIEN; ESTABLISHMENT; ALLELOPATHY; COMMONAGE; INFERENCE; PATTERNS; STATE	Biological invasions and human land use both have the potential to drastically alter the patterns and processes of landscapes, driving habitat fragmentation and altering natural disturbance regimes. The proliferation of an invasive species depends on composition and configuration of the landscape, as well as the invasiveness of the species. To effectively manage a highly invasive species, such as Acacia dealbata, it is crucial to understand the historical progression of the invasion within the landscape. This study sought to examine the landscape dynamics of biological invasions by tracking the historical spread of A. dealbata and broader land use/land cover (LULC) changes at different spatio-temporal scales in the northern Eastern Cape. A time-series of aerial photographs were systematically classified according to designated A. dealbata and LULC categories in ArcGIS to track the changes in the extent and rate of spread of A. dealbata. Markedly dynamic, multi-directional, and spatio-temporally variable LULC transitions were observed across the northern Eastern Cape over the last six decades. A. dealbata frequently retained a high proportion of cover over time, and despite the loss of cover to other LULC classes, a net increase in A. dealbata cover occurred as it spread at an overall annual rate of 0.11-0.21%, occupying approximately 8-18% of land cover across all sampled sites by 2013. Any management interventions to limit or control A. dealbata should therefore consider the spatio-temporal and LULC nuances of landscapes.

A better understanding of the composition of aerosol particles is beginning to be recognized as critical for ecological research to further comprehend the link between aerosols and ecosystems. While chemical characterization of aerosols has been practiced in the atmospheric science community, detailed methodology tailored to the needs of ecological research does not exist yet. In this study, we describe an efficient methodology (atmo-ecometabolomics), in step-by-step details, from the sampling to the data analyses, to characterize the chemical composition of aerosol particles, namely atmo-metabolome. This method employs mass spectrometry platforms such as liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometries (MS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FT-ICR-MS). For methodology evaluation, we analyzed aerosol particles collected during two different seasons (spring and summer) in a low-biological-activity ecosystem. Additionally, to further validate our methodology, we analyzed aerosol particles collected in a more biologically active ecosystem during the pollination peaks of three different representative tree species. Our statistical results showed that our sampling and extraction methods are suitable for characterizing the atmo-ecometabolomes in these two distinct ecosystems with any of the analytical platforms. Datasets obtained from each mass spectrometry instrument showed overall significant differences of the atmo-ecometabolomes between spring and summer as well as between the three pollination peak periods. Furthermore, we have identified several metabolites that can be attributed to pollen and other plant-related aerosol particles. We additionally provide a basic guide of the potential use ecometabolomic techniques on different mass spectrometry platforms to accurately analyze the atmo-ecometabolomes for ecological studies. Our method represents an advanced novel approach for future studies in the impact of aerosol particle chemical compositions on ecosystem structure and function and biogeochemistry.

Camera- and live-trapping of carnivores during an 18-month period revealed that the SPA hosts most mesocarnivore species that occur in Germany. Since raccoon (Procyon lotor), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and domestic cat (Felis silvestris f. catus) showed highest abundance-activity indices, we used GPS telemetry for a detailed analysis of spatial behavior of nine raccoons and five red foxes over a 22-month period. Spatial distribution patterns showed a strong difference between both species: raccoons showed a clear preference for reed swamps and shrub swamps, clustering in high concentrations along the edges of water bodies. Although this behavior is likely due to the high and year-round availability of aquatic food sources, overlap of raccoon core areas with high densities of wetland birds likely results in a high level of sublethal predation effects particularly on waterfowl breeding in reed beds. Red foxes showed much more evenly distributed movement patterns and a high intraspecific variability in habitat preference, revealing a general preference for woodlands and an avoidance of wetlands. Thus, predation pressure by foxes on ground-breeders seems to be lower and focusing on grassland-associated bird species in close proximity to woodlands. Consequently, our study highlights the need for a differentiated view on the predatory potential of particular mesocarnivore species on the endangered bird species in the SPA, leading to future management implications with a focus on swampland habitats.

First, we evaluated the entire data set to compare the performance of the models in the determination of the loading parameter k and the mass attenuation cross section sigma. Then we investigate k and a for different station types. The data set comprises 299 filters, all representative for 24 h samples collected with High-Volume-Samplers. Mass concentrations ranged from approximately 5-100 mu g m(-3) and covered all seasons. Both approaches give statistically indistinguishable results of k with values of 1.00*10(-3) (+/- 2*10(-4)) and 0.97*10(-3) (+/- 1*10(-4)), respectively, if the entire data set is evaluated. The "Drinovec" approach gives slightly lower values for a than "Virkkula" with values of 32.1 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 1.1 m(2) g(-1)) and 35.3 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 1.9 m(2) g(-1)). If the data set is restricted to ATN < 300 only, no statistically relevant changes are obtained for k and a using the "Virkkula" equation. Applying the "Drinovec" equation both parameters, k and a increase when the data set is restricted. The investigation of the different station types yields values of k statistically not different from zero, whereas sigma values are different for the respective station types. Highest values of sigma = 33.7 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 1.4 m(2) g(-1)) were observed for the remote, followed by sigma = 31.8 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 0.5 m(2) g(-1)) for the rural-background station and lowest values of sigma = 24.4 m(2) g(-1) (+/- 0.5 m(2) g(-1)) for the urban-traffic stations, possibly reflecting the respective aerosol type. Based on the results for k and sigma using either overall values or station type specific values we performed an extensive validation, discussing the application of the transmissometer measurements for a quick, easy and non-destructive quantification of eBC on either fresh sampled or archived filters of different station types. Applying the method for stations not classified as urban, rural or remote a deviation of eBC and EC values up to 23% can be expected. If the station type is known and the respective k and sigma values are used this deviation goes down to 10% or lower. This would allow users to obtain long-term time-series going back to times when no on-line instruments were existing, and to obtain these data sets for sites where no on-line instruments are installed even now.

We developed a substantially revised version of AirGIS (hereafter, new AirGIS) as a new modelling system in open-source GIS i.e. PostgreSQL software with its spatial extension PostGIS to (1) optimize the model performance enabling model calculations for a large number of sites over a large geographical area, with limited computing resources (2) replace the outdated programming language Avenue (3) become independent of commercial GIS software. This paper, therefore, aims to describe the overall structure of new AirGIS modelling system together with its strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the new AirGIS has been evaluated against various measured datasets of ambient air pollution (NOx, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5). In terms of reproducing temporal variation (single location, time series of concentrations e.g. annual, daily etc.) of air pollution, the new model achieved correlations (R) in the range 0.45-0.96. While, in terms of reproducing the spatial variation (several locations, single time interval), the new AirGIS achieved correlations in the range 0.32-0.92. The new model, therefore, can be used for both short- and long-term air pollution exposure assessments to facilitate health related studies. However, the present evaluation of the new modelling system also revealed that the new AirGIS significantly overestimated the observed concentrations for two out of four datasets. The possible reasons for these errors and future directions to reducing the bias in the new model output have been discussed.

In this study, we compared three approaches for determining the wet and dry deposition of nitrogen (total deposition) at 17 intensively monitored forest sites in Switzerland. Specifically, we considered approaches based on: 1) measurements of bulk deposition and throughfall in 2014 (throughfall method); 2) measurements of bulk deposition and measurements of air concentrations of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), to which deposition velocities were applied, also in 2014 (inferential method); and 3) a model developed for Switzerland at a high spatial resolution, run for the five-year period 2013-2017 (emission based model). In addition, changes over two decades were assessed using continuous measurements of throughfall and bulk deposition. Further, air concentrations of NH3 and NO2 measured in 2014 were compared with concentrations measured in 2000 at 10 of the sites. The three approaches generally yielded comparable estimates of total deposition, with some notable differences at some sites. For both the model and the inferential method, uncertainties were related to the deposition velocities that were applied to air concentrations of N compounds, especially for NH3. The throughfall method provided a minimum estimate of the total N deposition in the forest, but the fraction of the deposited N that is directly taken up by the canopy remained difficult to quantify. Nitrogen deposition has decreased since the mid-1990s at the majority of the sites. However, deposition of the reduced forms of N seems to have stagnated at the local level. Furthermore, N deposition is still too high in comparison with the range of empirical critical loads of N (CLN). The minimum deposition estimated from throughfall exceeds the lower limit of CLN at all sites except those in the Central Alps. Deposition estimated with the model and the inferential method exceeds the lower limit of CLN at all sites and even exceeds the upper limit at several locations.

These EDCs dysregulate a number of biomolecules and pathways, including microRNAs. MicroRNAs can be carried in transport systems called extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are present in most biofluids. EVs in the follicular fluid, which fills the ovarian follicle and influences oocyte developmental competency, carry microRNAs (EV-miRNAs) that have been associated with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether EDCs affect EV-miRNAs in follicular fluid. Objectives: This study sought to determine whether urinary concentrations of phenols and phthalates biomarkers are associated with EV-miRNAs expression in follicular fluid collected from women undergoing IVF treatment. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 130 women recruited between January 2014 and August 2016 in a tertiary university-affiliated hospital. Participants provided urine samples during ovarian stimulation and on the day of oocyte retrieval. We assessed urinary concentrations of five phenols, eight phthalate metabolites, and one phthalate alternative metabolite. EV-miRNAs were isolated from follicular fluid and their expression profiles were measured using the TaqMan Open Array (R) Human microRNA panel. We fitted multivariable linear regression models and principal component analysis to examine associations between individual and molar sums of exposure biomarkers and EV-miRNAs. Results: Of 754 miRNAs tested, we detected 133 EV-miRNAs in the microRNA array which expressed in at least 50% of the follicular fluid samples. After adjusting for multiple testing, we identified eight EV-miRNAs associated with individual phenols and phthalate metabolites, as well as molar Sigma DEHP that met a q < 0.10 false-discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-374a, and hsa-miR15b was associated with mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate concentrations, hsa-let-7c with concentrations mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), and the sum of metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, hsa-miR-24 with mono-n-butyl phthalate concentrations, hsa-miR-19a with cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid monohydroxy isononyl ester (MHiNCH), and hsa-miR-375 with ethyl paraben concentrations. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, gene targets and pathways of these EV-miRNAs were predicted in silico and 17 KEGG FDR-significant pathways related to follicular development and oocyte competence were identified. Conclusions: Our results show that urinary concentrations of select phenol and phthalate metabolites are correlated with altered EV-miRNAs expression in follicular fluid. These findings may provide insight regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying adverse effects of phenol and phthalate exposure on female fertility.

Satellite remote sensing measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were statistically associated with in-situ observations after 2013 to predict PM2.5 concentrations nationwide, while the lack of surface monitoring data before 2013 have created difficulties in historical PM2.5 exposure estimates. Hindcast approaches using statistical models or chemical transport models (CTMs) were developed to overcome this limitation, while those approaches still suffer from incomplete daily coverage due to missing AOD data or limited accuracy due to uncertainties of CTMs. Here we developed a new machine learning (ML) model with high-dimensional expansion (HD-expansion) of numerous predictors (including AOD and other satellite covariates, meteorological variables and CTM simulations). Through comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear effects of, and interactions among different predictors, the HD-expansion parameterized the association between PM2.5 and AOD as a nonlinear function of space and time covariates (e.g., planetary boundary layer height and relative humidity). In this way, the PM2.5-AOD association can vary spatiotemporally. We trained the model with data from 2013 to 2016 and evaluated its performance using annually-iterated cross-validation, which iteratively held out the in-situ observations for a whole calendar year (as testing data) to examine the predictions from a model trained by the rest of the observations. Our estimates were found to be in good agreement with in-situ observations, with correlation coefficients (R-2) of 0.61, 0.68, and 0.75 for daily, monthly and annual averages, respectively. To interpolate the missing predictions due to incomplete AOD data, we incorporated a generalized additive model into the ML model. The two-stage estimates of PM2.5 sacrificed the prediction accuracy on a daily timescale (R-2 = 0.55), but achieved complete spatiotemporal coverage and improved the accuracy of monthly (R-2 = 0.71) and annual (R-2 = 0.77) averages. The model was then used to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations during 2000-2016 across China and estimate long-term trends in PM2.5 for the period. We found that population-weighted concentrations of PM2.5 significantly increased, by 2.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.74, 2.46) mu g/m(3)/year during 2000-2007, and rapidly decreased by 4.51 (3.12, 5.90) mu g/m(3)/year during 2013-2016. In this study, we produced AOD-based estimates of historical PM2.5 with complete spatiotemporal coverage, which were evidenced as accurate, particularly in middle and long term. The products could support large-scale epidemiological studies and risk assessments of ambient PM2.5 in China.

Low-calorie sweeteners and health outcomes: A demonstration of rapid evidence mapping (rEM)	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Rapid evidence mapping; Evidence map; Systematic review; Evidence-based methodology; Low calorie sweeteners; Artificial sweeteners	REVIEWS	Background: "Evidence Mapping" is an emerging tool that is increasingly being used to systematically identify, review, organize, quantify, and summarize the literature. It can be used as an effective method for identifying well-studied topic areas relevant to a broad research question along with any important literature gaps. However, because the procedure can be significantly resource-intensive, approaches that can increase the speed and reproducibility of evidence mapping are in great demand. Methods: We propose an alternative process called "rapid Evidence Mapping" (rEM) to map the scientific evidence in a time-efficient manner, while still utilizing rigorous, transparent and explicit methodological approaches. To illustrate its application, we have conducted a proof-of-concept case study on the topic of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) with respect to human dietary exposures and health outcomes. During this process, we developed and made publicly available our study protocol, established a PECO (Participants, Exposure, Comparator, and Outcomes) statement, searched the literature, screened titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant studies, and applied semi-automated machine learning approaches to tag and categorize the included articles. We created various visualizations including bubble plots and frequency tables to map the evidence and research gaps according to comparison type, population baseline health status, outcome group, and study sample size. We compared our results with a traditional evidence mapping of the same topic published in 2016 (Wang et al., 2016). Results: We conducted an rEM of LCS, for which we identified 8122 records from a PubMed search (January 1, 1946-May 1, 2014) and then utilized machine learning (SWIFT-Active Screener) to prioritize relevant records. After screening 2267 (28%) of the total set of titles and abstracts to achieve 95% estimated recall, we ultimately included 297 relevant studies. Overall, our findings corroborated those of Wang et al. (2016) and identified that most studies were acute or short-term in healthy individuals, and studied the outcomes of appetite, energy sensing and body weight. We also identified a lack of studies assessing appetite and dietary intake related outcomes in people with diabetes. The rEM approach required approximately 100 person-hours conducted over 7 calendar months. Conclusion: Rapid Evidence Mapping is an expeditious approach based on rigorous methodology that can be used to quickly summarize the available body of evidence relevant to a research question, identify gaps in the literature to inform future research, and contextualize the design of a systematic review within the broader scientific literature, significantly reducing human effort while yielding results comparable to those from traditional methods. The potential time savings of this approach in comparison to the traditional evidence mapping process make it a potentially powerful tool for rapidly translating knowledge to inform science-based decision-making.

Maternal swimming pool exposure during pregnancy in relation to birth outcomes and cord blood DNA methylation among private well users	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS; FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE; DRINKING-WATER; BROMINATED TRIHALOMETHANES; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; HALOACETIC ACID; BLADDER-CANCER; FETAL-GROWTH; WEIGHT; HALOBENZOQUINONE	Swimming in pools during pregnancy may expose the fetus to water disinfection by-products (DBP). As yet, our understanding of the impacts on DBPs on the fetus is uncertain. Individuals with public water systems are typically exposed to DBPs through drinking, showering and bathing, whereas among those on private water systems, swimming in pools may be the primary exposure source. We analyzed the effects of maternal swimming on birth outcomes and cord blood epigenetic changes in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, a cohort of pregnant women with households on private water systems. Information about swimming in pools during pregnancy was obtained from 1033 women via questionnaires. Swimming pool use and duration were modeled using linear regression with newborn weight, length, and head circumference (z-scores) and genome wide cord blood DNA methylation as the outcomes and with adjustment for potential confounders. Overall 19.7% of women reported swimming in a pool during pregnancy. Among swimmers, duration of swimming was inversely related to head circumference (-0.02 z-score per 10% increase in duration, P = 0.004). No associations were observed with birth weight, length or DNA methylation modifications.

Spatial and temporal variation in nitrogen fixation and its importance to phytoplankton in phosphorus-rich lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						delta N-15; cyanobacteria; nitrogen demand; nutrient limitation; stable isotopes	HARD-WATER LAKES; N-2 FIXATION; FRESH-WATER; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; CARBON FLUX; EUTROPHICATION; CYANOBACTERIA; VARIABILITY	Limnological theory posits that phosphorus (P) limits primary production in freshwater lakes, in part because fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) can compensate for limitations in nitrogen (N) supply to phytoplankton. However, quantitative estimates of the degree to which N-2 fixation satisfies planktonic N demand are rare. Here we used biweekly sampling during summer in seven lakes over 2 decades to estimate both planktonic N-2 fixation and phytoplankton N demand. We further assessed the ability of biologically fixed N to satisfy N needs of primary producers in productive hardwater lakes. Phytoplankton N requirements, derived from estimates of phytoplankton productivity and N content, were moderately synchronous (S = 0.41) among lakes (ca. 0.1-9.2 mg N m(-3) hr(-1)). In contrast, rates of N-2 fixation determined using isotopic natural abundance method (NAM; 0.002-3.2 mg N m(-3) hr(-1)), or heterocyte-based calculations (0.10-1.78 mg N m(-3) hr(-1)), varied asynchronously (S-NAM = -0.03 and S-Heterocyte = -0.11) among basins, accounted for a median of 3.5% (mean 11.3% +/- 21.6) of phytoplankton demand, and were correlated to the abundance of Nostocales cyanobacteria when analysed using generalised additive models. Overall, the total mass of fixed N accounted for a median of only 3.0% of the spring standing stock of total dissolved N in study lakes (mean 7.5 +/- 12.1%), with higher relative importance of fixed N in highly productive downstream lakes. Thus, while fixed N helps sustain primary productivity, particularly in years with high rates of N-2-fixation, it does not appear to eliminate N limitation of phytoplankton growth in these P-rich hardwater lakes.

However, quantifications of biotic interactions frequently overlook demographic variabilities within populations, which can modulate interaction strengths, such as sex and reproductive status. Compositional population ratios between males and females, alongside reproductive status, are highly variable temporally in ephemeral aquatic systems, and may profoundly mediate levels of ecological impact and thus stability of trophic groups. In the present study, we apply functional responses (resource intake as a function of resource density) to quantify predatory impacts of adult males, non-gravid females, and gravid females of the calanoid copepod Lovenula raynerae (Diaptomidae), an abundant ephemeral pond specialist, on larvae of the Culex pipiens (Culicidae) mosquito complex. We then develop a novel metric to forecast population-level impacts across different population sex ratio scenarios. Lovenula raynerae demonstrated prey population destabilising Type II functional responses irrespective of sex and reproductive status, yet variable functional response magnitudes were found. While male and non-gravid female copepods exhibited similar functional response maximum feeding rates, gravid female feeding rates were substantially higher, implying higher resource demands for progeny development. Ecological impacts of L. raynerae on lower trophic groups increased markedly where their abundances increased but, crucially, also as population sex ratios became more biased towards gravid female copepods. We demonstrate that population-level impacts do not only correlate tightly with abundance but may be further modulated by reproductive status variations. Thus, the development of sex-skewed ratios in favour of gravid females during the hydroperiod probably heightens ecological impacts on lower trophic groups. The implications of these results for prey population stability are discussed in the context of freshwater ecosystems.	[Cuthbert, Ross N.; Dick, Jaimie T.

Do metacommunity theories explain spatial variation in fish assemblage structure in a pristine tropical river?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						Clementsian distribution; environmental filtering; fluvial gradient; species sorting	ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; PATCH SCALE; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS; GRADIENT; ELEMENTS; BASINS	Understanding processes driving patterns of species distribution and diversity is one of the main objectives of community ecology. There has been a growing recognition that local environmental conditions are not the only factor structuring ecological communities, and that large-scale spatial variation and dispersal also have major influences. The aim of our study was to evaluate spatial variation in fish assemblage structure along the longitudinal fluvial gradient of the Bita River, a nearly pristine tributary of the Orinoco River in the Llanos region of Colombia. Standardised surveys conducted at 34 sites throughout the basin during the low water period in January and March 2016 yielded 25,928 fish specimens representing 201 species. Twenty-seven environmental variables were recorded at each site, and asymmetric eigenvector maps were used to model spatial variables. To understand spatial variation in local fish assemblages and their relationships with the environmental and spatial variables, two approaches were used. First, we applied the elements of metacommunity structure framework, followed by a variation decomposition analysis that allowed the metacommunity to be classified according to six alternative patterns of species distribution and four alternative metacommunity paradigms. We hypothesised that at a basin scale a major fraction of variation in structure is explained by a pure environmental effect and metacommunity patterns should reveal a Clementsian distribution. At a more regional scale (localities within a river section), assemblages in upstream and downstream regions may reflect different metacommunity processes. Because headwater streams are isolated within the river network, they should receive fewer migrants and may have local assemblages strongly influenced by local environmental conditions and species sorting with one of three possible distributional patterns (Clementsian, Gleasonian, or evenly spaced) would be observed. Conversely, downstream sites closer to the river mouth should be influenced by high dispersal, resulting in a greater importance of spatial factors and the mass effect, with metacommunity patterns nested along the longitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that the fish metacommunity in the Bita River exhibits a Clementsian distribution, implying that species respond to the environmental and fluvial gradient as groups along the longitudinal gradient. These replacements were associated with environmental heterogeneity, especially regarding habitat features. Similarly, the variation partitioning analysis showed that the pure environmental component was higher than the pure spatial component, which is consistent with species sorting. In this paper, we demonstrated that variation partitioning and metacommunity structure analyses provided complementary findings to infer processes structuring fish assemblages in the Bita River. Both approaches identified species sorting as the principal structuring processes in this system. Therefore, strategies to preserve fish diversity in this system must emphasise maintenance of habitat heterogeneity and connectivity.

Localized recombination drives diversification of killing spectra for phage-derived syringacins	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							PSEUDOMONAS-SYRINGAE; BACTERIOCIN; EVOLUTION; AERUGINOSA; PYOCIN; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; RECEPTOR; ECOLOGY; DISEASE; GENES	To better understand the potential for antagonistic interactions between members of the same bacterial species, we have surveyed bacteriocin killing activity across a diverse suite of strains of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Our data demonstrate that killing activity from phage-derived bacteriocins of P. syringae (R-type syringacins) is widespread. Despite a high overall diversity of bacteriocin activity, strains can broadly be classified into five main killing types and two main sensitivity types. Furthermore, we show that killing activity switches frequently between strains and that switches correlate with localized recombination of two genes that together encode the proteins that specify bacteriocin targeting. Lastly, we demonstrate that phage-derived bacteriocin killing activity can be swapped between strains simply through expression of these two genes in trans. Overall, our study characterizes extensive diversity of killing activity for phage-derived bacteriocins of P. syringae across strains and highlights the power of localized recombination to alter phenotypes that mediate strain interactions during evolution of natural populations and communities.

Brackish brine (fed by meltwater inside the ice) is an expanding sympagic habitat in summer all over the CAO. We report for the first time the structure of bacterial communities in this brine. They are composed of psychrophilic extremophiles, many of them related to phylotypes known from Arctic and Antarctic regions. Community structure displayed strong habitat segregation between brackish ice brine (IB; salinity 2.4-9.6) and immediate sub-ice seawater (SW; salinity 33.3-34.9), expressed at all taxonomic levels (class to genus), by dominant phylotypes as well as by the rare biosphere, and with specialists dominating IB and generalists SW. The dominant phylotypes in IB were related to Candidatus Aquiluna and Flavobacterium, those in SW to Balneatrix and ZD0405, and those shared between the habitats to Halomonas, Polaribacter and Shewanella. A meta-analysis for the oligotrophic CAO showed a pattern with Flavobacteriia dominating in melt ponds, Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria in solid ice cores, Flavobacteriia, Gamma- and Betaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in brine, and Alphaproteobacteria in SW. Based on our results, we expect that the roles of Actinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in the CAO will increase with global warming owing to the increased production of meltwater in summer. IB contained three times more phylotypes than SW and may act as an insurance reservoir for bacterial diversity that can act as a recruitment base when environmental conditions change.

Microbiota and skin defense peptides may facilitate coexistence of two sympatric Andean frog species with a lethal pathogen	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							YELLOW-LEGGED FROG; BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS; SYMBIOTIC BACTERIA; IMMUNE DEFENSES; CHYTRID FUNGUS; AMPHIBIAN CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS; INHIBIT GROWTH; DISEASE; EXTINCTION; RESISTANCE	Management of hyper-virulent generalist pathogens is an emergent global challenge, yet for most disease systems we lack a basic understanding as to why some host species suffer mass mortalities, while others resist epizootics. We studied two sympatric species of frogs from the Colombian Andes, which coexist with the amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), to understand why some species did not succumb to the infection. We found high Bd prevalence in juveniles for both species, yet infection intensities remained low. We also found that bacterial community composition and host defense peptides are specific to amphibian life stages. We detected abundant Bd-inhibitory skin bacteria across life stages and Bd-inhibitory defense peptides post-metamorphosis in both species. Bd-inhibitory bacteria were proportionally more abundant in adults of both species than in earlier developmental stages. We tested for activity of peptides against the skin microbiota and found that in general peptides did not negatively affect bacterial growth and in some instances facilitated growth. Our results suggest that symbiotic bacteria and antimicrobial peptides may be co-selected for, and that together they contribute to the ability of Andean amphibian species to coexist with the global pandemic lineage of Bd.

Effects of nutrient enrichment on surface microbial community gene expression in the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							PHYTOPLANKTON; DEEP; FIXATION; ECOTYPES; SEA; NORMALIZATION; VARIABILITY; PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; ARCHAEA	Marine microbial communities are critical for biogeochemical cycles and the productivity of ocean ecosystems. Primary productivity in the surface ocean is constrained by nutrients which are supplied, in part, by mixing with deeper water. Little is known about the time scales, frequency, or impact of mixing on microbial communities. We combined in situ sampling using the Environmental Sample Processor and a small-scale mixing experiment with lower euphotic zone water to determine how individual populations respond to mixing. Transcriptional responses were measured using the MicroTOOLs (Microbiological Targets for Ocean Observing Laboratories) microarray, which targets all three domains of life and viruses. The experiment showed that mixing substantially affects photosynthetic taxa as expected, but surprisingly also showed that populations respond differently to unfiltered deep water which contains particles (organisms and detritus) compared to filtered deep water that only contains nutrients and viruses, pointing to the impact of biological interactions associated with these events. Comparison between experimental and in situ population transcription patterns indicated that manipulated populations can serve as analogs for natural populations, and that natural populations may be frequently or continuously responding to nutrients from deeper waters. Finally, this study also shows that the microarray approach, which is complementary to metatranscriptomic sequencing, is useful for determining the physiological status of in situ microbial communities.

Specifically, we know little about how the evolutionary and ecological differences between invaders and natives regulate invasion success and impact. Darwin's naturalization hypothesis suggests that the phylogenetic distance between invaders and natives could be a useful predictor of invasion, and modern coexistence theory proposes that invader-native niche and fitness differences combine to determine invasion outcome. However, the relative importance of phylogenetic distance, niche difference and fitness difference for microbial invasions has rarely been examined. By using laboratory bacterial microcosms as model systems, we experimentally assessed the roles of these differences for the success of bacterial invaders and their impact on native bacterial community structure. We found that the phylogenetic distance between invaders and natives failed to explain invasion success and impact for two of three invaders at the phylogenetic scale considered. Further, we found that invasion success was better explained by invader-native niche differences than relative fitness differences for all three invaders, whereas invasion impact was better explained by invader-native relative fitness differences than niche differences. These findings highlight the utility of considering modern coexistence theory to gain a more mechanistic understanding of microbial invasions.

Bacterial contributions to delignification and lignocellulose degradation in forest soils with metagenomic and quantitative stable isotope probing	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							COMPLETE GENOME SEQUENCE; LIGNIN; IDENTIFICATION; COMPLEX; QUALITY; FUNGAL; ENZYME; DECOMPOSITION; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY	Delignification, or lignin-modification, facilitates the decomposition of lignocellulose in woody plant biomass. The extant diversity of lignin-degrading bacteria and fungi is underestimated by culture-dependent methods, limiting our understanding of the functional and ecological traits of decomposers populations. Here, we describe the use of stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with amplicon and shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterize the functional attributes of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose-degrading fungi and bacteria in coniferous forest soils from across North America. We tested the extent to which catabolic genes partitioned among different decomposer taxa; the relative roles of bacteria and fungi, and whether taxa or catabolic genes correlated with variation in lignocellulolytic activity, measured as the total assimilation of C-13-label into DNA and phospholipid fatty acids. We found high overall bacterial degradation of our model lignin substrate, particularly by gram-negative bacteria (Comamonadaceae and Caulobacteraceae), while fungi were more prominent in cellulose-degradation. Very few taxa incorporated C-13-label from more than one lignocellulosic polymer, suggesting specialization among decomposers. Collectively, members of Caulobacteraceae could degrade all three lignocellulosic polymers, providing new evidence for their importance in lignocellulose degradation. Variation in lignin-degrading activity was better explained by microbial community properties, such as catabolic gene content and community structure, than cellulose-degrading activity. SIP significantly improved shotgun metagenome assembly resulting in the recovery of several high-quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes and over 7500 contigs containing unique clusters of carbohydrate-active genes. These results improve understanding of which organisms, conditions and corresponding functional genes contribute to lignocellulose decomposition.

Pangenomic comparison of globally distributed Poribacteria associated with sponge hosts and marine particles	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							CANDIDATE PHYLUM PORIBACTERIA; MICROBIAL ABUNDANCE SPONGES; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; CELL GENOMICS REVEALS; RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENE; SINGLE-CELL; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY; READ ALIGNMENT; DIVERSITY; BACTERIA	Candidatus Poribacteria is a little-known bacterial phylum, previously characterized by partial genomes from a single sponge host, but never isolated in culture. We have reconstructed multiple genome sequences from four different sponge genera and compared them to recently reported, uncharacterized Poribacteria genomes from the open ocean, discovering shared and unique functional characteristics. Two distinct, habitat-linked taxonomic lineages were identified, designated Entoporibacteria (sponge-associated) and Pelagiporibacteria (free-living). These lineages differed in flagellar motility and chemotaxis genes unique to Pelagiporibacteria, and highly expanded families of restriction endonucleases, DNA methylases, transposases, CRISPR repeats, and toxin-antitoxin gene pairs in Entoporibacteria. Both lineages shared pathways for facultative anaerobic metabolism, denitrification, fermentation, organosulfur compound utilization, type IV pili, cellulosomes, and bacterial proteosomes. Unexpectedly, many features characteristic of eukaryotic host association were also shared, including genes encoding the synthesis of eukaryotic-like cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix digestive enzymes, phosphoinositol-linked membrane glycolipids, and exopolysaccharide capsules. Complete Poribacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences were found to contain multiple mismatches to "universal" 16S rRNA gene primer sets, substantiating concerns about potential amplification failures in previous studies. A newly designed primer set corrects these mismatches, enabling more accurate assessment of Poribacteria abundance in diverse marine habitats where it may have previously been overlooked.

However, efficacies of environmental flows are often restrained by other demands along the river and inappropriate water management, leading to only spatially limited habitats being suitable for ecosystem functioning. This paper presents current restoration measures in the lower reaches of the Tarim riparian ecosystem in Northwest China and analyzes ecohydrological dynamics as a function of environmental flows. The groundwater level oscillation before/after and during the environmental flows (i.e., manmade water diversion) was examined, and the Mann-Kendall test was applied to identify the overall trend of change in groundwater depth from 2003 to 2011. The growth, distribution, health status (referred to as "vitality") and renewal potentials of the dominant tree species Populus euphratica were quantified by using individual-based repeated measurements of P. euphratica morphology in two sampling sites (a 100-ha permanent plot and five random sampling plots with 50-m radii) at Arghan village in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. Based on these measurements, the effects of restoration measures on the groundwater recharge and the revitalization of degraded trees were assessed. The main contribution and achievements of the water diversion project on rehabilitation of the degraded riparian forests were evaluated; further, the limitations and challenges faced by of the restoration project were examined. The results of this research could help establish a reference for monitoring changes in riparian forests in Central Asia and possibly recommend restoration measures for riparian forest ecosystems in arid regions worldwide.

It is often assumed that these stressful abiotic conditions alone are responsible for the speed of succession, but theory predicts that abiotic stress interacts strongly with levels of anthropic biomass disturbance. We conducted vegetation surveys on a long-term (similar to 50 years) tailings storage area on a gold mine site, and measured substrate properties (elemental composition, water content, pH), vegetation cover and species composition, as well as levels of human disturbance. Although the substrate was extremely infertile, vegetation cover on these substrates varied from completely denuded areas to forested areas. The main determinant of the amount of vegetation cover was the level of human disturbance, not abiotic conditions. Both abiotic conditions and levels of human disturbance determined the composition of the vegetation. These results highlight the fact that even low levels of human disturbance can have large impacts on the speed of primary succession on these sites.

A glasshouse study was undertaken to address this with aim to evaluate the effect of substrate compaction on the water use of a phytocap plant community. Four levels of relative compaction (RC), i.e. the ratio of dry bulk density over the standard maximum dry bulk density, (72%, 77%, 82%, and 87%) were considered. The native tree and grass species selected were typical of an Australian phytocap plant community: Themeda triandra, Microlaena stipoides, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, Acacia mearnsii and Allocasuarina verticillata. Plant water use was measured by weight as the difference between planted and unplanted cores over 5 drying periods occurring through the first 6 months of plant establishment traversing winter, spring and summer. Plant water use was optimal for all species at low-intermediate RC (72%, 77% and 82%), and all species except Themeda triandra, were most negatively impacted by the highest RC of 87%. The best linear model based on Akaike's Information Criterion included a second-order term for the continuous fixed factor 'RC' and the categorical fixed factor 'species'. This model showed plant water use to be optimum at a RC of 76.5% and highlighted a wide range of RC's (70-83%), for which plant water use is not < 90% of this optimum. It also highlighted increasing plant water use-sensitivity to RC's beyond these ranges, with a RC > 86% and a RC < 67% leading to reductions in plant water use of 20% or more. Substrate specifications are recommended to optimize phytocap plant water use within achievable RC ranges. These can be generalized beyond application to a single species or substrate texture to inform the design and quality assurance of substrate placement for future landfill phytocaps.

Phosphorus release from shoots of Phleum pretense L. after repeated freeze-thaw cycles and harvests	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cold climates; Vegetated buffer strips; Water extractable phosphorus; Nitric-acid digested phosphorus; Watershed management	VEGETATED BUFFER STRIPS; RUNOFF; NUTRIENT; NITROGEN; LOSSES; RETENTION; BIOMASS; WATERS	Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) are a common best management practice used in agricultural landscapes because of their possible effectiveness to reduce loadings of sediments and nutrients, including phosphorus (P), to adjacent surface waters. In cold climates, buffer vegetation is prone to numerous freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). The freezing may cause plant cells to lyse and release P, which would reduce buffer effectiveness. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to investigate if P fertilization of soils growing timothy grass (Phleum pretense L.) and the number of FTCs affect the type and concentrations of P released from the above-ground biomass. Timothy grass was grown in a greenhouse with and without P fertilizer application. Above-ground biomass was harvested twice: after 65 days of growth and again 37 days later, and these samples were subjected to zero, three, or six FTCs. Water extractions of the above-ground biomass were analysed for water extractable P (WEP) and alkali P with an oxidative agent (P-OH). Above-ground biomass was additionally analysed for nitric acid digested P (P-HNO3). Results from both harvests showed no significant difference in WEP or P-OH concentrations between soil fertilizer treatments, but there was a significant difference in WEP concentrations with increased FTCs. Combined data from both harvests showed that after six FTCs, 65-100% of P-OH was released as WEP, and 19-55% of P-HNO3 was released as WEP. These results indicate that timothy grass undergoing multiple FTCs can become a source of highly bioavailable P and that, as previous work has showed, harvesting vegetation is a potentially useful management practice in order to reduce P losses to surface waters.

We investigated how field abandonment influences spider abundance and diversity in rice paddy ecosystems. We collected spiders in paddy fields and six types of abandoned fields with different combinations of vegetation successional stage (early, middle, or late) and soil water content (wet or dry) in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan. The abundance and species richness of cursorial spiders were higher in the abandoned fields than in the paddy fields, but there was no difference in the case of orb-weavers. Total spider abundance decreased with increasing successional stage, but the responses differed between orb-weavers and cursorial spiders: the abundance of orb-weavers decreased in the middle stage, whereas that of cursorial spiders decreased in the late stage. Soil water content affected only the abundance of orb-weavers: abundance was higher on wet soil than on dry soil. Species richness was not affected by either vegetation succession or soil water content. On the other hand, an individual-based species-accumulation curve showed that rarefied species richness tended to be greater in abandoned fields at the late stage. Ordination analysis showed that species composition clearly differed among paddy and abandoned fields at different successional stages. Our findings suggest that spider abundance and diversity are higher in abandoned fields than in cultivated fields, and that species composition varies depending on field abandonment and succession. Therefore, maintaining cultivated fields and abandoned fields at different successional stages can maintain a high diversity of spiders across rice paddy ecosystems.

This also applies to banks of German Federal Waterways, which are mostly fixed by ripraps to prevent bank erosion as a consequence of wave disturbance by shipping traffic. Since ripraps notably alter functions of riparian ecosystems and nature conservation demands recently gained in importance along waterways, alternatives for ripraps play an increasing role. Front-fixed banks are ripraps parallel to the shoreline and embedded in the waterway's channel with an unsecured bank of low steepness behind them. Thus, they are suitable to prevent banks from erosion. However, it is unclear how they can contribute to the ecological enhancement of riparian vegetation along waterways. Therefore, we compared riparian vegetation of ripraps and front-fixed banks with unsecured banks along the German rivers Main and Danube to assess the ecological efficiency of front-fixed banks. Disturbance by alternating water levels was the lowest at ripraps, whereas disturbance levels were higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks. We used an ordination and indicator species analysis to reveal differences in species composition. The results of the indicator species analysis were analyzed regarding species' biotope origin, light and moisture demand and life strategy. We analyzed species diversity and calculated functional diversity indices to display the prevalent ecosystem processes. Higher variation in species composition, common indicator species, a strong vertical layering of woody riparian vegetation and similar site conditions at front-fixed and unfortified banks revealed higher similarities in species composition between them than to other bank type combinations. Limnic species occurred with a higher frequency at unfortified and front-fixed banks, whereas terrestrial species were more frequent at ripraps. Light-tolerant species were more common at ripraps, whereas species' demand for moisture was higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks than at ripraps. Cr-strategists occurred more frequently with increasing disturbance level, whereas c-strategists were more common at ripraps. Ripraps had the highest species diversity levels whereas functional diversity tended to be higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks. This indicates a higher trait complementarity and thus a higher specialization towards alternating water levels, wherefore a higher degree of naturalness can be assumed in these habitats. Nature conservation efforts along German Federal Waterways should focus on the restoration of flooding dynamics, as species typical for riverine habitats are more common at front-fixed and unfortified banks than at ripraps. Since front-fixed banks bear traits suited for the reconnection of rivers and their floodplains and for bank protection, they are a suitable alternative to promote biodiversity along German Federal Waterways.

Spatio-temporal forest cover dynamics along road networks in the Central Himalaya	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Forest canopy density mapping; Forest fragmentation; Road infrastructure; Remote sensing; Change detection	MID ELEVATION ZONE; LAND-COVER; ALLOCATION DISAGREEMENT; DEFORESTATION; IMPACTS; AMAZON; FRAGMENTATION; ACCURACY; AVAILABILITY; GOVERNANCE	Global road network has expanded at an unprecedented rate in the last century, and is needed for economic and social growth. However, the road networks through forest landscapes open it up for further exploitation and act as permanent scars on these fragile ecosystems. This has driven greater interest in studying ecological impacts of the road networks on forest cover dynamics. Our study assessed changes in forest canopy density (FCD) using satellite-based indices, and forest fragmentation using Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) for 2000 and 2016 in the Central Himalaya. The analysis reports reduction in areas with high FCD from 85% of geographical area in 2000 to 76% in 2016. Specific to road sites, maximum change has taken place owing to expansion of national highway (NH) 72 from two-lane in 2000 to four-lane in 2016. MSPA results also support this argument as forest fragmentation has substantially increased along the road transects, especially NHs and metalled roads. The study asserts that metalled forest roads at lower elevations and closer to the forest periphery have greater detrimental effects on surrounding ecosystems than unmetalled forest roads. Reason being continuous disturbance due to heavy traffic load, ease of accessibility to forest and added anthropogenic disturbances near the periphery. As ecological impacts of road network have not been mainstreamed into research and policy making in Himalaya, the findings from this study shall improve knowledge on the current status and potential future pathways of sustainable infrastructure development in Himalaya in particular and mountains around the globe in general.

Response of seaward-migrating European eel (Anguilla anguilla) to an infrasound deterrent	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Behavioural guidance; Acoustic telemetry; Bypass; Fishway; Fish migration	SILVER EELS; DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION; FISH PASSAGE; MORTALITY; BEHAVIOR; PROTECTION; ESCAPEMENT; AVOIDANCE; HEARING	Behavioural guidance technologies that employ stimuli to attract or repel fish offer potential to enhance, or even replace, costly physical and mechanical screens traditionally used to protect fish at river infrastructure such as hydropower and water intakes. At these structures, eel can suffer high rates of damage and mortality if entrained in pumps or turbines, or impinged on screens intended to protect them. This study used acoustic telemetry to quantify the behavioural response of adult European eel (Anguilla anguilla) to infrasound (12 Hz) under field settings. Eel (n=50) were tracked after release immediately upstream of the forebay of a redundant hydropower facility. An infrasound deterrent located at the water intake either emitted continuously (ON) or was switched OFF. Treatment (ON/OFF) was alternated nightly over 10 consecutive nights with five eel released during a single trial conducted each night. Seventy eight percent of the 41 eel that moved downstream into the forebay passed the intake. Although the infrasound deterrent had no effect on passage rate, fine-scale differences in movement patterns were determined. When the infrasound was ON, eel trajectories were on average over twice as long with frequent erratic turns and milling behaviour (i.e. repeated lateral movements perpendicular to the principal flow direction), and they were less active within the intake channel close to the device. It is important to consider the influence of site characteristics, especially water velocities that dictate the potential for eel to respond to an acoustic field created. Infrasound deterrents that induce avoidance could be used to protect eel, either through enhancing the efficiency of physical screens or as part of multimodel behavioural guidance systems.

Substrates of terraces created when mining limestone quarries could be inhospitable to native plants. However, they can provide opportunities for establishing specific vegetation, such as dry calcareous grasslands. Applying suitable mining spoils could be a cost-effective way to provide growing substrate when restoring limestone terraces. We assessed the efficacy of using mining spoils, collected on-site, as a potential growing substrate (bedding material). We tested gravely limestone (product of on-site mining activities), limestone dust (by-product), and no addition (bare limestone bedrock) to determine which was best for favoring the growth of native, dry calcareous grassland species and discourage the growth of two non-native invasive species that commonly invade altered mining sites: Buddleja davidii Franch and Senecio inaequidens DC. In a field experiment (in two quarries), we studied short-term (2 y) growth response of native and invasive species after sowing three seed mixtures of native grassland species, varying in functional diversity (and one no-sowing control treatment), all treatments subjected to competitive pressure exerted by invasive species. Percent cover of native and invasive species, species abundance and reproductive characteristics of the invasive species were monitored during 2-y. Native grasslands coverage was low on all substrate types, demonstrating how slowly calcareous grasslands species establish in such harsh substrate conditions. However, type of substrate did show a significant relationship with plant abundance, with limestone dust being the most beneficial for native species establishment (coverage). Although limestone dust appeared to be the best option for restoring grassland species to limestone quarries (based on its low cost, wide availability, and potential to support native species), it was also likely to support the two invasive species. Functional diversity of the seed mixture had no consistent effect. Our study shows the importance of identifying the most appropriate substrate to both establish calcareous grasslands and resist invasive species. This approach provides insights into developing strategies to conserve biodiversity in industrial and agricultural landscapes with limestone quarries.

Yet, few studies have documented the long-term effects of rewetting on complete greenhouse gas (GHG) balances including emissions of CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Here, we report the complete annual GHG balance of an extensively managed riparian wetland, dominated by creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), 12 years after rewetting. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was measured by transparent closed chambers, and fluxes were partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) for modelling and extrapolation to annual emissions based on photosynthetically active radiation, ratio vegetation index and temperature. Fluxes of CH4 and N2O were monitored with opaque chambers. Groundwater table (GWT) was close to soil surface for most of the growing period, whereas the site was inundated during winter. Biomass was cut in late summer (8.5 Mg dry weight ha(-1)), but left on-site according to current management in the area. Annual ER (1360 g CO2-Cm-2) exceeded GPP (-1140 g CO2-Cm-2), and the ecosystem was a net source of CO2 with NEE of 220 g CO2-Cm-2 yr(-1). However, fluxes of CH4 (53 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)) dominated the annual GHG balance with 405 g CO2-C-eq m(-2) yr(-1) which contributed 60% to the total GHG balance. Fluxes of N2O were primarily found at times of changing GWT with annual emission of 0.7 g N2O m(-2) (50 g CO2-C-eq m(-2)) equal to 7% of the complete GHG balance. With proper management, rewetting and restoration of wetlands is expected to eventually resume the carbon sink function of natural wetlands, but this was not found in the present study as net fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 were positive. This was mainly attributed to on-site deposition of biomass which apparently stimulated both CO2 and CH4 emissions and partly reduced GPP by acting as a mulch layer. Future studies should focus on managements that increase CO2 uptake and biomass yield, and at the same time reduce CH4 emissions; such managements should avoid on-site deposition of aboveground biomass at rewetted sites.

It is currently difficult to quantify these responses and to assess the potential of artificial refuges accordingly. To address this problem, two experimental trials were conducted in an indoor flume. In the first, two hydropeaking events were tested in the presence of deflectors as flow refuges. In the second, the presence and absence of deflectors was tested for the same hydropeaking event. A multidisciplinary approach combined physiological and movement behaviour responses of Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei) with hydrodynamic models. These were used as a complementary tool to explain the fish responses. In the first experiment, no evident physiological adjustments occurred. However, individual refuge use and swimming activity were higher in the single-step event where velocities above 0.6 m.s(-1) were observed. In the second experiment, the levels of glucose were the highest in the repeated single-step event with deflectors, whereas in their absence no visible changes were observed. The sequence of discharges affected the frequency of individual sprints and group drifts, particularly evident with deflectors. Additionally, the deflector use increased in the first peak in opposition to the second. Overall, the fish responses were indicative that the low velocity areas (< 0.1 m.s(-1)) existing behind the deflectors were favourable under hydropeaking conditions. However, the flow complexity resulting from the presence of deflectors impaired their ability to successfully find them. The integrated approach used in this study provided novel insight considering the responses of cyprinids to hydropeaking in the presence and absence of deflectors as a mitigation measure. This study emphasized the importance of characterizing the hydrodynamic conditions due to hydropeaking, particularly after including the artificial refuges.

Evaluating response distances to develop buffer zones for staging terns	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						anti-predator behavior; buffer zones; Cape Cod; common tern; disturbance; flight initiation distance; roseate tern; staging	FLIGHT-INITIATION DISTANCE; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; BIRDS; SHOREBIRDS; MANAGEMENT; SURVIVAL; ISLAND; AREAS	Buffer zones, calculated by flight-initiation distance (FID), are often used to reduce anthropogenic disturbances to wildlife, but FID can vary significantly across life-history stages. We examined the behavioral effect of potential natural (gulls and shorebirds) and anthropogenic (pedestrians) disturbance sources to staging roseate (Sterna dougallii) and common tern (S. hirundo) flocks from July to September in 2014 and 2015 at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA. We estimated the proportion of the flock exhibiting different responses to potential disturbance sources as a function of distance, flock size, percent roseate terns, and local disturbance rates, using Bayesian zero-and-one inflated beta regression. The proportion of tern flocks responding to the presence of shorebirds by flying was low (0.01 +/- 0.001 [SE]) and did not vary by distance or other covariates, whereas the proportion flying in response to gulls increased as distance decreased, with smaller flocks, and with flocks with a larger proportion of roseate terns being more sensitive to gull presence. Prolonged flight response rapidly increased in probability from 0.0 to as much as 1.0 as distance from pedestrians to the flock decreased from 100 m and was much more likely with smaller flocks. Pedestrian activity levels also had an effect on flock responses; those engaged in active behaviors such as jogging were more likely to cause flushing than those engaged in passive behaviors. Terns seemed to view pedestrians as more of a threat than shorebirds and gulls, even though gulls are frequent kleptoparasites of terns. Pedestrians >120 m from a tern flock generally elicited the same probability of flight response as shorebirds and gulls. We recommend managers maintain anthropogenic disturbance levels at or below the intensity of those from natural sources at sites where recreation and wildlife values are both important. Because staging tern flocks may use a variety of areas within a site, we recommend instituting a 100-m buffer around areas potentially used by staging flocks at Cape Cod, where we studied every location roseate terns are known to use in large numbers. For other sites used by mixed-species tern flocks, we recommend the use of our field and analytical methods to develop appropriate buffer distances that will keep pedestrians far enough away to reduce the likelihood of flight and other non-locomotive anti-predator behaviors. These buffer zones will also benefit other species sensitive to human activity. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

Gobbling chronology of eastern wild turkeys in South Carolina	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						gobbling chronology; hunting; hunting regulations; Meleagris gallopavo; season timing; wild turkey	PREDATION RISK; COURTSHIP; BEHAVIOR; PARAMETERS; SURVIVAL; SONG	Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) use a polygynous-promiscuous mating system, wherein males compete for mating opportunities and communicate with females via courtship behaviors. One courtship behavior is vocalization (gobbling), which attracts females and signals dominance to other males. However, temporal variation in gobbling activity may be influenced by external stimuli, environmental variation, and hunter activity. Gobbling activity is a key determinant of hunter satisfaction, and gobbling chronology is often used by state agencies to inform regulatory processes. To identify factors influencing gobbling activity, we evaluated daily gobbling chronology on 3 sites in South Carolina, USA (Webb Wildlife Management Area [WMA] Complex, Savannah River Site, Crackerneck WMA) with different levels of hunter activity. We used autonomous recording units (ARUs; n = 45) across 8,280 days to collect 53,937 hours of ambient sound recordings and identified 68,426 gobbles. Gobbling activity varied daily and site interacting with minutes since sunrise best predicted daily gobbling activity. We noted distinct differences in predicted numbers of gobbles between hunted sites and an unhunted site, suggesting that hunting may be an important determinant of gobbling activity. Across our study sites, we observed that >= 72% of gobbling activity occurred between 30 minutes before and 60 minutes after sunrise. We found no clear evidence of well-defined unimodal or bimodal peaks in daily or weekly gobbling activity. Across sites, <44% of gobbling activity occurred during legal hunting seasons in South Carolina, with between 30% and 48% of gobbling activity occurring after legal hunting seasons. Because hunter satisfaction is primarily influenced by gobbling activity, wildlife managers in South Carolina may consider adjusting dates of turkey hunting seasons to correspond hunting with periods when most gobbling occurs.

Habitat selection and population trends of the Torngat Mountains caribou herd	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						conservation; habitat selection; harvest; population dynamics; Rangifer tarandus; space use	RANGIFER-TARANDUS-CARIBOU; WOODLAND CARIBOU; NORTHERN LABRADOR; FEMALE CARIBOU; DYNAMICS; SURVIVAL; DENSITY; GROWTH; CONSERVATION; RECRUITMENT	Understanding why species at risk select certain habitat and what components of their life history influence changes in numbers can help mitigate population declines. The Torngat Mountains caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in northern Quebec-Labrador, Canada, is declining, and few studies have examined the potential causes of this decline. We fitted 9 Argos and 26 global positioning system (GPS)-collars on 35 adult caribou (25 female, 10 male) between 2011 and 2016 to assess seasonal habitat selection at 2 spatial scales, current and future population trends, and interactions with the neighboring Riviere-George migratory caribou herd. The caribou of the Torngat Mountains herd selected areas with abundant food resources in winter and where prevalence of insects was lower in summer. They did not avoid areas where predation risk was high during calving. Spatial overlap with the Riviere-George herd range decreased from 1990 to 2015 and was correlated with the size of the Riviere-George population, which declined drastically during this period. The decline of the Torngat Mountains population was principally attributed to the low survival of adult females (0.72 annual survival rate) owing to subsistence harvest (9/24) and predation (7/24). Demographic models revealed that the growth rate of the population (lambda) could vary from 0.83 (current) to 0.94 following a decrease in harvest pressure. Using demographic scenarios, we showed that the Torngat Mountains herd could continue to decrease if no management actions were taken to increase adult female survival. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

Effects of scale and land cover on loggerhead shrike occupancy	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						detection probability; fragmentation; grassland birds; land cover; Lanius ludovicianus; loggerhead shrike; occupancy	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; CHIHUAHUAN DESERT; GRASSLAND BIRDS; UNITED-STATES; HABITAT USE; ABUNDANCE; AVAILABILITY; SELECTION; MODELS	The loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) is a species of concern throughout its range because of severe population declines over the past 7 decades. Grassland habitat loss and fragmentation is widely viewed as contributing to the decline. Habitat associations have primarily been studied up to the territory scale, with few studies assessing shrike habitat selection at landscape scales. We conducted roadside passive-active point counts for loggerhead shrikes in the coastal plain of South Carolina to evaluate detection probability and how land use and habitat fragmentation at multiple spatial scales influenced the occupancy of loggerhead shrikes. Detection probability increased with fair weather to 63% with clear skies, with temperature to 83% at 28 degrees C, and with declining noise to 63% at no noise. High probability of detection at mean covariate conditions (P = 0.49 +/- 0.08 [SE]) indicated support for the application of passive point counts in future loggerhead shrike monitoring. Occupancy was best predicted by percentage of pasture within 1 km, where predicted occupancy increased from 2 +/- 0.02% when there was 0% pasture in a 1-km radius, to 98 +/- 0.03% occupancy when there was 43% pasture in a 1-km radius, though our model-averaged occupancy estimate was low (psi = 0.17 +/- 0.05). Extrapolation of our averaged model suggested that only 8% of the South Carolina coastal plain was occupied by loggerhead shrikes in the 2016 and 2017 breeding seasons. Our results highlight the importance of habitat beyond breeding territories and highlight the need for the establishment of higher concentrations of pasture and grassland at a 1-km scale to increase the proportion of area in South Carolina occupied by shrikes.

However, this growth has raised concerns because of the negative effects this activity may have on the behavior and survival of focal species. Hence, detecting the effects of this activity requires sensitive analytical methods allowing the implementation of regulations to protect cetacean welfare. We compared the performance of different hypothesis tests from classical and Bayesian approaches to detect whale-watching effects on humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) behavior. From a cliff located 31 m above sea level in northern Peru, we measured breathing frequency, surface time, long dive duration, directness index (i.e., path linearity), and swimming speed of humpback whales before, during, and after encounters with whale-watching boats. During 167 hours of observation, we tracked 180 humpback whale groups; 43% of groups had calves and 57% did not. Inference by null-hypothesis testing indicated significant changes only in directness index after boat encounters in groups with a calf. Other methods of inference detected moderate behavior responses as increments in the number of adult breaths, swimming speed, and dive intervals for adults and calves. Whale-watching regulations must be implemented in Peru to regulate number of boats, distance to whales, approximate speed, and time observing humpback whales. Whale-watching of humpback whales with calves should be avoided. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

This study reveals that seasons produce a drastic difference in the cadmium concentration (Cd) in marine mussels in bay, channel, and fjord ecosystems in this area. As the global mussel industry continues its rapid expansion, a complete understanding of cadmium pathways is critical in order to minimize the cadmium content in harvests. In this study, biweekly sampling was conducted in Chiloe (Southern Chile), during five consecutive seasons from June 2014 to November 2015. Cadmium in the soft tissues (ST) and in the content of the digestive gland (CDG) of Mytilus chilensis were investigated, in addition to resuspensions and seston to determine the effect of the seasons on metal bioassimilation capacity. In spring, the (Cd) between CDG and ST varied by approximately 2mg Cd kg(-1) dry mass (DM). In summer and autumn, the (Cd) in CDG increased from 3 to 6mg Cd kg(-1) while the (Cd) in ST decreased from 2.5 to 1.5mg Cd kg(-1) DM. The three ecosystems showed the same cadmium bioconcentration trends in all seasons, revealing coherent global trends. These findings should caution the industry and coastal populations about the seasonal variability and intensity of cadmium metal transfer to biofilters, especially because of the adverse effects of cadmium consumption on human health. Additionally, this study found that mussels in natural beds concentrate more Cd (>1mg Cd kg(-1) DM) than in industrial facilities. Multiregression analysis showed and explained the cadmium in CDG for three ecosystems: channel (R-2 0.9537), bay (R-2 0.5962), and fjord (R-2 0.4009). The independent variable nocturnal seston was able to explain the increase in cadmium.

The Mediterranean Basin is thus particularly suited to study the role of climate versus human-mediated changes on the evolutionary history of species. The Algerian mouse (Mus spretus Lataste) is an endemic species from this basin, with its distribution restricted to North Africa (from Libya to Morocco), Iberian Peninsula and South of France. A rich paleontological record of M. spretus exists in North Africa, suggesting hypotheses concerning colonization pathways, and the demographic and morphologic history of this species. Here we combined genetic (3 mitochondrial DNA loci and 18 microsatellites) and climatic niche modeling data to infer the evolutionary history of the Algerian mouse. We collected 646 new individuals in 51 localities. Our results are consistent with an anthropogenic translocation of the Algerian mouse from North Africa to the Iberian Peninsula via Neolithic navigators, probably from the Tingitane Peninsula. Once arrived in Spain, suitable climatic conditions would then have favored the dispersion of the Algerian mice to France. The morphological differentiation observed between Spanish, French and North African populations could be explained by a founder effect and possibly local adaptation. This article helps to better understand the role of climate versus human-mediated changes on the evolutionary history of mammal species in the Mediterranean Basin.

However, they are threatened worldwide by human-driven environmental change. Understanding the seagrasses' potential for adaptation is critical to assess not only their ability to persist under future global change scenarios, but also to assess the persistence of the associated communities. Here we screened a wild population of Posidonia oceanica, an endemic long-lived seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea, for genes that may be target of environmental selection, using an outlier and a genome-wide transcriptome analysis. We identified loci where polymorphism or differential expression was associated with either a latitudinal or a bathymetric gradient, as well as with both gradients in an effort to identify loci associated with temperature and light. We found the candidate genes underlying growth and immunity to be divergent between populations adapted to different latitudes and/or depths, providing evidence for local adaptation. Furthermore, we found evidence of reduced gene flow among populations including adjacent populations. Reduced gene flow, combined with low sexual recombination, small effective population size, and long generation time of P. oceanica raises concerns for the long-term persistence of this species, especially in the face of rapid environmental change driven by human activities.

In this study, Arabidopsis seeds or 14-day-old vegetative plants were exposed to 0.5 mu g/I of chemical standards of 26 VOCs previously identified from the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma. Seven compounds (1-decene, 2-heptylfuran, 2-methyl-l-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1- butanol, 2-heptanone, and 1-octen-3-ol) were further tested at the physiological concentration (10 ng/l) and 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-decene, and 2-heptylfuran induced significant increases in fresh weight and total chlorophyll content. Plants exposed to 1-decene had the greatest increase in plant fresh shoot weight (38.9%) and chlorophyll content (67.8%). An RNA sequencing analysis was performed on plants treated with vapors of 1-decene. The expression of 123 genes was differentially affected, encompassing genes involved in cell wall modification, auxin induction, stress, and defense responses, with several major classes of stress-related genes showing down-regulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effect of a plant growth promoting VOC on gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. As the role of fungal VOCs in biocontrol moves from correlative studies to more hypothesis driven approaches, our findings can guide both basic and applied studies in agricultural research.

However, the importance of non-dominant trees in shaping lichen communities has been poorly studied owing to the relative rarity of individuals. The importance of dominant and non-dominant trees for distribution of epiphytic lichens was determined in eight subtropical forests in southwestern China. Dominant trees supported more abundant total and exclusive lichen species only in secondary forests. The occurrence of non-dominant trees promoted lichen diversity within forest types and influenced lichen communities on both tree groups. The effects of total tree species on lichen distribution largely resulted from the presence of non-dominant trees. Dominant and non-dominant trees supported distinct lichen assemblages within forest types, and ordination analyses showed a clear separation. Our study, therefore, reinforces the importance of non-dominant trees for conserving epiphytic lichens, and highlights that lichen assemblages are shaped by both dominant and non-dominant trees.

Effects of howler monkey reintroduction on ecological interactions and processes	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alouatta; dung beetles; plant-animal interactions; rewilding; rewiring; secondary seed dispersal	DUNG BEETLE COMMUNITIES; TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; SEED DISPERSAL; ALOUATTA-SENICULUS; REVERSING DEFAUNATION; LOS-TUXTLAS; CONSERVATION; FATE; PRIMATE; FRAGMENTATION	Rewilding has been an increasingly popular tool to restore plant-animal interactions and ecological processes impaired by defaunation. However, the reestablishment of such processes has seldom been assessed. We investigated the restoration of ecological interactions following the reintroduction of the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) to a defaunated Atlantic forest site. We expected the reintroduction to restore plant-animal interactions and interactions between howlers and dung beetles, which promote secondary seed dispersal. We estimated the number of interactions expected to be restored by the reintroduction to provide the baseline interaction richness that could be restored. We followed the reintroduced howler monkeys twice a week for 24 months (337 hours total) to assess their diet. We used howler monkey dung in secondary seed dispersal experiments with 2484 seed mimics to estimate the removal rates by dung beetles and collected the beetles to assess community attributes. We compared the potential future contribution of howler monkeys and other frugivores to seed dispersal based on the seed sizes they disperse in other areas where they occur. In 2 years, howler monkeys consumed 60 animal-dispersed plant species out of the 330 estimated. Twenty-one dung beetle species were attracted to experimentally provided dung; most of them were tunnelers, nocturnal, and large-sized (>10 mm). On average 30% (range 0-100%) of the large seed mimics (14 mm) were moved by dung beetles. About 91% of the species consumed by howlers (size range 0.3-34.3 mm) overlapped in seed size with those removed by dung beetles. In our study area, howler monkeys may consume more large-seeded fruit species than most other frugivores, highlighting their potential to affect forest regeneration. Our results show reintroductions may effectively restore ecological links and enhance ecological processes.	[Genes, Luisa; Fernandez, Fernando A.

Targeted gene flow and rapid adaptation in an endangered marsupial	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						animal behavior; cane toad; evolutionary rescue; northern quoll; population management; rapid evolution	CONDITIONED TASTE-AVERSION; CANE TOADS; OUTBREEDING DEPRESSION; CONTEMPORARY EVOLUTION; NATURAL-POPULATIONS; NORTHERN QUOLL; TOXIC PREY; PREDATOR; SELECTION; BENEFITS	Targeted gene flow is an emerging conservation strategy. It involves translocating individuals with favorable genes to areas where they will have a conservation benefit. The applications for targeted gene flow are wide-ranging but include preadapting native species to the arrival of invasive species. The endangered carnivorous marsupial, the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), has declined rapidly since the introduction of the cane toad (Rhinella marina), which fatally poisons quolls that attack them. There are, however, a few remaining toad-invaded quoll populations in which the quolls survive because they know not to eat cane toads. It is this toad-smart behavior we hope to promote through targeted gene flow. For targeted gene flow to be feasible, however, toad-smart behavior must have a genetic basis. To assess this, we used a common garden experiment, comparing offspring from toad-exposed and toad-naive parents raised in identical environments, to determine whether toad-smart behavior is heritable. Offspring from toad-exposed populations were substantially less likely to eat toads than those with toad-naive parents. Hybrid offspring showed similar responses to quolls with 2 toad-exposed parents, indicating the trait may be dominant. Together, these results suggest a heritable trait and rapid adaptive response in a small number of toad-exposed populations. Although questions remain about outbreeding depression, our results are encouraging for targeted gene flow. It should be possible to introduce toad-smart behavior into soon to be affected quoll populations.

Assessing effects of non-native crayfish on mosquito survival	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						crayfish; invasive species; odonates; Procambarus; Santa Monica Mountains; vector-borne diseases	PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII; INVASIVE CRAYFISH; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; INTRODUCED CRAYFISH; BIODIVERSITY; PREDATOR; IMPACT; POPULATION; AMPHIBIANS; ABUNDANCE	Introductions of non-native predators often reduce biodiversity and affect natural predator-prey relationships and may increase the abundance of potential disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) indirectly through competition or predation cascades. The Santa Monica Mountains (California, U.S.A.), situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, is an area of conservation concern due to climate change, urbanization, and the introduction of non-native species. We examined the effect of non-native crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) on an existing native predator, dragonfly nymphs (Aeshna sp.), and their mosquito larvae (Anopheles sp.) prey. We used laboratory experiments to compare the predation efficiency of both predators, separately and together, and field data on counts of dragonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae sampled from 13 local streams. We predicted a lower predation efficiency of crayfish compared with native dragonfly nymphs and a reduced predation efficiency of dragonfly nymphs in the presence of crayfish. Dragonfly nymphs were an order of magnitude more efficient predators than crayfish, and dragonfly nymph predation efficiency was reduced in the presence of crayfish. Field count data showed that populations of dragonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae were strongly correlated with crayfish presence in streams, such that sites with crayfish tended to have fewer dragonfly nymphs and more mosquito larvae. Under natural conditions, it is likely that crayfish reduce the abundance of dragonfly nymphs and their predation efficiency and thereby, directly and indirectly, lead to higher mosquito populations and a loss of ecosystem services related to disease vector control.

Combined use of eDNA metabarcoding and video surveillance for the assessment of fish biodiversity	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						baited remote underwater video systems; elasmobranchs; environmental DNA; environmental genomics; marine management	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; STEREO-VIDEO; ASSEMBLAGES; PROTECTION	Monitoring communities of fish is important for the management and sustainability of fisheries and marine ecosystems. Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) are among the most effective nondestructive techniques for sampling bony fishes and elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and skates). However, BRUVs sample visually conspicuous biota; hence, some taxa are undersampled or not recorded at all. We compared the diversity of fishes characterized using BRUVs with diversity detected via environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We sampled seawater and captured BRUVs imagery at 48 locales that included reef and seagrass beds inside and outside a marine reserve (Jurien Bay in Western Australia). Eighty-two fish genera from 13 orders were detected, and the community of fishes described using eDNA and BRUVs combined yielded >30% more generic richness than when either method was used alone. Rather than detecting a homogenous genetic signature, the eDNA assemblages mirrored the BRUVs' spatial explicitness; differentiation of taxa between seagrass and reef was clear despite the relatively small geographical scale of the study site (similar to 35 km(2)). Taxa that were not sampled by one approach, due to limitations and biases intrinsic to the method, were often detected with the other. Therefore, using BRUVs and eDNA in concert provides a more holistic view of vertebrate marine communities across habitats. Both methods are noninvasive, which enhances their potential for widespread implementation in the surveillance of marine ecosystems.

They often exist in pastures that have very different environmental characteristics than forests. In our study, we surveyed the ant fauna of Brazil nut trees in forest and pasture habitats in the Southwestern Brazilian Amazon. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (i) How do arboreal ant assemblages of Brazil nut tree crowns change based on habitat type? (ii) What is the contribution of forest ant species from Brazil nut tree crowns to ant assemblages in pasture Brazil nut tree crowns? (iii) What features of pasture Brazil nut trees lead to a greater number of arboreal ant species? We selected 20 trees in each habitat type (forest and pasture) and collected ant samples both at the soil surface and at tree crowns, sampling a total of 184 ant species. Species composition was primarily determined by sampling layer. We found that the number of ant species was 63% lower in pasture than in forest tree crowns. The dissimilarity between the ant assemblages of tree crown and soil surface remained almost the same in both habitats. There was relatively little overlap in species composition in the forest tree crowns versus the pasture tree crowns, with species replacement component highly contributing to the differences. We conclude that scattered Brazil nut trees plays limited role on the conservation of its associated biodiversity in human-modified landscapes such as pastures.

The purpose of rarefaction was to standardise the uneven number of samples, while extrapolation enabled prediction of the real diversity considering the expected number of species undetected by the sampling effort. Both methods were based on three Hill's numbers: q=0 (species richness), q=1 (Shannon index) and q=2 (inverse Simpson index). The macrophyte survey was carried out at 96 river sites of a uniform abiotic type (medium lowland rivers with sandy substrate). Macrophyte diversity was evaluated based on survey data (the reference sample) as well as using a dataset standardised by rarefaction and extrapolation. Trends in species richness along the trophic gradient were depicted differently by analysis based on the reference sample and on the extrapolated dataset. Based on the reference sample, the increases of river trophy led to diminishing macrophyte richness, whereas use of the extrapolated dataset revealed that the highest plant diversity can be found in mesotrophic rivers. The extrapolated dataset showed that most oligotrophic pristine rivers were poorer in species than mesotrophic watercourses, and the most limited pool of macrophytes was found in highly eutrophic watercourses. Rarefaction/extrapolation methods enable the precise comparison of plant diversity across sites, by predicting the occurrence of rare species. Moreover, the extrapolation method allows assesses of the total biodiversity basing on a smaller number of trials (survey samples).

The effects of such drivers over the temporal trend in species richness and composition, particularly on invertebrate diversity in megadiverse countries, is controversial. One key animal group to clarify this controversy is that of odonate insects (dragonflies and damselflies), given their combined close water-land requirements. We have investigated whether changes in land use impact species richness and composition of odonates from 1980 to 1993 (period I) to 1994-2010 (period II) in Mexico. The effect of land use changes and land cover changes on species richness was analyzed using multiple diversity measures and at different spatial scales. In period II, an area reduction in original vegetation and increase in land use occurred. Responses to land use varied among spatial scales and measures of diversity but, overall, species richness in the transformed area was higher than in the original vegetation. However, species composition indicated a high species turnover inside hydrologic regions (watersheds) and across land uses classes, particularly between original and secondary vegetation. Our interpretation is that despite high land use conversion in Mexico, adult odonates seem resilient to land use change in terms of species richness, but not in species composition, which is in partial agreement with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Finally, we suggest that hydrologic region scale and use of entropy maximization (HCDT entropy), could provide a reliable biodiversity estimation of species loss associated with land use change.

In the Atlantic and Indian oceans, purse-seine nets are sometimes set around tuna schools associated with whale sharks and baleen whales, although less frequently than around free-swimming tuna schools or those associated with fish aggregating devices (FAD). However, knowledge on the targeted catch and bycatch in these megafauna associated fishing sets is still relatively limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess species and size composition of the target tuna species, as well as the diversity of bycatch species in whale and whale shark associated sets. Whale associated sets were found to be very similar to free school sets in terms of tuna catch (large yellowfin tuna), bycatch occurrence (presence in half the sets) and species assemblage (alpha and beta diversity). Whale shark associated sets were intermediate between FAD and free school sets, with tuna catch (skipjack and juvenile yellowfin) closer to FAD than to free school sets. However, the presence of large yellowfin, the bycatch composition (with almost no finfish, abundantly captured in FAD sets) and the species assemblage showed similarity with free school sets. This study highlights the need for an EAFM in the tuna purse-seine fishery by providing knowledge on pelagic multi-specific catches and bycatches.

If not adequately considered, this bias may lead to incorrect management actions. We designed an experiment aimed to provide an accurate assessment of carcass persistence time according to road type and position on the road along 114km of roads (24 in dirt roads, 74 two-lane roads, and 16 in four-lane roads). We used two types of rodent of different body size to perform the experiment: mice (30 +/- 8g) were placed on the road shoulders and road lanes every 1000m, and rats (400 +/- 55g) were placed only on road shoulders every 2000m. Carcasses were monitored for up to five consecutive days. The persistence times of mice and rats were in general similar, with an estimated median time of 1day. However, we found considerable differences according to road type and position on the road: the estimated median persistence time was substantially longer for carcasses on the four-lane roads, and longer on the road shoulders compared to the traffic lanes. Overall, we estimated an annual mortality of small animals to be higher than 100.000 individuals in Federal District, of which ca. 10% in dirt roads. Our results confirm that a great proportion of carcasses are likely to be undetected in roadkill surveys, particularly small body sized animals, and that such errors are also related to the type of road and the position of carcasses on the road. We highlight that the impact of dirt and two-lane roads on wildlife may be greatly underestimated.

Lawn mowing frequency and its effects on biogenic and anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article							SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; ORGANIC-CARBON; TURFGRASS SYSTEMS; RESIDENTIAL LAWNS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBAN; MANAGEMENT; SEQUESTRATION; RESPIRATION; FLUXES	Decision makers in urban areas actively pursue strategies to decrease carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other greenhouse gases. Lawns dominate urban lands in the U.S. and require intensive management, including frequent mowing, which may influence CO2 emissions from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. We tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (every one, two or three weeks) affected soil respiration (i.e., biogenic CO2 emissions), by changing soil moisture and temperature, and the gasoline emissions associated with lawn maintenance via lawn mowing (i.e., anthropogenic CO2 emissions). Sixteen yards in Springfield, Massachusetts USA were assigned a mowing frequency for two seasons (2013-2014). We measured grass height, air and soil temperature, soil moisture, soil CO2 flux, lawn mower emissions, tree canopy coverage and precipitation. We used a mixed effects modeling approach to test how these variables interacted with each other and responded to mowing frequency. Lawn-mowing frequency did not influence soil temperature, moisture, or biogenic soil CO2 fluxes. Soil microclimate and soil respiration varied more with ambient climatic fluctuations and tree canopy cover. By contrast, anthropogenic emissions increased with more frequent mowing due to emissions associated with the mower. When scaled to the entire mowing season, biogenic CO2 fluxes far exceeded the anthropogenic fluxes, thus requiring consideration for accurate accounting of urban greenhouse gas emissions. The interplay between biogenic (e.g., increasing tree canopy in lawn-dominated yards) and anthropogenic (i.e., mowing less frequently) methods of reducing CO2 emissions in cities highlights the need for more rigorous accounting processes for cities to meet climate action goals.

In this study, we quantified both the runoff retention performance of infiltration trenches retrofitted alongside established street trees and tree drought stress and growth. We compared retention for different soil types, tree phenological types and inlet designs over a period of 18 months. Retention was low on average (18.3%) but was highly variable among infiltration trenches (5.2-43.7%), driven by variation in inlet capacity due to blockages, as well as the flow velocity of runoff leading to the inlet. With appropriately designed inlets, street tree stormwater control measures have significant potential to retain runoff. We observed no clear reduction in tree drought stress or increase in tree growth. This suggests that the established trees in our study already had access to adequate soil water within their rooting volumes, supplemented by nearby irrigated private gardens, or leaky water infrastructure. We suggest that i) mature trees surrounded by greater impervious surface area, ii) newly planted trees, or iii) trees growing in hotter, drier climates, may respond more positively to similar passive irrigation systems. The evolving practice of passive irrigation of street trees with stormwater requires innovative design to maximise runoff capture efficiency under typical sediment and debris loads.

At its centre is the question whether a common resource will collapse under over-exploitation. The isolated analysis of one resource has many conceptual benefits, yet in reality resources and welfare are intertwined. In this paper, we investigate a situation where a resource which is exploited for profit has the additional feature of protecting against risk. Our main question is whether participants in an experimental game will prioritize such additional feature over maximizing profit and, if so, to what extent. Therefore, we designed a forest-harvesting game: Participants can harvest trees to generate income, and at the same time the forest serves as a protection against floods. Communication has been shown to play a vital role in managing commons. Our second aim is to test the importance of communication when the resource functions as a device of protecting against external risk. Lastly, we introduce a new perspective to the tragedy of the commons literature. Specifically, we investigate how the anthropologically motivated theory of risk perception (often called Cultural Theory) correlates with behaviour in our economic game. We believe that there is much potential in combining insights from these separate disciplines.

A novel algorithm for calculating transition potential in cellular automata models of land-use/cover change	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Entropy; Land-use/cover change; Uncertainty; Urban planning; Modelling; Simulation	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CROSS-BORDER REGION; URBAN-GROWTH; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORK; ACCURACY; UNCERTAINTY; SIMULATION; INFORMATION	Despite recent advances in quantifying land-use/cover change (LUCC) transition potential, transition rules are often not transparent and uncertainty is rarely made explicit. Here, we introduce DoTRules-a dictionary of trusted rules-as a transparent alternative to calculate transition potential in cellular automata models. Rules relate LUCC variables to the observed historical changes. Shannon entropy is calculated to assess the uncertainty of each rule, and the most trusted rules are used to project future LUCC. DoTRules produces rule-level uncertainty estimates, which can be mapped. In a case study of the Ahvaz region of Iran, the overall accuracy of LUCC simulation calibrated using DoTRules was very similar to simulations calibrated with the state-of-the-art random forest, but DoTRules provides a more transparent approach where transition rule information and uncertainty can be readily accessed and interpreted. The results demonstrate that DoTRules has potential to derive new insights into LUCC processes.

Both are susceptible to wind-induced errors. Shielding has been used to reduce these effects. The newly installed tipping-bucket rain gauges are not currently shielded in Cathedral Peak. The aim of this study was to improve understanding of the influence of shield and gauge design on rainfall measurement accuracy. The study was conducted at the Cathedral Peak Meteorological Station in the Drakensberg mountains, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Three rain gauges, a historical shielded Snowdon, shielded, and ground-level tipping-bucket rain gauges, were installed alongside an unshielded tipping-bucket rain gauge. At the monthly scale, the Snowdon and unshielded rain gauges recorded 7%-8% and the shielded rain gauge 12% less than the ground-level rain gauge. At the event scale, the unshielded rain gauge recorded more rainfall for 58.47% of events than the shielded. Peak rainfall intensity was identified as the significant predictor variable affecting rainfall volume recorded by the rain gauges. From this study it was concluded that the use of a Nipher shielded rain gauge in the Cathedral Peak research catchments is ineffective.

But the temporal variability of aquatic community response to continuous flow-sediment alterations is less well-known. This paper explored aquatic biota response to the flow-sediment regime in a broader temporal context using long-term paired hydrological database and monitoring data of benthic invertebrates in Dongting Lake. The inter-annual variations of benthic invertebrates and certain flow and sediment variables were synchronous. Community diversity parameters showed different response to different hydrological events and particularly revealed a short-term peak in the first two years after the operation of the Three Gorges Dam. This finding affirmed the importance of the time series study. The overall flow-sediment regime, calculated from 15 flow and sediment characteristics, affected community structures and could also affect benthic invertebrates by affecting the water quality. The combination of variables, including sediment inputs load, sediment exports/inputs ratio and the duration of low water level, could best explain the variation of benthic invertebrate assemblages and should be given the greatest management concern. When individual components of the flow-sediment regime were analysed, the response patterns of community parameters to different environmental variables or to different gradients of the same variables were complex. Our results suggest that the sediment seemed to be a more influential stressor than flow, especially erosion, which could significantly reduce total abundance and species richness. The effect of the flow regime was reflected by the duration of the low water level. Stressor gradients and the response patterns of different taxa to different stressors should be considered by river and lake managers. The results would provide valuable information for the design of lake management strategies and upstream reservoir regulation rules. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Irrigation management for arsenic mitigation in rice grain: Timing and severity of a single soil drying	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Alternate wetting and drying; Arsenic speciation; Soil moisture; Crop stage; Oryza sativa	WATER MANAGEMENT; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; PADDY SOIL; ACCUMULATION; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS; PRODUCTIVITY; METHYLATION; SPECIATION	The accumulation of arsenic (As) in rice grain is a public health concern since As is toxic to humans; in particular. inorganic As can cause many chronic diseases including cancer. Rice crops are prone to accumulating As, in part, due to the anaerobic soil conditions triggered by the traditional continuously flooded irrigation practice. The objective of this study was to determine how the severity and the timing (i.e. crop stage) of a single soil drying period impact total As concentration and As speciation within the rice (both white and brown) grain, compared to a continuously flooded (CF) control. Drying the soil until the perched water table reached 15 cm below the soil surface (same severity as in the "Safe Alternate Wetting and Drying"), which in this study corresponded to a soil (0-15 cm) water potential of -0, did not decrease grain As concentrations, regardless of timing. Drying the soil to Medium Severity [MS: soil (0-15 cm) water potential of -71 kPa] or High Severity [HS: soil (0-15 cm) water potential of -154 kPa] decreased total As by 41-61%. However, inorganic As did not always decrease because the severity and the timing of soil drying affected As speciation within the grain. Overall, the soil had to be dried to HS and/or late in the growing season (i.e., at booting or heading instead of at panicle initiation) to decrease inorganic As concentration in the rice grain. This study indicates that the imposition of a single soil drying period within the growing season can mitigate As accumulation in rice grain, but it depends on the severity and timing of the drying period. Further, irrigation management affects As speciation within the rice grain and this must be considered if regulations on inorganic As are based on a percentage of total As measured.

Uncultivated buffer zones or reforestation of riparian zones are advocated as a key management option that could compensate the harmful land use impacts. The effectiveness of riparian forests to protect ecological conditions of agricultural streams is yet inconclusive, particularly regarding the benefit of riparian buffers in streams suffering from uninterrupted agricultural diffuse pollution. We studied the effects of riparian land use on periphyton production and diatom, macrophyte and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in medium-sized agricultural streams by a) comparing 18 open field and forested agricultural stream reach pairs that only differed by the extent of riparian forest cover, and b) comparing the agricultural reaches to 15 near-natural streams. We found that periphyton abundance was higher in open reaches than in the forested reaches, but diatom community structure did not respond to the riparian forest cover. Macrophyte and macroinvertebrate communities were clearly affected by the riparian forest cover. Graminoids dominated in open reaches, whereas bryophytes were more abundant in forested reaches. Shredding invertebrates were more abundant in forested reaches compared to open reaches, but grazers did not differ between the reach types. Macrophyte trait composition and macroinvertebrate community difference between the reaches were positively related to the difference in riparian forest cover. The community structure of all three groups in the agricultural streams differed distinctly from the near-natural streams. However, only macrophyte communities in forested agricultural reaches showed resemblance to near-natural composition. Our results suggest that riparian forests provide ecological benefits that can partly compensate the impacts of agricultural diffuse pollution. However, community structure of forested agricultural reaches did not match the near-natural composition in any organism group indicating that catchment-scale management and mitigation of diffuse pollution need to be still advocated to achieve ecological goals in stream management and restoration.

The Penobscot is a system contaminated with Hg by a chlor-alkali plant that operated from 1967 to 2000, discharging 6-12 tons of mercury into the river. Mercury levels in aquatic biota were highest at sites downstream of the chlor-alkali plant and spatial trends were similar to those of sediments. Mean total Hg concentrations in fish muscle (adjusted for size or age) in the most affected areas were 521 (480, 566; 95% CI) ng/g ww in American eels, 321 (261,395) in mummichog, 121 (104, 140) in rainbow smelt, 155 (142,169) in tomcod, 55.2 (42.7,71.4) in winter flounder, and 328 (259,413) in American lobster tail and 522 (488,557) ng/g dw in blue mussel. Levels exceeded the 50 ng/g ww considered protective for piscivorous predators and were of concern for human health, with American eels and American lobster exceeding Maine's mercury action level of 200 ng/g ww. Calculations of trophic position (using nitrogen isotopes) suggested that the spatial patterns observed in total Hg concentrations were not due to changes in feeding habits of the species. Fish feeding in benthic food webs, as defined by stomach content and stable carbon isotope analyses, showed no change in Hg concentrations over time. In contrast, declining trends in Hg were found in two species dependent on pelagic food webs. The absence of declines in Hg concentrations in the benthically-based food webs, despite the fact that most Hg was discharged into the system >40 years ago, is consistent with the long recovery predicted from dated sediment cores and from similar studies elsewhere.

The results reveal that pollen emissions in the last 25 years have shown a slight downward trend, with large interannual fluctuations, which are a consequence of diverse environmental factors, both general and specific to the area. One of the most influential parameters on pollen concentrations is snow cover, which reinforces the importance of the presence of snow-packs as water resource outside the winter season in the High Mediterranean Mountain environments. The changes in land use experienced in the area are a driver of change, especially due to the losses experienced in the last decades in the preferred habitats for many species of grasses. It can be concluded that the vulnerability of these ecosystems will be affected by an increase in winter temperatures and/or a decrease in rainfall (climate change) and an increase in the intensity of anthropogenic activities on land use. In this context, the PI is shown as a useful indicator of global change given its sensitivity to both anthropic and hydro-meteorological changes. In addition, it has a wide range of spatial detection and discrimination capacity by altitudinal dimensions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study assessed the predator-prey relationship between two non-native crayfish species (Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus leniusculus) and three native (Anodonta anatina, Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus) and one non-native (Corbicula fluminea) freshwater bivalve species through experiments in laboratory and validation under natural conditions (Sabor River basin, Portugal). All native bivalve species were preyed both in laboratory and in the field: however, both crayfish species were unable to prey C. fluminea. Predation was dependent on crayfish and bivalve species but was not affected neither by crayfish nor bivalve sizes. In the laboratory, the most preyed species by both crayfishes was A. anatina. On average, this species was preyed at least 12% more than other species, when crayfishes had a choice. Similar results were found in the field. We also found signs of competition between both crayfishes, being P. clarkii more dominant and aggressive as this species, on average, manipulated the bivalves 63.6% more times and 24:33 min longer than P. leniusculus, and initiated 55.8% more agnostic bouts. Our results support the idea that P. clarkii and P. leniusculus can affect native freshwater bivalves, but clear interspecific differences were detected. Both crayfishes may have direct and indirect impacts on bivalve populations by increasing mortality or by reducing their fitness. In addition, since both crayfishes do not prey C. fluminea, they offer this IAS another advantage over native bivalves. Given the widespread distribution of both P. clarkii and P. leniusculus and the threatened status of many freshwater bivalves, the dynamics and impacts of this relationship should be taken in account in the implementation of management measures devoted to the conservation of native freshwater bivalves.

A global meta-analysis of the economic values of provisioning and cultural ecosystem services	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Natural capital; Mapping; Sustainability	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; TROPICAL FORESTS; TRADE-OFFS; ECOLOGY; UNITS	Despite a growing demand to integrate ecosystem services into sustainability decision-making, our understanding of the global distribution of the economic value of ES is scarce. We extracted information from provisioning and cultural ecosystem services (PCES) from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) database using a meta-analytical approach. We then employed geostatistical methods to analyze the relationship between economic values and environmental and socio-economic predictors. Here we show that anthropogenic related factors such as accessibility, spatially explicit gross domestic product and ecosystem services scarcity explain global trends of PCES economic values. We observe higher PCES values in agricultural areas of strong human presence such as the British Isles, Southwest of Brazil and India and lower values in less disturbed natural areas. These findings highlight the decisive role that human systems play in the economic realization of PCES and caution that single-criterion sustainability and conservation policies aimed at maximizing the economic returns of PCES may not overlap with wild nature.

In this study, we explored the key driving forces responsible for the succession between surface and subsurface cyanobacteria using ecological niche modelling based upon a case study in Miyun Reservoir, China. The results suggest a negative effect of water depth and surface light irradiance (I-0) on subsurface Planktothrix sp. growth (p-values < 0.001), and a unimodal effect of surface water temperature (T-0) with the optimum at 23 degrees C (p-value < 0.001). While the surface Microcystis spp. shows a strong positive relationship with temperature (T-0; p-value < 0.001), and significant effects for the interaction between T-0 and I-0 (p- value < 0.01). In addition, we identified the extent and type of interaction between subsurface and surface cyanobacteria and conclude that the high irradiance surface water combined with sufficient nutrients at the pre-bloom stage are key factors responsible for the preferential growth of surface cyanobacteria, while the gradual decline of the surface cyanobacteria in post-bloom stage is associated with nutrient reduction. This decline and loss of surface populations enhanced underwater irradiance and thus promoted the growth and allowed for succession of subsurface cyanobacteria in deeper layers where the nutrient supply was still adequate. Based upon this, the growth potentials for the subsurface and surface cyanobacteria are different under different environmental conditions: the subsurface cyanobacteria have greater growth potential than surface cyanobacteria in shallow oligotrophic and deep eutrophic reservoirs during median light irrigation seasons.

In order to evaluate the effects of metal exposure at molecular level in reproductive tissues, we profiled the sea urchin transcriptional response after non-lethal exposures using pathway-focused mRNA expression analyses. Herein, we show that exposures to relatively high concentrations of both essential and toxic metals hugely affected the gonadic expression of several genes involved in stress-response, detoxification, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, without significant changes in gonadosomatic indices. Even though treatments did not result in reproductive tissues visible alterations, metal exposures negatively affected the main mechanisms of stress-response, detoxification and survival of adult P. lividus. Additionally, transcriptional changes observed in P. lividus gonads may cause altered gametogenesis and maintenance of heritable aberrant epigenetic effects. This study leads to the conclusion that exposures to metals, as usually occurs in polluted coastal areas, may affect sea urchin gametogenesis, thus supporting the hypothesis that parental exposure to environmental stressors affects the phenotype of the offspring.

In the present study, the effect of water pH or Na concentration on fish olfactory response and Cu-induced olfactory toxicity was investigated. Also, the effects of two sodium salts, NaCl and NaNO3, on olfaction were studied. Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to 6 and 32 mu g/L Cu, each under five different conditions (pH 9, pH 6.5, 20 or 40 mg/L sodium added, or culture water), for 10 days before characterizing fish olfactory response using electro-olfactography (EOG). The results demonstrated that reducing the pH to 6.5 or adding 20 or 40 mg/L Na impairs the fish response to a standard olfactory cue. None of the water treatments were protective against, or synergic with, the toxic effect of Cu on the olfactory system. Of the two Na salts, NaCl caused significantly higher impairment than NaNO3. The results of the present study demonstrate that water quality modifies contaminant-induced olfactory toxicity, but differently than what is known for other tissues (i.e. gill).

The purpose of this study was to determine sub-lethal effects of ERY towards the marine fish Sparus aurata (gilthead seabream). S. aurata were acutely (0.3-323 mu g/L, 96 h) and chronically (0.7-8.8 mu g/L, 28 d) exposed to ERY. Detoxification [7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)], oxidative stress [catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GRed)], lipid peroxidation [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances - (TBARS)], genotoxicity [genetic damage index (GDI) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs)], neurotransmission [acetylcholinesterase (AChE)] and energy metabolism [lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] biomarkers were evaluated. Results showed that ERY did not promote significant effects in detoxification biomarkers, but induced slight pro-oxidative effects (decrease of GPx activity in the liver after acute exposure and an increase in gills after chronic exposure; and an increase of hepatic GRed activity following chronic exposure). There was a significant decrease in TBARS after chronic exposure, which contradicts a full scenario of oxidative stress. In terms of genotoxicity, both ERY exposures caused only a significant increase of GDI. Neurotransmission and energy metabolism were not also affected by ERY. Although few toxic effects of ERY have been previously documented (involving different metabolic pathways, as tested in this work), these were mainly observed for freshwater species. These findings suggest low vulnerability of S. aurata to ERY at levels close to the ones found in the wild. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gene duplication could promote better adaptation to environmental changes and to chronic injury or stress. We investigated if genotoxic and cytotoxic responses to agricultural impact are affected by ploidy. We evaluate syntopic populations of the cryptic diploid/polyploid complex Odontophrynus cordobae/O. americanus breeding in an agroecosystem from Central Argentina. The blood of 72 adult anurans was analysed. We used erythrometry to distinguish Odontophrynus individuals with different ploidy levels. We calculated micronucleus frequencies (Mn) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) as genotoxic effects and enucleated, mitotic, pyknotic and immature erythrocytes as cytotoxic endpoints (CYT). Mn, ENAs and CYT frequencies were significantly different between diploid and polyploid organisms. The higher frequencies of Mn and CYT were recorded in polyploid organisms, and the higher frequency of ENAs was recorded in diploids. These results indicate that stress response, as indicated by most genotoxic and cytotoxic endpoints, was higher in polyploids respect to diploids. Polyploidy could provide greater genetic flexibility increasing buffering against exogenous DNA-damaging agents and thus confer an advantage over diploids under certain environmental conditions.

One of the ways of combating this disease is the use of molluscicidal agents to eliminate or reduce the population of intermediate host snails. Polyhexamethylene biguanide hydrochloride (PHMB) is a chemical biocide commonly used as a disinfectant and antiseptic in the food industry and very successfully for the disinfection of swimming pools. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) indicated the PHMB as low environmental risk. The present study aimed to evaluate the molluscicidal activity of the PHMB in freshwater snail (Biomphalaria glabrata), intermediate host of Schistosoma mansoni. The PHMB showed high toxicity against all stages of the snail B. glabrata: embryos, new-borns and adults. The LC50 estimated was 0.98 mg L-1; 1.43 mg L-1 and 1.49 mg L-1, respectively, after exposure of 144 h for embryos and 96 h for new-borns and adults. PHMB did not prevent the development of embryos within the egg mass, since at all concentrations evaluated 80% of the embryos managed to develop until the hypo-stage, which is the last stage of development before hatching. However, PHMB inhibited the hatching of embryos by 100% at all concentrations above 1.6 mg L-1. PHMB proved to be a promising substance in the fight against schistosomiasis by eliminating the intermediate host (B. glabrata). This was the first study that makes an experimental observation of the molluscicidal activity of PHMB. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Research in progress in the Monte Austral of Argentina	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Arid and semiarid; Attributes; Desertification; Species selection	DESERT IMPLICATIONS; RESTORATION; DISTURBANCE; MOJAVE	We discuss the strategies and early results from an ecological restoration and rehabilitation project underway in Monte Austral (Southern Monte) of Argentinian Patagonia. We use this as a platform to propose a dryland framework species approach (DFSA) to ecological restoration and rehabilitation (ERR). DFSA is based on the 'framework species approach' developed in mega-diverse tropical forest biomes of Australia and southern Asia over the past 20 years. We discuss how the approach could be adapted and modified to boost the impact of ERR and help achieve more effective recovery of biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human health and well-being in the vast dryland ecosystems of the world. In arid and semiarid ecosystems, not all native species respond well to methods for growing in nurserys, and a key to ERR success is the identification of a coherent set of species selected on the basis of multiple criteria, both ecological and practical, and simple tests for field performance. We describe selection criteria and early results of field trials of three candidate framework plant species undergoing field trials in our region. Of these three, Atriplex lampa and Hyalis argentea var. latisquama showed uniformly high performance while the response of Senecio subulatus var. subulatus varied according to substrates. We also discuss the use of drones, and other tools for both research and action in conjunction with DFSA.

We tested whether different climatic regimes in this region promoted the evolution of different reproductive strategies among cacti species. We applied circular statistics and the Rayleigh test to determine whether flowering and fruiting were seasonal and to detect significant periodic patterns. Multiple linear regressions were used to determine the influence climatic variables had on the number of flowers and fruits produced by each species. The flowering and fruiting periods began during the rainy season and peaked in November and January, respectively. Annual and continuous patterns were observed, which presented extended durations. The timing of flowering and fruiting was positively associated with day length and temperature. Rainfall was not significant in any of the models. In the Brazilian Chaco, the cacti reproductive phenophases were triggered by changes in day length and temperature. The similarity in flowering and fruiting patterns among the cacti species with extended durations generated a significant amount of overlap in flowering and fruiting, which may be a strategy to maintain pollinator and seed disperser populations in this environment.

While the effects of artificial feeding on target species have been studied rather extensively, little is known about its effects on non-target species. We used automatic video surveillance to monitor the vertebrate species using artificial feeding sites (n=20) established primarily for brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. We also studied how type of artificial food (only plant-based food vs. mixed food including carrion) affects the species diversity and assemblage at the feeding sites. In total, we analyzed 117,566 recordings and identified 23 vertebrate taxa, including the brown bear, using the feeding sites. Brown bear, European badger (Meles meles), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) were the most frequently recorded species. Birds represented a substantial part (46%) of vertebrate community using the feeding sites, including species of a high conservation importance. Feeding sites were regularly used also by species for which intentional artificial feeding is forbidden in study area (e.g., roe deer Capreolus capreolus). Species diversity at the feeding sites was highest in spring while species composition varied both seasonally and according to the type of artificial food (with or without carrion). Our study indicates that artificial feeding affects numerous non-target species, which could have several ecological and management-relevant effects, including potentially undesired consequences. Artificial feeding of wildlife should be carefully planned and we provide recommendations on how to mitigate the side effects on non-target species.

Mapping ammonia risk on sensitive habitats in Ireland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						MARSH; Ammonia; Risk; Natura 2000; Agriculture; National Emissions Ceilings Directive; Habitats Directive	EPIPHYTIC LICHEN COMMUNITIES; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; ATMOSPHERIC AMMONIA; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION	The aim of this study was to provide a simple, cost-effective, risk-based map of terrestrial areas in Ireland where environmental quality may be at risk from atmospheric ammonia. This risk-based approach identifies Natura 2000 sites in Ireland at risk from agricultural atmospheric ammonia, collating best available data using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). In mapping ammonia risk on sensitive habitats (MARSH), the method identifies sources of ammonia, classifying them on a scale of risk from 0 to 5. These sources are subsequently summed based on a weighting determined by their contribution to national emissions divided by their potentially impacted area. A Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.72 allows for concentrations from United Kingdom's FRAME modelling to be applied to the MARSH model, which are corrected based on recent monitoring. Applying Designation Weighted Indicators (DWI), the MARSH model predicts that 80.7, 34.3 and 5.9% of Natura 2000 sites in Ireland may exceed ambient concentrations of 1, 2, and 3 mu g/m(3), respectively. A Nitroindex map of Ireland based on available lichen records was also developed and is presented as part of this study. This Nitroindex was used to identify areas where impacts have already been recorded, thus informing the classification of sites "at-risk". The combination of both the MARSH and Nitroindex models ascertains which Natura 2000 sites are most at risk, thereby providing valuable data to relevant authorities. The MARSH model acts as a first step towards screening and assessing Natura 2000 sites most at risk from atmospheric ammonia, providing a tool to demonstrate compliance with the National Emissions Ceilings Directive.

The causes of these declines are unknown, but sea surface temperature (SST) is considered one of the dominant factors affecting intertidal algae. The 2015-2016 El Nino introduced anomalously high SSTs to southern California, which may have impacted rocky intertidal species. This study investigates temporal changes in abundance of S. compressa with respect to SST at 4 sites on San Clemente Island (SCI), California, from 2012 to 2016. Point-intercept data were used to quantify percent cover during biannual intertidal surveys. To correlate SST with changes in S. compressa percent cover, we utilized SST data collected approximately 50 km southeast of SCI from the National Data Buoy Center. Our results indicated significant declines in S. compressa in spring 2015 across all 4 sites following SST anomalies that began in 2014. Linear regression between S. compressa percent cover and the previous year's maximum SSTs showed a significant negative relationship, indicating that reduced abundance of S. compressa was moderately associated with elevated SSTs.

Persistence of fire-killed conifer snags in California, USA	FIRE ECOLOGY			English	Article						FFE-FVS; model evaluation; model validation; snag dynamics; snag longevity	MIXED-CONIFER; DYNAMICS; FORESTS; LONGEVITY; SALVAGE; WILDFIRE; ECOLOGY; DECAY; BIRDS; WOOD	Background: Coarse woody debris has numerous functions in forest ecosystems, including wildlife habitat, fuel loading, and nutrient cycling. Standing dead trees, or snags, are particularly important resources for wildlife, and guidelines for snag recruitment and retention are integral parts of forest management. However, snag persistence is not well understood and existing models are poorly validated. We monitored fire-killed conifer snag persistence after four California wildfires and one prescribed fire. Species sampled included white fir (Abies concolor [Gord. & Glend] Lindl. ex Hildebr.), incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens [Torr.] Florin), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi [Balf.]), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson var. ponderosa C Lawson). Results: Fire-injured trees that survived at least one year post fire were monitored for 10 years after they died. We developed two sets of species-specific snag persistence rates: a simplified model based only on time since death, and a full model that included tree characteristics. The primary factors affecting persistence rates in all models were snag age (years since death) and species. Secondary factors included diameter at breast height, time between fire and tree death, and crown injury. Snag persistence rates decreased with snag age. Yellow pine snags (a combined group of ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine) fell significantly faster than any other species. Larger-diameter snags persisted longer than smaller-diameter snags for all species. Incense-cedar trees that survived longer post fire persisted longer as snags.

Functional traits of acquisitive invasive woody species differ from conservative invasive and native species	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						Prunus serotina; Quercus rubra; Robinia pseudoacacia; biomass; natural regeneration; functional traits	LOCUST ROBINIA-PSEUDOACACIA; OAK QUERCUS-RUBRA; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; PLANT INVASIONS; PRUNUS-SEROTINA; SEED DISPERSAL; EUROPEAN JAY; FOREST TREE; GROWTH	One of the most important sources of invasiveness is species' functional traits and their variability. However, there are still few studies on invasive tree species traits conducted along resource gradients that allow for a comparison of acquisitive and conservative strategies. We aimed to assess the differences in trait variation among native, alien conservative and alien acquisitive tree species along resource availability gradients (soil fertility and light availability) and to assess the traits variability of the species studied along resources availability gradients. Our study compared invasive tree species in Europe (Prunus serotina Ehrh., Quercus rubra L. and Robinia pseudoacacia L.) with their native competitors (Ater pseudoplatanus L., A. platanoides L., Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. and Fagus sylvatica L). The study was conducted on 1329 seedlings and saplings collected in a system of 372 study plots in W Poland. For each individual we assessed leaf, stem and root mass ratios, total biomass, leaf area ratio, specific leaf area and projected leaf area. Two invasive species (P. serotina and R. pseueloacacia) represented a more acquisitive strategy than native species - along litter pH and light availability gradients these species had higher leaf mass fraction, specific leaf area and leaf area ratio. In contrast, Q. rubra had the highest total biomass and root mass fraction. Alien species usually had higher coefficients of variation of studied traits. This suggests that relatively high projected leaf area, as a way of filling space and outcompeting native species, may be reached in two ways - biomass allocation to leaves and control of leaf morphology or by overall growth rate. High variability of invasive species traits also suggests randomness in seedling survival, which similarly to the neutral theory of invasion, highlights the necessity of including randomness in modelling biological invasions.

It is transmitted from rats to people via urine, and is responsible for significant human morbidity and mortality in under-resourced settings. To mitigate the risks posed to people, it is important to understand the ecology of the causative agent Leptospira interrogans. The overarching objective of this study was to compare L. interrogans carriage in urban Norway rats in two ecologically distinct urban environments. We trapped Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in Vancouver, Canada (N = 525) and Salvador, Brazil (N = 433) to evaluate whether rat characteristics (i.e., sex, weight, sexual maturity, pregnancy, and the presence of wounds) and location of capture were associated with L. interrogans status. Using generalized linear mixed models to control for clustering by trapping location, we found a greater prevalence of L. interrogans in Salvador (79%) than in Vancouver (12%), and greater spatial heterogeneity in pathogen prevalence in Vancouver than in Salvador. In both locations, we found that older rats and rats with more bite wounds had greater odds of L. interrogans carriage, although wounding influenced pathogen status more for younger animals. Additionally, we found that juvenile rats in Salvador were more likely to leave the nest infected with L. interrogans than were rats in Vancouver, suggesting that potential differences in early-life transmission dynamics exist between the two locations. Together, these results elucidate both general L. interrogans ecology, as well as the importance of geographical location in determining transmission among rats.

Area-Independent Effects of Water-Retaining Features on Intertidal Biodiversity on Eco-Engineered Seawalls in the Tropics	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						habitat complexity; ecological engineering; urban marine ecology; species-area relationship; species-abundance relationship	URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE; COASTAL DEFENSE; OCEAN SPRAWL; ROCK-POOLS; MARINE; ASSEMBLAGES; ENHANCEMENT; COMMUNITIES; ADAPTATION; HABITATS	Over the last decade there has been a global effort to eco-engineer urban artificial shorelines with the aim of increasing their biodiversity and extending their conservation value. One of the most common and viable eco-engineering approaches on seawalls is to use enhancement features that increase habitat structural complexity, including concrete tiles molded with complex designs and precast "flowerpots" that create artificial rock pools. Increases in species diversity in pits and pools due to microhabitat conditions (water retention, shade, protection from waves, and/or biotic refugia) are often reported, but these results can be confounded by differences in the surface area sampled. In this study, we fabricated three tile types (n = 10): covered tile (grooved tile with a cover to retain water), uncovered tile (same grooved tile but without a cover) and granite control. We tested the effects of these tile types on species richness (S), total individual abundance (N), and community composition. All tiles were installed at 0.5 m above chart datum along seawalls surrounding two island sites (Pulau Hantu and Kusu Island) south of Singapore mainland. The colonizing assemblages were sampled after 8 months. Consistent with previous studies, mean S was significantly greater on covered tiles compared to the uncovered and granite tiles. While it is implied in much of the eco-engineering literature that this pattern results from greater niche availability allotted by microhabitat conditions, we further investigated whether there was an underlying species-individual relationship to determine whether increases in S could have simply resulted from covered tiles supporting greater N (i.e., increasing the probability of detecting more species despite a constant area). The species-individual relationship was positive, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are at play, and that biodiversity enhancements may in some instances operate simply by increasing the abundance of individuals, even when microhabitat availability is unchanged. This finding underscores the importance of testing mechanisms in eco-engineering studies and highlights ongoing mechanistic uncertainties that should be addressed to inform the design of more biodiverse seawalls and urban marine environments.

Energy balance closure (EBC) is crucial for validating and improving regional and global climate models. To investigate the nature of the gap in EBC for agroecosystems, we analyzed EC measurements from two climatically contrasting regions (Kraichgau - KR - and Swabian Jura - SJ) in southwestern Germany. Data were taken at six fully equipped EC sites from 2010 to 2017. The gap in EBC was quantified by ordinary linear regression, relating the energy balance ratio (EBR), calculated as the quotient of turbulent fluxes and available energy, to the residual energy term. In order to examine potential reasons for differences in EBC, we compared the EBC under varying environmental conditions and investigated a wide range of possible controls. Overall, the variation in EBC was found to be higher during winter than summer. Moreover, we determined that the site had a statistically significant effect on EBC but no significant effect on either crop or region (KR vs SJ). The time-variable footprints of all EC stations were estimated based on data measured in 2015, complimented by micro-topographic analyses along the pre-vailing wind direction. The smallest mean annual energy balance gap was 17% in KR and 13% in SJ. Highest EBRs were mostly found for winds from the prevailing wind direction. The spread of EBRs distinctly narrowed under unstable atmospheric conditions, strong buoyancy, and high friction velocities. Smaller footprint areas led to better EBC due to increasing homogeneity. Flow distortions caused by the back head of the anemometer negatively affected EBC during corresponding wind conditions.	[Eshonkulov, Ravshan; Poyda, Arne; Ingwersen, Joachim; Weber, Tobias K.

Abiotic factors determine functional outcomes of microbial inoculation of soils from a metal contaminated brownfield	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Extracellular soil phosphatase activity; Soil microbiome; Soil metal contamination	16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; PLANT DIVERSITY; PHYTOREMEDIATION; PRODUCTIVITY; BACTERIUM; IMPACTS; BIOMASS; FOREST	Whole community microbial inoculation can improve soil function in contaminated environments. Here we conducted a case study to investigate whether biotic factors (inoculum) or abiotic factors (soil base) have more impact on the extracellular enzymatic activities in a whole community microbial inoculation. To this end, we cross-inoculated microbial communities between two heavy metal-contaminated soils, with high and low extracellular enzyme activities, respectively. We measured extracellular phosphatase activity, a proxy for soil function, after self- and cross-inoculation of microbial communities into sterilized soils, and all activities were normalized to non-inoculated controls. We found that inoculation increased phosphatase activity in the soils. For soils treated with different inocula, we found significant differences in the microbial community compositions but no significant differences in the extracellular phosphatase activities normalized to their respective sterilized, non-inoculated controls (4.7 +/- 1.8 and 3.3 +/- 0.5 for soils inoculated with microbial communities from 146 to 43, respectively). On the other hand, normalized phosphatase activities between the two soil bases were significantly different (4.1 +/- 0.12 and 1.9 +/- 0.12 for soil bases 146 and 43, respectively) regardless of the source of the inoculum that did not vary between soil bases. The results indicate that the abiotic properties of the soils were a significant predictor for phosphatase activity but not for the end-point composition of the microbial community. The findings suggest that targeted microbial inocula from metal contaminated soils can increase phosphatase activity, and likely soil functioning in general, but the degree to which this happens depends on the abiotic environment, in this case, metal contamination.

An automated and optimized approach for online spatial biodiversity model: a case study of OGC web processing service	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Web processing service; parallel computing; spatial biodiversity model; distributed GIS; fuzzy AHP; participatory GIS	DECISION-ANALYSIS; GIS; MAPS	An online spatial biodiversity model (SBM) for optimized and automated spatial modelling and analysis of geospatial data is proposed, which is based on web processing service (WPS) and web service orchestration (WSO) in parallel computing environment. The developed model integrates distributed geospatial data in geoscientific processing workflow to compute the algorithms of spatial landscape indices over the web using free and open source software. A case study for Uttarakhand state of India demonstrates the model outputs such as spatial biodiversity disturbance index (SBDI) and spatial biological richness index (SBRI). In order to optimize and automate, an interactive web interface is developed using participatory GIS approaches for implementing fuzzy AHP. In addition, sensitivity analysis and geosimulation experiments are also performed under distributed GIS environment. Results suggest that parallel algorithms in SBM execute faster than sequential algorithms and validation of SBRI with biological diversity shows significant correlation by indicating high R-2 values.

Fine-Scale Tracking of Ambient Temperature and Movement Reveals Shuttling Behavior of Elephants to Water	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Loxodonta africana; thermoregulation; GPS telemetry; temperature; water; habitat; shuttle	ASIAN ELEPHANTS; INTERFERENCE COMPETITION; AFRICAN ELEPHANT; NATIONAL-PARK; LANDSCAPE; HEAT; SAVANNA; THERMOREGULATION; SELECTION; CLIMATE	Movement strategies of animals have been well studied as a function of ecological drivers (e.g., forage selection and avoiding predation) rather than physiological requirements (e.g., thermoregulation). Thermal stress is a major concern for large mammals, especially for savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), which have amongst the greatest challenge for heat dissipation in hot and arid environments. Therefore, elephants must make decisions about where and how fast to move to reduce thermal stress. We tracked 14 herds of elephant in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, for 2 years, using GPS collars with inbuilt temperature sensors to examine the influence of temperature on movement strategies, particularly when accessing water. We first confirmed that collar-mounted temperature loggers captured hourly variation in relative ambient temperatures across the landscape, and, thus, could be used to predict elephant movement strategies at fine spatio-temporal scales. We found that elephants moved slower in more densely wooded areas, but, unexpectedly, moved faster at higher temperatures, especially in the wet season compared to the dry season. Notably, this speed of movement was highest when elephants were approaching and leaving water sources. Visits to water showed a periodic shuttling pattern, with a peak return rate of 10-30 h, wherein elephants were closest to water during the hotter times of the day, and spent longer at water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. When elephants left water, they showed low fidelity to the same water source, and traveled farther in the dry season than in the wet season. In KNP, where water is easily accessible, and the risk of poaching is low, we found that elephants use short, high-speed bursts of movement to get to water at hotter times of day. This strategy not only provides the benefit of predation risk avoidance, but also allows them to use water to thermoregulate.

For a comprehensive site characterization of Mount Zugspitze, analyses of CO2 weekly periodicity and diurnal cycle were performed to provide evidence for local sources and sinks, showing clear weekday to weekend differences, with dominantly higher CO2 levels during the daytime on weekdays. A case study of atmospheric trace gases (CO and NO) and the passenger numbers to the summit indicate that CO2 sources close by did not result from tourist activities but instead obviously from anthropogenic pollution in the near vicinity. Such analysis of local effects is an indispensable requirement for selecting representative data at orographic complex measurement sites. The CO2 trend and seasonality were then analyzed by background data selection and decomposition of the long-term time series into trend and seasonal components. The mean CO2 annual growth rate over the 36-year period at Zugspitze is 1.8 +/- 0.4 ppm yr(-1), which is in good agreement with Mauna Loa station and global means. The peak-to-trough amplitude of the mean CO2 seasonal cycle is 12.4 +/- 0.6 ppm at Mount Zugspitze (after data selection: 10.5 +/- 0.5 ppm), which is much lower than at nearby measurement sites at Mount Wank (15.9 +/- 1.5 ppm) and Schauinsland (15.9 +/- 1.0 ppm), but following a similar seasonal pattern.

KILIMANJARO; PRECIPITATION GRADIENT; TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS; MOISTURE GRADIENT; PYROGENIC CARBON; C-4 VEGETATION; FOREST; PLANT	Variations in the stable isotopic composition of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) of fresh leaves, litter, and topsoils were used to characterize soil organic matter dynamics of 12 tropical ecosystems in the Mount Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania. We studied a total of 60 sites distributed along five individual elevational transects (860-4550m a.s.l.), which define a strong climatic and land-use gradient encompassing semi-natural and managed ecosystems. The combined effects of contrasting environmental conditions, vegetation, soil, and management practices had a strong impact on the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values observed in the different ecosystems. The relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants greatly determined the delta C-13 of a given ecosystem. In contrast, delta N-15 values were largely controlled by land-use intensification and climatic conditions. The large delta C-13 enrichment factors (delta C-13(litter) - delta C-13(soil)) and low soil C/N ratios observed in managed and disturbed systems agree well with the notion of altered SOM dynamics. Besides the systematic removal of the plant biomass characteristic of agricultural systems, annual litterfall patterns may also explain the comparatively lower contents of C and N observed in the topsoils of these intensively managed sites. Both delta N-15 values and calculated delta N-15-based enrichment factors (delta N-15(litter) - delta N-15(soil)) suggest the tightest nitrogen cycling at high-elevation (> 3000m a.s.l.) ecosystems and more open nitrogen cycling both in grass-dominated and intensively managed cropping systems. However, claims about the nature of the N cycle (i.e. open or closed) should not be made solely on the basis of soil delta N-15 as other processes that barely discriminate against N-15 (i.e. soil nitrate leaching) have been shown to be quite significant in Mount Kilimanjaro's forest ecosystems. The negative correlation of delta N-15 values with soil nitrogen content and the positive correlation with mean annual temperature suggest reduced mineralization rates and thus limited nitrogen availability, at least in high-elevation ecosystems. By contrast, intensively managed systems are characterized by lower soil nitrogen contents and warmer conditions, leading together with nitrogen fertilizer inputs to lower nitrogen retention and thus significantly higher soil delta N-15 values. A simple function driven by soil nitrogen content and mean annual temperature explained 68% of the variability in soil delta N-15 values across all sites. Based on our results, we suggest that in addition to land-use intensification, increasing temperatures in a changing climate may promote soil carbon and nitrogen losses, thus altering the otherwise stable soil organic matter dynamics of Mount Kilimanjaro's forest ecosystems.

Broadscale inventories of this "blue" carbon store are currently lacking and labour intensive. Sampling 23 salt marshes in the United Kingdom, we developed a Saltmarsh Carbon Stock Predictor (SCSP) with the capacity to predict up to 44% of spatial variation in surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-10 cm) from simple observations of plant community and soil type. Classification of soils into two types (sandy or not-sandy) explained 32% of variation in SOC stock. Plant community type (five vegetation classes) explained 37% of variation. Combined information on soil and plant community types explained 44% of variation in SOC stock. GIS maps of surface SOC stock were produced for all salt marshes in Wales (similar to 4000 ha), using existing soil maps and governmental vegetation data and demonstrating the application of the SCSP for large-scale predictions of blue carbon stores and the use of plant community traits for predicting ecosystem services.

The ability to accurately model growth becomes critical when making population predictions over large temporal (multi-decadal) and spatial (meso) scales, e.g., investigating the effect of global change. Body length collection by removal sampling is a widely-used practice for monitoring fish populations over such large scales. Such data can be efficiently integrated into a Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM) and lead to interesting findings on fish dynamics. We illustrate this approach by presenting an integrated HBM of brown trout (Salmo trutta) growth, population dynamics, and removal sampling data collection processes using large temporal and spatial scales data (20 years; 48 sites placed along a 100 km latitudinal gradient). Growth and population dynamics are modelled by ordinary differential equations with parameters bound together in a hierarchical structure. The observation process is modelled with a combination of a Poisson error, a binomial error, and a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Absolute fit is measured using posterior predictive checks, those results indicate that our model fits the data well. Results indicate that growth rate is positively correlated to catchment area. This result corroborates those of other studies (laboratory, exploratory) that identified factors besides water temperature that are related to daily ration and have a significant effect on stream-dwelling salmonid growth at a large scale. Our study also illustrates the value of integrated HBM and electrofishing removal sampling data to study in situ fish populations over large scales.

Thus, to address these problems, modern modelling techniques have been developed and introduced for applications. In time-series data, the cross-wavelet transform (CWT) and cross-correlation function (CCF) serve as promising tools to analyze the dynamics of fish populations through time and space. Here, we employed these two well-known time-series modelling approaches to model the spatial and temporal dynamics of small mud carp species (Henicorhynchus lobatus and Henicorhynchus siamensis) and examine the influence of flow pulses on their dynamics using spatial and time-series data collected from the Tonle Sap Lake and River System. The phase angle given by the CWT provided a useful tool for statistically detecting and reconstructing the phase relationship between the two time series of fish data. Moreover, the correlation coefficients at each lag between the water level and fish abundance identified by the CCF provided a mechanism to understand how the flow pulse influenced the dynamics of fish. The results showed that H. lobatus moved out of the floodplain and the lake earlier than H. siamensis. Herein, H. lobatus retreats slower than H. siamensis in the Tonle Sap Lake, but they retreated at similar speeds when they reach the Tonle Sap River. This suggests that the two species respond differently to the out-flow pulse only when they are inside the TSL, indicating the main role of flow pulses in determining the occurrence and movement of fish in the Tonle Sap Ecosystem. We also discussed the role and applications of these modelling approaches for linking the changes in environmental parameters and fish. The CWT and CCF, based on our results, are helpful modelling approaches for analyzing time-series data to understand the phase relationship and the periodicity of synchronisation (joint periodicity), i.e. the role of environmental factors in shaping fish occurrence and movement in a flood-pulse ecosystem.

We introduce the R package "DiagnoseHR," simulation tools for assessing how variation in detection probability arising from landscape, animal behavior, and methodological processes affects home range inference. We demonstrate the utility of simulation methods for home range analysis planning by comparing bias arising from three home range estimation methods under multiple detection scenarios. We simulated correlated random walks in three landscapes that varied in detection probability and constructed home ranges from locations filtered through a range of sampling protocols. Home range estimates were less biased by reduced detection probability when sampling effort was increased, but the effects of sampling day distribution were minimal. Like others, we found that kernel density estimates were the least affected by variation in detection probability, while minimum convex polygons were most affected. Our results illustrate the value of quantifying uncertainty in home range estimates and suggest that field biologists working in environments with low detection may wish to weight sample-size greater than concerns about temporal autocorrelation when designing sampling protocols.

For their meaningful use, correct species identification is crucial. For example, clarifying if a species is new to science requires an overview of what has already been described. This includes comparisons with existing authoritative specimens (types). Most type specimens are rather old and their DNA expected to be degraded to various extents. Comparative DNA sequence analysis is in regular use in taxonomic research of today and is essential for identifying and delimiting species. In this study, we focus on lichenized fungi (lichens), in which many species groups are highly inconspicuous and impossible to identify to species based on morphology alone. Our aim was to test the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that DNA quality of lichens depends on (1) time since collection, (2) taxonomic affinity, and/or (3) habitat/ecology. We included two species from each of four different lichen genera (i.e., Cladonia, Nephroma, Peltigera, and Ramalina), each species pair with a different autecology. For each species, we included samples from approximately every 25 years from present to about 150 years back in time. We used a two-step PCR-based approach followed by sequencing on an Ion Torrent PGM to produce target sequences (mtSSU) of degraded DNA. We received satisfactory DNA sequence information for 54 of 56 specimens. We recovered full-length sequences for several more than 100-years-old specimens, including a 127-years-old specimen, and retrieved enough sequence information for species identification of a 150-years-old specimen. As expected, sequencing success was negatively correlated with age of the specimens. It also varied with taxonomic affinity. We found no significant correlation between sequencing success and habitat ecology of the investigated specimens. The herein tested Ion Torrent sequencing approach outperformed Sanger sequencing with regard to sequencing success and efficiency. We find the protocol used herein highly suitable for obtaining sequences from both young and old lichen specimens and discuss potential improvements to it.

However, if genetically encoded in the parasite, it should be under selection in the parasite. Such host manipulation has often been assumed to be energetically costly, which should restrict its evolution. Evidence of such costs, however, remains elusive. The trophically transmitted cestode Schistocephalus solidus manipulates the activity of its first intermediate copepod host to reduce its predation susceptibility before the parasite is ready for transmission. Thereafter, S. solidus increases host activity to facilitate transmission to its subsequent fish host. I selected S. solidus for or against host manipulation over three generations to investigate the evolvability of manipulation and identify potential trade-offs. Host manipulation responded to selection, confirming that this trait is heritable in the parasite and hence can present an extended phenotype. Changes in host manipulation were not restrained by any obvious costs.

However, few studies have investigated whether males sum previous encounters with rivals, and the total level of competition has never been explicitly separated from social familiarity. Social familiarity can be an important component of kin recognition and has been suggested as a cue that males use to avoid harming females when competing with relatives. Previous work has succeeded in independently manipulating social familiarity and relatedness among rivals, but experimental manipulations of familiarity are confounded with manipulations of the total number of rivals that males encounter. Using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we manipulated three factors: familiarity among rival males, the maximum number of rivals encountered simultaneously and the total number of rivals encountered over a 48 h period. Males produced smaller ejaculates when exposed to more rivals in total, regardless of the maximum number of rivals they encountered simultaneously. Males did not respond to familiarity. Our results demonstrate that males of this species can sum the number of rivals encountered over separate days, and therefore the confounding of familiarity with the total level of competition in previous studies should not be ignored.

Within these relict deposits, ancient microbial mats, or paleomats, have been preserved under extremely arid and cold conditions since the receding of larger paleolakes thousands of years ago, and now serve as a sheltered niche for microbes in a highly challenging oligotrophic environment. To explore whether paleomats could be repositories for ancient lake cells or were later colonized by soil microbes, determine what types of metabolic pathways might be present, analyze potential gene expression, and explore whether the cells are in a vegetative or dormant state, we collected paleomat samples from ancient lake facies on the northern slopes of Lake Vanda in Wright Valley in December 2016. Using a gentle lysis technique optimized to preserve longer molecules, combined with a polyenzymatic treatment to maximize yields from different cell types, we isolated high-molecular weight DNA and RNA from ancient paleomat samples. Community composition analysis suggests that the paleomat community may retain a population of indigenousmat cells that may flourish once more favorable conditions are met. In addition to harboring a diverse microbial community, paleomats appear to host heterotrophs in surrounding soils utilizing the deposits as a carbon source. Whole genome long-read PacBio sequencing of native DNA and Illumina metagenomic sequencing of size-sorted DNA (>2,500 nt) indicated possible cell viability, with mat community composed of bacterial taxa. Metagenome assemblies identified genes with predicted roles in nitrogen cycling and complex carbohydrate degradation, and we identified key metabolic pathways such as stress response, DNA repair, and sporulation. Metatranscriptomic data revealed that the most abundant transcripts code for products involved in genetic information processing pathways, particularly translation, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Our results lend new insight into the functional ecology of paleomat deposits, with implications for our understanding of cell biology, Antarctic microbiology and biogeography, and the limits of life in extremely harsh environments.

Pattern of PEEA catalyzing major steps of the carbon cycle (beta-glucosidase (beta-gls), cellobiohydrolase (cel), glucuronidase (glr), and xylosidase (xyl), soil respiration rates and extractable organic carbon were analyzed in response to increased intra-annual precipitation variability in a European, mesic temperate grassland. The field experiment was carried out in three subsequent years by simulating recurrent drought events combined with heavy rainfall either early or late in the growing season (spring or summer) by rainout shelters and irrigation systems. Our data indicated comparable effects of the drought settings independent from the timing of the drought. Both for the simulated spring-and summer drought a decrease of enzymatic activities was observed compared to the control plots, with beta-gls activity after the summer drought being the only exception. However, response pattern toward rewetting differed depending on the seasonal timing of the drought being introduced. After spring drought, a fast recovery to control level was observed for PEEA of beta-gls and xyl, whereas cel and glr activity remained constantly lower. Rewetting after summer drought induced an increase of all enzymatic activities to values even higher compared to the controls. Overall, our data indicate a high resilience of PEEA toward drought and rewetting events in grassland soils, which is modulated by the seasonal timing of the extreme weather events.

A large number of algorithms have been developed to reconstruct missing information. Simple methods are compared for filling missing data in the case that one spectral band presents missing information but the other bands are complete. The methods are (1) spatial convolution filtering, (2) unsupervised classification using the complete bands and assignment of the cluster's average value to missing stripe pixels, (3) global regression models, (4) geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, and (5) a combination of classification and linear models. To evaluate the performance of the different methods, missing line stripes of different sizes are simulated and reconstructed using the five methods. Then, root mean square error (RMSE), correlation, maximum deviance, and bias are computed. To identify the conditions related to the performance of each method, some characteristics of the missing lines, as correlation between spectral bands and spatial autocorrelation, are also calculated. The unsupervised classification based on the larger number of clusters, in particular when combined with linear regression, presents a low RMSE due to its ability to identify the spectral signature of the objects present in the scene. The GWR model performs better than global regression model because it is able to fit the relationship between the missing band and the complete bands locally, which is an important advantage in heterogeneous landscape. Spatial filtering is the most inaccurate method except for one pixel-width missing line.

Factors affecting recruitment, growth and survival of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica across an intertidal elevation gradient in southern New England	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Crassostrea virginica; Oyster; Restoration; Biophysical gradients	EVALUATING PERFORMANCE; HABITAT DEGRADATION; SALT-MARSHES; DENSITY; REEFS; RESTORATION; PREDATION; MORTALITY; COMMUNITY; SCALE	Reef-building oysters are important coastal foundation species that provide ecosystem services. Overharvesting, destructive fishing practices, and environmental degradation have caused significant declines in global oyster populations, necessitating restoration efforts in many regions to rebuild oyster habitat and recover lost services. Understanding how biological and physical gradients regulate oyster recruitment, survivorship and growth will help guide future efforts to successfully restore oyster populations. We conducted a field experiment in Ipswich, Massachusetts, to quantify the effects of tidal elevation, predator exclusion, and reef vertical relief on oyster settlement, recruitment and survivorship. Oyster settlement was 3 times greater at the deepest intertidal elevation compared to the 2 shallower intertidal elevations. Reef vertical relief and predator exclusion did not affect oyster settlement or survivorship. Despite increased sedimentation and algal fouling with increasing depth, living oyster densities remained significantly elevated at the deepest intertidal elevation 8 mo after the experimental reefs were constructed. Oyster mortality during this period was highest (>70%) at our shallowest elevation treatment, likely the result of desiccation and food limitation. Meanwhile, mortality during the first winter post-recruitment was high across all elevations (all >64 %), with our deepest elevation treatment experiencing the highest mortality rate (90%). Our results suggest that there is a gradient in oyster settlement rates, which increase at lower elevation, and that the dominant drivers of mortality also likely vary with elevation. Our findings highlight the need for region-specific studies to quantify biological and physical gradients prior to large-scale restoration efforts.

Thecosome pteropods, i.e. Limacina helicina (juveniles and adults) and L. retroversa (adults), were collected in summer/autumn in Kongsfjorden and Isfjorden (Svalbard, 78 degrees N) and, for the first time, successfully fed with C-13-labeled algae for 6 d. The gymnosome pteropod Clione limacina was sampled in summer in northern Svalbard and fed with C-13-labeled L. retroversa for 23 d. FA compositions were determined by gas chromatography, and C-13 enrichment of FAs was analyzed by compound-specific isotope analysis. Among the thecosomes, maximum lipid turnover occurred in L. retroversa adults (1.3% d(-1)). L. helicina adults and juveniles showed lower lipid turnover rates (0.1 and 0.2% d(-1) , respectively). The thecosomes exhibited the ability to assimilate omega-3 FAs (up to 8.0% d(-1)). The lipid turnover rate of C. limacina averaged at only 0.07% d(-1). However, C. limacina clearly showed the unusual capacity of de novo synthesis of odd-chain FAs (up to 1.2% d(-1)). Lipid turnover rates of pteropods were lower than those reported for Arctic copepods. However, pteropods may play a substantial role in the transfer of lipids to higher trophic levels, especially in autumn, when copepods have descended from the upper layers of the water column. The pteropods also showed the capacity to channel particular compounds such as omega-3 and odd-chain FAs, and therefore could be important for the functional diversity of the Arctic zooplankton community.

Fine-scale habitat partitioning facilitates sympatry between two octopus species in a shallow Florida lagoon	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Resource partitioning; Cephalopods; Spatial distribution; Seasonal abundance; Den ecology; Habitat heterogeneity	INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; DEN ECOLOGY; VULGARIS; MIMICRY; CEPHALOPODA; BEHAVIOR; CORAL; POPULATIONS; COEXISTENCE; CAMOUFLAGE	Species coexistence is a critical determinant of biodiversity and community structure, yet resource partitioning mechanisms that facilitate coexistence remain understudied for many taxa, including cephalopods. Octopus vulgaris and Macrotritopus defilippi cohabit a shallow-water lagoon in South Florida. Temporal and spatial distribution as well as habitat association were examined as potential resource partitioning mechanisms to facilitate coexistence between these species. Methods included in situ visual observations, marking locations of octopusoccupied dens, and photoquadrats of octopus dens and surrounding habitats. Den locations were marked year-round for 3 yr to determine consistency of spatial distribution and temporal trends. Octopus abundance was highest during spring and lowest during fall for both species, indicating that temporal partitioning (in terms of seasonality) is likely not a mechanism of coexistence. O. vulgaris and M. defilippi had the highest densities of occupied dens in the same general shallow areas of the lagoon; thus there was no evidence of spatial partitioning. Although octopuses spatially overlapped in the same general area, multiple substrate categories were available, and each species' den and surrounding habitat was associated with different substrates. O. vulgaris was associated mostly with hard bottom and inhabited hard-structured dens while M. defilippi was associated with soft sandy bottom and inhabited burrows in the sand as dens. Fine-scale habitat partitioning is made possible by this lagoon's heterogeneous microenvironments, which aid in explaining coexistence of these 2 octopus species.

Skate egg nursery habitat in the eastern Bering Sea: a predictive model	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Nursery habitat; Maximum entropy; Suitable habitat; Elasmobranch; Alaska	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; BATHYRAJA-PARMIFERA; ALASKA SKATE; FISH; PREDATION; FISHERIES; CHONDRICHTHYES; HYPOXIA; GROWTH; WATER	Alaska skate species utilize localized egg nursery sites along the interface of the continental slope and shelf in the eastern Bering Sea to lay eggs in high densities. These egg nursery sites persist across years and are thought to be related to environmental conditions. The objective of this analysis was to predict the potential habitat of skate egg nursery sites using species distribution models. Skate egg nursery locations (n = 26) for 6 species were identified from bottom trawl survey catches and underwater camera surveys. Maximum entropy models were developed using 10 environmental variables to predict the probability of suitable skate egg nursery habitat; 7 variables were included in the best model. Potential habitat peaked at seafloor slopes <2 %, in areas of low temperature variability and in areas of high oxygen concentrations. These were the 3 most important variables in the model. Most of the predicted high probability egg nursery suitable habitat for skates was in canyons (e.g. Bering Canyon and the southern arm of Pribilof Canyon) in a relatively narrow band on the upper slope. The most important finding of this modeling study was that there is a limited area of the upper continental slope where conditions would support potential skate egg nursery areas; however, much of the area is unexplored and likely to remain so in the near future. Management actions for important conservation questions can look to modeling studies such as these for guidance in the absence of comprehensive surveys.

Factors influencing the habitat use of sympatric albatrosses from Macquarie Island, Australia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Environmental models; Foraging ecology; Habitat overlap; Macquarie Island; Residence time; Seabirds; Southern Ocean; Tracking	SOUTHERN BULLERS ALBATROSSES; WANDERING ALBATROSSES; FORAGING STRATEGIES; SATELLITE TRACKING; PROVISIONING STRATEGIES; ROUND DISTRIBUTION; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS; MARINE PREDATOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Differences in habitat use of sympatric species are influenced by variability in functional morphology and life history trade-offs and are expected to shape species resilience to environmental change. To determine differences in year-round habitat use and gain insight into how morphological and life history traits influence foraging of an albatross community from subantarctic Macquarie Island, Australia (54.6 degrees S, 158.9 degrees E), we quantified the physical features associated with high residence time for 10 black-browed Thalassarche melanophris; 10 grey-headed T. chrysostoma; 15 light-mantled Phoebetria palpebrata; and 12 wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans tracked in 1994-2009. Overlap among the 4 species was greatest close to the island during the breeding season, extending north into the Tasman Sea. Nevertheless, black-browed albatrosses ranged more locally than the other species, perhaps because they have a shorter breeding cycle and morphological traits that result in less efficient flight and greater capacity to outcompete other species for prey. Nonbreeding albatrosses showed high variability in habitat use across wide ocean expanses, but all used productive frontal regions and mesoscale eddies. Increased residence times during the breeding and nonbreeding periods were associated with moderate wind speeds for all species (excluding breeding black-browed albatrosses), indicating that birds used areas where aerodynamic performance was enhanced. Given patterns in residence time at sea, and the functional and life history adaptations of each species, we suggest that black-browed albatrosses breeding on Macquarie Island will be more vulnerable to expected future climate-driven changes to wind patterns in the Southern Ocean, and potential latitudinal shifts in the Subantarctic Front.

To mitigate detrimental effects of this overlap, it is critical to understand their habitat use patterns. The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in the western Gulf of Maine is a hypothesized foraging area for toothed whale species and an area of high human use, but odontocete habitat use there is poorly understood. While a large whale watch community provides a robust, long-term, opportunistic sighting data set, those data are not standardized. To overcome this limitation, we used point process models to analyze 10 yr of opportunistic sighting data. We identified spatial distribution patterns and environmental predictors for the 2 most common odontocete species in the sanctuary, Atlantic white-sided dolphins Lagenorhynchus acutus and harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena. Habitat use differed among months, and depth, slope, substrate, and salinity were the most important and consistent predictors for both species. Models identified both persistent and shifting hotspots within the sanctuary. While presence was strongly associated with several covariates, environmental predictors did not fully explain shifting hotspots. This work highlights the importance of long-term opportunistic data collection and provides new knowledge on habitat use to inform assessment and management of potential human impacts on odontocetes in a federal marine protected area.

Research on infra-specific niche variation has been focussed on intrinsic drivers. However, differential transmission of socially learned behaviours can also lead to intra-specific niche variation. In sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus, social transmission of information is thought to generate culturally distinct clans, which at times occur sympatrically. Clans have distinct dialects, foraging success rates, and movement patterns, but whether the niches of clan members are also different remains unknown. We evaluated the differences in habitat use of clans off the Galapagos Islands, using data collected over 63 encounters between 1985 and 2014. During encounters, we recorded geographic positions, determined clan identity through analysis of group vocalizations and individual associations, and used topographical and oceanographic variables as proxies of sperm whale prey distribution. We used logistic generalized additive models, fitted with generalized estimating equations to account for spatiotemporal auto-correlation, to predict clan identity as a function of the environment descriptors. Oceanographic variables marginally contributed to differentiating clans. Clan identity could be predicted almost entirely based on geographic location. This fine-scale, within-region spatial partitioning likely derives from whales preferring areas where members of their clans occur over temporal scales of a few months to a few years. By identifying differences in clan's space use, we have uncovered another level of sperm whale life that is likely influenced by their cultural nature.

The movement behaviour of natural enemies is decisive in the success of biological control: when low habitat quality hinders the diffusion of natural enemies from the border, the density of natural enemies may frequently be heterogeneous inside agricultural plots. We hypothesise that the specific relationship between habitat quality and movement behaviour may allow the improvement of biological control by means of a careful allocation of habitat qualities inside and around the plot. We used three tested individual-based movement models, with different levels of complexity ranging from simple cell-to-cell movements to complex strategies including the sinuosity of the path, boundary crossings, perceptual range, and directional persistence. We used the models to explore how the manipulation of habitat quality may allow significant improvements to the residence time of natural enemies inside the field. We suggest that existing field designs are generally inadequate to retain natural enemies. Mechanistic explanations leading to the highest and lowest residence times are used to draw specific management recommendations.

Bears habituate to the repeated exposure of a novel stimulus, unmanned aircraft systems	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Drone; cardiac biologger; habituation; stress; bears; unmanned aerial system	URSUS-AMERICANUS; AERIAL SYSTEMS; ANIMAL-WELFARE; WILDLIFE; RESPONSES; TAGS	Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS; i.e. drones') provide new opportunities for data collection in ecology, wildlife biology and conservation. Yet, several studies have documented behavioral or physiological responses to close-proximity UAS flights. We experimentally tested whether American black bears (Ursus americanus) habituate to repeated UAS exposure and whether tolerance levels persist during an extended period without UAS flights. Using implanted cardiac biologgers, we measured heart rate (HR) of five captive bears before and after the first of five flights each day. Spikes in HR, a measure of stress, diminished across the five flights within each day and over the course of 4 weeks of twice-weekly exposure. We halted flights for 118 days, and when we resumed, HR responses were similar to that at the end of the previous trials. Our findings highlight the capacity of a large mammal to become and remain habituated to a novel anthropogenic stimulus in a relatively short time (3-4 weeks). However, such habituation to mechanical noises may reduce their wariness of other human threats. Also, whereas cardiac effects diminished, frequent UAS disturbances may have other chronic physiological effects that were not measured. We caution that the rate of habituation may differ between wild and captive animals: while the captive bears displayed large initial spikes in HR change (albeit not as large as wild bears), these animals were accustomed to regular exposure to humans and mechanical noises that may have hastened habituation to the UAS.

Consensus Modeling of Median Chemical Intake for the US Population Based on Predictions of Exposure Pathways	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							IN-VITRO BIOACTIVITY; RISK-ASSESSMENT; NEAR-FIELD; ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS; BIOMONITORING DATA; INTAKE FRACTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; TOXICITY; PRIORITIZATION; SCIENCE	Prioritizing the potential risk posed to human health by chemicals requires tools that can estimate exposure from limited information. In this study, chemical structure and physicochemical properties were used to predict the probability that a chemical might be associated with any of four exposure pathways leading from sources consumer (near-field), dietary, far-field industrial, and far-field pesticide to the general population. The balanced accuracies of these source-based exposure pathway models range from 73 to 81%, with the error rate for identifying positive chemicals ranging from 17 to 36%. We then used exposure pathways to organize predictions from 13 different exposure models as well as other predictors of human intake rates. We created a consensus, meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework in which the predictors of exposure were combined by pathway and weighted according to predictive ability for chemical intake rates inferred from human biomonitoring data for 114 chemicals. The consensus model yields an R-2 of similar to 0.8. We extrapolate to predict relevant pathway(s), median intake rate, and credible interval for 479 926 chemicals, mostly with minimal exposure information. This approach identifies 1880 chemicals for which the median population intake rates may exceed 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day, while there is 95% confidence that the median intake rate is below 1 mu g/kg BW/day for 474572 compounds.

Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge about the effect of confounding factors can lead to data misinterpretation and false diagnoses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of three confounding factors (season, sex and body size) on three-spined stickleback innate immunomarkers in laboratory conditions. Results shown strong seasonal variations in stickleback innate immunomarkers, with higher immune capacities in late winter-early spring and a disturbance during the spawning period in late spring-summer. Sex and body size had a season dependant effect on almost all tested immunomarkers. Reference ranges were established in laboratory-controlled conditions (i.e. laboratory reference ranges) and compared with data obtained from in vivo chemical expositions. The predictive power of the statistical model depended on the immunomarker, but the control data of the in vivo experiments, realized in same laboratory conditions, were globally well include in the laboratory reference ranges. Moreover, some statistical effects of the in vivo exposures were correlated with an augmentation of values outside the reference ranges, indicating a possible harmful effect for the organisms. As confounding factors influence is a major limit to integrate immunomarkers in biomonitoring programs, modelling their influence on studied parameter may help to better evaluated environmental contaminations.

Nevertheless, information on pollution of elements in water and sediments in this river is scarcely documented. There is also no information available on the impact of elemental pollution from the aquatic environmental compartments on biota. To fill these gaps, in this study, water, sediment and fish samples were collected from four sampling sites along the Evrotas River under variable flow regimes (July 2015, higher discharge; June 2016, low discharge and September 2016, minimum discharge). Total and dissolved element concentrations in water samples, total and acetic acid extractable contents in sediments, and element concentrations in fish samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and significant relationships between samples were established using correlation analysis. The concentrations of PTE (Ni, Cr, Cd, As, Pb, Zn and Cu) in water were generally low, while elevated Ni and Cr contents were found in sediments (up to 150 and 300 mg/kg, respectively), with total Cr concentration in water and sediment being positively correlated. The ecological risk posed by the simultaneous presence of PTE in sediments evaluated by calculating the Probable Effect Concentration Coefficient (PEC-Q), demonstrated that PEC-Qs, which were above the critical value of 0.34, derived mostly from Cr and Ni inputs. Since their mobile sediment fraction was extremely low, Cr and Ni origin is most probably geogenic. The analysis of elements in the target fish species, the Evrotas chub, showed low to moderate PTE concentrations, with Pb being positively correlated with total Pb concentration in water. Moderate Zn concentrations found in fish samples from the Evrotas are possibly derived from pesticides and fertilizers. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Among these pharmaceuticals, antihistamines are commonly found, and these substances have the potential to influence the physiology of aquatic invertebrates. Previous studies have focused on how antihistamines may affect behaviours of aquatic invertebrates, but these studies probably do not capture the full consequences of antihistamine exposure, as traditional recording techniques do not capture important animal movements occurring at the scale of milliseconds, such as prey escape responses. In this study, we investigated if antihistamine exposure can impact escape responses in aquatic insect, by exposing damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) larvae to two environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1 and 1 mu g L-1) of diphenhydramine. Importantly, we used a highspeed imaging approach that with high-time resolution captures details of escape responses and, thus, potential impacts of diphenhydramine on these behaviours. Our results show overall weak effects of antihistamine exposure on the escape behaviours of damselfly larvae. However, at stage 2 of the C-escape response, we found a significant increase in turning angle, which corresponds to a reduced swimming velocity, indicating a reduced success at evading a predator attack. Thus, we show that low concentrations of an antihistamine may affect behaviours strongly related to fitness of aquatic insect prey - effects that would have been overlooked using traditional recording techniques. Hence, to understand the full consequences of pharmaceutical contamination on aquatic wildlife, high-speed imaging should be incorporated into future environmental risk assessments.

These protected areas range across multiple biogeographic regions, and they include a diversity of species assemblages along with a diversity of managing organizations, altogether making difficult to pool relevant sites to facilitate the flow of knowledge significant to their management. Here we introduce an approach to navigating protected area networks that has the potential to foster systematic identification of key sites for facilitating the exchange of knowledge and diffusion of information within the network. To demonstrate our approach, we abstractly represented Romanian Natura 2000 network as a co-occurrence network, with individual sites as nodes and shared species as edges, further combining into our analysis network topology, community detection, and network reduction methods. We identified most representative Natura 2000 sites that may increase the transfer of information within the national network of protected areas, detected clusters of sites and key sites for maintaining network cohesiveness, and highlighted the subsample of sites that retain the characteristics of the entire network. Our analysis provides implications for protected area prioritization by proposing a network perspective approach to collaboration rooted in ecological principles.

The drivers of the isotopic composition of water vapor at these temporal scales is a key topic of discussion. The aim of this paper is to decouple mesoscale from synoptic processes that affect the water vapor isotopic composition over a coastal lagoon and to quantify the vertical mixing and sea breeze contributions to the daily water vapor cycle. We monitored the water vapor isotopic composition at the beginning of the 2017 spring season for 21 days, at the inland boundary of the Venetian Lagoon (Italy) with a commercially available cavity ring-down spectroscopy analyzer. Mean atmospheric pressure fields and back trajectories are used to investigate the long-range transport of water vapor to the study area. Moisture source areas and d-excess correlation maps show that the control on the d-excess parameter is dominated by the mesoscale contribution. The daily cycle of water vapor is studied in detail, showing that the intrusion of air from the free atmosphere represents the main process that occurs in the morning. Under those circumstances, the morning variability of the water vapor isotopic composition can be used as a proxy for the Planetary Boundary Layer height. The study period was characterized by a constant development of the sea breeze circulation that conserved the marine signature of water vapor until the afternoon. However, the water vapor isotopic signal tends to stabilize when atmospheric conditions such as high relative humidity and a weak gradient in the atmospheric pressure field occur, leading to the establishment of an isotopic equilibrium between the atmospheric water vapor and surface waters.

Radon-based estimates of equivalent mixing layer heights: A long-term assessment	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Radon decay products; Radioactive tracer; Equivalent mixing layer height; Box model	STABLE BOUNDARY-LAYER; ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY; APPLIED-MODEL; MIXED-LAYER; URBAN AREA; AIR; DISPERSION; PROGENY; MILAN; INVENTORY	Air pollution events at urban locations are driven by both emissions and atmospheric dispersion conditions. Atmospheric dispersion is not routinely assessed at monitoring networks thus preventing the possibility of understanding if high pollution events are due to increasing emissions or to the occurrence of atmospheric stability conditions. In principle, this piece of information would be very useful to implement effective strategies for pollution abatement. In this work, an 18-year long dataset of radon (Rn-222) progeny measurements was used to estimate equivalent mixing layer heights (hereafter referred to as MH) with hourly resolution by means of a box model. Mean MH obtained by more conventional modelling approaches based on turbulence variables on a 5 year long dataset agreed very well with results obtained by the box model. It is noteworthy that in the literature there are scarce MH data for such long periods and comparisons between estimates by radioactive tracers and other approaches are often limited to a few days/weeks. Results suggested that relatively simple methods like the one here proposed could be implemented at pollution monitoring stations in order to improve available information and better understand the evolution of pollution events on 1-h timescale. In addition, the long-term assessment here presented provides useful data to pursue MH climatological studies.	[Vecchi, R.; Piziali, F.

However, their responses to management change in less productive and less fertilized mountain grasslands are largely unknown. We studied eight mountain grasslands, positioned along gradients of management intensity in Austria, the UK, and France, which differed in their historical management trajectories. We measured the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) as well as nitrite-reducing bacteria using specific marker genes. We found that management affected the abundance of these microbial groups along each transect, though the specific responses differed between sites, due to different management histories and resulting variations in environmental parameters. In Austria, cessation of management caused an increase in nirK and nirS gene abundances. In the UK, intensification of grassland management led to 10-fold increases in the abundances of AOA and AOB and doubling of nirK gene abundance. In France, ploughing of previously mown grassland caused a 20-fold increase in AOA abundance. Across sites the abundance of AOB was most strongly related to soil NO3--N availability, and AOA were favored by higher soil pH. Among the nitrite reducers, nirS abundance correlatedwas most strongly with N parameters, such as soil NO3--N, microbial N. leachate NH4+-N, while the abundance of nirK-denitrifiers was affected by soil total N, organic matter (SOM) and water content. We conclude that alteration of soil environmental conditions is the dominant mechanism by which land management practices influence the abundance of each group of ammonia oxidizers and nitrite reducers.

The simulated wet deposition and its trends for two 11-year periods (1990-2000 and 2000-2010) were evaluated using data from observations from the EMEP European monitoring network. For annual wet deposition of oxidised nitrogen (WNOx), model bias was within 30% of the average of the observations for most models. There was a tendency for most models to underestimate annual wet deposition of reduced nitrogen (WNHx), although the model bias was within 40% of the average of the observations. Model bias for WNHx was inversely correlated with model bias for atmospheric concentrations of NH3 + NH4+ 4, suggesting that an underestimation of wet deposition partially contributed to an overestimation of atmospheric concentrations. Model bias was also within about 40% of the average of the observations for the annual wet deposition of sulfur (WSOx) for most models. Decreasing trends in WNOx were observed at most sites for both 11-year periods, with larger trends, on average, for the second period. The models also estimated predominantly decreasing trends at the monitoring sites and all but one of the models estimated larger trends, on average, for the second period. Decreasing trends were also observed at most sites for WNHx, although larger trends, on average, were observed for the first period. This pattern was not reproduced by the models, which estimated smaller decreasing trends, on average, than those observed or even small increasing trends. The largest observed trends were for WSOx, with decreasing trends at more than 80% of the sites. On average, the observed trends were larger for the first period. All models were able to reproduce this pattern, although some models underestimated the trends (by up to a factor of 4) and others overestimated them (by up to 40 %), on average. These biases in modelled trends were directly related to the tendency of the models to under-or overestimate annual wet deposition and were smaller for the relative trends (expressed as % yr(-1) relative to the deposition at the start of the period). The fact that model biases were fairly constant throughout the time series makes it possible to improve the predictions of wet deposition for future scenarios by adjusting the model estimates using a bias correction calculated from past observations. An analysis of the contributions of various factors to the modelled trends suggests that the predominantly decreasing trends in wet deposition are mostly due to reductions in emissions of the precursors NOx, NH3 and SOx. However, changes in meteorology (e.g. precipitation) and other (non-linear) interactions partially offset the decreasing trends due to emission reductions during the first period but not the second. This suggests that the emission reduction measures had a relatively larger effect on wet deposition during the second period, at least for the sites with observations.

The amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here, we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL. Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners' coordinated management decisions within a landscape context.

However, compared with bacteria and fungi, the impacts of increasing aridity on archaea in these ecosystems remain largely unknown. Here, soil samples were collected along a typical aridity gradient in semi-arid regions in Inner Mongolia, China, to investigate whether and how the increasing aridity affects archaeal communities. The results showed that archaeal richness linearly decreased with increasing aridity. After partialling out the effects of soil properties based on partial least squares regression, the significant aridity-richness relationship vanished. The composition of archaeal communities was distributed according to the aridity gradient. These variations were largely driven by the changes in the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota and unclassified phyla. Niche-based processes were predominant in structuring the observed archaeal aridity-related pattern. The structural equation models further showed that aridity indirectly reduced archaeal richness through improving soil electrical conductivity (EC) and structured community composition by changing soil total nitrogen (TN). These results suggested that soil salinization and N-losses might be important mechanisms underlying the increasing aridity-induced alterations in archaeal communities, and highlighted the importance of soil niches in mediating the indirect impacts of increasing aridity on archaea.

As a species' response to global change is likely to be largely determined by its physiological performance, subsequent changes in environmental conditions can profoundly influence populations at range edges, resulting in range extensions or retractions. To understand the differential physiological performance among populations at their distribution range edge and center, we measured levels of mRNA for heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) as an indicator of temperature sensitivity in two high-shore littorinid snails, Echinolittorina malaccana and E. radiata, between 1 degrees N to 36 degrees N along the NW Pacific coast. These Echinolittorina snails are extremely heat-tolerant and frequently experience environmental temperatures in excess of 55 degrees C when emersed. It was assumed that animals exhibiting high temperature sensitivity will synthesize higher levels of mRNA, which will thus lead to higher energetic costs for thermal defense. Populations showed significant geographic variation in temperature sensitivity along their range. Snails at the northern range edge of E. malaccana and southern range edge of E. radiata exhibited higher levels of hsp70 expression than individuals collected from populations at the center of their respective ranges. The high levels of hsp70 mRNA in populations at the edge of a species' distribution range may serve as an adaptive response to locally stressful thermal environments, suggesting populations at the edge of their distribution range are potentially more sensitive to future global warming.

Decadal post-fire succession of soil invertebrate communities is dependent on the soil surface properties in a northern temperate forest	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Multi-taxa; Disturbance; Recovery; Burn plots; Soil cover; Fire chronosequence	BOREAL FOREST; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; FIRE-SEVERITY; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES; ANT COMMUNITIES; CONIFER FORESTS; RECOVERY; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; ASSEMBLAGES	Although fires are common disturbances in North American forests, the extent to which soil invertebrate assemblages recover from burning remains unclear. Here, we examine long-term (14- to 101-yr) recoveries of soil invertebrate communities from common cut and burn treatments conducted at 6 to 26-yr intervals since 1911 in a deciduous forest in the upper Great Lakes region (USA). We characterize soil surface macro-invertebrate communities during both fall and spring across a long-term, experimental fire chronosequence to characterize invertebrate community recovery at decadal time-scales and community changes between seasons. We posited that changes in invertebrate community structure might, in turn, impact decomposition process. We sampled active organisms at the soil surface using pitfall traps. We described understory vegetation, measured soil properties, and conducted a 4-year litter bag study with big-toothed aspen leaves (Populus grandidentata). Invertebrate community responses followed a habitat accommodation model of succession showing that invertebrate succession is dependent on the soil surface properties. The fall and spring measures revealed that the densities of active invertebrates were highest 101 years after fire. For a given pair of stands, a pattern of sharing higher percentage of taxa was denoted when stands were of similar age. Some species such as the beetle Stelidota octomaculata appeared to be indicator of the chronosequence succession stage because it tracks the successional increase of Quercus and acorn production at the study site. We also found a significant positive correlation between leaf decomposition of soil macrofaunal accessible leaves and millipedes density across the chronosequence. We show that vegetation cover changes and related shifts in habitat structure occurring during post-fire succession are important in shaping communities assemblages. This finding highlights the importance of simultaneously considering abiotic-biotic factors together with above- and belowground measurements to better characterize controls on successional community dynamics after disturbance.

Source and fate of nitrate in contaminated groundwater systems: Assessing spatial and temporal variations by hydrogeochemistry and multiple stable isotope tools	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nitrate contamination; Boron isotopes; Nitrogen isotopes; Sulfur isotopes; Mediterranean environment	BORON ISOTOPES; SHALLOW GROUNDWATER; NATURAL ATTENUATION; TRACING SOURCES; RIVER-BASIN; WATER; DENITRIFICATION; NITROGEN; AQUIFER; SARDINIA	Intensive farming usually imply a degradation of groundwater resources worldwide. In particular, nitrate concentrations exceeding the 50 mg L-1 limit established for drinking water pose the human health at risk. Therefore, assessing the impact of farming on groundwater, in terms of space and time, is of fundamental importance for policy decision makers and land managers. This study was aimed at assessing the nitrate source and fate in groundwater by combining hydrogeochemical and isotopic tools. The study area is located in the coastal plain of Arborea (Italy), a nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ) due to intensive farming and animal husbandry (28,000 bovine livestock units). This area represents Mediterranean environments where groundwater resources are of relevant importance. In order to assess the present level of groundwater contamination and evaluate temporal variations, 6 hydrogeochemical surveys were carried out bimonthly at 13 sampling sites located in an area of 6 km(2). Additional samples were collected in specific surveys (82 water samples in total). The physical-chemical parameters, nitrogen species concentrations, major and minor components were determined, together with the boron, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur isotopic delta values. Results showed that groundwater samples were of meteoric origin, as indicated by the delta H-2 and delta O-18(H2O) values. The groundwater showed near-neutral pH (6.8-7.9) and different values of redox potential (0.2 divided by 0.5 V), dissolved oxygen (2 divided by 6 mg L-1), electrical conductivity (0.8 divided by 2.1 mS cm(-1)) and chemical composition (sodium-chloride divided by calcium-bicarbonate). Nitrate was not homogeneously distributed in groundwater, being observed a large range of concentrations, from <1 up to 162 mg L-1. The above differences reflected the variability of groundwater circulation at small scale, which in turn controlled the interaction of water with different sediments (sands and/or clays). The shallow wells (about 5 m depth), screened in groundwater interacting mainly with sands, showed marked variations under the monitoring period, with nitrate peaks reflecting high leaching of nitrate in correspondence of fertilization and irrigation periods. The deeper wells (15-37 m depth) showed high to moderate nitrate when screened in sandy aquifer, whereas they had very low nitrate and relatively high ammonium (up to 1.8 mg L-1) when clay layers were intercepted. Trends of delta N-15 and delta O-18(NO3) values in the nitrate of shallow groundwater were related to the nitrate concentration observed over the monitored period. This dual isotope systematic showed a likely source of nitrate in groundwater from either manure or sewage. The delta B-11 signature coupled to delta N-15 values clearly identified the manure as the predominant source of nitrate in the shallow and deep groundwater at Arborea. Relative enrichments in heavy nitrogen coupled to high concentrations of nitrate in groundwater were mainly attributed to volatilization processes occurring during the storage of animal wastes prior to application on the soil. Mixing of groundwater with seawater was not recognized, whereas mixing between shallow and deep groundwater may have occurred locally. Natural attenuation of nitrate contamination was observed in the deep groundwater interacting with lagoon clays rich in organic matter. Heterotrophic denitrification processes were highlighted by relatively high delta N-15, delta O-18(NO3), delta S-34 and delta O-18(SO4) values in association with low SO42-/Cl- and high HCO3-/SO42- molar ratios observed in the groundwater with low concentration of nitrate. Results of this study showed that site-specific investigations are required for designing the best practices aimed at preserving groundwater resources under Mediterranean conditions. The spreading of animal waste on soils affects groundwater systems and likely extends over long time, strongly depending on the time lag of nutrient transport from source areas to receptor wells. Therefore, adequate monitoring of groundwater quality is required in areas of intensive farming. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we profiled the microbial communities in the hyporheic sediments of a watershed undergoing intensive anthropogenic activities via next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA V4-V5 hypervariable regions on Illumina MiSeq platform. Tidal impacts on microbial communities were investigated via co-occurrence networks. In addition, the influences of physicochemical variables including salinity, and the concentrations of nutrients, organic matter and heavy metals on the microbial communities were explored via canonical correspondence analyses. The sediment samples were collected from 19 sites covering the whole main river stem of the target watershed (n = 19; Maozhou river watershed, Shenzhen, China). The samples were subdivided in the field for microbiological analyses and measurements of physicochemical variables. The results indicated that core microbiome was associated with archaea methanogens and bacteria members from Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Synergistetes and Firmicutes, among which, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria genera contributing to the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur were predominant. Site-specific microbiomes were revealed that may serve as indicators of local environmental conditions (e.g., members affiliated to Oceanospirillales were abundant at sites with salt intrusion). Distinct microbial co-occurrence networks were identified for non-tidal, inter-tidal and tidal sites. Major environmental factors influencing microbial community composition included the concentrations of nitrate and bicarbonate in river water, pore water concentrations of sulfate, dissolved organic carbon and electrical conductivity, as well as manganese concentrations associated with the solid sediment. Collectively, the results of this study provide fundamental insights into the influence of environmental perturbations on microbial community composition in a lotic system, which may aid in the design of effective remediation and/or restoration strategies in the target watershed and beyond.

However, the effects of flow intermittency (resulting from both seasonal variations and rising hydrological pressure) and pollution on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning have been overlooked in these ecosystems. We explore the way multiple stressors affect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) relationship in a Mediterranean temporary river. We measured diversity of benthic communities (i.e. diatoms and macroinvertebrates) and related ecosystem processes (i.e. resource use efficiency-RUE and organic matter breakdown-OMB) across a pollution and flow intermittency gradient. Our results showed decreases in macroinvertebrate diversity and the opposite trend in diatom assemblages, whereas ecosystem functioning was negatively affected by both pollution and flow intermittency. The explored B-EF relationships showed contrasting results: RUE decreased with higher diatom diversity, whereas OMB increased with increased macroinvertebrate diversity. The different responses suggest contrasting operating mechanisms, selection effects possibly driving the B-EF relationship in diatoms and complementarity effects driving the B-EF relationship in macroinvertebrates. The understanding of multiple stressor effects on diversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as the B-EF relationship in temporary rivers could provide insights on the risks affecting ecosystem functioning under global change.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is vulnerable to changes in land use and climate. For a better understanding of the SOC dynamics and its driving factors, we collected data of the 1980s and 2000s in the North and Northeast China and conducted the digital soil mapping for spatial variation of SOC for the respective period. In the 1980s, 585 soils were sampled and the area was resampled in 2003 and 2004 (1062 samples) in a 30-km grid. The main land use in the area was cropland, forest and grassland. The random forest was used to predict the SOC concentration and its temporal change using land use, terrain factors, vegetation index, vis-NIR spectra and climate factors as predictors. The average SOC concentration in 1985 was 10.0 g kg(-1) compared to 12.5 g kg(-1) in 2004. The SOC variation was similar over the two periods, and levels increased from south to north. The estimated SOC stock was 1.68 Pg in 1985 and 1.66 Pg in 2004, but the SOC changes were different under different land uses. Over the twenty-year period, average temperatures increased and large areas of forests and grassland were converted to cropland. SOC under cropland was increased by 0.094 Pg (+9%) whereas 0.089 Pg SOC was lost under forests (-25%) and 0.037 Pg in the soils under grassland (-25%). It is concluded that land use is the main drivers for SOC changes in this area while climate change had different contributions in different regions. SOC loss was remarkable under the land use conversion while cropland has considerable potential to sequester SOC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the toxicological effects of these effluents on the soil's organisms, especially earthworms, have not been well studied as yet. In this paper, earthworms Eisenia andrei were exposed for 7 days and 14 days to five agricultural soils irrigated with TWW for different periods: 1 year, 8 years, and 20 years. In addition, they were also exposed to soil from one reference site sampled from the Ouardenin perimeter in the Monastir Governorate in Tunisia. The effect on earthworms was assessed at the biochemical level by evaluating for catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde accumulation (MDA) and acetylcholinesterase inhibition (AChE). On the other hand, genotoxicity and transcriptomic responses were evaluated using micronuclei test (MNT) and gene expression level of CAT and GST. Moreover, metals uptake by earthworms was analyzed. Results showed that CAT and GST activity in the earthworm increased significantly when they were exposed to soils irrigated with TWW for 1, 8 and 20 years. Furthermore, MDA concentration also increased significantly with the increase in exposure period. However, AChE activity decreased and MNi frequency increased in earthworms after 7 and 14 days of exposure to soils irrigated with TWW for more than a year. The gene expression level of CAT and GST showed a significant variability, thus data are discussed in relation to the studied biomarkers (CAT and GST). These data provide new insights into the effect of toxicity of TWW on the soil's macro fauna, which is strongly affected by the trace elements and other organic compounds accumulated in soils after 20 years of TWW irrigation.

Contributions of throughfall, forest and soil characteristics to near-surface soil water-content variability at the plot scale in a mountainous Mediterranean area	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Rainfall partitioning; Soil moisture; Soil water repellence; Forest hydrology	SPATIAL VARIABILITY; RAINFALL INTERCEPTION; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; TEMPORAL STABILITY; MOISTURE; PATTERNS; STEMFLOW; STORAGE; REPELLENCY; VEGETATION	Soil water-content (SWC) variability in forest ecosystems is affected by complex interactions between climate, topography, forest structure and soil factors. However, detailed studies taking into account the combined effects of these factors are scarce. This study's main aims were to examine the control that throughfall exerts on local spatial variation of near-surface soil water-content and to combine this information with forest structure and soil characteristics, in order to analyze all their effects together. Two stands located in the Vallcebre Research Catchments (NE Spain) were studied: one dominated by Quercus pubescens and the other by Pinus sylvestris. Throughfall and the related shallow SWC were monitored in each plot in 20 selected locations. The main characteristics of the nearest tree and soil parameters were also measured. The results indicated that mean SWC increment at the rainfall event scale showed a strong linear relationship with mean throughfall amount in both forest plots. The % of locations with SWC increments increased in a similar way to throughfall amount in both forest plots. The analyses considering all the effects together indicated again that throughfall had a significant positive effect in both forest plots, while soil litter depth showed a significant negative effect for the oak plot but lower statistical significance for the pine plot, showing a comparable -although more erratic- influence of the organic forest floor for this plot. These results, together with lower responses of SWC to throughfall than expected in rainfall events characterized by low preceding soil water-condition and high rainfall intensity, suggest that litter layer is playing an important role in controlling the soil water-content dynamics. The biometric characteristics of the nearest trees showed significant but very weak relationships with soil water-content increment, suggesting that stemflow and throughfall may act at lower distances from tree trunk than those presented in our study.

The predictive uncertainty has been often assessed in terrestrial ecosystems, but it is still unknown how freshwater variables affect the performance of ENMs, contributing to unreliable predictions for aquatic species. Here, we used the ecologically and economically relevant Amazon giant catfish (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum) as a model species to assess uncertainties on ENM predictions in freshwater ecosystems. Specifically, we assessed uncertainty by coupling ENM predictions using five modeling methods and four sets of freshwater environmental variables. Our results indicate that the modeling methods and secondarily the variables account for significant uncertainty in predicting freshwater species distribution using ENM. Areas with high environmental suitability such as the Amazon large rivers and nearby areas presented high uncertainty for the methods component, and lower uncertainties for freshwater variables. Moreover, freshwater variables accounted also for uncertainties in metrics of models' performance. Whereas Topographic variables better predicted presences (higher sensitivities and lower omission errors), Land cover and Soil variables better predicted pseudo-absences (higher specificities and lower commission errors). The Hydroclimatic variables had better accuracy metrics values (AUC and TSS) but also generated the greatest uncertainty for the final models. When included variables from all groups, ENMs presented low uncertainties and good accuracy. In sum, our findings suggest the importance of measuring and mapping the uncertainties of ENMs using freshwater environmental database.

The representation of how chemical species are mixed inside the particles (the mixing state) is one of the major uncertainty factors in the assessment of these effects. Here we compare aerosol optical properties simulations over Europe and North America, coordinated in the framework of the third phase of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII), to 1 year of AERONET sunphotometer retrievals, in an attempt to identify a mixing state representation that better reproduces the observed single scattering albedo and its spectral variation. We use a single post-processing tool (FlexAOD) to derive aerosol optical properties from simulated aerosol speciation profiles, and focus on the absorption enhancement of black carbon when it is internally mixed with more scattering material, discarding from the analysis scenes dominated by dust. We found that the single scattering albedo at 440nm (omega(0,440)) is on average overestimated (underestimated) by 3-5% when external (core-shell internal) mixing of particles is assumed, a bias comparable in magnitude with the typical variability of the quantity. The (unphysical) homogeneous internal mixing assumption underestimates omega(0,440) by 14%. The combination of external and core-shell configurations (partial internal mixing), parameterized using a simplified function of air mass aging, reduces the omega(0,440) bias to-1/-3%. The black carbon absorption enhancement (E-abs) in core-shell with respect to the externally mixed state is in the range 1.8-2.5, which is above the currently most accepted upper limit of 1.5. The partial internal mixing reduces E-abs to values more consistent with this limit. However, the spectral dependence of the absorption is not well reproduced, and the absorption Angstrom exponent AAE(675)(440) is overestimated by 70-120%. Further testing against more comprehensive campaign data, including a full characterization of the aerosol profile in terms of chemical speciation, mixing state, and related optical properties, would help in putting a better constraint on these calculations.

Three factors challenge quantification of these pollutant fluxes using traditional sampling methods: (i) concentration fluctuations; (ii) unknown event duration; and (iii) placement, operation, and maintenance of equipment. Passive samplers offer the advantage of sampling in a continuous mode without power supply. However, variable uptake rates due to environmental factors and desorption in the case of fluctuating concentrations can affect the accuracy of time-weighted average (TWA) concentration estimates. While uncertainties related to environmental factors could be accounted for with additional effort, we can neither control nor quantify the concentration variability. We present measured and modelled concentration profiles at high temporal resolution and provide a systematic approach to assessing deviations from true TWA concentration due to fluctuating concentration profiles. We evaluate sampling of sewer overflows (0.3-14 h) with Chemcatcher and 1-week sampling in rivers. The uncertainty due to fluctuating concentrations is small, and other factors such as chemical analyses and sampler calibration have a similar or higher impact. The uncertainty due to fluctuations clearly increases with the sampling duration, particularly when exceeding the half-life of equilibrium. We conclude that passive sampling can also be used in wastewater systems with potentially high concentration variations.

Few large-scale measurement studies have been conducted to confirm a baseline. This study used a vehicle-based gas monitoring system to measure fugitive and vented gas emissions across Lloydminster (heavy oil), Peace River (heavy oil/bitumen), and Medicine Hat (conventional gas) developments in Alberta, Canada. Four gases (CO2, CH4, H2S, C2H6), and isotopic delta C-13(CH4) were recorded in real-time at 1 Hz over a six-week field campaign. We sampled 1,299 well pads, containing 2,670 unique wells and facilities, in triplicate. Geochemical emission signatures of fossil fuel-sourced plumes were identified and attributed to nearby, upwind oil and gas well pads, and a point-source gaussian plume dispersion model was used to quantify emissions rates. Our analysis focused exclusively on well pads where emissions were detected >50% of the time when sampled downwind. Emission occurrences and rates were highest in Lloydminster, where 40.8% of sampled well pads were estimated to be emitting methane-rich gas above our minimum detection limits (m = 9.73 m(3)d(-1)). Of the well pads we found to be persistently emitting in Lloydminster, an estimated 40.2% (95% CI: 32.2%-49.4%) emitted above the venting threshold in which emissions mitigation under federal regulations would be required. As a result of measured emissions being larger than those reported in government inventories, this study suggests government estimates of infrastructure affected by incoming regulations may be conservative. Comparing emission intensities with available Canadian-based research suggests good general agreement between studies, regardless of the measurement methodology used for detection and quantification. This study also demonstrates the effectiveness in applying a gaussian dispersion model to continuous mobile-sourced emissions data as a first-order leak detection and repair screening methodology for meeting regulatory compliance.

To evaluate benthic community vulnerability when exposed to seawater warming, bottom trawling, and predation from a new predator, we used a trait-based approach and applied this to an extensive dataset of >450 megabenthic taxa, from a 1.5 million km 2 area. Taxon rank values were obtained after sorting the taxa by temperature median and temperature range, i.e. the temperature sensitivity trait, and by body height, mean weight, and mobility, i.e. the trawl vulnerability trait, and were given as a size-based prey classification, i.e. the predation trait. The taxon rank values were then used to calculate the mean community sensitivity. Our study showed a recent significant increase in community mean temperature ranks, indicating an increased importance of species with affinity for warmer waters and a reduced importance of coldwater species. Commercial fish stocks and snow crabs are expanding into the western part of the Barents Sea, thereby simultaneously increasing the exposure of large immobile species to trawling and of small prey species to crab predation. Overall, we found a high level of vulnerability to the 3 investigated stressors in the northwestern Barents Sea, which may lead to alterations in community structure and diversity. Mapping vulnerability to multiple stressors enables authorities managing human activities to identify vulnerable areas that warrant special measures, including protection from trawling and reduction of the snow crab stock.

In the early 2000s, management actions have been implemented to reduce nutrient inputs with the aim to achieve a good ecological status as requested by the EU water framework directive. As a result of these actions, a sharp decline in nutrient loads has been recorded in several lagoons leading to an oligotrophication of the water column. The analyses of a long-term data set (1998-2015) of 21 polyhaline and euhaline lagoons with contrasting trophic status allowed us to infer a general scheme for the changes in macrophyte assemblages during the oligotrophication process. Placing hypertrophic and oligotrophic conditions end to end, we inferred that the general pattern for the re-oligotrophication trajectory in Mediterranean coastal lagoons is described by the following sequence, with regime shifts between each state: (1) bare non-vegetated sediments, phytoplankton-dominated state; (2) opportunistic macroalgae; (3) seagrass and perennial macroalgae dominated state. However, we did not observe the latter regime shift for the most eutrophicated lagoons, which, so far, remained stuck in the opportunistic macroalgae state. So far, the shift from dominance of opportunistic macroalgae to a system dominated by seagrasses was only observed in a single lagoon where seagrasses had never completely disappeared, which possibly relates to resilience. More generally, the conditions favoring regime shifts from opportunistic macroalgae to seagrasses are still poorly understood. In conclusion, we describe a generic pattern for re-oligotrophication of Mediterranean coastal lagoons, although a full recovery from highly eutrophied to oligotrophic conditions may require more than a decade and may include conditions that remain so far poorly recognized.

Considering the existing limitations for processing numerous and complex data series generated from automated systems, and because of processes involved in phytoplankton blooms, this paper proposes a data-driven evaluation of an unsupervised classifier to optimize the way we track phytoplankton, including harmful algal blooms (HABs), and to identify the main associated hydrological conditions. We used in situ data from a portable flow-through automatic measuring system coupled with a multi-fixed-wavelength fluorometer implemented in the eastern English Channel during a bloom of Phaeocystis globosa (high biomass, non-toxic HAB species). This combination of technologies allowed high resolution online hydrographical and biological measurements, including spectral fluorescence as a means of quantifying phytoplankton biomass and simplifying the phytoplankton community structure inference. An unsupervised spectral clustering method was applied to this multi-parameter high-resolution time series, which allowed discrimination under near real-time of 6 to 33 contrasting water masses based on their abiotic and biotic characteristics. In addition, areas subject to extreme events such as HABs could be precisely identified, so controlling factors or their direct and indirect effects could be hierarchized. Considering the benefits and limitations of such a strategy, future applications of such methods will be important in the context of implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

Seasonal changes in bacteria and phytoplankton biomass control the condition index of the demosponge Halichondria panicea in temperate Danish waters	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Porifera; Clearance rate; Free-living bacteria; Chlorophyll a; Starvation; Growth; Choanocyte chambers	MUSSELS MYTILUS-EDULIS; KIEL BIGHT; MARINE-BACTERIA; SPONGE; GROWTH; FILTRATION; CARBON; RATES; ECOPHYSIOLOGY; DYNAMICS	Sponges are sessile filter-feeders, and the basic principles for water pumping and particle retention are the same among all demosponges. Phytoplankton cells smaller than the inhalant openings (ostia) are retained and phagocytosed in the inhalant canal system before the water is sieved through the collar filter of the choanocytes, which efficiently retain bacteria. However, the importance of bacteria versus phytoplankton as the main diet is unclear. Sponges must cope with seasonal changes in food availability in temperate waters, and during winter, low phytoplankton and bacterial biomasses may result in starvation. In this study, the lower threshold of suspended biomass resulting in starvation of the demosponge Halichondria panicea was determined. We measured the seasonal changes in phytoplankton and bacterial biomasses along with the sponge condition index (CI, the ratio of organic to inorganic matter). A low CI during winter reflected starvation, and based on total available carbon concentrations (phytoplankton plus bacterial carbon), we conclude that a concentration of ca. 30 mu g C l(-1) was not sufficient to cover the maintenance costs of H. panicea. Bacteria constitute a minor, but consistent part of the diet, around 20%. A field growth experiment revealed a positive correlation between CI and sponge weight. Measured volume-specific clearance rate of sponges, density of choanocyte chambers and inter-choanocyte chamber-distance were not significantly different in low and high CI sponges, and it remains unknown how sponges withstand long periods with low suspended food particle concentrations.

Habitat geometry influences the abundance and distribution of species through an interplay between habitat area and perimeter. However, few studies have tested the interacting effects of these distinct geometry parameters on community and ecosystem dynamics. We used experimental mussel (Mytilus spp.) beds as a model system to control and test for the effect of perimeter, area and their interaction on the diversity and abundance of macro-invertebrate species associated with mussel beds and on ecosystem functions (ammonium and oxygen fluxes). Live blue mussels were used to create artificial mussel transplants corresponding to 9 factorial combinations of area and perimeter, and both community and ecosystem effects were assessed after a 2 mo colonization period in the field. Our results showed an interacting and scale-dependent effect of area and perimeter on both community and ecosystem characteristics: area had a negative effect on taxonomic diversity of small-perimeter transplants, and perimeter had a negative effect on diversity of small-area transplants. At the ecosystem level, ammonium release increased with area in large-perimeter transplants. This study stresses the importance of integrating the explicit and interactive effects of multiple metrics of habitat shape for resolving the relationship between community dynamics and ecosystem functions in fragmented habitats.

Reconstructing sea turtle ontogenetic habitat shifts through trace element analysis of bone tissue	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Barium; Strontium; Stable nitrogen isotopes; Habitat use; Sea turtle; Migration; Bone chemistry	SKELETAL GROWTH MARKS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; OTOLITH CHEMISTRY; STOCK DISCRIMINATION; LEPIDOCHELYS-KEMPII; CARETTA-CARETTA; MINKE WHALES; STRONTIUM; MARINE; BARIUM	Trace element analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to elucidate past movement and habitat use in aquatic animals, but has been underutilized in studies of non-fish species. When applied to sequentially deposited tissues (e.g. fish otoliths, sea turtle humerus bone), the technique can be used to infer aspects of an individual's ecology through time. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether trace elements could be used to reconstruct transitions between oceanic and neritic life stages in 2 species of sea turtle. We sampled the annual humerus bone growth layers of loggerhead Caretta caretta and Kemp's ridley Lepidochelys kemph sea turtles for concentrations of 7 elements (Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ba) using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Previous studies have demonstrated that stable nitrogen isotope (delta N-15) values can be used to reconstruct ontogenetic shifts between oceanic (offshore) and neritic (nearshore) habitats in these species; therefore, bone delta N-15 data were also collected for comparison. Bone strontium to calcium (Sr:Ca) and barium to calcium (Ba:Ca) ratios were significantly higher in oceanic versus neritic life stages for both species. Changes in bone elemental ratios within individuals coincided with known changes in resource use, as indicated by delta N-15 values, and fell within the range of body sizes and ages typical for oceanic-to-neritic ontogenetic shifts in each species. We conclude that bone Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca ratios may identify oceanic versus neritic resource use in sea turtles, but that additional studies are needed to identify the specific mechanisms underpinning these differences.

Fine-scale oceanographic features characterizing successful Adelie penguin foraging in the SW Ross Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Foraging behavior; Seabird habitat; Prey depletion; Thermocline; Sea ice; Ross Sea; Adelie penguin; Pygoscelis adeliae	PHYTOPLANKTON TAXA PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHAEOCYSTIS-ANTARCTICA; PLEURAGRAMMA-ANTARCTICUM; FRAGILARIOPSIS-CYLINDRUS; REGRESSION TREES; MCMURDO SOUND; FOOD-WEB; OCEAN; ICE; PREY	According to central place foraging theory, breeding seabirds should energetically optimize prey acquisition and, therefore, foraging is expected to be located where prey are most available, within limits defined by the energetics of the species. We have shown this previously for Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, using foraging intensity as a proxy for prey patch quality, but we have yet to assess the habitat characteristics where foraging success is highest. Here, we report an effort using biologging instruments that recorded location and an index of foraging success, allowing us to characterize aspects of more or less successful foraging locations on the basis of sea-surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, sea ice cover, water column stratification, and bathymetry. We retrieved data from 162 breeding Adelie penguins over 5 austral summers, 2005-2008 and 2012, and used a machine-learning algorithm to model the relationship between the number of undulations (>1 m) penguins made (i.e. our index of foraging success) and oceanographic conditions at the fine scale (5 km). We found that most oceanographic features were not predictive of foraging success, although light availability and thermocline strength as measured at the scale of individual penguin foraging dives were both relatively strong predictors. Contrary to previous results obtained at larger scales, we showed that at the fine scale, sea ice concentration is not an important predictor of foraging success, although the associated effect of sea ice cover, i.e. a stratified water column as indicated by thermocline strength, was important. We also confirmed that penguins traveled farther to achieve the same foraging success later in the season despite consistent oceanographic features, indicating that prey become depleted as the breeding season progresses. Our findings suggest that finer spatial and temporal scale data, including from underwater, are necessary to accurately describe the environmental variables that correlate with penguin foraging success, reinforcing the promise of small, animal-borne sensors for evaluating ecosystem processes.

We combined conventional stomach content and stable isotope analysis to assess Magellanic Penguin diet during the chick rearing stage at the two northernmost colonies in an area subject to fisheries. In 2011 and 2013, Thornfish (Bovichtus argentinus) was the main prey by mass at Complejo Islote Lobos (63.0% and 32.3%, respectively) and Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) at Estancia San Lorenzo (85.2 and 63.3%, respectively). Magellanic Penguins from both colonies showed low isotopic niche overlap in 2011 (36%) and no overlap in 2013, suggesting a different use of prey species and/or foraging areas. Stable isotope mixing models showed that Argentine Anchovy (52.8%) and Thornfish (65.9%) were the main prey at Complejo Islote Lobos in 2011 and 2013, respectively, while Patagonian Redfish (Sebastes oculatus) (46.4%) and Squat Lobster (Munida gregaria) (50%) were the main prey at Estancia San Lorenzo in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Results show that in addition to Argentine Anchovy, previously recognized as main prey for breeding Magellanic Penguins in northern Patagonia, other juvenile or small sized fish are important diet items. Diet results suggest different scenarios of food conditions for each colony, despite the relative short distance between breeding locations. The low contribution of Argentine Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and Argentine Shortfin Squid (Illex argentinus) suggests a low trophic overlap with commercial fisheries. The information provided is key to understand changes in the marine ecosystem and potential penguin-fishery interactions.

The aim of this study was to predict SOCS and compare under current and potential future land uses. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density were measured at 137 locations across the Marivan, Kurdistan Province, Iran, and soil SOCS was computed. Auxiliary data including, terrain attributes and Landsat 8 ETM+ data were acquired. Random forest (RF) models were used to relate the SOCS to the auxiliary data. Results suggested that the mean SOCS in the topsoil and subsurface in croplands were lower than in forestland and wetland, although not significantly so. In the area, approximately 18.48% of forestland and 17.39% of wetland has been brought into cultivation. The authors estimate that this has led to a loss of SOCS from forestland topsoil of 22,860 Mg C, and from subsurface of 15,685 Mg C. The SOCS loss from wetland topsoil and subsurface were not as great, at 4193 and 2680 Mg C, respectively, but this was due to the area not being as large.

However, the effect on vector competence for arboviruses still remained to be investigated. We examined the influence of two insecticide resistance mechanisms on vector competence of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus for two arboviruses, Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) and West Nile virus (WNV). Three Cx. quinquefasciatus lines sharing a common genetic background were used: two insecticide-resistant lines, one homozygous for amplification of the Ester(2) locus (SA2), the other homozygous for the acetylcholinesterase ace-1 G119S mutation (SR) and the insecticide-susceptible reference line Slab. Statistical analyses revealed no significant effect of insecticide-resistant mechanisms on vector competence for RVFV. However, both insecticide resistance mechanisms significantly influenced the outcome of WNV infections by increasing the dissemination of WNV in the mosquito body, therefore leading to an increase in transmission efficiency by resistant mosquitoes. These results showed that insecticide resistance mechanisms enhanced vector competence for WNV and may have a significant impact on transmission dynamics of arboviruses. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the impacts of insecticide resistance on the vectorial capacity parameters to assess the overall consequence on transmission.

Understanding invasion spread patterns and the underlying process driving invasions are key to predicting and managing invasions. We combine a set of statistical methods in a novelway to characterize local spread properties and demonstrate their application using simulated and historical data on invasive insects. Our method uses a Gaussian process fit to the surface of waiting times to invasion in order to characterize the vector field of spread. Using this method, we estimate with statistical uncertainties the speed and direction of spread at each location. Simulations from a stratified diffusion model verify the accuracy of our method.

We examined geographical variation in timing of events throughout the year using light-level geolocator tracking data from 133 migratory tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) originating from 12 North American breeding populations. A swallow's breeding latitude influenced timing of breeding, which then carried over to affect breeding ground departure. This resulted in subsequent effects on the arrival and departure schedules at autumn stopover locations and timing of arrival at non-breeding locations. This 'domino effect' between timing events was no longer apparent by the time individuals departed for spring migration. Our range-wide analysis demonstrates the lasting impact breeding latitude can have on migration schedules but also highlights how such timing relationships can reset when individuals reside at non-breeding sites for extended periods of time.

New Caledonian crows infer the weight of objects from observing their movements in a breeze	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						object properties; observational learning; causal reasoning; motion; corvid cognition	CORVUS-MONEDULOIDES; INFORMATION; COGNITION; BEHAVIOR; TOOLS; SOLVE; ROOKS; LIFT; APES; BOX	Humans use a variety of cues to infer an object's weight, including how easily objects can be moved. For example, if we observe an object being blown down the street by the wind, we can infer that it is light. Here, we tested whether New Caledonian crows make this type of inference. After training that only one type of object (either light or heavy) was rewarded when dropped into a food dispenser, birds observed pairs of novel objects (one light and one heavy) suspended from strings in front of an electric fan. The fan was either on-creating a breeze which buffeted the light, but not the heavy, object-or off, leaving both objects stationary. In subsequent test trials, birds could drop one, or both, of the novel objects into the food dispenser. Despite having no opportunity to handle these objects prior to testing, birds touched the correct object (light or heavy) first in 73% of experimental trials, and were at chance in control trials. Our results suggest that birds used pre-existing knowledge about the behaviour exhibited by differently weighted objects in the wind to infer their weight, using this information to guide their choices.

Trade-offs direct the evolution of coloration in Galapagos land snails	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						adaptation; biogeography; crypsis; islands; predation; thermoregulation	OIL DROPLETS; CEPAEA; BIRD; CONSPICUOUSNESS; SELECTION; GENETICS; COLORS	Increasingly, multiple selective factors are recognized as jointly contributing to the evolution of morphology. What is not clear is how these forces vary across communities to promote morphological diversification among related species. In this study of Galapagos endemic snails (genus Naesiotus), we test several hypotheses of colour evolution. We observe mockingbirds (genus Mimus) predating live snails and find that avian predation selects against conspicuous shells. The evolutionary outcome of this selection is a diversity of shell colours across snails of the archipelago, each closely matching local backgrounds. We also find that snails more regularly exposed to the hot, equatorial sun reflect more light than shells of species from shadier habitats, suggesting a role for thermoregulatory constraints directing colour evolution. The signature of thermoregulatory selection is most clear in comparatively young communities (on the youngest islands), while the signature of selection from predators is most evident in older communities (on the older islands). Together, our findings point to a scenario of shifting selective forces along island ontogeny and community maturity that lead to the distribution of snail coloration we observe in Galapagos. Complex selective regimes such as these may have more responsibility for morphological diversity than is currently recognized.	[Kraemer, A.

Exploring the causes of small effective population sizes in cyst nematodes using artificial Globodera pallida populations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						effective population size; genetic drift; Globodera pallida; nematode; plant resistance; selection	GENETIC-STRUCTURE; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; EFFECTIVE NUMBER; LOCAL ADAPTATION; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; N-E; ROSTOCHIENSIS; WILD; SELECTION; PROGRAM	The effective size of a population is the size of an ideal population which would undergo genetic drift at the same rate as the real population. The balance between selection and genetic drift depends on the effective population size (N-e), rather than the real numbers of individuals in the population (N). The objectives of the present study were to estimate N-e in the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida and to explore the causes of a low N-e/N ratio in cyst nematodes using artificial populations. Using a temporal analysis of 24 independent populations, the median N-e was 58 individuals (min N-e = 25 and max N-e = 228). N-e is commonly lower than N but in the case of cyst nematodes, the N-e/N ratio was extremely low. Using artificial populations showed that this low ratio did not result from migration, selection and overlapping generations, but could be explain by the fact that G. pallida populations deviate in structure from the assumptions of the ideal population by having unequal sex ratios, high levels of inbreeding and a high variance in family sizes. The consequences of a low N-e, resulting in a strong intensity of genetic drift, could be important for their control because G. pallida populations will have a low capacity to adapt to changing environments.

Accordingly, the states of biomechanical traits (absolute or relative trait values) have long been used as proxies for adaptations in response to direct selection. However, ignoring evolutionary history, in particular ancestry, passage of time and the rate of evolution, can be misleading. Here, we apply a recently developed phylogenetic statistical approach using significant rate shifts to detect instances of exceptional rates of adaptive changes in bite force in a large group of terrestrial vertebrates, the amniotes. Our results show that bite force in amniotes evolved through multiple bursts of exceptional rates of adaptive changes, whereby whole groups-including Darwin's finches, maniraptoran dinosaurs (group of non-avian dinosaurs including birds), anthropoids and hominins (fossil and modern humans)-experienced significant rate increases compared to the background rate. However, in most parts of the amniote tree of life, we find no exceptional rate increases, indicating that coevolution with body size was primarily responsible for the patterns observed in bite force. Our approach represents a template for future studies in functional morphology and biomechanics, where exceptional rates of adaptive changes can be quantified and potentially linked to specific ecological factors underpinning major evolutionary radiations.

The effect of insularity on avian growth rates and implications for insular body size evolution	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						bird; meta-analysis; growth rates; life history; island biology; island syndrome	NEST PREDATION; DEVELOPMENTAL RATES; ISLAND RULE; TRADE-OFFS; BIRDS; PATTERNS; MODELS; FAMILY; RISK; NEED	Island populations often differ in consistent ways from their mainland counterparts with respect to their ecology, behaviour, morphology, demography and life-history characteristics; a set of changes referred to as the 'island syndrome'. To understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers of the island syndrome requires characterization of suites of interacting traits. While patterns in some types of traits, e.g. body size, are well characterized across a range of taxa, key gaps remain. Growth rate is one such trait, being an important determinant of both increases and decreases in body size, and can vary with changes in predation pressure and food limitation; two factors that are known to differ between mainland and island environments. Using a phylogenetic meta-analytic approach, we characterize differences in growth rates among mainland and island altricial bird populations, controlling for environmental factors. We found a trend towards slower growth on islands in small-bodied (less than 1 kg) bird species. This is consistent with the idea that the pattern of body size increases in small-bodied island colonists is associated with the evolution of slower growth combined with shifts in age and size at maturity in relaxed predation regimes.

They maintain associations with particular lineages of fungi, but the phylogenetic extent and mechanisms of fidelity are unknown. We test the hypothesis that selectivity of their mycangium enforces fidelity at coarse phylogenetic scales, while permitting promiscuity among closely related fungal mutualists. We confirm a single evolutionary origin of the Xylosandrus complex-a group of several xyleborine genera that farm fungi in the genus Ambrosiella. Multi-level co-phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent symbiont switching within major Ambrosiella clades, but not between clades. The loss of the mycangium in Diuncus, a genus of evolutionary cheaters, was commensurate with the loss of fidelity to fungal clades, supporting the hypothesis that the mycangium reinforces fidelity. Finally, in vivo experiments tracked symbiotic compatibility throughout the symbiotic life cycle of Xylosandrus compactus and demonstrated that closely related Ambrosiella symbionts are interchangeable, but the probability of fungal uptake in the mycangium was significantly lower in more phylogenetically distant species of symbionts. Symbiont loads in experimental subjects were similar to wild-caught beetles. We conclude that partner choice in ambrosia beetles is achieved in the mycangium, and co-phylogenetic inferences can be used to predict the likelihood of specific symbiont switches.

When less is more: heterogeneity in grass patch height supports herbivores in counter-intuitive ways	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE			English	Article						diet selection; grazing management; forage quality; nutrition	MINERAL-NUTRITION; FORAGE QUALITY; GRAZING LAWNS; AFRICAN; SAVANNA; MANAGEMENT; RANGELANDS; PREDATION; SELECTION; RAINFALL	Herbivores are an integral part of the African landscape and have evolved with the vegetation to create the savanna landscape. Managers of these landscapes can benefit from a better understanding of how indigenous herbivores use the landscape to which they are adapted. In this study we observed which patches were frequently utilised, by doing regular monthly road counts, grass height observations and dung counts on selected short grass patches in the Kruger National Park. Smaller-framed impala and blue wildebeest (meso-herbivores) were most regularly seen on these nutritious patches, while from dung deposits it was clear that the even larger-framed buffalo (mega-herbivores) spent time there. This preference can be explained by considering the nutritional needs and food intake of the herbivores. Smaller-framed herbivores seem to be able to satisfy their dietary requirements on the high-quality forage patches, while larger-framed herbivores seem to supplement the quality forage by also spending foraging time on areas of higher grass biomass. From this insight we propose that range management should take herbivore preferences into account and allow herbivores to select and concentrate their foraging on the most nutritious forage. This approach is likely to decrease inputs while allowing animals to maintain or increase production.	[Grant, Rina C. C.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Zool, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Grant, Rina C.

Substantial uncertainty about fire effects in semi-arid ecosystems exists. Fire may affect ecosystem productivity directly through nutrient volatilisation, increased mineralisation and altering organic matter quantity, and indirectly through altering vegetation structure. We explored the effects of fire history and vegetation patch types (tree canopy vs inter-canopy) on soil nutrients and soil organic carbon (SOC) in a semi-arid ecosystem. We collected soil samples along transects in four treatments with different fire histories (1 to 24 years since the last burn). In the statistical analyses, tree canopy and inter-canopy samples along transects were differentiated. Fire showed an inconsistent effect on soil nutrients and SOC. There was a short-term negative influence on total nitrogen, whereas phosphorus, potassium and magnesium increased in the 1-year treatment. Sodium consistently decreased with increasing time since the last burn, whereas SOC and calcium were not affected. Calcium and magnesium were significantly higher under canopy relative to inter-canopy patches. There was no significant interactive effect between fire history and vegetation patch type on soil nutrients and SOC. Management decisions regarding fire within the frequency experienced in this system appear not to necessitate concern regarding soil resource impacts.

Effects of cross-fostering and developmental exposure to mixtures of environmental contaminants on hepatic gene expression in prepubertal 21 days old and adult male Sprague-Dawley rats	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES			English	Article						Rat; liver; developmental exposure; organochlorines; persistent organic pollutants; mixtures; cross-fostering; gene expression microarray	ARYL-HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR; PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; CONSTITUTIVE ANDROSTANE RECEPTOR; POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS; IN-UTERO EXPOSURE; LACTATIONAL EXPOSURE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; ALPHA-CATULIN; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; PESTICIDE EXPOSURE	The notion that adverse health effects produced by exposure to environmental contaminants (EC) may be modulated by the presence of non-chemical stressors is gaining attention. Previously, our lab demonstrated that cross-fostering (adoption of a litter at birth) acted as a non-chemical stressor that amplified the influence of developmental exposure to EC on the glucocorticoid stress-response in adult rats. Using liver from the same rats, the aim of the current study was to investigate whether cross-fostering might also modulate EC-induced alterations in hepatic gene expression profiles. During pregnancy and nursing, Sprague-Dawley dams were fed cookies laced with corn oil (control, C) or a chemical mixture (M) composed of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine pesticides (OCP), and methylmercury (MeHg), at 1 mg/kg/day. This mixture simulated the contaminant profile reported in maternal human blood. At birth, some control and M treated litters were cross-fostered to form two additional groups with different biological/nursing mothers (CC and MM). The hepatic transcriptome was analyzed by DNA microarray in male offspring at postnatal days 21 and 78-86. Mixture exposure altered the expression of detoxification and energy metabolism genes in both age groups, but with different sets of genes affected at day 21 and 78-86. Cross-fostering modulated the effects of M on gene expression pattern (MM vs M), as well as expression of energy metabolism genes between control groups (CC vs C). In conclusion, while describing short and long-term effects of developmental exposure to EC on hepatic transcriptomes, these cross-fostering results further support the consideration of non-chemical stressors in EC risk assessments.

However, the understanding of the roles of transport modes in the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic spread across mainland China is limited. Herein, we collected 127,797 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in mainland China from May 2009 to April 2010. Arrival days and peak days were calculated for all 340 prefectures to characterize the dissemination patterns of the pandemic. We first evaluated the effects of airports and railway stations on arrival days and peak days, and then we applied quantile regressions to quantify the relationships between arrival days and air, rail, and road travel. Our results showed that early arrival of the virus was not associated with an early incidence peak. Airports and railway stations in prefectures significantly advanced arrival days but had no significant impact on peak days. The pandemic spread across mainland China from the southeast to the northwest in two phases that were split at approximately 1 August 2009. Both air and road travel played a significant role in accelerating the spread during phases I and II, but rail travel was only significant during phase II. In conclusion, in addition to air and road travel, rail travel also played a significant role in accelerating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 spread between prefectures. Establishing a multiscale mobility network that considers the competitive advantage of rail travel for mid to long distances is essential for understanding the influenza pandemic transmission in China.

To assess MV uptake among 5-year-old children and to evaluate parental knowledge and attitudes regarding invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 among 350 parents (mean age: 32.3 years), attending three randomly selected primary care clinics in Szczecin region, Poland. Anonymous questionnaires were administered to the parents by researchers, present at the time the survey was conducted, to self-complete on a voluntary basis. Chi-square or Fisher's exact for categorical and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Variables significantly (p < 0.05) associated with good knowledge' in the bivariate analysis were used to build a logistic regression model. It was found that the response rate was 93.4%, and MV uptake among children was 29.5%. The main knowledge sources were medical staff and media; 72.5% had ever received information about IMD. Only 18.8% of parents self-assessed their knowledge regarding IMD as good; 61.8% scored >50% in the knowledge test 58.9% knew the mode of transmission, 58.7% recognized the severity of meningitis, and 79.7% knew that bacterial meningitis is a vaccine-preventive disease. Knowledge regarding IMD was higher among parents with higher educational level (OR = 3.37; p = 0.01), from urban facilities (OR = 2.20; p = 0.02), who received previous information about IMD (OR = 2.85; p = 0.01) and self-assessed their knowledge as good (OR = 2.59; p = 0.04). Low MV coverage among children up to five years old and knowledge gaps about IMD call for awareness campaigns which may increase the coverage. Although educational interventions should cover all parents, those from provincial facilities, representing lower education level need special attention.

The I-CNN and D-CNN models were trained on 1000 chest X-ray images, both positive and negative, for tuberculosis. Feature extraction was conducted using VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2. Age, weight, height, and gender were recorded as demographic variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated for model comparison. The AUC values of the D-CNN models were greater than that of I-CNN. The AUC values for VGG19 increased by 0.0144 (0.957 to 0.9714) in the training set, and by 0.0138 (0.9075 to 0.9213) in the test set (both p < 0.05). The D-CNN models show greater sensitivity than I-CNN models (0.815 vs. 0.775, respectively) at the same cut-off point for the same specificity of 0.962. The sensitivity of D-CNN does not attenuate as much as that of I-CNN, even when specificity is increased by cut-off points. Conclusion: Our results indicate that machine learning can facilitate the detection of tuberculosis in chest X-rays, and demographic factors can improve this process.

Items were extracted from a review of previous instruments, as well as from several focus groups which have been conducted with different mental health stakeholders, including mental health service users. The preliminary scale consisted of 44 items and was administered to 480 mental health professionals. After eliminating non-discriminant and low weighting items, a final scale of 25 items was obtained. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses produced a four-factor solution consisting of the following four dimensions; system criticism/justifying beliefs, freedom/coercion, empowerment/paternalism, and tolerance/discrimination. The scale shows high concordance with our theoretical model as well as adequate parameters of explained variance, model fit, and internal reliability. Additional work is required to assess the cultural equivalence and psychometrics of this tool in other settings and populations, including health students.

Both a nocturnal (NBL) and a diurnal convective boundary layer (CBL) approach were employed. A diel course of mole fractions was found with a daytime minimum (background around 1900 ppb) and a nocturnal maximum (up to 3500 ppb). The C value in only showed small variations during the day (9-21 hours CET, parts per thousand ) when the atmosphere was well mixed, but decreased by parts per thousand during the night. Biogenic emissions dominated in both approaches (ranging from 60 to 94%), but non-biogenic sources were rather important (42.2% and 46.0% with CBL, 5.8% and 40% with NBL approach in 2011 and 2012, respectively, of total emissions). The sink, dominated by tropospheric OH oxidation and only to a minor extend by soil surface uptake, was quantified at roughly 4% of local emissions.

A Multifactorial Approach to Value Supporting Ecosystem Services in Spanish Forests and Its Implications in a Warming World	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						climate change; drivers; ecosystem services; National Forest Inventory; valuation	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EUROPEAN FORESTS; CARBON STOCKS; STAND STRUCTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; IMPACTS; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT	Carbon storage and sequestration are key ecosystem services critical to human well-being and biodiversity conservation. In a warming context, the quantification and valuation of carbon storage and sequestration is important in ensuring that effective incentives are put in place to tackle climate change. The quantification and valuation of ES such as carbon storage and sequestration requires the calculus of actual values and prediction, however, it usually does not include key processes that can indirectly influence carbon dynamics (i.e., risk, conservation or management). Here, we define a multifactorial approach to value ecosystem services based on two stages: (1) a biophysical approximation that integrates yearly supporting ecosystem services (i.e., quantification of carbon storage and sequestration) and (2) a weighing approach including factors that indirectly influence carbon storage and sequestration or that deserve specific attention (i.e., risk, conservation or management factors). The quantification of carbon storage and sequestration indicated that Spanish forests store on average 43 Mg C ha(-1) and sequestrate on average 1.02 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Forest structure was a strong determinant of carbon storage and sequestration in Iberian forests, hence there was a strong spatial variation in the carbon sink. We adapted the weighting values to a financial cap and the monetary value of carbon increased more than four times when the weighting factors were taken into account. Finally, we argue that a multifactorial approach to value supporting ecosystem services incorporating aspects related to conservation and risk prevention can facilitate ecosystem service valuation and assist policy makers and stakeholders to establish payment service policies.

Many of them are important locations for tourism and leisure activities. We explored the perceptions of short-term visitors and summer residents on ecosystem services (ESs) tied to characteristic habitats of the Archipelago Sea Biosphere Reserve in Finland. During holiday season, we conducted structured on-field interviews with 74 Biosphere Reserve visitors. From these data, we gained information on the visitors' appreciation of different ESs and the selected habitats. We also derived habitat-specific ES profiles. Excluding the reedbeds, most habitats were both highly valued and considered as important producers of the listed ESs. The derived ES profiles were partially overlapping and inclined towards appreciation of cultural services, and the importance of scenery was highlighted. Provisioning services were not particularly appreciated. We discovered several linkages among biodiversity, ESs, and recreational land uses. Certain habitats were found to be in need of protection under high recreational land-use pressure, but also potential synergies were found. Our method introduces an important socio-cultural perspective into the region's land management that aims to find a balance between the protection of the Biosphere Reserve's unique biodiversity and the need to support sustainable local livelihoods and tourism.

Marginal ice zones are known as important feeding locations for seabirds. The hypothesis that thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia), northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) congregate in areas of high Arctic cod food resource and low ice concentration was tested at different spatial scales. Arctic cod biomass was estimated by hydroacoustics as a resource proxy, and seabirds were counted and sampled for stomach analysis along eight longitudinal transects across the marginal ice zone in southern Baffin Bay in June-July 2016. With increasing length, the epipelagic age-0 Arctic cod migrated from open waters to ice-covered areas. Subsequently, age-1 and age-2 Arctic cod tended to concentrate in a subsurface layer (40-100 m) within the epipelagic layer. Arctic cod 5.7-16.1 cm long (late age-0 to age-5) were the main fish prey of the three seabird species, which preferentially captured age-1 cod (6-11.5 cm). At large spatial scale (western versus eastern Baffin Bay), thick-billed murre, northern fulmar and their Arctic cod resource proxy were generally more abundant on the western ice-covered side of Baffin Bay. No clear spatial match was found, however, when comparing seabird abundances and their food-resource proxy in different ice concentrations across the marginal ice zone or at small scale (5 km). At medium scale (12.5 km), only murre density was influenced positively by its Arctic cod resource. A lack of schooling behavior and a successful strategy to avoid predation by hiding under the ice could explain the absence of any strong spatial match between Arctic cod and its seabird predators at these different scales.

Results indicate that species richness has increased from 13 to 21 species. However, the apparent increase in species richness seemed to mirror recent physical and chemical changes brought upon the stream. In particular, these anthropogenic environmental changes seemed to have been driving a large-scale shift in the composition of the Odonata community of Wadi Bouaroug with an influx of widespread, (hemophilic species (Paragomphus genei, Crocothemis erythraea, Sympetrum fonscolombii ,Trithemis spp.) at the expense of rare, stenotypic species (Coenagrion puella, Gomphus lucasii). In the light of impending and challenging climatic scenarios, we urge that steps should be taken to set up more long-term monitoring schemes and research of North African streams that may provide insights into causal mechanisms of global changes.

Potential threats to smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in the Juniata River Basin, Pennsylvania, USA	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY			English	Article						Endocrine disrupting compounds; smallmouth bass; atrazine; agrochemicals; intersex; tributaries	LARGEMOUTH BASS; MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERGENCE; REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH; POTOMAC RIVER; UNITED-STATES; ATRAZINE; CHEMICALS; FISHES; KINEMATICS; INDICATORS	The Susquehanna River basin is one of the largest and most diverse watersheds in the northeastern United States, however, its historically renowned Micropterus dolomieu (smallmouth bass-SMB) fishery has been in decline since the mid-2000s. Agricultural herbicide runoff has been identified as a major risk for Susquehanna basin SMB populations given their effects as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). During the summers of 2016 and 2017, we assessed potential threats to SMB populations in 11 tributaries to the Juniata River, the second largest tributary to the Susquehanna River. Passive water samplers were installed for 38-39 days in ecologically important tributaries to quantify six common herbicides, and SMB were collected from nine sites in 2016 and 2017 to assess their health and morphology. Our passive water samplers showed markedly higher EDC concentrations than has previously been documented in the Juniata basin, with atrazine occurring at all sites and in the highest concentrations (11.09-91.02 ng/L). SMB blood samples revealed complete prevalence (100%) of vitellogenin, an egg protein precursor, in male fishes further confirming previous rates male vitellogenisis. Additionally, SMB hepatosomatic index (HSI) was statistically higher in female SMB than in male SMB (P < 0.001), and higher than many previous regional SMB studies further highlighting a contaminant-based stressor. Finally, a geometric morphometric analysis of SMB body shape indicated morphologies to be significantly site-based. Morphological differences were in line with the ram-suction feeding continuum, further revealing potential vulnerability in SMB sub-populations where EDCs may alter food web dynamics and prey availability. Overall, our study of the Juniata River Basin highlights high EDC concentrations alongside high rates of male vitellogenisis and elevated HSI, and proposes novel theory for morphological vulnerability in SMB sub-populations.

This dramatically altered in-stream habitat by reducing the structural heterogeneity and increasing water velocity, which in turn had effects on the aquatic fauna. Today, extensive efforts to restore channelized rivers are being made by adding boulders to the streambed. In northern boreal rivers, evaluations of such restorations are often based on the response of trout and salmon populations. Few studies have investigated the effect on European grayling (Thymallus thymallus L), despite it being an important and vulnerable gamefish in both North America and Europe. This 6-year study investigated the effect of streambed restoration on grayling in a channelized, regulated (hydro-peaking) river in northern Sweden open to recreational fisheries. No effects on habitat preference, size, body condition, abundance or survival of grayling could be detected. The results are discussed based on grayling habitat preferences and behaviour, and give perspectives on streambed restoration in river conditions common to many Scandinavian grayling rivers today. The study is one of very few that presents multiyear abundance and survival estimates of grayling in a large boreal river.

A comparison between fixed and random sampling of a low density spotted bass population in a large river	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY			English	Article						Sampling comparison; spotted bass; random sampling; fixed versus random sampling	FISH COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS	Characterizing the structure of riverine fish populations that are patchily distributed and at low densities is often difficult. Due to the wide distribution but low abundance of Spotted Bass, Micropterus punctulatus, throughout the lower Wabash River (LWR), captures from fixed and random sampling designs were compared to assess their performance in determining relative abundance and size structure. The LWR is monitored using both sampling regimes-the Long Term Electrofishing Program monitors community assemblages uses a stratified-random sampling, whereas the Illinois Department of Natural Resources monitors the fish community using a fixed-sampling design. Mean CPUE was significantly higher for fixed site sampling compared to random sites. However, the size structure of Spotted Bass sampled by each design were similar. These results suggest random-sampling designs should be used when monitoring low density populations of fishes in large riverine systems because this method provides the greatest spatial coverage of habitats, evaluates heterogeneity in distribution, and provides a representative measure of abundance throughout an entire aquatic system. In situations where size distribution or temporal trends are the only goal, fixed site sampling would be sufficient.

This can be particularly challenging in temporally variable habitats, such as geographically isolated wetlands (GIW), which dry down seasonally. Larval anurans (tadpoles) are excellent model organisms for studies within the framework of ecological stoichiometry because they undergo major anatomical changes during metamorphosis that likely require a shift in body stoichiometric demands. To examine stoichiometry of larval anurans in GIWs, we measured larval Lithobates sphenocephalus tissue carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca) content, excretion NH4-N, TDN and TDP, and egestion C, N and P across three developmental stage categories (no limbs, hind limbs only, and four limbs). We found that tissue P content increased significantly during later stages when bone development was occurring, which significantly reduced tissue C:P and N:P. Tissue C also increased across stages. Mass-specific excretion of TDN and N:P decreased across stages. Per capita NH4-N excretion rate had a positive relationship with body size, and per capita excretion N:P had a negative relationship with body size. Mass specific bulk egestion and C egestion varied across stages, as well as C:N and C:P, but we could not distinguish which stages were different from one another. Per capita egestion rates of N and P were positively correlated with body size, and both C:N and C:P were negatively related to body size. We found that development stage of larval anurans was an important indicator of tissue, excretion, and egestion stoichiometry and these differences may influence their functional role in aquatic ecosystems throughout their development.

We used a controlled, replicated artificial stream experiment to expose biofilm, algal and stream insect communities to two different concentrations of fluoxetine: 20 ng/L (typical concentration detected in surface waters) and 20 mu g/L (concentration shown to influence insect emergence and algal productivity). We quantified a range of community and ecosystem response metrics over the course of the 21d experiment including; algal biomass (chl-a), net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and invertebrate emergence. At 20 ng/L, fluoxetine significantly suppressed algal colonization on rocks, and reduced GPP after 13 days, but by day 21 chl-a, NEP and GPP did not differ between treatments and control. Fluoxetine increased ER on leaves where invertebrates were excluded, but had no effect on leaves accessible to invertebrates. Streams receiving 20 ng/L of fluoxetine had adult insects from the order Diptera emerge sooner and at a greater rate than control streams. Our results suggest that ecosystem function, including primary production and respiration, and invertebrate population dynamics are sensitive to SSRIs and that fluoxetine may alter these key processes concentrations found in the environment.

A framework for predicting the effects of climate change on the annual distribution of Lyme borreliosis incidences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING			English	Article						Lyme borreliosis; climate change; Ixodes ricinus; tick-borne encephalitis; prediction	TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS; IXODES-RICINUS TICKS; SEASONAL ACTIVITY; ENDEMIC AREA; DISEASE; PREVALENCE; RISK; TEMPERATURE; SCAPULARIS; ABUNDANCE	Global climate change is predicted to affect both the spatial and annual distributions of vector-borne diseases. Tick-borne diseases are particularly sensitive to the changing climatic conditions. Modelling them is, however, challenging due to the input-intensity of these models. A framework with low number of inputs (easily accessible weekly temperature data and week numbers) on modelling the seasonality of Lyme borreliosis incidences is presented. The modelling framework enables predicting the annual distribution of Ixodes ricinus tick's biting activity and Lyme borreliosis in two cascading phases, incorporating a population dynamics approach. The model is calibrated for Hungary as a case study, for the period of 1998-2008, using tick-borne encephalitis series as a proxy for biting activity. Prediction to the future period of 2081-2100 is also provided. Climate change may significantly alter both the annual distribution of I. ricinus activity and that of the Lyme borreliosis incidences. The currently unimodal annual distribution of Lyme borreliosis is predicted to become bimodal with a long summer pause and a spring maximum shifted 8 weeks earlier.

The aim of the study was to determine the soil pollution by the hazardous elements (As, Cr, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) around the tailing pond using contamination factor (C-f), degree of contamination (C-d) and pollution load index (PLI). The health and the condition of soil were evaluated by soil enzyme activity (urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase, florescein diacetate, and ss-glucosidase). The spreading of the airborne hazardous elements from the body of the tailing pond was evaluated by moss and lichen bag technique and relative accumulation factor was used for the result expression. Cd, Fe, and Mn in soils reached above the limit values at all sampling sites. According to the degree of contamination (C-d), the soils at the sampling area were very high contaminated by As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb. The most part of the assessed area was according to the PLI values extremely polluted. The air pollution was the most serious around the tailing pond, but serious levels of some hazardous elements were determined also in the remote distances.

The index of preponderance, an index of the importance of prey items, was calculated from two relative metrics of prey quantity: percent frequency and percent volume. The index of niche breadth and the overlap coefficient were calculated to compare the breadth of food habits among the size classes and species groups. The M. urophthalmus mainly preyed on fish scales, detritus and aquatic invertebrates (molluscs and crustaceans). The O. mossambicus and O. niloticus fed mostly on detritus. The diets of the latter two species overlapped almost completely; however, green filamentous algae mixed with detritus was observed in the diet of the O. niloticus only. The observation that fish scales were a predominant food source in the stomach of M. urophthalmus (high importance value 45.48%) was specific to this study area.

Norway has a vast coastline (58 degrees-71 degrees N), but the distribution of eel has been largely unknown. We analysed data from questionnaires on fish distribution, covering 30 575 Norwegian lakes. Eels were recorded in 1773 lakes. The distribution was largely restricted to low altitude lakes in coastal areas (95% of the lakes with eels were situated below 295 m a.s.l., and within 87 kilometres from the sea). The occurrence of eels decreased towards the north, and only 5% of the lakes with eel were located north of 64.5 degrees N. The northernmost lakes with eel were at 70.6 degrees N, in the Barents Region. The degree to which man-made migration barriers restrict the distribution of the European eel in Norwegian freshwater should be further researched and data on the eel life history and densities are also largely missing.

We measured above-ground VOC emissions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) saplings in the laboratory using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) before, during and after a 48-hour exposure to bark-feeding pine weevils. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the whole-plant VOC emission profile and its changes due to pine weevil feeding with a high time resolution. Monoterpenes dominated the emissions during and after heibivore feeding. The average monoterpene emission rate increase due to pine weevil feeding was 90 times and maximum monoterpene emission response was linearly proportional to the damaged bark area, demonstrating a dose-dependent response. Overall, the emission rates of more than ten VOC groups were increased due to herbivore feeding. These results increase knowledge about the effect of bark-feeding herbivores on VOC emissions from conifer forests and shed light on the important influence of heibivore ecosystem disturbance on atmospheric chemistry.

Boreal peatlands are under stress from commercial extraction of peat, drainage for conversion to forestry and agricultural lands, and climate change. In this study, we identify key microbial groups and their ecological functions across peatland depth profiles and provide insight into how environmental changes related to water table may alter microbial communities. We examined the diversity and composition of prokaryotic communities across a microtopographic hummock-hollow gradient using Illumina sequencing. Communities formed a gradient of species and functional groups with depth, with overlap in functional groups at lower layers of hummocks and upper layers of hollows. Yet, overall, we found significantly different prokaryotic communities in hollows than hummocks. Surfaces of hummocks were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, methanotrophs and chemoheterotrophs, mid-depths were typified by aerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and anaerobic nitrate reducers, while lower depths in hollows were typified by anaerobic and facultative anaerobic chemoorganotrophs, nitrate reducers and methanogenic archaea. Microbial composition as a function of hydrology and moisture regimes suggests that environmental changes that alter hydrological regimes (e.g., climate change, peatland draining) may alter carbon and nutrient cycling regimes.

We aimed to examine the impact of elevation on the morphological and reproductive characteristics of Cephalanthera rubra in four different altitudes in Hungary: in a lowland oak forest (103 m), and in the beech forests of the Biikk-mountains (361 m, 533 m, 657 m). We counted the number of leaves, flowers, and fruits, and measured the height of each plant with the length and width of all leaves. Linear, negative binomial, and quasipoisson regressions were used to compare the populations. Our study has shown that the lowland and mountain populations of C. rubra are sharply different regarding their life history strategy and reproductive success, and altitudinal effects can be found only in the mountain populations. The number of flowers depends strongly on the vegetative production (height and leaf area) of the plants, but at the same time, the area that facilitates greater vegetative production - possibly because it also facilitates species with better competitiveness, and it is less favorable to its mimicked partners - were less beneficial in terms of fruit production.

But, this information regarding the basmati (scented) rice genotypes cultivated under north Indian conditions are not well known. Therefore, here we have evaluated the twenty-two basmati rice genotypes for stability, based on important traits, and different production system. Genotypes were evaluated for two consecutive Kharif seasons under open field conditions in a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The genotypes were evaluated under four production systems namely, transplanted rice (TPR), system of rice intensification (SRI), direct seeded rice (DSR) in both settings, i.e. wet DSR (W) and dry DSR (D). The stability of genotypes was determined via Eberhart and Russell model, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI), and genotype x environment interaction (GGE) biplot model. The stability and adaptability studied using Eberhart and Russell model, AMMI and GGE biplot identified Basmati-370 as the most stable genotype for biological weight; Pusa RH-10 for filled spikelet; CSR-30 for spikelet Number; and Traori Basmati for test grain weight. TPR was the most desirable test environment followed by SRI and DSR (W). Further, we have identified HKR 08-417 as the most suitable genotype for all of the production systems. Overall, this study provides information regarding stable basmati rice genotypes under the north Indian conditions.	[Jain, B.

LONG-TERM ABANDONMENT OF MOUNTAIN MEADOWS AFFECTS BUMBLEBEES, TRUE BUGS AND GRASSHOPPERS: A CASE STUDY IN THE AUSTRIAN ALPS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						extensive management; management cessation; grasslands; Bombus sp.; Heteroptera; Orthoptera	LAND-USE CHANGES; PLANT DIVERSITY; SEMINATURAL GRASSLANDS; SPECIES RICHNESS; INSECT DIVERSITY; HAY MEADOWS; MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; HETEROPTERA; SWITZERLAND	We investigated how abandonment of mountain meadows influences bumblebees, true bugs and grasshoppers in two years in the Eisenwurzen region (Austria). We surveyed abandoned (20-40 years old) and annually mown unfertilized meadows. Bumblebees were observed in 20 m(2) plots, bugs were collected by sweep netting and grasshoppers identified with a soundscape approach. The insect groups were analysed in relation to plant species richness, flower cover, vegetation cover and the surrounding landscape. Bumblebee species richness and richness of long-tongued species were significantly higher in managed meadows. Similarly, we found significantly more phytophagous bug species in managed meadows, whereas grasshoppers showed no difference between meadow types. Bumblebee species richness and abundance, the abundance of phytophagous bugs and total grasshopper species richness were associated with total flower cover. Surrounding forest area negatively affected bugs, while open landscape positively affected bugs, both regarding species richness and abundance, number of phytophagous species and individuals and individuals overwintering as egg. Species assemblages of the three insect groups did not significantly differ between meadow types. Extensive management is important to preserve bumblebee and bug richness. However, abandoned meadows, which are not yet regrown into forest can still act as suitable habitats for the three insect groups.	[Walcher, R.; Hussain, R., I; Jernej, I; Zaller, J.

IMPACT OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI ON SOME DEFENSE ENZYME ACTIVITIES AT AN EARLY STAGE OF MAIZE (ZEA MAYS.

Promoting the adaptability of plants is a priority area, one of the opportunities is the symbiotic system of mycorrhizal fungi with plants. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have beneficial effects on plants' water and nutrient uptake and increasing plant defense mechanisms to alleviate different oxidative stresses. The aim of this study was to investigate how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi influence the changes in some plant defense enzymes (catalase (CAT), peroxidase (PER), glutathione S-transferase (GST), polyphenol oxidase (PPO)) together with gene expressions under salt, high temperature and drought stresses at an early stage of maize (Zea mays L.). The results suggest that AM fungi inoculation may take part in the alleviation processes caused by high temperature, salt and drought stresses. However, these mechanisms are influenced by the age of the plants which is most likely justified by energy considerations.

Impact of agrarian practices and some pastoral uses on vegetation in Algerian steppe rangelands	RANGELAND JOURNAL			English	Article						drylands; grazing pressure; herd management; land access; pastoral map; regressive succession; vegetation dynamics; vegetation map	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DESERTIFICATION; RESTORATION; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; PATTERNS; REGION	The decline in steppe vegetation in Algeria was first reported in the mid-20th century, and for many years was attributed to recurrent droughts. Hypotheses suggesting that this decline was a consequence of human activities emerged in the 1970s - a time of major socioeconomic trends in the region. Changes such as strong population growth, sedentarisation, herd size increases and use of pasture land for crops, all had considerable impact on rangeland vegetation. The aim of the present work was to identify heterogeneity in the pasture vegetation of a given territory' (in the sense of a terroir'), or biophysical environment (including meteorological), taking into account rangeland distribution, land use changes and herd management in the Aflou region of Algeria. Characterisation and mapping of the vegetation and its environment in the study area led to the hypothesis that, apart from some very slight soil differences, heterogeneity in rangeland vegetation appeared mainly related to human impacts. Bertin's Semiology of Graphics was used to analyse the results, and indicated a major decline in vegetation productivity and biodiversity in the steppe rangelands of the study zone. Beyond this general trend in the municipal territory studied, areas were found with contrasting flora communities, with some showing relatively stable plant communities, while other areas had some plant communities that had undergone regressive succession. Grazing conditions and the proximity of ploughed land were responsible for these different vegetation situations.	[Hammouda, R.

Grazing management that promotes both biodiversity and production outcomes has the potential to improve broad-scale conservation and complement the protected area network. In this study we explored the potential to integrate commercial livestock grazing and conservation in a semi-arid rangeland in south-eastern Australia. Understorey floristic composition and diversity were compared at different spatial scales across three grazing management treatments: (1) continuous commercial grazing management where paddocks were grazed for the majority of the year (8 months per annum); (2) rotational commercial grazing management where livestock are frequently rotated and paddocks rested for >4 months per annum; and (3) protected areas managed for conservation with domestic livestock excluded and grazed only by native and feral herbivores. The season of sampling, rainfall, soil characteristics and the spatial location of sites were the dominant drivers of variability in understorey plant species composition; the effect of grazing treatment on understorey plant species composition was relatively minor. However, areas managed for conservation and under rotational forms of commercial grazing management generally had greater floristic richness and diversity than continuously grazed areas, the results varying with season (spring/autumn) and soil type (clay/sandy-loam), particularly at fine scale (1-m(2) quadrats). These findings indicate that rotational grazing management on commercial properties has the potential to improve biodiversity conservation outside the reserve system compared to conventional grazing management.

Fish community response to in-channel woody debris in a channelized river system	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY			English	Article						Missouri River; woody debris; fish community	BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; MISSOURI; ECOLOGY; HABITAT; THREATS	Additions of large wood (LW) have become a go-to technique for recovering altered river ecosystems. However, successful applications of this technique are generally limited to unchannelized rivers and headwater streams. Channelization of rivers, that is, engineering river channels to reduce recruitment and retention of in-channel structure, may, by definition, limit success of this restoration technique. Moreover, sufficient time has passed (a century or more) since initial channelization of many large rivers that portions of the fish community associated with LW may have become extirpated. Thus, the maxim that LW leads to a positive fish community response may not hold true. We examined fish community associations in habitats with and without LW in the channelized Missouri River to gain an understanding of the role of LW in large, channelized rivers. There were some differences between habitats with wood present compared to those without, but the differences were not evident once year, season and channel modifications intended to create aquatic habitat were taken into account. We assert that careful planning is necessary to ensure that additions of LW in channelized rivers are made to appropriate locations such that it will be retained in-channel for use as fish habitat and that LW-associated species are found in the system.

The short and variable period of flowering that this plant has, the inaccessibility and the physiognomy of the place in which it grows, the resources needed, as well as the meteorological harshness linked to the time of the year in which the censuses are carried out make it a priority to optimize the time spent on fieldwork. For this reason, we designed a method to reduce the sampling load. This method allows us to reduce the time spent and the material, methodological and human resources used in censuses, while maintaining the highest possible precision.

We used a 30-year set of data on winter observations of brown bear Ursus arctos to investigate the effects of weather and supplementary feeding on bear winter activity in the Polish Eastern Carpathians. The probability of observations of bears and their signs was negatively correlated with depth of snow cover and positively related to ambient temperature and the amount of supplementary food. We noted an increase in the frequency of bear winter observations over the study period, which might be additionally related to the increasing bear numbers in the study area. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of how climate change and supplementary feeding affect the brown bear, a species considered as threatened by human activity. Supplementary feeding seems to disrupt bears' natural responses to winter weather conditions. Limiting the amount of anthropogenic food subsidies may help to mitigate the effect of climate change on wildlife. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Combining modeling tools to identify conservation priority areas: A case study of the last large-bodied avian frugivore in the Atlantic Forest	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Conservation planning; Cracidae; Habitat fragmentation; Hunting; Population viability; Ecological niche modeling	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; POPULATION VIABILITY ANALYSIS; RED-BILLED CURASSOW; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; ECOLOGICAL NICHES; BIODIVERSITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; ACCURACY; REINTRODUCTION; LANDSCAPE	Applicability of modeling tools to tackle conservation problems is key for conservation planning. However, modeling papers regarding real-world conservation issues are scarce. Here, we combined two modeling tools to identify priority areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, focusing on the last large-bodied frugivorous bird in the region, the red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii). We used population viability analysis (PVA) to determine (1) the minimum viable population size under different hunting scenarios; and (2) the minimum critical forest patch size required to maintain viable populations. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify remnants that retain suitable environmental conditions to ensure the long-term persistence of this species. We overlapped the outputs from PVA and ENM models to identify priority areas for curassows. Under our best-case scenario, 56 individuals would suffice to maintain a viable population and 71 forest patches located within the species' known range are above the critical size of 3141 ha. In the worst-case scenario, at least 138 individuals would be required to maintain a viable population in forest patches larger than 9500 ha, corresponding to only 20 Atlantic Forest fragments within the species range. Among these, 17 presented median habitat suitability values higher than 0.70, eight of which were selected as priority areas for law enforcement and nine as priority areas for reintroduction. We encourage conservation biologists and land managers to combine modeling tools which can be guided by our conservation planning framework. This approach is promising to inform long-term conservation planning of a flagship species and its entire ecosystem. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Bonfim, Fernando C.

In many rural communities, they constitute a main treatment for disease or a source of disease prevention. Here, we review traditional knowledge of medicinal plants, the benefits they provide when cultivated in home gardens, and the determinants of knowledge about their uses in a rural parish in Amazonian Ecuador, where two ethnic groups prevail: indigenous Shuar and settled mestizos. Among 138 garden owners interviewed in 11 communities, a broad knowledge of 104 pharmacological properties across 145 medicinal plant species is retained. Several species play a specific role for a particular culture; therefore, the importance ranking of medicinal plants is different between the two main cultures. Traditional knowledge of medicinal uses is also influenced by ethnicity as well as generational age of the gardeners. Knowledge seems to have been lost in people of younger generations, who cultivated fewer species and knew less about properties of medicinal plants. Although men cultivate more diverse gardens, the role for women in the conservation of agrobiodiversity in home gardens appears crucial, as they are identified as the main source for transmission of traditional knowledge about medicinal plants.

Is restocking a useful tool for increasing rabbit densities?

In recent years its populations have declined due to several factors including habitat transformation and viral diseases. At the same time, corrective measures including population restocking in areas with low population densities using rabbits from other geographical areas have been performed. In this study we evaluate the impact restocking has had on the population dynamics of native rabbits in the Donana National Park. As part of the natural processes monitoring program carried out in the Donana Biological Station (ESPN-EBD-CSIC), rabbit censuses were conducted in spring and late summer in 2005-2015 at dusk and at night along six fixed transects in habitats harbouring rabbit populations. In order to take into account restocked rabbit numbers, annual reports from the Donana Natural Area and data provided by the Lynx team of the LIFE project were incorporated into the study. In all, 52 336 rabbits from different parts of western Andalusia were released in the Donana Biosphere Reserve in 2005-2015. Yet, rabbit populations underwent significant declines, above all in 2013 and 2015, with decreases in some areas of up to 80%. These results show intensive rabbit restocking did not increase the native rabbit populations numbers. The impact of the release of rabbits on the population dynamics of the species in Donana is discussed. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, censusing organisms to understand such changes is often impractical. For example, while it is thought that over half of pelagic seabird populations are declining, most breed in burrows or on cliffs, in large, remote colonies, making them difficult to count. Burrow-nesting sooty shearwaters (Ardenna grisea) are abundant but declining in their core (South Pacific) breeding range, potentially due to introduced rodents and habitat loss. In contrast, Kidney Island, their largest colony in the Falkland Islands (Southwest Atlantic), purportedly grew by several orders of magnitude since the mid-1900s. This island is rodent-free, and native tussac grass (Poa flabellata) has increased following cessation of historical exploitation. To estimate the sooty shearwater population in the Falkland Islands, and its relationship with breeding habitat availability, we sampled burrow density and occupancy on Kidney Island and modeled these as functions of habitat. Both indices responded positively to a proxy for historical increases in tussac cover. We estimate that breeding sooty shearwaters occupy similar to 140,000 (95% CI: 90,000-210,000) burrows on Kidney Island. Moreover, using additional survey data and Generalized Functional Response models to account for intra-island variation in habitat availability, we estimate that 25,000 (95% CI: 20,100 - 30,500) burrows could be occupied on nearby islands from which non-native rodents have been recently eradicated. Our study shows that habitat selection functions, generalized where necessary, not only improve population estimates but provide biological insights needed to reverse declines in seabirds and other species.

Comparing stakeholder attitudes toward white-tailed deer and rare plant management in Canaan Valley, West Virginia	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						White-tailed deer; Stakeholder; Nonresident; Visitor; Plant conservation	PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT; OVERABUNDANCE; SCIENCE; RECREATION; POLITICS; HUNTERS	Canaan Valley, West Virginia, USA provides habitat for many plants considered rare in West Virginia. The local white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) are a popular attraction for visitors as well as resident and nonresident hunters. However, concerns exist over the impact of white-tailed deer herbivory on rare plant communities in the wetlands. We evaluated stakeholder attitudes regarding white-tailed deer management and rare plant conservation by mailing surveys to property owners in Canaan Valley and Tucker County, WV, and providing surveys to visitors at Canaan Valley State Park and National Wildlife Refuge. Individuals that had incurred crop damage were more likely to view the Canaan Valley population as overabundant while nonresident landowners placed higher values on the conservation of rare plants and plant communities in Canaan Valley. We found that hunters were more likely than nonhunters to support white-tailed deer management actions. Results of this survey may help managers to direct management and education goals toward actual rather than perceived stakeholder attitudes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using qualitative methods to support recovery of endangered species: The case of red-cockaded woodpecker foraging habitat	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Endangered species; Habitat threshold; Pine forest; Meta-analysis; Population fitness; Recovery plan	BROWN TREECREEPER; FOREST STRUCTURE; GROUP-SIZE; BODY-MASS; SPACE-USE; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; FITNESS; DENSITY; REINTRODUCTION	Meta-analyses are powerful tools for synthesizing wildlife-habitat relationships, but small sample sizes and complex species-habitat relationships often preclude correlative meta-analyses on endangered species. In this study, we demonstrate qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) as a tool that can reliably synthesize habitat-fitness relationships from small sample sizes for species with narrow habitat requirements. We apply QCA to results from a habitat threshold regression tree model and identify habitat thresholds with consistent positive effects on fitness of the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Dryobates borealis; RCW) on the Savannah River Site, USA. We reformulated regression tree results in a QCA framework to examine the consistency of threshold effects on RCW fledgling production at the individual group level (n = 47). Synthesizing regression tree results with QCA revealed alternative combinations of habitat thresholds that in conjunction with group size consistently led to above-average fledgling production for 41 of 47 (88%) individual RCW groups. Importantly, QCA identified unique combinations of habitat thresholds and group size related to above-average fledgling production that were not retained in the regression tree model due to small sample sizes. Synthesizing a small habitat-fitness dataset using QCA provided a tractable method to identify unique combinations of habitat and group size conditions that are consistently important to individual fitness, but may not be detected by meta-analyses that can be biased by small sample sizes. QCA offers a viable approach for synthesis of habitat-fitness relationships and can be extended to address many complex issues in endangered species recovery when correlative meta-analyses are not possible.

However, they can also be located in humanized and highly dynamic areas, whose management can be extremely challenging. The Andalusian buttonquail (Turnix sylvaticus sylvaticus) is the critically endangered nominal subspecies of the common buttonquail, a largely unknown species due to its secretive habits. Here, we show how the last Andalusian buttonquail population is restricted to a small, intensively used agricultural area (4,675 ha) in the Atlantic coast of Morocco, where the birds adapt their life cycle to a fast crop rotation. Buttonquails occupy crops in the flowering and fruiting stages, thus changing the preferred crop types along the year, although Alfalfa fields were occupied in all seasons. We used estimated occupancy rates in different crops to obtain seasonal (2017) and year-to-year population estimates (2011, 2014 and 2017). Numbers showed wide seasonal fluctuations between the lowest in winter and the maximum in summer (112-719 individuals). Year-to-year summer estimates also showed wide variations and large uncertainties, ranging between a maximum 1,890 estimated in 2011 and a minimum in 2014 with 492 individuals. The last population estimate available was 596 in 2017. The area is suffering a rapid shift from traditional irrigation farming towards practices more akin to commercial industrial agriculture. The conservation of this critically endangered taxon is highly dependent on the maintenance of traditional farming practices and a rational on-site agricultural modernization. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Devising effective strategies to reduce risks to as low as reasonably possible of these crimes, calls for adequate information on factors driving people to commit these crimes. Data for this study were obtained from 315 respondents in 20 villages and 316 people who were arrested for committing different conservation crimes in the Rungwa- Kizigo- Muhesi- Game- Reserves. Our results suggest that arrested respondents were typically young adult males with limited alternative sources of income and owning virtually no livestock or land. There were heterogeneous drivers for each type of conservation crime. To address the challenge of conservation crimes in the Reserve, we recommend, among other strategies, the establishment of effective conservation education programmes, strengthening law enforcements as a deterrence method, and development of entrepreneurship skills to enhance employment.

Characterising trafficking and trade of pangolins in the Gulf of Guinea	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Africa; Bushmeat; Conservation; Phataginus; Smutsia; Wild meat	BUSHMEAT	Humans and pangolins have a long and intertwined history in Africa and Asia, with the species having been used for subsistence, livelihood, medicinal, and cultural purposes. Populations of Asian pangolins have severely declined, and intercontinental trafficking of African pangolin scales to Asia has emerged in the last decade. Coastal countries in the Gulf of Guinea have been highlighted as hotspots of illegal pangolin trade, and in 2017, international commercial trade in pangolins was banned. We characterise the trade and international trafficking of African pangolins in the coastal countries around the Gulf of Guinea using data across three tiers. First, we investigated which countries were most heavily involved in international trafficking using seizure data. Second, we investigated where domestic seizures of pangolins took place, and whether they were seized with other species. Finally, we tracked the open sale of pangolins across 20-years at the main wild meat market in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, to investigate patterns of pangolin sales in a capital city. We found a total of 55893 kg of pangolin scales in 33 seizures between 2012 and 2018, with Cameroon and Nigeria being the most common export countries for international trafficking of pangolin scales. Cameroon had the largest number of domestic seizures (45); we also observed a shift from seizures of meat to scales from 2013 onwards. At the Malabo market a total of 11207 Phataginus pangolins and 366 Smutsia pangolins were sold between 1997 and 2017, and the number and price of pangolins increased over time for both genera and corresponded to a shift in the import of pangolins from Cameroon. Together, these results highlight the scale of trade and trafficking in pangolins within and from this region. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Stability of Afromontane ant diversity decreases across an elevation gradient	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Ant compositional similarity; Ant species richness; Climate change; Ecological community thresholds; Altitude gradient; Insurance hypothesis	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES; VEGETATION; PATTERNS	As the need to better understand the ecology of hotspots of endemism intensifies, the insurance hypothesis is drawing increasing attention from policy-makers and scenarioplanners. The hypothesis states that biodiversity increases ecosystem stability. When species numbers fluctuate, there is potential for further perturbation, loss of function and increased opportunity for invasive species to fill vacated niches. Southern Africa is predicted to be disproportionately impacted by global change, and high altitude systems as foci of endemism are particularly vulnerable to warming. Using ants, a group key to ecosystem function, we assess effects of temperature, season, aspect, vegetation and soil conditions on montane ant species richness, stability of ant community composition, and stability of ant species richness across an altitude gradient. Over six consecutive years of bi-annual sampling, we gathered one of the largest standardized data sets to date. We showed for the first time that stability of ant species richness decreases with increasing altitude, whilst compositional similarity of ant communities is higher with increasing altitude. Findings reveal more similar, species-poor, less stable ant communities at high altitude at the same sites over time. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Changes in technology and imperfect detection of nest contents impedes reliable estimates of population trends in burrowing seabirds	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Ardenna carneipes; Detection probability; Flesh-footed Shearwater; Lord Howe Island; Population status	FLESH-FOOTED SHEARWATERS; PUFFINUS-CARNEIPES; OCCUPANCY; ABUNDANCE; COLONY; ISLAND; ALBATROSSES; GRISEUS; CENSUS; SOUTH	One of the most fundamental aspects of conservation biology is understanding trends in the abundance of species and populations. This influences conservation interventions, threat abatement, and management by implicitly or explicitly setting targets for favourable conservation states, such as an increasing or stable population. Burrow-nesting seabirds present many challenges for determining abundance reliably, which is further hampered by variability in the quality of previous surveys. We used burrow scopes to determine the population status of Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) at their largest colony on Lord Howe Island, Australia, in 2018. We estimated a breeding population of 22,654 breeding pairs (95% CI: 8159-37,909). Comparing burrow scope models used in 2018 found more than half of burrow contents (20/36 burrows examined) were classified differently. If this detection probability is applied retroactively to surveys in 2002 and 2009, we estimate that the Flesh-footed Shearwater population on Lord Howe has decreased by up to 50% in the last decade, but uncertainty around previous surveys' ability to reliably determine burrow contents means a direct comparison is not possible. The decline in burrow density between 2018 and previous years adds further evidence that the population may not be stable. Our results highlight a need for regular surveys to quantify detection probability so that as video technology advances, previous population estimates remain comparable. We urge caution when comparing population counts of burrowing seabirds using different technologies, to ensure comparisons are meaningful. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Several studies have investigated how wild bees respond to large-scale agriculture production; however, there has been limited assessment of how wild bees may be impacted by agricultural activity on public lands or how local variables may influence bee communities in these same areas. In this study, we assessed the abundance and richness of wild bee floral and nesting guilds at 30 agricultural field margins located on five Conservation Areas in Missouri. Generally, regardless of guild, bee abundance and richness was greater in field margins with more floral diversity and taller vegetation. Bee guilds responded negatively to agricultural production in Conservation Areas with fewer soil- and cavity-nesting bees collected in margins adjacent to annually cropped fields. Although fewer diet specialists were collected, specialist bee abundance and richness was greater in margins near fields that were uncropped (i.e., vegetated, but not row-cropped) during the previous year. Overall, the percentage of trees and shrubs within 800 m of study fields (i.e., "woodland") was negatively associated with abundance and richness of bees, but specifically, reduced richness of soil-nesters and diet specialists. Our findings indicate agricultural management activities on public lands may lead to decreased abundance and richness of wild bee guilds. If public lands are to be managed for species diversity, including wild bees, maintaining diverse plant communities with taller vegetation (>100 cm) near cultivated fields and/or modifying agricultural production practices on public lands may greatly improve the conservation of local bee communities.

Here we used maximum entropy (Maxent) and boosted regression trees to predict suitable habitat of the threatened Bornean highland endemic Hose's civet (Diplogale hosei), that is currently available, and for future time periods (2050s and 2080s), considering future land cover and climate change predictions. Next, we identified areas that were consistently suitable under current and future model predictions as forest refuges. Our analysis predicted that Hose's civet is restricted mainly to the highlands of Borneo to an area less than 20,000 km(2) (about 2% of the entire island of Borneo). Changes in land cover have little impact on predicted suitable area for the species. However, we predicted habitat loss due to climate change to approximate 86% by 2080, except under a "green economy scenario" which showed stable or increasing suitable habitat. Refuges were small, about 11% of 2010 habitat, and mostly restricted to lower montane forest. About 28-35% of refuges lie within the current protected area network though much is designated as commercial forests within the proposed Heart of Borneo (HoB). For the conservation of Hose's civet and likely other Bornean highland endemics, we recommend increased wildlife and forest law enforcement in identified protected refuges and sustainable timber harvesting practices in surrounding commercial forests, both within the HoB and the extensions we identified. Results of our green model showed that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will likely contribute immensely to the long-term conservation of highland species such as Hose's civet.

We compared different protection types (animal sanctuaries, nature reserves and unprotected areas) using data on species richness and occurrence of coastal breeding bird species in a large archipelago in the Baltic Sea. Data were from extensive inventories based on a grid with 1 x 1 km resolution covering 4646 km(2) on the East coast of Sweden. We focused on specialist species breeding exclusively in coastal habitats since these species are of specific conservation concern, but considered generalists, which also breeds in inland wetlands, as well. Animal sanctuaries had significantly higher species richness of specialist species than unprotected areas and nature reserves. Nature reserves had even lower richness of specialist species than unprotected areas. Further, a rarity-weighted diversity index showed that animal sanctuaries were better in capturing hotspots of bird diversity compared to nature reserves and unprotected areas. Hotspots, both protected and unprotected, were scattered throughout the entire archipelago. The rarity-weighted richness is therefore useful to identify gaps in the protected area network. Overall, we conclude that the establishment of animal sanctuaries has been a successful conservation measure for protecting specialist species in several aspects. Ongoing human exploitation of the Baltic archipelagos prompt further consideration of protecting still unprotected but species rich shorelines for the benefit of many coastal breeding birds.

Proactive development of invasive species damage functions prior to species reintroduction	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Artificial nests; Density-impact function; Erinaceus europaeus; Invasive	HEDGEHOGS ERINACEUS-EUROPAEUS; INTRODUCED EUROPEAN HEDGEHOGS; NEW-ZEALAND; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PESTS; SADDLEBACKS; IMPACT	Damage function models can determine the nature of relationships between the pest population and impact, and can provide guidance about when pest control is required. However, damage functions usually assess risk to species currently occupying conservation areas. Damage functions are not currently used to predict risk to species yet to be reintroduced to conservation areas. While the impacts of several mammalian pest species, such as rats (Rattus spp.), are relatively well-known in urban forest fragments, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are relatively understudied invasive mammals, and their impacts in urban fragments are unknown. Conservation areas within cities provide important habitat for native species and are a focus of current conservation efforts. We developed a damage function describing the relationship between the relative abundance of hedgehogs (determined using a chew card index) and their potential impact (estimated by egg mortality in artificial nests) in a New Zealand urban environment. Egg mortality was positively related to hedgehog abundance, although some egg mortality occurred even at the lowest hedgehog abundances measured. Conservation managers should prioritise hedgehog control at sites of highest hedgehog relative abundances and/or sites containing high value species likely to be at risk. Our results demonstrate the need for conservation managers to proactively assess potential threats to protected areas. Further, we show that damage functions provide an objective means of assessing threats prior to reintroduction of species. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Prioritisation has been a feature of schemes in terms of focussing funding on individual species, habitats or regions. For the 2014-2020 Agri-Environment and Climate Scheme Scotland decided on an alternative prioritisation method; for a number (11) of management options funding was made available for areas (10 km x 10 km grid squares) with more than a threshold of priority species present (a subset of species on the Scottish Biodiversity List likely to benefit from the management options). This approach (Simple targeting) takes no account of the different abundances of the priority species or the possibility that rare species' distributions are not nested within the more common ones. Three alternative methods were used to assess if that targeting could be made more efficient in its coverage of species' ranges. Rarity Weighted targeting took into account range sizes of different priority species, Uniqueness targeting focussed on maximising the beta-diversity of targeted grid squares, and Marxan targeting used a reserve selection algorithm to solve the minimum set reserve design problem. Assessment was in terms of how well each method covered the range of the priority species, both on average and on minimum representation of each species on the priority list. Rarity Weighted targeting improved the mean representation of species' ranges across all 11 options, whereas Marxan targeting performed best of the four methods in ensuring a high minimum representation of species. Uniqueness targeting was uniformly poor. These patterns were conserved whatever the threshold of species richness used in the Simple targeting. If funding for agri-environment options is to be targeted to areas where more species can benefit, then the current Simple targeting approach employed in Scotland can be improved upon in its efficiency at channelling funding to where the priority species are found. However, a strategic choice has to be made as to whether maximising the mean coverage of priority species is the most important objective of the targeting process or whether ensuring high minimum coverage of the species is more important; ensuring that rarer species with ranges poorly nested within those of rarer species are well represented in the targeted areas.

Habitat similarity presumably falls along a gradient depending on the degree to which a species is migratory. How migratory a population is may even vary considerably within a species. A partially migratory species of conservation concern is the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), where breeding habitat has been prioritized. Our goal was to determine if a more migratory sage-grouse population required a different habitat conservation strategy to meet its comprehensive requirements than a less migratory population. Firstly, even though our study populations differed in behavior they both reflected what was expected for partially migratory populations with seasonal habitats that on average had a moderate degree of similarity. This suggests that prioritizing the conservation of one seasonal habitat will result in partly protecting other seasonal requirements but not completely meet all requirements. Secondly, for both populations, prioritization of breeding habitat was justified because breeding habitat was most like other seasonal requirements. Thirdly, information specific to each study population was necessary to identify the importance of prioritizing additional seasonal habitat with a greater need to include summer and winter habitat for the more migratory population. We created a cumulative habitat prediction map that depicts comprehensive habitat requirements to help guide reserve delineation. This process can be used to delineate priority areas for conservation reserves for other partially migratory species. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, it is still not known whether the former have lower temperature thresholds and lower physiological optimum temperatures for development than the latter. We studied two native Chinese bamboo species that have different vertical distributions: Chimonobambusa utilis, which typically grows at altitudes of 1400-2200 m, and Phyllostachys edulis (i.e., moso), which typically grows at altitudes of 400-800 m. The seed germination times of both species at eight temperatures from 16 to 30 degrees C at 2 degrees C increments were observed. A thermodynamic model was used to calculate the intrinsic optimum temperature and upper developmental threshold for development of each of these two species, and a linear model was used to calculate their lower developmental threshold and the sum of effective temperatures required for completing seed germination. We found that the alpine bamboo species had a lower intrinsic optimum temperature and a lower low-temperature developmental threshold than the non-alpine moso (19.4 vs. 19.8 degrees C and 7.5 vs. 10.1 degrees C, respectively), although it should be noted that the difference between the intrinsic optimum temperatures of the two species was small. However, there was no significant difference between the upper developmental thresholds (31.6 vs. 31.0 degrees C) or the sum of effective temperatures (135.8 vs. 136.8 d degrees C) of the two species. The results of this study imply that climate warming might reduce the fitness of bamboos, especially the alpine species whose intrinsic optimum temperature was found to be approximately 20 degrees C, which is in accordance with results previously reported for terrestrial arthropods.

We developed a new framework to assist planning environmental representativity in a network across the marine space of Portugal, responding to a political commitment to protect 14% of its area by 2020. An aggregate conservation value was estimated for each of the 27 habitats identified, from intertidal waters to the deep sea. This value was based on expert-judgment scoring for environmental properties and features relevant for conservation, chosen to reflect the strategic objectives of the network, thus providing an objective link between conservation commitments and habitat representativity in space. Additionally, habitats' vulnerability to existing anthropogenic pressures and sensitivity to climate change were also scored. The area coverage of each habitat in Portugal and within existing MPAs (regionally and nationally) was assigned to a scale of five orders of magnitude (from < 0.01% to >10%) to assess rarity and existing representation. Aggregate conservation value per habitat was negatively correlated with area coverage, positively correlated with vulnerability and was not correlated with sensitivity. The proposed framework offers a multi-dimensional support tool for MPA network development, in particular regarding the prioritization of new habitats to protect, when the goal is to achieve specific targets while ensuring representativity across large areas and complex habitat mosaics. It requires less information and computation effort in comparison to more quantitative approaches, while still providing an objective instrument to scrutinize progress on the implementation of politically set conservation targets.

This could lead to increased risk of extirpation or extinction, especially for locally range-restricted species within fragmented landscapes. Assisted migration has been suggested as a proactive conservation tool to mitigate these risks. We tested assisted migration for Liatris ligulistylis and Houstonia longifolia, two perennial forbs considered 'vulnerable' and 'imperilled', respectively, in Alberta, Canada, where they are at their northern and western range limits. Both mature plants and seeds were translocated to replicate sites at four geographic locations along a north-south gradient representing the current ranges of the species (central) and areas south (warmer) and north (cooler) of their current range. L. ligulistylis adult plants thrived similar to 500 km north of the species current range with survival, growth, and flowering similar to or exceeding performance in the current range, the influence of soil was also tested by comparing the performance of transplanted mature plants in soil from the source location versus the translocation (recipient) site. Plants planted into soil from the source location had increased flower bud production at all sites. Seedling establishment was significantly higher at sites north of the current range, but much lower in the southern locations. These results suggest that L. ligulistylis is in climate disequilibrium, potentially due to migration lags, and that it might be vulnerable to near-future climate vulnerability. For H. longifolia, the influence of flower morph type and location were tested. Only 8 out 130 translocated adult plants survived, five with thrum flowers and three with pin flowers; no seedling establishment was observed in the first growing season, which experienced drier than normal conditions. Among the eight adult plants, seven survived in the central location and one in the north demonstrating specific habitat requirements and conditions that may make this species difficult for translocation and establishment. Overall, locally rare and range-restricted plants with limited dispersal demonstrate climate sensitivity to current conditions and potential for assisted migration, yet species-by-species testing is needed to understand vulnerability and efficacy of this approach.

This study aimed to explore the relationships between soil food webs, soil properties and fruit productivity in plantations of Chinese star anise (Illicium verum Hook). We anticipated that this comparison would allow us to identify key indicators of soil ecosystem associated with fruit yield. We found that soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), bacterial abundance (B) and fungal abundance (F) derived from phospholipid fatty acid profiling, bacteriovores abundance (Ba), fungivores abundance (Fu) and F/B ratio were resilient to fruit productivity. By contrast, MBC: MBN ratio, total nematode abundance, F/Fu and the correlation between F/B, Fu/Ba and Fu/(Ba+Fu) were responsive to fruit productivity. In conclusion, MBC: MBN and trophic linkages in the detritus food web are important determinants of ecosystem functioning at local scale. Very small change in community composition or interactions among components within soil food webs could disturb some ecosystem processes and ultimately affect plant's productivity. Therefore, we can enhance ecosystem functioning using management practice which is conducive to restore the community composition of soil biota and interactions among components within soil food webs to those of adjacent healthy natural ecosystem.

We assessed the differential gene expression related to defensive metabolites in cynipid wasp galls of Quercus castanea induced by Amphibolips michoacaensis throughout gall development. We assembled de novo transcriptomes from galls in three phases of growth and compared the differential expression of phenolic-related genes. We found that (1) Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme genes were upregulated at the intermediate and late growth stages. (2) Phenylpropanoid genes were upregulated at the intermediate stage and downregulated at the late stage. (3) Lignin genes were upregulated at the late stage. The transcriptomic profile of wasp galls exposes the switches in secondary metabolism during development. Patterns of differential expression shown in wasp galls suggest phenotype manipulation by the wasp larvae and physiological constraints of the host plant for enzyme channeling in different biosynthetic branches of phenolic compounds.

Evaluation of Heracleum sosnowskyi Frost Resistance after Snow Cover Removal in Early Spring	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Heracleum sosnowskyi; biological invasion; frost resistance; snow cover; invasion management	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; GIANT HOGWEED; MANTEGAZZIANUM; MANAGEMENT	The development of environmentally safe and cost-effective methods for controlling invasive species Sosnowsky's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi Manden.) is an urgent issue for the European part of Russia. The article presents findings of an experiment on the effect of snow cover removal from the areas occupied by H. sosnowskyi in the early spring period (the beginning of March 2018) in the vicinity of the city of Syktyvkar (Komi Republic, Russia). The snow depth reached 100 cm on the intact plots; the sum of below-zero air temperatures measured at 6 a.m. constituted -448 degrees C, with a minimum of -29.0 degrees C during the experiment. The number of H. sosnowskyi plants of all age groups at the experimental plots (with removed snow cover) was shown to be significantly decreased. The median seedling density (pcs. per square meter) was equal to zero. Most of the surviving plants were located along the sides and in the corners of experimental plots. This can be explained by the higher temperature of soil on the borders of plots with an intact snow cover. The results of the experiment may be used for development of invasive plant eradication technology by removal of the snow cover. This technology can be suitable for kindergartens, schools, hospitals, and water protection zones, where the use of chemical methods of plant control is limited or prohibited. The obtained data set with respect to H. sosnowskyi monitoring is available in the repository of Zenodo.	[Chadin, I. F.; Dalke, I. V.; Malyshev, R.

Methods: We excerpted the published and unpublished phytosociological releves which were by their authors assigned to the aquatic vegetation classes Lemnetea, Potamogetonetea or Charetea intermediae. Subsequently, we added a dataset composed of releves of the class Phragmito-Magnocaricetea with presence of at least one aquatic plant species. Altogether 3856 releves were selected for the final dataset. Seven environmental characteristics (altitude, water depth, bioregion - Carpathian or Pannonian, type of water body - lentic or lotic, origin of water body - natural or artificial, mean annual temperature and annual sum of precipitation) were determined for each releve. We used "New Cocktail" for classification of the vegetation and Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for explanation of species composition-environmental conditions relationships. Results: Based on classification process, 2667 releves (about 69.2%) were classified as non-aquatic vegetation, 58 releves (about 1.5%) were not classified at all or were classified to more than one vegetation unit, and the rest, 1133 releves (i.e. about 29.4 %) were classified as aquatic vegetation. Within three classes selected for the analyses (Lemnetea, Potamogetonetea and Charetea intermediae), altogether 8 orders, 9 alliances, and 55 associations were distinguished. CCA revealed a relatively good separation of the seven pre-defined alliances in the ordination space. The first axis is related to bioregion and mean annual temperature, while the second axis shows the relationship to water depth. Bioregion was the most frequent environmental factor explaining species variability across the alliances of the aquatic vegetation, followed by temperature and water depth. Conclusion: Based on "new Cocktail" approach, we produced clear syntaxonomical classification of aquatic vegetation in Slovakia with a low number of non-classified or multiply classified releves.

Study area: Umbria-Marche Apennines (Italy). Methods: In 156 plots we collected topographic data and species cover. We identified the main forest communities using a Multivariate Regression Tree (MRT) analysis on the releves by species matrix constrained by altitude, aspect and slope angle. For the herb layer of each plot, we calculated the community-weighted mean trait values (CWMs) and functional diversity (FD) indices. We compared CWM and FD values between MRT groups at each partition of the tree graph and checked linear trends of CWMs and FD indices along gradients illustrated by topographic variables and mean Ellenberg's Indicator Values. Results: Altitude and aspect segregated the main forest types and filtered the herb layer functional structure, depending on the considered traits. We observed a shift from strategies related to cold stress and the shortness and unpredictability of growing season at the highest altitudes and on north-facing slopes, to those related to dryness at lower elevations and on south-facing slopes. Environmental filtering changed the relative abundance of traits between mountain and hilly woods, as well as functional richness of life form, vegetative propagation, pollen/spore vector, and functional evenness, divergence, and Rao's quadratic entropy of storage organs types. Within hilly forests, functional divergence increased toward north-facing slopes, while evenness increased toward south-facing slopes. Conclusions: Altitude and aspect, besides shaping the distribution patterns of sub-Mediterranean coppiced woods, influence the functional structure of their herb layer in a different manner. In mountain woods, higher altitude fosters convergence of the storage organs more suitable to tolerate cold stress. In hilly woods, drought and the heterogeneous distribution of resources on south-facing slopes increase functional evenness, whereas the higher availability of resources on north-facing slopes promotes divergence.

For this purpose, we devised an approach to assess the ESS provided by urban green spaces through the integration of social data (i.e., stakeholders' perception of the multiple benefits of green spaces) with remotely sensed data, such as high-resolution satellite images and Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point-cloud. We developed a spatially explicit indicator (or metric) called Normalized Difference Green-Building Volume (NDGB), derived from remote sensing, that can be used to predict the way people perceive the ESS conveyed by green spaces in cities. We designed the NDGB metric using the city of Bad, Southern Italy, as a case example by involving four groups of stakeholders (n = 202) to assess ten urban green spaces. Our results show a strong positive relationship between the NDGB and the way stakeholders perceive the ESS provided by these urban green spaces. Thus, our indicator accurately expresses the relationship between stakeholders' perceptions of ESS provided by green spaces and the physical data (i.e., green space structure) produced by remote sensing technology. The green space most highly evaluated by the NDGB indicator, the periurban park "Lama Balice", was also the one on which all stakeholder group responses converged, including the group of NGOs and associations, which assigned average low scores for perceived ESS across all the green spaces presented in the study. The study was developed using the city of Bari in Southern Italy as testbed. There is a need to further extend and replicate our approach to other urban systems across different regions (e.g., Northern Europe, North America, Asia), especially those which are in the process of pursuing more sustainable green infrastructure planning and development, as they could be inclined to adopt our approach in ongoing decision making processes. We believe our approach can inform planners and decision makers on ESS provision and supply them with evidence of the local co-benefits of green spaces as well as of the spatial distribution of ESS within compact urban systems.

These ecological assessments are based on the measurement of deviations between a metric's (characteristic of assemblages) observed values (obtained by sampling) and a metric's expected values in the absence of anthropogenic stressors (reference conditions). In addition, the confidence in the ecological status evaluation provided by the different biological indices is required. Numerous sources of uncertainty due to sampling variability or operator bias, for example, are often considered on observed metric values, whereas uncertainty associated with expected metric values are seldom discussed. In this study, we developed a methodology based on Monte-Carlo methods to assess the uncertainty associated with the establishment of reference values for multimetric predictive indices. This was done by randomly generating reference values and propagating the uncertainty throughout the computation of the index. This methodology can be applied to a wide variety of indices as long as it is possible to make assumptions about the statistical distributions of some of the index's numerical components (e.g. coefficients of the statistical models, metric values). The European Lake Fish Index was used to illustrate the methodology and show how this method can provide valuable information on the confidence in the ecological status defined by the index. These results also revealed that the degree of uncertainty varied between the ecological classes, which were highest for the "Moderate" class and lowest for the "Poor" and "High" classes for the ELFI.

Today, climate change and several types of land use are rapidly transforming northern ecosystems and challenging lichen growth. Since lichens are important indicators of ecosystem health and habitat suitability for reindeer, large-scale assessments are needed to estimate their past, present and future status. In our study, we aimed to develop models and equations that can be used by stakeholders to identify the occurrence of lichen-dominated boreal forests and to determine lichen conditions in those forests. Data were collected in Sweden and most input data are publicly available. We focused on mat-forming lichens belonging to the genera Cladonia and Cetraria, which are dominant species in the reindeer and caribou winter diet. Our models described lichen-dominated forests as being dominated by Scots pine (Pines sylvestris), having low basal area and thin canopy cover, and being located in south-and west-facing areas with high summer precipitation, low winter precipitation and temperature, and on gentle slopes. Within those forests, lichen biomass was positively related to tree canopy cover and summer precipitation, while negatively and exponentially related to intensity of use of the area by reindeer. Forest, meteorological, topographic and soil data can be used as input in our models to determine lichen conditions without having to estimate lichen biomass through demanding and expensive fieldwork.

Testate amoebae are sensitive hydrological indicators that offer insight into Holocene environmental change in peatlands. However, in contrast to temperate peatlands, there have only been a few studies into the ecology of testate amoebae and their efficacy as environmental indicators in permafrost peatlands. We present the first study of testate amoeba ecology from peatlands in the continuous permafrost zone, based on samples from across the Alaskan North Slope. Multivariate statistical analyses show that pore water electrical conductivity (EC), a proxy for nutrient status along the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, is the dominant control on testate amoeba distribution. Water-table depth (WTD) is also a significant control on testate amoeba distribution, but is secondary to EC. We present two new testate amoeba-based transfer functions to reconstruct both EC (TFEC) and WTD (TFWTD), the first for peatlands in the continuous permafrost zone. The transfer functions are based on Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares (WAPLS) regression and were assessed using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation. We find that both transfer functions have good predictive power. TFWTD is the best performing model (R-JACK(2) = 0.84, RMSEPJACK = 6.66 cm), but TFEC also performs well (R-JACK(2) = 0.76, RMSEPJACK, = 146 mu S cm(-1)). Our findings are similar to those conducted in peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions. The new transfer functions open the opportunity for reconstructing the Holocene dynamics of peatlands of the continuous permafrost zone in Alaska, which represent rapidly changing ecosystems.

Development of a large-scale juvenile density model to inform the assessment and management of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations in Scotland	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Capture probability; Electrofishing; Habitat; Spatial statistical model; GIS; Juvenile assessment	CHANNEL-REACH MORPHOLOGY; BROWN TROUT; LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS; CONSERVATION STOCKING; CAPTURE PROBABILITY; RIVER TEMPERATURES; HEADWATER STREAMS; HABITAT MODELS; RAINBOW-TROUT; FISH	Electrofishing data are commonly collected to assess the status of salmonid populations. However, their interpretation can be challenging without a benchmark measure of abundance against which they can be compared, leading some practitioners to question the value of these data. Juvenile density models that relate salmonid abundance to habitat characteristics offer one approach for developing spatially explicit benchmark abundances. This study collated and analysed an electrofishing dataset for Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) collected across Scotland between 1997 and 2015. Habitat was characterised using landscape proxies, derived from large scale spatial datasets. A two stage modelling approach related (1) capture probability to landscape and other covariates (2) fish density to landscape and other covariates, having adjusted for differences in capture probability. Capture probability varied with monitoring organisation, year and region, responded modally to day of the year, and decreased with upstream catchment area, river distance to sea and gradient. Salmon density increased non linearly with upstream catchment area and river distance to sea and decreased with the percentage of the riparian zone containing conifer trees. There was a south-north gradient in density, with higher densities in the north. The density model was used to develop benchmark salmon densities (reference conditions) that would be expected in river catchments that are relatively un-impacted by anthropogenic pressures and are associated with high spawner densities, resulting in near-saturation of available freshwater habitat. The benchmark densities were based on the fixed effects from the density model, excluding the effects of riparian conifer woodland and the south-north gradient, adjusted for the site-wise mean observed density in the dataset. Comparing catchment scale predictions of juvenile production against this benchmark (or some percentage of it) could provide a valuable assessment tool.

Local-scale drivers such as man-made freshwater discharges have changed the salinity, temperature and nutrient regimes, leading to the degradation of sandy beaches. However, there is still little understanding about the effects of salinity changes on the structure and functioning of sandy shores at the ecosystem level of ecological organization. This study seeks to identify the main spatial and long-term variations in a sandy beach ecosystem due to salinity changes induced by a freshwater discharge using a trophic network approach and thus linking anthropogenic pressures with functional and structural ecosystem changes. The trophic networks of nine scenarios involving three sampling sites representing different salinity stress regimes and three study phases established between 1987 and 2015 were modelled and compared. The results showed important space-time variations that were reflected at the community and ecosystem levels. A more complex trophic structure was developed with longer distances to the freshwater inflow, with higher biomass, species richness and number of predators. The highly disturbed and undisturbed sites occupied discrete, contrasting and clearly distinguishable states over time, whereas the moderately disturbed site showed a variable pattern over time. Recent trends in ecosystem indicators reflected a more fragile state, characterized by a greater organization (Ascendency) and a lower adaptive potential (Overhead) to address unexpected disturbances. Ecosystem indicators were sensitive enough to distinguish among sites and long-term phases in the ecosystem, where different organization states can persist over time. Future studies aimed at assessing press disturbances on sandy beach ecosystems should emphasize a longer time scale in order to assess the recovery capacity of these systems that are increasingly threatened by long-lasting stressors.

However, the general extent of non-random linkages between phylogeny and ecosystem services remains unclear. In this study, we examined phylogenetic clustering and associations of beneficial attributes of tree species that are essential for various aspects of ecosystem services to assess the generality of the phylogenetic bias in ecosystem service provision. Through literature mining, we compiled 15 benefits linked to a wide variety of ecosystem services for 171 tree species common in Japan to examine phylogenetic clustering in the beneficial attributes. In addition, we examined whether taxonomically different species provide different bundles, or suites, of benefits. Significant phylogenetic signals were detected in all 15 beneficial attributes even though some benefits are specific to Japanese culture. Beneficial species overlapped significantly more than random expectation for 25 of the 105 possible combinations of the benefits, whereas they differed significantly for eight combinations of the benefits. Cluster analysis classified the species into five groups by similarity of their beneficial attributes. Distribution of these groups among phylogenetic clades was significantly uneven, indicating that phylogenetically distant species tended to have different bundles of beneficial attributes. Fabids tended to provide more kinds of benefits than species in other clades. Overall our analysis suggests that, at least in tree communities of Japan, phylogenetic diversity can potentially increase ecosystem multifunctionality via complementarity of beneficial attributes among phylogenetically distant species. Future analyses of actual relationships between phylogenetic diversity and multi functionality of tree communities will provide further insights into the ecological processes sustaining ecosystem multifunctionality.

Such data include spatial, temporal, and thematic information on recreation and outdoor activities, thus can be used to quantify the demand for cultural ecosystem services (CES). So far photo content has been analyzed based on user-labeled tags or the manual labeling of photos. Both approaches are challenged with respect to consistency and cost-efficiency, especially for large-scale studies with an enormous volume of photos. In this study, we aim at developing a new method to analyze the content of large volumes of photos and to derive indicators of socio-cultural usage of landscapes. The method uses machine-learning and network analysis to identify clusters of photo content that can be used as an indicator of cultural services provided by landscapes. The approach was applied in the Mulde river basin in Saxony, Germany. All public Flickr photos (n = 12,635) belonging to the basin were tagged by deep convolutional neural networks through a cloud computing platform, Clarifai. The machine-predicted tags were analyzed by a network analysis that leads to nine hierarchical clusters. Those clusters were used to distinguish between photos related to CES (65%) and not related to CES (35%). Among the nine clusters, two clusters were related to CES: 'landscape aesthetics' and 'existence'. This step allowed mapping of different aspects of CES and separation of non-relevant photos from further analysis. We further analyzed the impact of protected areas on the spatial pattern of CES and not-related CES photos. The presence of protected areas had a significant positive impact on the areas with both 'landscape aesthetics' and 'existence' photos: the total number of days in each mapping unit where at least one photo was taken by a user ('photo-user-day') increased with the share of protected areas around the location. The presented approach has shown its potential for reliable mapping of socio-cultural uses of landscapes. It is expected to scale well with large numbers of photos and to be easily transferable to different regions.

Efficient surrogates for epiphyte invertebrate communities could reduce the cost of biomonitoring surveys while preventing destructive sampling of the plants. Here, we focus on the invertebrate communities associated to tank bromeliads. We ask whether the presence of particular ant and/or spider taxa (easily surveyed taxa) that use these plants as nesting and/or foraging habitats predicts functional trait combinations of aquatic invertebrate communities hosted by the plants. Functional community composition of invertebrates was predicted both by bromeliad habitat features and the presence of certain ant and spider species. The ant Azteca serica preferred wider bromeliad rosettes that trap large amount of detritus, indicating interstitial like food webs dominated by deposit feeders that burrow in fine particulate organic matter. Leucauge sp. spiders preferred narrower bromeliad rosettes bearing smaller detrital loads, thereby indicating a dominance of pelagic filter-feeding and predatory invertebrates in the water-filled leaf axils. Both Neoponera villosa ants and Eriophora sp. spiders preferred rosettes at intermediate size bearing moderate amounts of detritus, indicating a benthic food web dominated by leaf shredders and gathering collectors. Owing to the animal diversity and biomass supported by rainforest epiphytes, our approach would deserve to be further tested on a range of epiphytes involved in tight interactions with invertebrates. In this context, surrogate species could serve both as indicators of functional diversity, and as early-warning indicators of network disassembly.

Testate amoebae as a hydrological proxy for reconstructing water-table depth in the mires of south-eastern Australia	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Testate amoebae; Australia; Transfer function; Species-pruned; Water-table depth; Modern Analogue Technique	NEW-ZEALAND; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PEATLAND; RECORD; KEILAMBETE; VEGETATION; RHIZOPODA; DYNAMICS; VICTORIA	Although it is well established that moisture availability in south-eastern Australia has been decreasing through time recently, the driver(s) of this trend are contentious, and our understanding of any drivers is limited by a relatively short historic record. Testate amoebae have been widely used to reconstruct peatland hydrology in the Northern Hemisphere, but in the Southern Hemisphere research is still needed to assess their proficiency as a palaeohydrological proxy and to develop robust transfer functions. Here we examine the ecology of testate amoebae in several high altitude mires in south-eastern Australia and present the first transfer function for the continent. Euglypha tuberculata type, Centropyxis platystoma type and Assulina muscorum were the most common taxa in our modern samples. Water-table depth was the primary environmental variable determining testate amoebae assemblages and therefore transfer functions were developed for this ecological factor. We found that the performance of various all-species and species-pruned transfer functions were statistically robust, with R-2 values of around 0.8 and Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP) values of about 7 cm. All cross validation methods (leave-one-out RMSEP, cluster-bootstrap RMSEP, segment-wise RMSEP and leave-one-site out RMSEP from all-species and species-pruned transfer functions) suggested that the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT) was the best performing transfer function, with negligible bias evident from un-even sampling and spatial autocorrelation. We also used a new approach to evaluate the importance of taxa and the performance of our transfer functions using species-pruned methods. Our results suggest that the all-species MAT, with an RMSEP of 5.73 and R-2 of 0.86, provides the best reconstruction of water-table depth across our sites in south-eastern Australia.

Using a tree seedling mortality budget as an indicator of landscape-scale forest regeneration security	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Forest regeneration; Native forest; Young forest; Quercus/Carya; Acer/Fagus/Betula; Biodiversity	WHITE-TAILED DEER; OVERSTORY DENSITY; OAK REGENERATION; STAND-DENSITY; COMPETITIVE SUCCESS; SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; RED OAK; GROWTH; REPRODUCTION; MODELS	Securing desirable forest regeneration outcomes is an essential component of sustainable forest management. When natural reproduction is preferred over planting, achieving desirable outcomes may be the principal challenge for forest managers, as reports of struggles and even failures are common across many regions and forest ecosystems. Informing managers and policymakers of the prospects of regeneration success before practices and policies are implemented promotes long-term sustainability because rehabilitating undesirable regeneration outcomes is often lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. In 2012, the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, Forest Inventory and Analysis program implemented Regeneration Indicator (RI) protocols that added detailed seedling measurements and browse impact assessments to a subsample of inventory plots across 24 states in the northern United States. The goal of this expanded sampling effort is to improve the ability to monitor broad scale regeneration trends and better inform forest management planning and policy. Modeling probable regeneration outcomes is difficult and the rarity of vetted models that can fully utilize RI inventory data highlights an immediate need for flexible methods to evaluate regeneration of different taxa at large scales. This manuscript is premised on estimation of a tree seedling mortality budget for inventoried reproduction. The method offers a transparent structure for leveraging existing literature and expert knowledge to gain provisional insight into plausible regeneration outcomes. The resulting tool provides flexibility for users to examine regeneration for multiple species, site conditions, and user-defined quantitative regeneration objectives. The approach is demonstrated by applying a suite of multispecies regeneration objectives to RI data for two case studies with different forest composition and geographic scales, the Ozark Highland Ecological Section (OHES) and the Monongahela National Forest (MNF). Within the Quercus/Carya dominated OHES, analyses indicate that desirable regeneration outcomes are more likely than not based on current plot conditions. Regeneration events were projected to produce new fully stocked forests on 76% of OHES plots, produce a sizable component of characteristic overstory species on 57%, and produce a sizable component of commercially important species on 59%. Within the Acer/Fagus/Betula and Quercus/Caiya forests of the MNF, analyses indicated that difficulties in achieving desirable regeneration outcomes were likely. Only 36% of MNF plots were projected to produce new fully stocked forests following a regeneration event and only 29% were projected to regenerate a sizable component of either characteristic overstory species or commercially important species.

The idea that telomere dynamics may be shaped in response to such costs is already established; however, we still lack information on whether this relation translates to overall fitness. Here, we quantified LRS (number of fledged young) and longitudinal telomere dynamics of small passerine birds-the blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We found that individual telomere erosion rate was positively associated with lifetime fledgling number. Birds with more fledged young experienced increased telomere attrition. We show that telomere attrition rate, but not telomere length, is related to individual fitness and suggest that telomere dynamics may underlie reproductive costs experienced by animals as a consequence of prioritizing their lifetime fitness. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to provide evidence that more pronounced telomere erosion is associated with higher fitness gain.

We assessed volatiles emitted from the temperate grass Brachypodium distachyon L. (Poaceae) damaged by Mythimna separata Walker (Noctuidae), a specialist herbivore of Poaceae, in light/dark cycle conditions. Volatiles were preferentially emitted from the damaged plants in both light and dark phases, but their quantitative compositions were different. The generalist predator Nesidiocoris tenuis Reuter (Miridae) was attracted to the damaged plants in both light and dark conditions. However, adult females of M. separata preferred to oviposit on undamaged plants mostly in the dark owing to the cue of undamaged plant volatiles, partly in a circadian rhythm-dependent manner. The findings suggested that volatiles released in the dark contribute to both plant-herbivore and plant-herbivore enemy communications.

In the current study, to assess how B. rapa receiver plants cultivated near peppermint plants resist P. xylostella, two biological assays were conducted. The data showed that the receiver plants cultivated with peppermint exhibited lower weight gain of P. xylostella larvae, compared to that exhibited by non-receiver plants. Moreover, a lower rate of oviposition of adult female P. xylostella was observed on B. rapa plants cultivated with peppermint plants compared to the rate on B. rapa plants cultivated with glass-enclosed peppermint plants, although receiver B. rapa plants that had been previously incubated with peppermint for 7 days and non-receiver B. rapa plants exhibited similar rates of oviposition. Taking all these findings together, we conclude that cultivation of B. rapa receiver plants with peppermint results in two arrays of defense strategies.

Annual CO2 fluxes from a cultivated fen with perennial grasses during two initial years of rewetting	MIRES AND PEAT			English	Article						ecosystem respiration; gross primary production; paludiculture; reed canary grass	REED CANARY GRASS; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; SOIL RESPIRATION; CARBON BALANCE; WATER-TABLE; PEAT SOILS; VEGETATION COMPOSITION; ORGANIC SOILS	Rewetting combined with biomass crop cultivation (paludiculture) has been proposed as a method for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from drained peatlands. This field experiment compared CO2 fluxes from drained (control) and rewetted experimental plots in a temperate fen under reed canary grass cultivation over two successive years. The annual weighted mean water table depth from soil surface (WTD) during the study period was 9, 3 and 1 cm in control, semi-flooded and flooded plots, respectively. There were no significant effects of WTD treatment on biomass yields. The choice of response model for CO2 fluxes influenced annual estimates of ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP), but all models showed that ER and GPP decreased in response to rewetting. The resulting net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, derived by combining eight ER and eight GPP models, varied widely. For example, NEE (expressed as CO2-C) ranged from -935 to -208 g m(-2) yr(-1) for the flooded plots. One set of ER and GPP models was selected on the basis of statistical criteria and showed insignificant differences in NEE between the three water table treatments (-537 to -341 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)). Treatment effects on CO2 emission factors, calculated as the sum of NEE and C export in harvested biomass (58-242 g CO2-C m(-2) yr(-1)), were similarly insignificant. Thus, the results indicated that varying WTD within this narrow range could influence both ER and GPP without altering the net emissions of CO2.	[Karki, S.; Kandel, T. P.; Elsgaardl, L.; Laerke, P.

Despite its important damage, its seasonal life cycle is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the seasonal life cycle and distribution of C. vestitus between November 2013 and October 2016 in the center and south of Tunisia. We recorded the direct damage caused by beetles on pistachio branches and buds. The highest density of C. vestitus attack was detected in Elguettar 2 site (Gafsa governorate). The insect overwinters both in adults and larval stage on pistachio trees. The adults emerge to attack new suitable trees at mid-May. Reproduction started in autumn: Also, females searched suitable hosts to attack. Copulation took place either on the bark in the initial phase of egg tunnel construction or inside the tunnel system. Mean fecundity was 50.95 (+/- 9.68 SD) eggs/female. The colonization process occurred in two phases. During the first phase, feeding galleries were drilled through, the buds. In the second phase, reproduction galleries were constructed in the thick branches of the tree. The results obtained in this work are considered essential for developing optimal control of the pest. Information on the seasonal life cycle allows to anticipate the time when plant damage may take place and to design the proper management of the pest.

In the study, 1090 animal brain sample suspected of rabies were studied, using fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The results of the tests indicated 71.83% (786/1090) positivity of total animal rabies, with 41.73% (328/1090) positivity in dogs and 35.49% (279/1090) positivity in bovine. A statistically strong positive correlation was found in the prevalence of dog rabies and cattle rabies according to the years. Partial gene sequencing of rabies virus isolates from naturally infected 7 bovine brains belonging to 2009 and 2013 was performed. These isolates confirmed presence of Rabies virus (RABV) by performing gene screening in the NCBI (The National Center for Biotechnology Information) database. In addition, phylogenetic analyzes of these isolates were performed according to the partial gene sequence of RABV nucleoprotein N gene 0-510 bp. It was determined that the nucleotide sequences of the isolates of the rabies virus obtained during 2009 and 2013 were identical as shown by the partial gene sequences of viruses. In addition, these isolates were determined to have a common ancestor with the nucleotide sequences of previously isolated viruses in Turkey and neighbouring countries bordering Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia Regions. It was concluded that it must be ensured that the bovines are inoculated with the inactivated dog vaccine and the dogs must be protected against rabies disease.

Vitality of bog pine and colonising Norway spruce along environmental gradients within a bog	MIRES AND PEAT			English	Article						bog woodland; competition; drainage; Picea abies; Pinus rotundata; vitality	UNCINATA VAR. ROTUNDATA; PICEA-ABIES; JURA MOUNTAINS; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SUCCESSION; SHADE; SUN	Bog pine is an endangered species in Europe as drainage of bogs permits colonisation by Norway spruce, resulting in severe bog pine habitat loss in marginal bog forests, and a habitat shift towards the bog centre where growing conditions are extreme. Thus, we investigated the physiological causes that limit bog pine regeneration at the bog margins and growth in the centre. We measured needle nitrogen concentration, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic capacity and the morphological traits of bog pine and spruce along transects from the centre to the margin of a bog in the Black Forest, Germany. Needle nitrogen and chlorophyll contents in the bog pine increased from the centre to the margin. However, photosynthesis was independent of chlorophyll content indicating that other factors, such as light rather than nutrients, may limit regeneration of bog pine. Vitality of bog pine was highest at the edge of the bog centre. This zone appears to be a compromise between nutrient limitation and shallow water levels on the one hand, and light limitation caused by spruce on the other. Therefore, in order to conserve bog pine, it is necessary to maintain wet and open bog forests that cannot be colonised by spruce.

RESPONSES OF TROPHIC STRUCTURE VARIATION IN FISH ASSEMBLAGE TO HYDROLOGIC REGULATION IN A TRIBUTARY OF THE THREE GORGES RESERVOIR, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						reservoir regulation; stable isotope; community metrics; pathway; food resource	FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; NICHE WIDTH; RIVER; DAMS; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; STREAMS	Responses of trophic structure to reservoir regulation are important to manage and conserve the river ecosystem influenced by dams. We used stable isotope-derived community-wide metrics to describe spatiotemporal variation in trophic niches and trophic structures of fish assemblages in a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China where water level regulation is put into operation annually. A longitudinally increasing trophic space was discovered in this tributary especially when the water level was low. Trophic diversity declined and trophic redundancy increased from the non-flood period to flood season at the upper backwater region. However, trophic space was more stable in the estuarine site. The site differences were associated with availability of food resource and pathway of consumers, as specifically, disturbance derived from flow pulse at the end of backwater site altered diet composition of the fish consumers, while immense water body in the lower confluence area limited the flood influences as well as promoted exploitation of diverse available sources. Moreover, the declined water level control facilitated the contraction of the trophic niche size at the tail backwater site because of remarkable riverine morphology alternation leading to decreasing water body whereas the rising water level regulation homogenized trophic structure along the downstream river. Our study revealed that there was different response of fish assemblages along longitudinal fluvial gradient to the water level regulation in the reservoir and targeted management and conservation measures are needed for the different sections of the tributary.

FOREST EDGE EFFECTS ON SEEDLINGS IN MIXED ORIENTAL BEECH (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) - SCOTS PINE (Pinus sylvestris L.)

In addition, the effects of stand basal area and height-to-crown on height growth, root-collar-diameter growth and seedlings density were monitored. The study was conducted within Samatlar Forest Planning Directorate, in Kastamonu city, Turkey. In the selected Oriental beech-Scots pine stand, twenty-five transects were installed perpendicular to the forest edge, and all the measurements were taken within these transects. There were statistically significant relationships between the distance from the forest edge and the growth of Scots pine seedlings (p<0.05), while the stand edge did not have any effect on the growth of Oriental beech seedlings. Density of Scots pine seedlings decreased, while Oriental beech seedling density increased from the edge into the intact stand (p<0.05). Stand basal area and height-to-crown did not significantly change from the edge into the intact stand (p>0.05). The differences in seedling growth and seedling density between the two species can be associated with their dissimilar tolerance to shade. The initial results obtained in this study point out the importance of forest edges on the regeneration of Oriental beech and Scots pine seedlings. Data suggest that regeneration of mixed Oriental beech-Scots pine should be successful using group methods rather than traditional shelterwood method within entire stand.

Two doses of salt applications were conducted at 0 mM and 50 mM NaCl concentrations and the plants were cultivated in 3 repeats under 25 +/- 2 degrees C temperature and 16/8 light/dark periods based on the randomized block experimental design in climate chamber conditions. In order to determine the effect of stress, traits such as 0-5 scale, shoot and root lengths, shoot diameters, leaf number, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, leaf relative water content, membrane injury index, stoma widths and lengths, stomatal areas and stoma densities were evaluated. The reaction of the genotypes against stress was determined via mixture modeling and PCA analysis. In PCA analysis, three PCA components explained 71.48% of the total variation at 0 mM, while four components explained 69.53% of the total variation at 50 mM. As a result of the mixture modeling analysis, it was observed that 4 sub-populations for 0 mM and 3 sub-populations for 50 mM were formed and it was revealed that the salt-tolerant genotypes were in the sub-population 3 and salt-susceptible genotypes were in the sub-population 1.

However, information of root distribution in the whole rooting profile is rarely available in practice. This paper documents a method to quickly quantify root vertical distribution pattern using limited root length density data obtained from soil cores under field conditions. It was implemented through the development of a Minitab macro and an R script, with sample calculations conducted on field collected root length density data from the winter wheat crop in Texas, USA. The method is potentially useful for quantifying plant root activities in natural soils where deep roots are difficult to access by physical means and data of root length density distribution are only available in the upper root zone.

High biodiversity indicates a healthy ecosystem that functions properly because of the right combination of physical, chemical, and biological factors. Anthropogenic disturbance decreases biodiversity by modifying these factors. The Grande Ronde and Imnaha River basins in northeastern Oregon are occupied by land uses that could be disturbing aquatic ecosystems. Biological assessments (bioassessments) were used in this study to determine the effects of disturbance on macroinvertebrate community structure within the Grande Ronde, Wallowa, and Imnaha rivers. Macminvertebrate distribution and abundance data collected from upstream and downstream sites on each river were used to calculate species- and community-level metrics (e.g., richness, abundance and the Family Biotic Index [FBI]) for each site. These metrics revealed differences between sites and between rivers, as well as a decrease in water quality and biodiversity for the Grande Ronde and Imnaha rivers. The Wallowa River did not conform to this trend, likely because the upstream site was directly below an oligotrophic lake. In general, metrics were not indicative of impaired macroinvertebrate communities, but management efforts should be taken to conserve biodiversity in lower reaches of rivers within the Grande Ronde and Imnaha river basins.

Effects of the 2011 Missouri River flood on walleye natal recruitment and habitat use in Lake Sharpe, South Dakota	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY			English	Article						Habitat use; Lake Sharpe; Missouri River; natal recruitment; otolith chemistry; Sander vitreus	OTOLITH CHEMISTRY; TRACE-ELEMENT; FISHES; LARVAL; RESERVOIR; MOVEMENT; FINGERPRINTS; MANAGEMENT; ABUNDANCE; NEARSHORE	Floods affect fish populations in the short term (e.g. entrainment, mortality) and long term (e.g. recruitment, habitat availability), but oftentimes long-term effects are overlooked. In 2011, a catastrophic flood with record peak flows (4,200 m(3)/s) occurred in Lake Sharpe, a mainstem Missouri River reservoir. The flood's immediate impacts on the Lake Sharpe walleye (Sander vitreus) population have been documented, but long-term effects on natal recruitment and habitat use have not been assessed. We used otolith chemistry to evaluate spatial patterns in walleye natal recruitment and late-summer (i.e. July - September) habitat use in years before, during, and after the flood to gain insight into long-term flood impacts on the Lake Sharpe walleye population. From 2004 to 2013, all walleye hatched in embayments and main channel habitats as opposed to stilling basins or tributaries, and the majority of age >= 1 fish (i.e. age-1 or older) used the former habitats in late summer. During the flood year, natal recruitment remained stable relative to pre-flood levels in embayments (26% pre-flood, 20% during flood) and main channels (74% pre-flood, 80% during flood). Habitat use of age >= 1 walleye was generally unaltered by the flood as it remained consistent in embayments and main channel habitats before, during, and after the disturbance. Hence, the Lake Sharpe walleye population was largely unaffected by the flood in terms of natal recruitment and habitat use. Our results highlight the resilience of the Lake Sharpe walleye population to a catastrophic flood, providing fisheries professionals with an otolith chemistry approach for quantifying flood effects on natal recruitment and habitat use and developing spatially informed management approaches (e.g. habitat protection/rehabilitation, harvest regulations).

Nevertheless, little is known about the elevational patterns of plant zones and marsh edge existing along deepened navigation channels compared to their shallow anabranches. Our study analyzed the factors controlling these patterns. This knowledge is required when restoring tidal marshes to compensate for anthropogenic impacts. We determined the species-elevation-pattern in the navigable German Elbe and Weser estuaries. Using the key species Scirpus tabernaemontani, Scirpus maritimus, and Phragmites australis, we compared (1) marshes along navigation channels and anabranches and (2) their marsh edges. (3) Additionally, we tested how tidal range affects the lowest elevation of marsh edges. We analyzed data derived from digital vegetation maps and digital elevation models, and then normalized the elevation data using the mean tidal range. We determined the elevational distributions of plant zones on regularly flooded estuarine marshes and quantified the lowest elevation as an important niche boundary which reflects the resistance against physical stress. Our findings indicate that the patterns result not only from tidal range but also from hydrodynamics due to the dredging history, diversely shaped channels, bank morphologies, and vessel frequencies. The patterns found and the species-specific elevations need to be considered when choosing suitable elevations when restoring tidal marshes in dredged estuaries. The results might also inspire reconsidering the reference plants zonation while monitoring ecological potential of severely modified estuaries under Water Framework Directive.

Evidence from Eastern China	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES			English	Article						wetlands; water resources; urbanization; human disturbance; economic development	WATER-RESOURCES; IMPACTS; SUSTAINABILITY; URBANIZATION; EVOLUTION; QUALITY; WETLAND; CYCLES	Lakes are one of the most important wetland types on the earth with many ecosystem functions. With continuing economic growth and climate change, lake abundance and surface areas throughout the world have been threatened by many factors, including by human and environmental disruptions. However, we still have limited knowledge on how human activities and climate change affect lake reductions and associated ecosystem services. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of lake shrinkage will help maintain an ecological balance in urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries. We explore the determinants of lake shrinkage and abundance reduction from the 1980s to the 2010s using remote sensing data of lakes in two large cities in eastern China: Nanchang and Shanghai. In order to account for the non-independence of time-series data, time series auto-regressive generalized least squares (GLS) models were used to examine the relationship between lake area/abundance and human activities and climate change. Our results show that human activities rather than climate change, are the most important determinants for the areas and numbers of lake shrinkage, and gross domestic product (GDP) and population size could explain more than half of the variation in the number and area of lakes with areas larger than 20 ha in the two cities. GDP and lake area shrinkage do not exhibit a linear relationship. This highlights the importance of wetland protection in the early development stage. Because the main determinants are human activities, cities have the ability to protect wetlands via suitable planning.

Complex male mate choice in the brush-legged wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz)	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						experience; female state; male mate choice; rearing environment; Schizocosa ocreata	ALTERNATIVE MATING TACTICS; ORB-WEB SPIDER; SEXUAL SELECTION; CHEMICAL SIGNALS; SOCIAL EXPERIENCE; SPERM COMPETITION; FEEDING REGIME; ARANEAE; COURTSHIP; PREFERENCES	What a male finds attractive in a female can vary depending on experience and context. In the brush-legged wolf spider, when compared to lab-reared males, males that develop under natural conditions care less about a female's mating history when she is available to court but are less interested in a mated female when her location is uncertain. Further studies may shine light on the causes and benefits of these differences. Abstract Recent interest in male mate choice has prompted a re-examination of widely held beliefs regarding sex roles in animal mating systems. It is now known that males can be choosy based on female quality, but studies which directly compare the aspects of female quality and their influence on male mate choice are relatively rare. The brush-legged wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) has a well-studied male courtship display, which shows evidence of male mate choice based on female mating history and foraging history, as well as possible effects of experience and rearing environment. This makes it an excellent system to compare the importance of these 2 female states and examine how the choice patterns they give rise to may be influenced by the environment. By examining male courtship and female behavior under different circumstances and across environmental experience conditions, the relative effects of these factors can be inferred. Evidence collected in this study suggests that female mating status is the dominant predictor of mate choice, with males generally courting virgin females more vigorously regardless of context, as well as females showing higher levels of receptivity when unmated. An important exception to this trend is seen in field-reared males and their female partners, who show less behavioral differences based on female state, suggesting that this preference is not static and may be influenced by experience.

Collective behavior and colony persistence of social spiders depends on their physical environment	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						architecture; foraging; human-induced habitat modification; Stegodyphus dumicola; web	PERSONALITY; SELECTION; LEVEL; WEB; THERMOREGULATION; AVAILABILITY; EVOLUTION; ARANEAE; TRAITS; RISK	Human habitat modification can lead animals to experience more variable physical environments. For group-living animals, the physical environment can shape social interactions and, consequently, collective behavior and group persistence. Using both field-based and greenhouse experiments, we find that fence-dwelling colonies of social spiders hunt more effectively and are more likely to persist than tree-dwelling colonies. Thus, variation in the physical environment arising from human habitat modification can suggest new mechanisms for how animal societies function. Abstract The physical environment occupied by group-living animals can profoundly affect their cooperative social interactions and therefore their collective behavior and success. These effects can be especially apparent in human-modified habitats, which often harbor substantial variation in the physical environments available within them. For nest-building animal societies, this influence of the physical environment on collective behavior can be mediated by the construction of nestsnests could either buffer animal behavior from changes in the physical environment or facilitate shifts in behavior through changes in nest structure. We test these alternative hypotheses by examining the differences in collective prey-attacking behavior and colony persistence between fence-dwelling and tree-dwelling colonies of Stegodyphus dumicola social spiders. Fences and trees represent substantially different physical environments: fences are 2-dimensional and relatively homogenous environments, whereas tree branches are 3-dimensional and relatively heterogeneous. We found that fence-dwelling colonies attack prey more quickly and with more attackers than tree-dwelling colonies in both field and controlled settings. Moreover, in the field, fence-dwelling colonies captured more prey, were more likely to persist, and had a greater number of individuals remaining at the end of the experiment than tree-dwelling colonies. Intriguingly, we also observed a greater propensity for colony fragmentation in tree-dwelling colonies than fence-dwelling colonies. Our results demonstrate that the physical environment is an important influence on the collective behavior and persistence of colonies of social spiders, and suggest multiple possible proximate and ultimate mechanismsincluding variation in web complexity, dispersal behavior, and bet-hedgingby which this influence may be realized.

Songbirds have predispositions to learn songs of their own species over others, but what about species that have regional dialects? And how different are responses of baby and adult birds? We show that golden-crowned sparrow chicks, before song learning, treat foreign songs like heterospecific songs. Adults, on the other hand, show graded responses to local, foreign and heterospecific songs. This study tells us how song responses change across life stages. Abstract Understanding the causes and consequences of divergence in mate recognition traits has long been a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. In songbirds, songs are culturally transmitted, and cultural divergence can generate discrete geographic variation in song (i.e., dialects). Understanding how responses to within- versus across-species variation in songs changes across life stages may shed light on the functional significance of population divergence in learned traits. Here, we use a novel combination of song playbacks to adult and nestling golden-crowned sparrows to compare responses to local conspecific, foreign conspecific, and heterospecific songs prior to and after song learning. We found that nestlings respond equally little to both foreign conspecific and heterospecific songs. By contrast, the response of adult males to foreign conspecific songs was stronger than their response to heterospecific song, but weaker than their response to local conspecific song. Our study suggests that early local experience may interact with conspecific biases prior to song learning, in a way that has not been previously documented. Our results illustrate the importance of studying behavior at multiple life stages in order to better understand the effect of early experience on cultural and biological evolution.

Presence of carrion and hooded crows was affected by the environmental factors that modulate the party size component of fission-fusion dynamics and thereby influence social complexity. Abstract Social complexity arises from the formation of social relationships like social bonds and dominance hierarchies. In turn, these aspects may be affected by the degree of fission-fusion dynamics, i.e., changes in group size and composition over time. Whilst fission-fusion dynamics has been studied in mammals, birds have received comparably little attention, despite some species having equally complex social lives. Here, we investigated the influence of environmental factors on aspects of fission-fusion dynamics in a free-ranging population of carrion and hooded crows (Corvus corone ssp.) in the urban zoo of Vienna, Austria over a 1-year period. We investigated 1) the size and 2) spatio-temporal structure of the local flock, and 3) environmental influences on local flock and subgroup size. The local flock size varied considerably over the year, with fewest birds being present during the breeding season. The spatio-temporal structure of the local flock showed 4 distinct presence categories, of which the proportions changed significantly throughout the year. Environmental effects on both local flock and subgroup size were time of day, season, temperature, and weather, with additional pronounced effects of the structure of the surroundings and age class on subgroup size. Our findings show environmental influences on party size at the local flock and subgroup level, as well as indications of structured party composition in respect to the 4 presence categories. These results suggest that environmental factors have significant effects on fission-fusion dynamics in free-ranging crows, thereby influencing social complexity.

We show that a simple strategy of maintaining a single heading for a given amount of time can account for the turtles' postnesting migrations directed to targets along the Brazilian coast, while for prebreeding migrations aimed at reaching the isolated Ascension Island, reliance on more complex, map-like systems seems crucial. Abstract Vector navigation, i.e., maintaining a constant heading for a given amount of time, is hypothesized to provide a viable basis for the navigational feats of a number of long-distance animal migrants. Since animals following this strategy are subject to drift by wind or by ocean current, performing long migrations relying on vector navigation is particularly challenging. We tested whether vector navigation could be involved in the migrations of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) that migrate between the remote Ascension Island and Brazil. To this aim, a novel approach was followed using individual-based numerical models to simulate migratory trajectories of virtual turtles that were compared to actual routes reconstructed by satellite. Simulated postnesting migrations from Ascension revealed that weak currents enabled modeled turtles to reach the Brazilian coast, but only for a limited range of headings around due West. This conclusion was corroborated by comparing modeled trajectories with the actual routes of previously tracked turtles, with a beeline vector navigation strategy providing the best fit, although a true-navigation strategy directed to the landfall site produced similar results. Finally, we tested if a vector navigational strategy was feasible for the prebreeding migration from Brazil towards Ascension, but modeled routes mostly failed to reach the island or a larger area around it, with individuals drifting away under the influence of currents. We conclude that Ascension turtles can take advantage of vector navigation when migrating towards a wide target like the Brazilian coast, while the demanding prebreeding migration likely requires more complex navigational systems.

Within-individual variation in sexual displays: signal or noise?

Within-individual variation does not appear to signal male quality as a potential mate and may simply obscure mean male trait values. Female treefrogs nevertheless prefer males who produce consistent signals of male quality but may not be able to express this preference in dense breeding aggregations, which produce high levels of chorus noise. Abstract Animal sexual displays are typically repeated over time and consist of components that are also repeated within a display, creating potential for within-individual variation in signal production. Across taxa, patterns of variation in and female preferences for temporal properties of signals are well documented, but data describing how within-individual variation functions in communication are scarce. Is within-individual variation itself a signal of male quality, or noise that obscures another signal encoded by a temporal pattern? In this study of Cope's gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, we used synthetic advertisement calls to examine the function of within-individual variation in two signal traits: pulse rate, a signal of species identity, and call rate, a signal of male quality. We examined relationships between male body condition and coefficients of variation within males for both signal traits. We then measured female preferences for within-individual variation. Because treefrogs communicate in noisy social aggregations, we repeated the experiment in quiet and at three amplitudes of chorus-shaped noise to evaluate how within-individual variation affects mate choice in natural settings. Within-individual variation in signal production was not predicted by male condition and likely acts as noise in this communication system. Females strongly discriminated against highly variable call rates, but not pulse rates, when the mean trait values of signals were taken into account. At its highest level, chorus noise abolished this effect, suggesting female preferences against within-individual variation are unlikely to be expressed in dense social aggregations.

Non-aggressive invasive species that avoid conflict, but are also highly competitive are much less common in the literature. We revealed the absence of aggression in the highly successful invasive Asian house gecko in direct encounters with both conspecifics, and with an ecologically similar, aggressive native Australian house gecko. Abstract Invasive species are implicated in native species declines globally, but predicting the effect of specific invaders on a given native species remains difficult. Many successful invaders are highly aggressive, whereas others are not. The highly successful invasive Asian house gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, has achieved a pantropical distribution. We investigated direct interactions between H. frenatus and a sympatric native Australian house gecko (Gehyra dubia) to determine the strength and nature of aggressive exclusion and which species may be competitively superior. Intraspecific aggression was strong in the native, and individuals were more aggressive as residents than as intruders, suggesting this species shows site defence. In contrast, the invasive species displayed little aggression in intraspecific encounters. Overall, residents of the native species were more aggressive than residents of the invasive species. Aggression in the native species was influenced by the degree of aggression of the intruding gecko, but not by the species of intruder. Aggression from invasive residents was low and was not influenced by either the intruder's species or their behavior. Our study suggests that native Australian house geckos (G. dubia) are unlikely to be directly displaced by invasive H. frenatus, but rather that this native gecko will aggressively defend its resources when necessary. In this case, the tolerance of the invasive species for others in close proximity may contribute to its success.

Using 3-spined sticklebacks and artificial prey, we studied how manipulation of 2 visual properties of the eyespot, size, and internal contrast, while keeping prey conspicuousness constant, influence where attacking fish direct their strikes. An increase in size and internal contrast, independently of each other, significantly increased the divertive effect of eyespots. This increases our knowledge about the selection pressures that shape eyespots. Abstract Recent studies have shown that some eyespots of prey divert the strikes of predators, increasing the likelihood of prey escape. However, little is known about what makes eyespots effective divertive (deflective) prey marks. The size of eyespots varies much both between and even within taxa. Yet, whether size is important for the divertive function of eyespots is unknown. Furthermore, eyespots have often been described as highly contrasting, but the effects of contrast on the divertive function of eyespots has never been tested experimentally. Using artificial prey and the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model for predator cognition and behavior, we tested the importance of size as well as internal contrast for the divertive effect of eyespots. We independently increased the internal contrast and size of eyespots and found that both increased the divertive effect. The effect of size was significant over all 4 subsequent prey presentations, whereas the effect of contrast decreased after the initial presentations. These results suggest that the size and contrast of divertive marks are probably shaped by selection imposed by predation. We also discuss the involvement of predation in the seasonal and ontogenic plasticity of eyespots found in some taxa.

Predators target prey vulnerabilities to maximize hunting success, while prey trade-off foraging against predation avoidance. Though studies have demonstrated how predation risk can alter how prey allocate daily foraging effort, little work has considered the implications of this temporal component of behavior from a predator's perspective, or assessed its influence on broad-scale predator-prey interactions. We develop a method to compare daily activity patterns of avian predators and prey using data from 2 large citizen science datasets collected on different continents. Our analyses reveal evidence for convergent daily hunting strategies across avian predators, with distinct differences according to prey type. By comparing predator data with correspondent data from songbirds, our study suggests that predators (Accipiters) specialized to hunt songbirds match the activity patterns of their prey species. These results indicate predators have evolved common temporal hunting strategies to exploit temporal patterns in prey behavior.	[Lang, Stephen D.

However, empirical tests of such hypotheses have largely focused on mating systems in which female choice is known to play a large role. In insular reptile populations, cryptic choice may be important for overcoming constraints on precopulatory choice and diversifying breeder representation. We carried out pedigree reconstructions of 50 clutches of critically endangered Cyclura nubila caymanensis (Sauria: Iguanidae) to investigate the prevalence and efficacy of strategies theorized to optimize genetic compatibility among mate pairs. We found that females mating disassortatively and multiply, but not with respect to male heterozygosity, tended to produce more heterozygous offspring on average. Pair relatedness also had a negative effect on hatching success, whereas additional sires positively influenced clutch size. Despite evidence for direct and indirect benefits, females did not mate with more outbred or genetically dissimilar males than expected by chance. Our data imply strong reproductive skew among males, with geographic proximity and body size largely predicting siring success. Multiple-paternity occurred in a minimum of 38% of clutches. Paradoxically, females were not more promiscuous when confronted with more males, as demonstrated at a site supporting high local densities. Our data imply that while female-mating behaviors have the potential to confer adaptive benefits in this small population, the trajectory of mating system evolution may be largely constrained by sexual conflict.

Optimal foraging or surplus killing: selective consumption and discarding of salmon by brown bears	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						brown bear; optimal foraging; prey selection; surplus killing	PARTIAL PREY CONSUMPTION; REPRODUCTIVE LIFE-SPAN; SOCKEYE-SALMON; URSUS-ARCTOS; BODY-SIZE; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; SPAWNING MIGRATION; ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA; HABITAT FEATURES; RIPARIAN FORESTS	Selective consumption of prey by predators, observed in many animals, is often attributed to optimal foraging. Consistent with this idea, brown bears (Ursus arctos) often exhibit partial consumption, feeding exclusively on lipid-rich tissues of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and discarding remains. However, bears also kill and abandon salmon without consuming any tissue. These discarded fish may be consistent with optimal foraging choices if they are of poor quality and if bears have easy access to better prey, or may reveal nonadaptive surplus killing behavior if fish are killed and discarded at random or solely based on prey abundance. Using 21 consecutive years of data from sockeye salmon (O. nerka) carcass surveys in Alaska, we found that foraging to maximize energy intake best explained prey discarding behavior. Specifically, discarding was more common under high prey abundance, late in the salmon run, and with low-quality prey. Patterns of tissue consumption were consistent with these findings; bears were less likely to consume belly, body, and brain tissue when prey condition decreased. Other factors not quantified here (e.g., bear demography, alternative food resources) almost certainly influence prey discard and partial consumption, though the salmon-related factors explored here strongly influenced bear foraging decisions that were consistent with optimal foraging theory. We did not find clear evidence of surplus killing behavior in brown bears foraging on salmon, but prey selectivity manifested itself through both discarding and partial consumption, which contributes to our ability to predict transport of salmon nutrients by bears across ecosystem boundaries.

Floral community predicts pollinators' color preference: implications for Batesian floral mimicry	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Batesian mimicry; color vision; conditioning; flower color; learning; pollination; vision	PROBOSCID FLY POLLINATION; DECEPTIVE ORCHID; VISION; DROSOPHILA; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; PLANTS; BEES; DISCRIMINATION; EVOLUTION	Animals that rely on nectar are expected to display floral trait preferences correlating to the signals of nectar source flowers. Batesian mimicry evolves to exploit these pre-existing signal-receiver relationships, attracting pollinators through an adaptive resemblance to specific co-occurring rewarding species. The nectar-feeding long-proboscid flies of South Africa are pollinators for several deceptive orchid species that are putatively Batesian mimics. We tested whether flies' measured color preference varied among communities providing different nectar-source diets, which would indicate the necessary signal-receiver conditions for the evolution of advergent Batesian mimicry. We introduced artificial rewardless flowers into flowering communities that supported divergent nectar diets in resident flies and inferred floral trait preferences of a long-proboscid fly species (Prosoeca ganglbaueri) from visitation behavior to these artificial flowers. The experiment showed that the preference of flies for white versus pink was strongly predicted by the colors of flowers most commonly visited by flies at a site. Furthermore, generalization in preference was positively correlated with the variance in nectar-community hue, i.e., flies showed more generalized preference in more spectrally diverse flower communities. The floral tube length of local nectar sources also influenced how readily the flies probed the artificial flowers during attempted foraging. These results support the hypothesis that nectarless orchids pollinated by P. ganglbaueri experience selection for traits that exploit site-specific mutualistic relationships between fly pollinators and their local floral communities.

Long-term selection experiments for survival in stressful conditions are valuable for understanding how survival traits may trade-off with other traits, such as reproduction. We investigated how courtship behaviors and female choice may vary under stressful conditions in Drosophila melanogaster by mating females and males from starvation-selected lines with unselected-control lines. Males from starvation-selected lines had reduced courtship behaviors with fewer wing bouts per minute and shorter duration of wing bouts compared with control males, regardless of female pairing. These results are consistent with increased survival in starvation conditions showing trade-offs in males. Female mate selectivity also showed significant evolutionary changes with unselected-control females exhibiting differential courtship durations: shorter courtship durations when paired with males from unselected-control lines and longer courtship durations with males from starvation-selected lines. In contrast, starvation-selected females showed no significant differences in courtship duration between unselected-control and starvation-selected males, despite the reduction in starvation-selected male courtship behaviors. We discuss how these results may indicate that starvation selection altered the interaction between females and males for mating ability and preferences in a complex manner consistent with life-history trade-off models.

It is well known that directional and negative frequency-dependent selection by predators can influence the persistence of color polymorphisms in their prey, but much less attention has been paid to the idea that prey behavior could generate selection on predator color morphs. In this study, we examine the role that avoidance behavior by honeybees might play in selection on a color-polymorphic sit-and-wait predator, the crab spider Synema globosum. In 2 field experiments, we offered flowers harboring spiders of different color morphs to foraging honeybees. In the first, we tested for a preexisting propensity in honeybees to avoid one spider morph over another, and whether this behavior is influenced by the flower species on which spiders hunt. In the second, we tested the ability of bees to learn to avoid spider morphs associated with a previous simulated attack. Our results suggest that honeybees do not impose strong directional selection on spider morphs in our study population, and that avoidance behavior is not influenced by flower species. However, we find evidence that honeybees learn to avoid spiders of a color morph that has previously been associated with a simulated attack. These findings are the first empirical evidence for a mechanism by which prey behavior might generate negative frequency-dependent selection on predator color morphs, and hence potentially influence the long-term persistence of genetic and phenotypic diversity in predator populations.

Recent studies have found that carnivores also have this capacity, despite their more nutritionally homogeneous diet. However, unlike herbivores and omnivores who prioritize protein intake when restricted to imbalanced foods, carnivores instead show much stricter regulation of fat intake. These choices to over- or under-consume nutrients when the intake target cannot be achieved are known as rules of compromise. To date, studies examining these rules have all been carried out at a single life stage, and it is unclear if these rules regarding the prioritization of nutrients are fixed or labile. We address this question with a carnivorous beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides. We use a combination of dietary restriction and choice tests to determine the intake target and rules of compromise in reproductively mature beetles and in newly emerged adults undergoing a period of maturation feeding. We show that, despite having very similar intake targets, the rules of compromise differ between the 2 life stages. Although mature adults follow the typical carnivore rule of fat prioritization, immature adults behave more like omnivores, showing strict regulation of protein intake, resulting in obesity when restricted to protein-poor diets. These alternate rules suggest different mechanisms or capacities to cope with excess protein across these life stages. Examining how intake targets and rules of compromise change across life stages could be a valuable approach for our understanding of how animals will fare under rapidly changing environmental conditions.

Therefore, we measured four types of indices (soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activities, microbial number and bacterial diversity) for 120 soil samples which had been taken from 4 hydrologic environmental gradients in 10 typical study sites in Lijiang watershed, and analyzed the correlation between the indices and their change trend along the hydrological environment. The results showed that there were a strong coupling and mutual exclusion among different types of characteristic indices of soil in the Lijiang riparian zones; Soil bacterial diversity (phylogenetic diversity, operational taxonomic units, Chao1) was positively correlated with soil pH and negatively correlated with soil organic matter and catalase; Bacteria and actinomycetes number had a positive correlation with available nitrogen, acid phosphatase and sucrase. There were also significant differences in soil physicochemical properties and microbial community structure under different hydrological environments, featuring with the characteristic of gradual change. With decrease of inundation frequency, the bacterial diversity (operational taxonomic units, phylogenetic diversity) decreased gradually, and the soil organic matter, available nitrogen, fungi number and the catalase activity increased gradually; the soil pH value, number of bacteria and actinomycetes, invertase and acid phosphatase activities increased first and then decreased. The research emphasized to maintain the integrity of the hydrological environment gradient and adapt to the gradually changing structure of riparian soil ecosystem, which are the factors to be considered fully during the ecological restoration of the Lijiang riparian zone.

Marginal populations could be outposts allowing cedar to expand its presence in the north in response to climate change. This study aimed to characterize the spatio-temporal regeneration dynamics of 20 marginal cedar stands in order to evaluate their expansion capacity into adjacent black spruce stands. Cedar recruitment within marginal cedar stands was mainly by layering, which allowed the species to maintain for a long time in the landscape. However, the rate of expansion of marginal stands into adjacent black spruce stands through seed dispersal was very low (0.28 m.year(-1)) and it was negatively influenced by distance to seed trees. Substrate had no significant effect. Global warming could lead to increased seed production by cedar, which could favour the species' expansion at its northern distribution limit. However, global warming could also increase the frequency and severity of wildfires, which would have a negative effect on cedar expansion capacity.

Autogenic ecological succession of a pristine peat bog: focus on factors affecting beetle diversity	ECOSCIENCE			English	Article						Succession; diversity; peat bog; Coleoptera; assemblages	RESOURCE-BASED HABITAT; CONSERVATION; DEFINITION; NEED	Elements of the ancient periglacial flora such as peat bog shrubs provide a paleorefugium in Central Europe for survival of glacial biota and other cold-adapted species during recent climate change. This study provides evidence that diversity of one of the most numerous consumers in peat bogs, beetles, was higher in mid-successional stages characterized by the highest degree of shrub encroachment, compared with early and old stages. The main autogenic factor driving successional changes of herb-shrub layer coleopteran assemblages were shrub cover and bog water level. Younger successional stages contained the highest abundance of herb dwellers (chortobionts) and polyphagous species, whereas middle and old stages contained shrub inhabitants (chamebionts), which are oligophagous species specializing on ericaceous dwarf shrubs. Species richness and abundance of cold-adapted inhabitants of peat bogs (tyrphobiontic and tyrphophilous) increased from young to old successional stages along with increased shrub cover. Herb dwellers and polyphagous species are among the first primary consumers to colonize peat bogs. With changes in late-successional habitats, in particular the invasion of ericaceous dwarf shrubs, chamebiontic and oligophagous species start colonizing.

In the Red Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) calls are an important trait for mate choice. In this species, calls having the same function (e.g., flight calls or excitement calls) are known to be clustered in distinct groups, so called 'call types'. Each individual utters only calls of one call type. The driving force for the differentiation of Red Crossbill call types in the Palearctic remains unknown, as call types often overlap in space, and time and birds can be seen feeding on the same seeds. In this study, we investigated calls of crossbills, recorded within seven years in the Western Palearctic. We found at least 17 distinct call types of Red Crossbill and at least two call types of Parrot Crossbill (Loxia pytyopsittacus). There were obvious differences in call type delimitation between the northern and southern part of the study area. We argue this is in conflict with the ecological differentiation hypothesis and propose that there are other or further driving forces for this differentiation process.

Yet, challenging terrain and survey costs hinder the collection of data needed to estimate absolute abundance or population densities for New Zealand's forest birds. Acoustic sampling is being used more frequently to increase efficiency in avian monitoring and paired sampling facilitates robust density estimation from acoustic data. In paired sampling. point counts are conducted simultaneously by human observers and autonomous recording units (ARU s) to allow estimation of statistical offsets that correct biases in ARU data relative to human observers. These offsets can then be used to calibrate count data collected only by ARUs in a larger sampling scheme. However, the effectiveness of paired sampling has not yet been evaluated in New Zealand. We assessed bias in bird counts from ARUs relative to traditional point counts and evaluated whether paired sampling reduced ARU bias, when present, at 280 count stations in six indigenous forest patches on the North Island from January to April 2017. For 13 forest bird species, we estimated delta a statistical offset that represents the ratio of the effective detection radius (EDR) of the ARU data to human count data and compared bias in density estimates from ARUs relative to human observers between models with and without delta offsets. We found that delta estimates of EDR ratios were near 1.0 and 95% confidence intervals around delta overlapped 1.0 for nine of 13 species. Furthermore. densities produced by ARU counts were unbiased relative to human point counts for nine of 13 species. When models included delta offsets, ARU density estimate bias was removed for all species. Thus, paired acoustic sampling offers a promising strategy for increasing the efficiency, and spatial and temporal coverage of bird population monitoring across New Zealand.

These traits potentially put kea at risk of poisoning during vertebrate pest poisoning operations. However, as kea fall prey to introduced pests, they also gain from pest control, creating a cost-benefit situation. Pest control in kea habitat is mainly by aerial 1080, the distribution of sodium fluoroacetate poison pellets by helicopter. Understanding the net outcome for kea of this pest control method is extremely important because kea are endangered and aerial 1080 use is controversial. We use 222 monitoring cases of individually marked kea at 19 aerial 1080 operations to model kea survival of aerial 1080 operations with respect to five variables. Proximity to human-occupied sites where kea scrounge human food was inversely related to survival; the odds of survival increased by a factor of 6.9 for remote kea compared to those that lived near scrounging sites. High survival in remote areas is explained by innate neophobia and a short field-life of prefeed baits, which together preclude acceptance of poison baits as familiar food. Elevated risk to kea living near scrounging sites is explained by learned neophilia, possibly exacerbated by lead poisoning. Survival was also related to the history of aerial 1080 treatment at a site: the odds of survival increased by a factor of 21.3 at sites with repeated operations compared with first time treatments. This effect is possibly due to selection for neophobic phenotypes. We suggest that 1080 poisoning risk management for kea should focus on reducing human food availability through an advocacy campaign. If most kea have not been fed by humans, then the long term outcome of the South Island aerial 1080 programme should be positive for the kea.

Ecology of scree skinks (Oligosoma waimatense) in O Tu Wharekai Wetland, mid-Canterbury high country, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; flooding; Oligosoma; predation; skink; Southern Alps	REPTILIA SCINCIDAE; GENUS OLIGOSOMA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIZARD; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; EXTINCTION; SURVIVAL	Many of New Zealand's 104 lizard taxa are restricted to the country's main islands where they are vulnerable to a range of threats. Information on population trends and basic ecological data are lacking for most species, hampering conservation efforts. We monitored a population of scree skinks (Oligosoma waimatense; conservation status: Nationally Vulnerable) in an alluvial stream bed in O Tu Wharekai Wetland in the midCanterbury high country over 10 years (2008-2018) to understand aspects of the population's ecology, and to clarify potential threats and options for management. Although there was no linear trend in scree skink capture numbers over this time, an 84% decline was observed following severe and unseasonal flooding in May 2009. Capture numbers recovered over c. 8.5 years in the absence of any species management. Skinks ranged in size from 60-114 mm (snout-to-vent length). Home range size estimates varied from 39.5 to 950 m(2) (100% Minimum Convex Polygons) and their mean size was smaller than those reported for closely-related species. Photo-identification was not sufficiently accurate for long-term individual identification. Threats at our study site include severe flooding, predation by pest mammals, weed encroachment and human interference. Climate change is likely to increase future flood risk to this population and to other threatened species inhabiting the upland reaches of Southern Alps rivers. We recommend: (1) continued monitoring at our study site to assess long-term trends in a flood-prone population of scree skinks; (2) monitoring of four additional populations in scree habitat for 10 years to determine threats and management needs; (3) a survey of Black Jacks Island in Lake Benmore to determine whether the species (last seen there in the 1980s) is still present; and (4) the immediate removal of wilding conifers and other exotic trees from affected sites.

Costs and benefits of aerial 1080 operations to Western weka (Gallirallus australis australis)	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						compound 1080; Gallirallus australis; mortality; nest success; non-target species; pest control; sodium fluoroacetate; weka	SODIUM MONOFLUOROACETATE 1080; ROBINS PETROICA-AUSTRALIS; POSSUM CONTROL OPERATIONS; NEW-ZEALAND; NORTH-ISLAND; PUREORA FOREST; PEST-CONTROL; POISONING OPERATIONS; MUSTELA-ERMINEA; BIRDS	The impact of aerially applied 1080 poison on a Western weka (Gallirallus australis australis) population was assessed at Tennyson Inlet, Marlborough Sounds, between September 2010 and June 2016. We estimated mortality and the incidence of sublethal poisoning as a direct consequence of two aerial 1080 operations and examined the differences in nest success, chick survivorship and adult survivorship. Most weka in the treated block appear to have been sublethally poisoned but only one of 58 (1.8%) radio-tagged weka died as a direct consequence of 1080 application. Both adult and chick survivorship were higher in the treated block, but nest success was unaffected by the observed reduction in rat and stoat abundances following the 1080 operation. The net effect of aerial 1080 application on this weka population was positive when the operation followed a beech (Nothofagaceae) mast and stoat (Mustela erminea) irruption, as adult and chick survivorship after the operation exceeded adult mortality during the operation. However, 1080 operations carried out when stoats are uncommon may have a minor negative impact on weka populations due to the risk of primary poisoning without compensatory increases in survivorship.

Invertebrates of an urban old growth forest are different from forest restoration and garden communities	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						habitat; invertebrates; remnant forest; restoration success; suburban gardens; urban forest	NEW-ZEALAND; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; INSECT COMMUNITIES; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; BUTTERFLIES; URBANIZATION; LANDSCAPE; RESERVES	Areas of indigenous forest in urban and rural areas are often the last remaining examples of lowland ecosystems that were once extensive before human settlement. Conserving the indigenous invertebrate species in these remnants requires knowledge of how many taxa are functionally isolated and how many are capable of dispersing to, and persisting in, forest restoration sites and the surrounding matrix. Invertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera) in Riccarton Bush, a 7.8 ha old growth forest remnant New Zealand were compared with suburban gardens and Wigram Retention Basin, a 10-year old 2 ha forest restoration site in Christchurch, New Zealand. Insects were collected with Malaise traps and all Lepidoptera. Coleoptera, and Diptera: Sciaroidea (fungus gnats) were sorted and identified. We also compared our survey with previous Malaise trap surveys of Christchurch restoration sites (Travis and Styx wetlands). Insect composition in the remnant forest was well differentiated from the other habitats: indigenous taxa detected only in the remnant comprised of 27 species of Coleoptera (60% of total), 12 species of fungus gnats (27% of total), and 22 species of Lepidoptera (21% of total). Species accumulation curves suggested that most species not detected in gardens were truly absent. The restoration habitat we surveyed was more similar in species richness and composition to surrounding gardens than it was to the remnant forest. The three restoration habitat sampling sites only shared five species exclusively with the remnant forest sites, suggesting that either these restoration sites provide unsuitable habitat, or have yet to be reached by the species living in the remnant forest. Previous studies suggest that indigenous invertebrate communities can gradually colonise habitat restoration sites, but the timespans over which this occurs are long and the process poorly understood. Our study highlights the importance of preserving remnants for conserving invertebrate biodiversity and the challenges of mitigating biodiversity loss through forest restoration.

Ecological diversity of planktonic protists in spatial regimes of the Arabian Sea revealed through next-generation sequencing	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Arabian sea; Oxygen gradients; Eukaryotic microbes; Diversity; Environmental influence; Next-generation sequencing	ANOXIC CARIACO BASIN; EUKARYOTIC COMMUNITY; COASTAL; PICOPLANKTON; PHYTOPLANKTON; PATTERNS; DISTANCE; WATERS	Eukaryotic microbes inhabiting diverse ecological niches are capable of mediating biogeochemical shifts. Here, we studied the distribution patterns of protistan community in oxygen-deficient sites in the Arabian Sea and nearby estuarine waters. Protist diversity was quantified through Illumina Miseq sequencing of the V4 region of 18S rRNA gene amplicons. Overall, 12687 OTUs represented the diverse protist communities at various sampling sites such as the open ocean, outer shelf and inner shelf along the oxygen gradient. As per Alpha diversity estimation, estuarine communities were less diverse than the coastal, and open ocean sites. Multivariate analysis was applied to differentiate the community structure in estuarine, coastal and open ocean sites. The results indicated distinct community variation between oxic, hypoxic and suboxic water column at a comparatively deep sea station. However, the influence of dissolved oxygen was statistically insignificant for the protist distribution. The DistLM analysis suggests that the adaptation of protist communities across the spatial habitats could be significantly correlated with temperature, salinity, and nitrate. Moreover, chlorophyll a was the important environmental variable associated with the estuarine complex, whereas salinity, nitrate, and temperature influenced coastal and open ocean stations.

Population variations of Opal fish, Bembrops caudimacula Steindachner, 1876 from Arabian Sea and Andaman Sea: Evidence from otolith morphometry	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Bembrops caudimacula; Arabian sea; Andaman sea; Otolith	COD GADUS-MORHUA; SHAPE-ANALYSIS; HOPLOSTETHUS-ATLANTICUS; SAGITTAL OTOLITHS; MORPHOLOGY; SIZE; DISCRIMINATION; SALINITY; PISCES; SPP.	Bembrops caudimacula dominates the deep-sea trawl catch in the exploratory surveys and as bycatch in the commercial trawling targeting deep-sea shrimps, in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone. The intra-species variability in the bathy-demersal fish Bembrops caudimacula collected from two different ecosystems in the Indian Ocean were studied using otolith morphometric analysis. Five otolith size parameters (ferret length, ferret width, area, perimeter and weight), and five shape indices (roundness, rectangularity, ellipticity, form factor and circularity) were taken from forty-seven otoliths collected from two regions. Principal component analysis (PCA) and non-parametric PERMANOVA successfully differentiate the fishes from two regions based on the otolith morphometry. PCA indicated that ellipticity and otolith weight were the major factor responsible for the variation. The study indicated that otoliths of the fishes collected from Andaman Sea (part of Bay of Bengal) were more elliptic and massy compared to those collected from the Arabian Sea. This is the first work on the differentiation of B. caudimacula population from these two unique ecosystems, using otolith morphometry which is highly imperative to understand its population structure. Our study confirmed the suitability of otolith morphometric studies as an easiest and inexpensive method for differentiating the fish populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, how bid prices for parrotfishes (Scaridae spp.) determined at auction were investigated in a tropical island, southern Japan (Yaeyama fish market, Okinawa) between April 2011 and March 2015. Six factors, i.e. month, supply, size of fish, fishing gear type, bruising on the body, and endo-parasitic infection were chosen as variables, and their effects on bid prices were investigated using a generalized linear model with a log-normal error distribution in six selected species (Chlorurus microrhinos, Hipposcarus longiceps, Scarus ghobban, S. rivulatus, S. rubroviolaceus, Bolbometopon muricaturn). All variables significantly affected the prices. The effects of supply were thought to remain for up to seven days from the AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion) comparison, and the supply affected prices more than month did. For all species, the prices increased with fish size for smaller size ranges, but inversely decreased for larger size ranges. Prices of medium sized species took the highest values at 1.0-2.0 kg in size. Scarid fishes were mainly caught by spearfishing at night, but spear bruising on the body, parasitic infection, and being caught by gillnet significantly reduced prices (ca. minus 200-300 yen/kg for each case). Results obtained here are useful to increase the catch of higher quality fish by regulation (size, season, site etc.), to help reduce risk of price collapse triggered by large catch (oversupply), and to enable discussion of appropriate fisheries management practices.

Combining potentially incompatible community datasets when harmonizing forest inventories in subarctic Alaska, USA	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						beta-diversity; bootstrapped ordination; boreal forests; community compositions; cross-validation; forest ecology; interior Alaska; national forest inventory; nonmetric multidimensional scaling; procrustes analysis; species abundance distributions; species pools	BETA-DIVERSITY; BOOTSTRAPPED ORDINATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; TRAIT VARIATION; PLOT SIZE; METAANALYSIS; DISSIMILARITY; DISTURBANCE; NESTEDNESS; FRAMEWORK	Aims Plant responses to disturbances and environmental variation can manifest in communities as compositional nestedness (i.e., one community is a subset of another) and/or turnover (two communities represent different compositional gradient spaces). Yet, different sampling designs can artificially give an illusion of such compositional differences among two datasets, making it problematic to harmonize them in multi-species analysis. We test the prediction that sampling differences which increase beta-diversity components (nestedness and turnover) among two vegetation datasets will decrease their exchangeability. Location Boreal forests of Tanana River region, interior Alaska, USA. Methods We develop novel methods for comparing compositional variation among two datasets in nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. Resampled NMDS establishes internal sampling variability for each dataset independently, and reciprocal NMDS determines external exchangeability when the two are mutually exchanged. We first compare simulated data with specified beta-diversity differences, then evaluate two forest inventories based on local vs regional sampling designs in Alaska's boreal forests. Results As simulated species turnover and nestedness increased, internal sampling variability remained essentially constant, but external exchangeability progressively declined. Species turnover (not nestedness) had the larger negative effect on exchangeability. Among the boreal forest inventories, internal sampling variability was relatively similar, and exchangeability was weakly moderate, but the regional inventory exhibited much better fit to broad-scale environment. Species turnover (not nestedness) contributed the majority of beta-diversity differences among the two forest inventories, suggesting that strong environmental gradients were unequally represented. Conclusions Species turnover alters multivariate outcomes more drastically than species nestedness. Therefore, combining two vegetation datasets may be inadvisable when turnover prevails. Instead, a multi-scale perspective, with separate but complementary forest inventory analyses, can portray local and regional variation at appropriate scales. Our method is tractable for assessing exchangeability of potentially inconsistent sampling designs, like those that are common in synthesis studies and long-term ecological monitoring.

Floating ability, shoot length and abundance facilitate hydrochorous dispersal of moss and liverwort fragments	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						asexual hydrochory; asexual reproduction; bryophyte dispersal; dispersal vector; long-distance dispersal; moss dispersal; moss regeneration; vegetative dispersal; vegetative propagules; water dispersal	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; ASEXUAL PROPAGULES; SPORES; STREAM; PLANTS; BRYOPHYTES; MODEL	Question Vegetative diaspores are pivotal to the ability of bryophytes to colonize new areas, but life-history traits and other factors facilitating vegetative hydrochorous dispersal are largely unknown. Here, we ask whether hydrochorous dispersal of vegetative bryophyte fragments can be predicted by specific traits in addition to discharge and abundance of species in the vegetation. Location The Twentekanaal, a navigation canal in the Netherlands. Methods Over a one-year period, viable bryophyte fragments dispersed in the canal were quantified using a 200-mu m net and related to five potentially predicting variables. These variables are fragment buoyancy, shoot length, growth form, abundance in the vegetation and discharge. Buoyancy of fragments including regeneration was determined experimentally for all species found; other traits were derived from the literature. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model approach was adopted to identify the traits and trait-discharge interactions best explaining the presence of fragments in water. Results Of the 144 samples collected, 77% contained bryophyte fragments. A total of 54,514 fragments were counted, representing 18 species. The free-floating Riccia fluitans was the most abundant species, followed by Brachythecium rutabulum. In total, 55% of the variation in diaspore presence of sessile species could be explained by abundance in the vegetation, buoyancy and shoot length. Of the sessile species of which fragments were trapped, mean floating time (T-50) was 5.9 days and mean shoot length 79 mm. Species that occurred in the vegetation, but were not found in the water had a significantly lower buoyancy and shoot length. Conclusions We conclude that abundance in the vegetation, buoyancy and shoot length are significant predictors for vegetative hydrochorous dispersal of aquatic and riparian bryophytes. As fragments of species found are able to regenerate after being in water for weeks, they may contribute to colonization of new favourable substrate patches along water bodies after being dispersed.

Methods In our sampling design, we defined treatments by crossing forest continuity (ancient vs recent) and stand maturity (mature vs overmature), then quantified lichen response to the treatments at the stand (n = 70) and tree scales (n = 420). We distinguished between total macrolichen and Lobarion species alone. Finally, we assessed the influence of tree-, stand- and landscape-scale variables, as well as climatic variables. Results Neither total macrolichen nor Lobarion diversity and composition were influenced by forest continuity, stand maturity or by stand- or landscape-associated variables. Instead, climatic variables, light availability at the stand scale and host tree characteristics were the major drivers of lichen assemblages. In our mountain forests, this clearly shows that macrolichen were more influenced by local abiotic and biotic factors than by present or past human-induced activities. Conclusions Overall, we show that assemblage patterns in forest ecosystems may be driven by parameters that are not directly related to habitat quality. The influences of forest continuity and stand maturity on diversity and composition thus appear to be context-dependent. In the ecological context of alpine forests, these findings highlight the benefits of selective-cutting practices and illustrate the importance of structural heterogeneity, in terms of both improved accessibility to light and tree diameter diversity. Finally, the importance of temperature in shaping assemblage patterns suggests that global warming is probably the most significant threat to macrolichen conservation in temperate mountain forests.

Distinct responses of terrestrial and epiphytic ferns and lycophytes along an elevational gradient in Southern Brazil	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Atlantic forest; climatic variables; community structure; edaphic gradient; monilophytes; neutral model; pteridophytes; species richness; variance partitioning	SPECIES RICHNESS PATTERNS; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; FLORISTIC PATTERNS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; LOS TUXTLAS; DIVERSITY; PTERIDOPHYTES; TRANSECT; CLIMATE; MELASTOMATACEAE	Questions What are the drivers that govern fern and lycophyte community composition across different elevation zones in the South Brazilian Atlantic Forest? Does explanatory power of the models increase when we consider substrate-based life forms separately? Do terrestrial and epiphytic species respond similarly to environmental drivers? Study site Four distinct elevation zones of the Atlantic Rain Forest sensu stricto in northeastern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Method Variation partitioning was used to investigate the role of climatic, edaphic and spatial variation on species composition at different spatial scales. We considered both the entire community and subsets with either only epiphytic or terrestrial species. Results On the broad scale, environmental variables were the most important in shaping the fern and lycophyte community composition. Edaphic filters had a more important role for the terrestrial community, and climatic filters for epiphytic species. Considering epiphytic and terrestrial species separately increased the explanatory power of the models. Conclusions Changes in community composition of ferns and lycophytes along an elevational gradient in the South Brazilian Atlantic Forest are primarily driven by niche processes. Ferns and lycophytes found on different substrates (epiphytic vs terrestrial species) show distinct responses to environmental factors and thus should be considered separately in ecological studies.

Nitrogen uptake and biomass resprouting show contrasting relationships with resource acquisitive and conservative plant traits	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						ammonium; disturbance; leaf traits; longleaf pine; nitrate; nutrient uptake; plant economics spectrum; regrowth; root traits	ROOT TRAITS; DIVERSITY; LEAF; COMPETITION; PULSES; WATER; PINE; SOIL; AVAILABILITY; PRODUCTIVITY	Questions Disturbances can cause fluctuations in resource availability that influence plant performance. In systems with such dynamics, inter-specific differences in resource capture may promote co-existence by partitioning competition between periods of high or low resource availability. Such differences in resource use strategy have been described with the Plant Economics Spectrum, which hypothesizes that functions related to resource use and processing should co-vary and can be predicted from plant traits. In pyrogenic systems, fires are associated with short-term increases in soil nitrogen availability ("pulses"), and thus contribute to a fluctuating resource supply. In this study, we sought to understand whether plants differed in their capacity to capture a nitrogen pulse, and to what extent that ability influenced biomass recovery. Methods In two consecutive greenhouse experiments, we tested whether two functions - nitrogen assimilation (Experiment 1) and biomass regrowth after disturbance (Experiment 2) - co-varied, and how each function corresponded to leaf and root functional traits. Results In Experiment 1, four co-occurring shrubs differed in their temporal patterns of nitrogen uptake, and nitrogen uptake was positively correlated with resource-acquisitive leaf traits (leaf percent nitrogen). In Experiment 2, the biomass regrowth of a resource acquisitive and a resource conservative species was the same regardless of competitive environment (i.e., when grown in pots of mixed-species or same-species pairs). Rather than being associated with the capture of new nitrogen, biomass resprouting of both species was associated with the size of below-ground resource stores and specific root length. Conclusions Our work suggests that resource acquisition and processing may be decoupled from each other after disturbance, and also highlights the need for explicit tests of the relationships between root traits and above-ground plant function.

We addressed how increased rainfall and N influenced plant species richness, gain, loss, and turnover in an ungrazed steppe. Location Northeastern Inner Mongolia, China. Methods We performed a five-growing-season field experiment, in which an ungrazed steppe was subject to nine different combinations of rainfall and N. The three rainfall levels were ambient amount of rainfall, a 14% increase in amount of rainfall, and a 28% increase in amount of rainfall; the three N levels were no N addition, an addition of 5 g N m(-2) year(-1), and an addition of 10 g N m(-2) year(-1). We determined successional changes at the taxonomic and functional levels by surveying plant species in the first and fifth growing seasons. Results (a) Increased rainfall and N addition did not affect plant species richness but did influence plant species loss, gain, and turnover. (b) At the taxonomic level, species loss, gain, and turnover decreased monotonically with increasing rainfall; N addition decreased species loss and turnover but did not influence species gain; the slope of the species loss-gain relation was approximately 1.0. (c) At the plant functional group level, increased rainfall favored C-3 plants by sustaining species gain and decreasing species loss; N addition favored C-4 plants by increasing the species gain and decreasing the species loss. Conclusion Increased rainfall and simulated N deposition could induce rapid colonization and extinction during postgrazing steppe succession, but maintain plant diversity homeostasis by equally affecting species colonization and extinction. Future rainfall enrichment and N deposition might strongly influence the relative abundance of different plant functional groups, thereby affecting successional changes under global change.

To investigate the short-term effects of forest management on understory vegetation, we asked: (a) Are there any plant indicator species associated with different felling intensities? (b) What are the differences in abundance of plant functional types along the disturbance gradient? (c) How do typical forest species respond to silvicultural treatments? Location Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. Methods At each of three study sites in Illyrian beech forests, nine plots (4,000 m(2)) were established, comprising a total of 27 plots. Three different felling intensities were implemented at each site, with one third of the plots assigned to each treatment: control, 50% of the growing stock removed and 100% of the growing stock removed. In the centre of each plot, a vegetation survey of vascular plants was done before (in 2012) and two years after (in 2014) felling in a circular sampling area of 400 m(2). We employed indicator species analysis, and species were grouped into functional types with respect to their traits. Results Understory species composition differed significantly between treatments. Forty-seven species (out of 251) were significantly associated with the 100% felling intensity. This relatively high number of indicators was due to the post-disturbance colonization of early-successional, non-forest species, coupled with the expansion of pre-treatment resident species. Only one species was a strong indicator for the 50% felled plots, while three species showed a preference for the unfelled plots. Graminoids, tall perennial forbs, annual/biennial forbs and legumes exhibited the most prominent increase in cover at the 50% and 100% felling intensity. Ferns showed non-significant changes, whereas woody plants exhibited a decrease in the most intensive treatment. In general, most of the typical forest species responded with increased frequency and/or abundance after felling. Conclusions The post-treatment taxonomic and functional composition of plant communities exhibited the largest changes in the most intensively felled stands. Overall, in the short term, ecological conditions in canopy gaps were not modified to an extent that would be detrimental to the persistence of typical forest species.

We posed the following questions: Can savanna restoration outcomes be affected by the initial functional-group composition? Are there functional groups that, when established early, can prevent colonization by invasive grasses, trigger a successful restoration trajectory, and be used as early indicators of restoration success? Location Brazilian savanna (cerrado) in Central Brazil (14 degrees 07 ' 2.54 '' S, 47 degrees 38 ' 30.36 '' W). Methods We established 110 plots spanning a naturally occurring range of species composition in savanna areas that had been restored through direct seeding. We looked for different initial compositions of the following functional groups: perennial grasses, annual grasses, short-lived shrubs, and invasive grasses. We measured vegetation cover over two years and evaluated the effects of the initial functional composition on the successional trajectory of the plots. Results The initial dominant functional group determined the assembly trajectory. Short-lived and fast-growing species were replaced by perennial species, indicating a fast species turnover. Invasive grass cover remained stable over time, demonstrating that once they establish and dominate an area, an alternative stable state is achieved. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of introducing a mixture of functional groups when restoring savannas in severely disturbed areas. Fast-growing and short-lived species are important for quickly covering the ground, creating the conditions for the establishment of perennial grasses that naturally dominate the herbaceous layer of savannas. Trees are also characteristic of the savanna structure and must be introduced. Our results indicate that invasive grasses must be eliminated and/or constantly controlled before native species are introduced.

Location "La Crau", southeastern France. Methods We set up a split-plot experiment testing the effects of fire season (winter, summer) and grazing on plant cover, inflorescence number, seed set and germination of Brachypodium retusum in traditionally grazed grasslands. We further analyzed plant species composition and diversity in vegetation releves. The same fire treatments were tested in a second experiment in long-term grazing exclosures. Results Brachypodium retusum showed a rapid post-fire recovery, but other species of the associated plant community, in particular annuals, recovered as fast or even faster. Fire increased Brachypodium retusum inflorescence production and seed set per inflorescence and this effect was stronger in the summer fire treatment. At the community level, fire significantly increased species richness, evenness and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in the second post-fire season and again, the summer fire effect was stronger. Grazing exclusion for two seasons had only a small effect on Brachypodium retusum and the associated plant community. The effect of both fire treatments on Brachypodium retusum was similar in long-term exclosures. In these exclosures, fire resulted in a community shift towards the species composition of traditionally grazed steppes. Conclusions The concomitant positive effects of experimental burning on Brachypodium retusum reproduction and on plant diversity of Mediterranean steppe vegetation suggest that the system is adapted to fire as an important driver of community composition. Annual species surviving as seeds are as successful in post-fire recovery as perennial resprouters. Prescribed burning may be an alternative strategy to restore community structure in abandoned (ungrazed) steppes showing a decline in typical grassland species after several years of grazing abandonment.

We applied three plant introduction treatments at a highly degraded industrial area to test whether plant material introduced onto industrial areas initiates plant assemblages similar in composition to those of reference grasslands. We specifically asked (a) Does restoration differ between primary and secondary reference sites in terms of overall species richness and cover three years after the introduction of plant material? (b) What is the sociability of species of the vegetation resulting from different treatments? Location Restoration and reference grassland sites with acidic sandy soil in the temperate region of the EU, NE Hungary, Nyirseg. Methods As restoration techniques, we (a) directly seeded a single dominant species, (b) applied a commercial seed mixture, and (c) transferred hay. We compared species composition, cover, species richness and sociability of species in restoration treatments to reference grasslands. Inventories of vascular plant species were made at five randomly placed 2 m x 2 m sampling units per plot. Results The species composition of seeded restoration plots (with a single dominant species and a commercial seed mixture) became similar to that of reference grasslands. Both types of seeding resulted in a similar cover, whereas seeding a commercial seed mixture and hay transfer resulted in a species richness similar to that of reference grasslands. The cover of the natural constituents (NC) of seeded plots also reached that of reference grasslands, while hay addition resulted in a lower cover and a higher number of NC than other methods. Conclusions The introduction of propagules in degraded industrial areas can provide communities similar, after three years, to those of secondary reference grasslands that are 30 years of age. We conclude that investing in the restoration of native grasslands at unused urban-industrial sites can be a great opportunity to enhance biodiversity.

Mussel beds appear to be declining in the Gulf of Maine, apparently due to climate change and predation by the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas. As mussels die, they create a legacy of large expanses of shell biogenic structure. In Maine, USA, we used bottom traps to examine effects of four bottom cover types (i.e., live mussels, whole shells, fragmented shells, bare sediment) and wind condition (i.e., days with high, intermediate, and low values) on flow-related ecosystem processes. Significant differences in transport of sediment, meiofauna, and macrofauna were found among cover types and days, with no significant interaction between the two factors. Wind condition had positive effects on transport. Shell hash, especially fragmented shells, had negative effects, possibly because it acted as bed armor to reduce wind-generated erosion and resuspension. Copepods had the greatest mobility and shortest turnover times (0.15 d), followed by nematodes (1.96 d) and the macrofauna dominant, Tubificoides benedeni (2.35 d). Shell legacy effects may play an important role in soft-bottom system responses to wind-generated ecosystem processes, particularly in collapsed mussel beds, with implications for recolonization, connectivity, and the creation and maintenance of spatial pattern.

However, delineating drivers of biological variability in such complex environments has proved challenging. Here, we investigated the assemblage structure and diversity of parrotfishesa common and ecologically important groupacross 6 degrees of latitude on the Northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. Parrotfish abundance and biomass were determined from stereo-video surveys across 82 sites spanning 31 reefs and assessed against geographic, biophysical, and management-related factors in a multivariate framework to determine major drivers and associated scales of assemblage structure. Large cross-shelf variation in parrotfish assemblages pervaded along the entire Northern GBR, with distinct assemblages associated with sheltered and exposed reefs. Species abundances and diversity generally decreased with decreasing latitude. The gradient of explicit predator biomass associated with management zoning had no effect on parrotfish assemblage structure, but was positively correlated with parrotfish diversity. Our results highlight the ubiquitous presence of cross-shelf variation, where the greatest differences in parrotfish community composition existed between sheltered (inner and mid shelf) and exposed (outer shelf) reef systems. Prior attempts to explain linkages between parrotfishes and fine-scale biophysical factors have demonstrated parrotfishes as habitat generalists, but recent developments in nutritional ecology suggest that their cross-shelf variation on the GBR is likely reflective of benthic resource distribution and species-specific feeding modes.

Seed dispersal is a primary driver, via propagule pressure, of biological invasions. In animal-dispersed plants, theory predicts that indirect ecological interactions at the neighbourhood scale may determine landscape-scale patterns of seed dispersal and predation, and thus invasion. 2. Indirect interactions in seed dispersal may arise between two plant species if shared seed dispersal agents adjust their foraging decisions to the relative frequencies of co-occurring seeds. We used seed-tracking experiments and empirically parameterized simulations to test the hypothesis that an indirect interaction between two plant species, mediated by scatterhoarding rodents that both consume and disperse seeds, affects recruitment of an invasive tree. We predicted that acorns of Quercus rubra (invasive in Central Europe) would experience higher caching (and therefore survival) rates when they co-occurred with native Quercus petraea than when they occurred in isolation, that Q. petraea acorns would survive at lower rates with Q. rubra relative to isolation, and that this interaction would facilitate Q. rubra seedling recruitment in Q. petraea forests. 3. Contrary to expectations, the presence of Q. petraea reduced caching of Q. rubra acorns, and co-occurrence with Q. rubra increased caching of Q. petraea. Thus, a rodent-mediated indirect interaction may be slowing rather than facilitating the Q. rubra invasion. However, our simulations indicate that the magnitude of this indirect interaction will change nonlinearly as Q. rubra becomes more dominant on the landscape, and that the pace of invasion will accelerate as the alien species is released from the rodent-mediated effect of Q. petraea. 4. Synthesis. The presence of native Quercus petraea decreases recruitment rates of Quercus rubra, and consequently, slows down the invasion process. The strong dependence of pairwise interactions on the presence of a third-party species emphasizes the role of indirect interactions in the invasion processes.

Diversity among species and genetic diversity within species are both important components of ecological communities that can determine the outcome of species interactions, especially between hosts and parasites. We sought to understand the impact of species diversity on host community resistance to infection by a keystone parasitic plant (Rhinanthus minor L.) and genetic diversity of the parasite on its successful establishment in a grassland community. 2. We used an experimental approach where large pots were planted with mixtures of mesotrophic grassland species at high and low species diversity. The parasitic plant was sown in a proportion of these with high and low genetic diversity treatments. Establishment of the parasite was monitored over 2 years and the pots harvested at the end of each growing season to determine the impact of infection on plant community biomass. 3. We found a strong effect of host plant species diversity on the establishment of the parasitic plant, with successful establishment considerably lower in the high species diversity treatment. Genetic diversity appeared to promote establishment of the parasite in the high species diversity treatment, and also facilitated longer term fitness in the low species diversity treatment. Host community structure was influenced by R. minor, with grass relative biomass decreasing and legume relative biomass increasing when the parasite was present. There was no direct impact of the presence of the parasite on the relative biomass of nonleguminous forbs. 4. Synthesis. Our data demonstrate the importance of host community species diversity in deterring the establishment of a generalist parasite. They also highlight the role of genetic diversity in determining the outcome of host-parasite interactions in multispecies communities. These findings, therefore, have important implications for the establishment and management of species-rich grasslands and provide insight into the community dynamics of parasitic plants and their hosts.

Productivity and related soil properties mediate the population-level consequences of rodent seed predation on Blanketflower, Gaillardia aristata	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Context dependence; environmental gradients; Gaillardia aristata; plant populations; plant-herbivore interactions; recruitment; rodent seed predation; soil properties	ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT INFLUENCES; INTEGRAL PROJECTION MODELS; SPECIES-RICHNESS; DEMOGRAPHIC COMPENSATION; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION; PLANT COMPETITION; GROUND COVER; RECRUITMENT; GRASSLAND; HERBIVORY	1. Plants are frequently attacked by consumers that reduce seed numbers. However, our ability to predict whether seed loss results in parallel changes in future recruitment or plant abundance remains poor. Progress in this area requires simultaneously understanding: (1) how spatial variation in environmental conditions influence recruitment and other demographic rates, and (2) how the magnitude of seed loss varies spatially and relative to seed limitation. 2. We experimentally assessed how postdispersal seed predation by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) influenced recruitment of the native perennial forb, Gaillardia aristata, in western Montana (USA) grasslands. To explore whether seed limitation and the population-level consequences of seed predation varied predictably based on environmental conditions, we added seeds to plots where mice had access or were excluded at sites occurring over a strong gradient of soil characteristics and plant community productivity. We also quantified whether components of Gaillardia demography varied in ways that may compensate for or exacerbate the population-level effects of seed predation across this environmental gradient. 3. Across two replicate years, recruitment was highest at low productivity/soil nutrient sites and decreased towards the opposite end of the gradient. Postdispersal seed predation strongly reduced Gaillardia recruitment in both years, and the impacts of seed predation on recruitment were greater at sites with lower productivity and fewer soil nutrients and decreased towards the opposite end of the gradient. Growth and fecundity varied among populations in ways that could buffer Gaillardia populations from stronger effects of seed predation, whereas survival varied among populations in a way that may intensify these effects. 4. Synthesis. Together, these results show that postdispersal seed predation can importantly limit plant recruitment and that the magnitude of these effects were predicted by variation in underlying environmental conditions that influence recruitment and other key demographic rates.

Our knowledge of the functional role of large herbivores is rapidly expanding, and the impact of grazing on species coexistence and nonnative species expansion has been studied across ecosystems. However, experimental data on large grazer impacts on plant invasion in aquatic ecosystems are lacking. 2. Since its introduction in 2002, the seagrass species Halophila stipulacea has rapidly expanded across the Eastern Caribbean, forming dense meadows in green turtle (Chelonia mydas)-foraging areas. We investigate the changes in seagrass species coexistence and the impacts of leaf grazing by green turtles on nonnative seagrass expansion in Lac Bay (Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands). 3. Green turtle grazing behaviour changed after the introduction of nonnative seagrass to Lac Bay in 2010. Field observations, together with time-lapse satellite images over the last four decades, showed initiation of new grazing patches (65 ha, an increase of 72%). The sharp border between grazed and ungrazed seagrass patches moved in the direction of shallower areas with native seagrass species that had previously (1970-2010) been ungrazed. Green turtles deployed with Fastloc-GPS transmitters confirmed high site fidelity to these newly cropped patches. In addition, cafeteria experiments indicated selective grazing by green turtles on native species. These native seagrass species had significantly higher nutritional values compared to the nonnative species. In parallel, exclosure experiments showed that nonnative seagrass expanded more rapidly in grazed canopies compared to ungrazed canopies. Finally, in 6 years from 2011 to 2017, H. stipulacea underwent a significant expansion, invading 20-49 fixed monitoring locations in Lac Bay, increasing from 6% to 20% in total occurrence. During the same period, native seagrass Thalassia testudinum occurrence decreased by 33%. 4. Synthesis. Our results provide first-time evidence of large-scale replacement of native seagrasses by rapidly colonizing Halophila stipulacea in the Caribbean and add a mechanistic explanation for this invasiveness. We conclude that green turtle leaf grazing may modify the rate and spatial extent of this invasive species' expansion, due to grazing preferences, and increased space for settlement. This work shows how large herbivores play an important but unrecognized role in species coexistence and plant invasions of aquatic ecosystems.	[Christianen, Marjolijn J.

Herbivory-induced changes in plant resistance and tolerance traits can mediate the interaction between spatially and temporally separated above- and below-ground herbivores. However, it is unknown how long the impact of transient herbivory events last or if legacy effects can be detected systemically in the plant and across plant generations. 2. Here, we studied the impact of transient above-ground herbivory by the specialist caterpillar Manduca sexta on the plant traits of wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and the consequences for below-ground root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne incognita in short-term, long-term, and transgenerational experiments. 3. In the short- and long-term experiments, above- and below-ground herbivory had significant, albeit independent, impacts on key plant traits such as plant biomass, nutrient content, and secondary metabolites. In addition, herbivory influenced fitness parameters such as seed yield and quality. In the long-term and transgenerational experiments, transient above-ground herbivory had facilitating effects on nematodes, irrespective of any treatments of the parental plants. We found evidence for transgenerational legacy effects of both above- and below-ground herbivory on the resistance of progeny plants against above-ground herbivores. Additionally, below-ground herbivory in the parental generation increased the root biomass of progeny plants. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that herbivory may have a long-term impact on plant fitness by improving the performance of progeny plants challenged by above- and below-ground herbivory.

Forests play a strong role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide through increasing forest biomass. Understanding temporal trends of forest net above-ground biomass change (Delta AGB) can help infer how forest carbon sequestration responds to ongoing climate changes. Despite wide spatial variation in the long-term average of climate moisture availability (CMIaverage) across forest ecosystems, temporal trends of Delta AGB associated with CMIaverage remain unclear. 2. We tested the hypothesis that the negative impacts of climate change on Delta AGB would decrease with CMIaverage using the data from permanent sample plots, monitored from 1958 to 2011, with stand ages varying from 17 to 210 years, in western boreal forests of Canada. 3. We found that Delta AGB on average increased with CMIaverage. Temporally, Delta AGB declined sharply between 1958 and 2011 in plots with low CMIaverage owing to increased biomass loss from mortality accompanied by little growth gain, whereas Delta AGB changed little in plots with high CMIaverage. The temporal decrease of Delta AGB in drier areas was attributable to its negative responses to warming-induced temporal decreases in climate moisture availability. 4. Synthesis. Our results indicate that large-scale changes in forest carbon functioning associated with climate change depend on the long-term average of climate moisture availability. Our finding suggests a possible retreat of boreal biome at the drier distribution limits with predicted declines in water availability in the 21st century.	[Luo, Yong; Chen, Han Y.

Predicting how ecological interactions will respond to global change is a major challenge. Plants and their associated insect herbivores compose much of macroscopic diversity, yet how their interactions have been altered by recent environmental change remains underexplored. 2. To address this gap, we quantified herbivory on herbarium specimens of four plant species with records extending back 112 years. Our study focused on the northeastern US, where temperatures have increased rapidly over the last few decades.This region also represents a range of urban development, a form of global change that has shown variable effects on herbivores in the past studies. 3. Herbarium specimens collected in the early 2000s were 23% more likely to be damaged by herbivores than those collected in the early 1900s. Herbivory was greater following warmer winters and at low latitudes, suggesting that climate warming may drive increasing insect damage over time.In contrast, human population densities were negatively associated with herbivore damage. 4. To explore whether changes in insect occurrence or abundance might explain shifts in herbivory, we used insect observational records to build climate occupancy models for lepidopteran herbivores (butterflies and moths) of our focal plant species. 5. These models show that higher winter temperatures were associated with higher probability of insect herbivore presence, while urbanization was associated with reduced probability of herbivore presence, supporting a link between insect herbivore occurrence and herbivory mediated through environment. 6. Synthesis. Using a temporal record of plant herbivory that spans over a century, we show that both temperature and urbanization influence insect damage to plants, but in very different ways. Our results indicate that damage to plants by insect herbivores will likely continue to increase through time in the northeastern US as global temperatures rise, but that urbanization may disrupt local effects of winter warming on herbivory by excluding certain herbivores. These changes may scale to shape ecosystem processes that are driven by herbivory, including plant productivity.

The temporal and spatial dynamics of soil water are closely interlinked with terrestrial ecosystems functioning. The interaction between plant community properties such as species composition and richness and soil water mirrors fundamental ecological processes determining above-ground-below-ground feedbacks. Plant-water relations and water stress have attracted considerable attention in biodiversity experiments. Yet, although soil scientific research suggests an influence of ecosystem productivity on soil hydraulic properties, temporal changes of the soil water content and soil hydraulic properties remain largely understudied in biodiversity experiments. Thus, insights on how plant diversity-productivity relationships affect soil water are lacking. 2. Here, we determine which factors related to plant community composition (species and functional group richness, presence of plant functional groups) and soil (organic carbon concentration) affect soil water in a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment). 3. Both plant species richness and the presence of particular functional groups affected soil water content, while functional group richness played no role. The effect of species richness changed from positive to negative and expanded to deeper soil with time. Shortly after establishment, increased topsoil water content was related to higher leaf area index in species-rich plots, which enhanced shading. In later years, higher species richness increased topsoil organic carbon, likely improving soil aggregation. Improved aggregation, in turn, dried topsoils in species-rich plots due to faster drainage of rainwater. Functional groups affected soil water distribution, likely due to plant traits affecting root water uptake depths, shading, or water-use efficiency. For instance, topsoils in plots containing grasses were generally drier, while plots with legumes were moister. 4. Synthesis. Our decade-long experiment reveals that the maturation of grasslands changes the effects of plant richness from influencing soil water content through shading effects to altering soil physical characteristics in addition to modification of water uptake depth. Functional groups affected the soil water distribution by characteristic shifts of root water uptake depth, but did not enhance exploitation of the overall soil water storage. Our results reconcile previous seemingly contradictory results on the relation between grassland species diversity and soil moisture and highlight the role of vegetation composition for soil processes.

Feedback between plants and soil is an important driver of plant community structure, but it remains unclear whether plant-soil feedback (PSF): (i) reflects changes in biotic or abiotic properties, (ii) depends on environmental context in terms of soil nutrient availability, and (iii) varies among plant functional groups. As soil nutrient availability strongly affects plant distribution and performance, soil chemical properties and plant nutrient-acquisition strategies might serve as important drivers of PSF. 2. We used soils from young and old stages of a long-term soil chronosequence to represent sites where productivity is limited by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability, respectively. We grew three N-fixing and three non-N-fixing plant species in soils conditioned by co-occurring conspecific or heterospecific species from each of these two stages. In addition, three soil treatments were used to distinguish biotic and abiotic effects on plant performance, allowing measurements of overall, biotic, and abiotic PSF. 3. In young, N-poor soils, non-N-fixing plants grew better in soils from N-fixing plants than in their own soils (i.e., negative PSF). However, this difference was not only associated with improved abiotic conditions in soils from N-fixing plants but also with changes in soil biota. 4. By contrast, no significant PSF was observed for N-fixing plants grown in young soils. Moreover, we did not observe any significant PSF for either N-fixing or non-N-fixing plants growing in old, P-impoverished soils. 5. Synthesis. The direction and strength of plant-soil feedback (PSF) varied among N-acquisition strategies and soils differing in nutrient availability, with stronger plant-soil feedback in younger, N-poor soils compared to older, P-impoverished soils. Our results highlight the importance of considering soil nutrient availability, plant-mediated abiotic and biotic soil properties, and plant nutrient-acquisition strategies when studying plant-soil feedback, thereby advancing our mechanistic understanding of plant-soil feedback during long-term ecosystem development.

Aquatic plant meadows are important coastal habitats that sustain many ecosystem functions such as primary production and carbon sequestration. Currently, there is a knowledge gap in understanding which plant functional traits, for example, leaf size or plant height underlie primary production in aquatic plant communities. 2. To study how plant traits are related to primary production, we conducted a field survey in the Baltic Sea, Finland, which is characterized by high plant species and functional diversity. Thirty sites along an exposure gradient were sampled (150 plots), and nine plant morphological and chemical traits measured. The aim was to discern how community-weighted mean traits affect community production and whether this relationship changes along an environmental gradient using structural equation modelling (SEM). 3. Plant height had a direct positive effect on production along an exposure gradient (r=0.33) and indirect effects through two leaf chemical traits, leaf delta N-15 and leaf delta C-13 (r=0.24 and 0.18, respectively) resulting in a total effect of 0.28. In plant communities experiencing varying exposure, traits such as root N concentration and leaf delta N-15 had positive and negative effects on production, respectively. 4. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the relationship between aquatic plant functional traits and community production is variable and changes over environmental gradients. Plant height generally has a positive effect on community production along an exposure gradient, while the link between other traits and production changes in plant communities experiencing varying degrees of exposure. Thus, the underlying biological mechanisms influencing production differ in plant communities, emphasizing the need to resolve variability and its drivers in real-world communities. Importantly, functionally diverse plant communities sustain ecosystem functioning differently and highlight the importance of benthic diversity for coastal ecosystem stability.

Ecogeographical isolation is a fundamental prezygotic barrier to reproduction and a step towards diversification in flowering plants. However, whether ecogeographical isolation acts as a reproductive barrier between species and thus as a mechanism for species divergence is unclear and is expected to change as species distributions shift under climate change. 2. Using a Maxent framework, we quantified the extent of ecogeographical isolation of nine closely related species of the European plant genus Pulmonaria, which lack premating barriers and often form hybrids. We investigated ecogeographical isolation under both current conditions and four climate change scenarios; two unrelated future climate models, each with two predictions of the potential trajectories of climate change. 3. Compared with current climates, under these future climate scenarios, there will be an increase in mean annual temperature, but not in mean annual precipitation in the range of Pulmonaria throughout Europe. This will result in a range contraction in three of the nine Pulmonaria species, a range expansion in two species, and no clear effect of climate change on the ranges of four species. 4. Climate change will result in an overall increase in ecogeographical isolation between these species in future. In particular, species that have low ecogeographical isolation under current conditions are predicted to increase the most in their ecogeographical isolation under climate change. 5. Synthesis. These results highlight that climate change can strongly impact on a major premating barrier of closely related species, therefore potentially affect the evolutionary trajectory of plants in the future.

So far, the principal force shaping local plant abundance patterns remains unclear. Rarity can result not only from poor competitive ability or from small vegetative or generative reproduction, but also from strong self-limitation. The same mechanisms can drive species-specific overyielding, that is, increased species productivity at high community diversity. Rare species can then benefit more (i.e., overyield to a larger extent) from growing in species-rich communities because of altered competitive hierarchies or smaller conspecific frequencies. Here, we test which mechanism is the most important determinant of species rarity and of species-specific productivity across a diversity gradient ranging from 1- to 60-species plots. 2. For that, we measured vegetative growth, competitive ability (competitive effect), and negative frequency dependence for 49 perennial grassland species from Central Europe. We then linked these characteristics with species abundance (measured as species biomass from 60-species plots) and with species-specific overyielding in The Jena Experiment. 3. Species with higher rates of vegetative growth (when grown without neighbours) were also more abundant in the Jena Experiment. Larger species-specific overyielding was then associated with a stronger negative frequency dependence. As species with greater vegetative growth were also more self-limited, larger overyielding in species-rich communities was characteristic for common rather than for rare species, refuting our initial hypothesis. Finally, path analysis indicated that species with poor capacity to suppress neighbours also profited more from growing in diverse communities. 4. Synthesis. Our results identify key mechanisms driving abundance and productivity of species in synthetic communities differing in species richness. While vegetative reproduction was closely associated with abundance, intraspecific interactions (strength of negative frequency dependence) shaped species productivity across a richness gradient. Our study sheds light on the abundance patterns of species and their influence on community functions, such as biomass production, of species-rich and -poor vegetation.

Disentangling the interplay between species-specific environmental preferences and micro- and macroscale determinants of species abundance within plant communities remains challenging. Most existing studies addressing this issue either lack empirical data regarding species interactions and local abundances or cover a narrow range of environmental conditions. 2. We merged species distribution models and local spatial patterns to investigate the relative importance of key macro- (aridity) and micro(facilitation and competition)scale determinants of plant species abundance along aridity gradients in drylands world-wide. We used information derived from the environmental niches of species to evaluate how species-specific aridity preferences modulate the importance of such factors to drive species relative abundance. 3. Facilitation and aridity preferences were more important than competition to explain species local abundances in global drylands. The specialization of communities (i.e. their compositional shifts from species with a large range of aridity preferences towards only aridity specialists) also modulated the effect of aridity and plant-plant interactions on species abundances. The importance of facilitation to drive species abundances decreased with aridity, as species preferred arid conditions and did not need neighbours to thrive. Instead, competition showed stronger relationships with species abundances under high levels of aridity. As composition became dominated by aridity specialists, the importance of aridity in shaping dryland plant communities did not increase further from moderate to high aridity levels. 4. Synthesis. Our results showed that: (a) the degree of community specialization to aridity mediates the relative importance of plant-plant interactions in determining species abundances and (b) facilitation and competition were more strongly related to species abundance in communities dominated by generalists and specialists, respectively. We observed a shift from facilitation to competition as drivers of species abundances as aridity increases in global drylands. Our findings also pave the way to develop more robust predictions about the consequences of ongoing climate change on the assemblage of plant communities in drylands, the largest terrestrial biome.

Michael			Grass competition overwhelms effects of herbivores and precipitation on early tree establishment in Serengeti	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Acacia robusta; Acacia tortilis; competition; environmental gradients; herbaceous vegetation; plant-animal interactions; plant-available moisture; recruitment limitation	AFRICAN SAVANNA; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; RECRUITMENT LIMITATION; WOODY COVER; FIRE; ACACIA; RAINFALL; VEGETATION; GROWTH; WATER	1. Savanna ecosystems span a diverse range of climates, edaphic conditions, and disturbance regimes, the complexity of which has stimulated long-standing interest in the mechanisms that maintain tree-grass coexistence. One hypothesis suggests that tree establishment is strongly limited by one or several demographic bottlenecks at early stages of the tree life cycle. A major impediment to testing this hypothesis is the lack of data on the relative strengths of different bottle-necks across key environmental gradients. 2. To identify demographic bottlenecks that limit early tree establishment (0-18 months), we conducted a series of transplant experiments with two savanna trees species (Acacia robusta and Acacia tortilis) across a natural rainfall and soil fertility gradient in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania. We tested the interactive effects of precipitation, herbivory, seed scarification, grass competition, water limitation, and tree species identity on two key life stages: germination and early seedling survival (0-2 months), and juvenile seedling survival (2-18 months). 3. Germination and early seedling survival increased as a function of rainfall, in the absence of herbivores and when seeds were scarified. Juvenile seedling survival, in contrast, decreased with rainfall but increased in the absence of herbivores. Grass removal had the single strongest (positive) effect on juvenile seedling survival of any treatment. Soil moisture monitoring and grass-addition treatments revealed that grasses negatively affected seedlings in ways that were not necessarily linked to soil moisture. 4. A demographic model combining all effects across early life stages showed that the strength of grass competition on juvenile seedling survival was the key factor limiting early tree establishment. While rainfall had an unexpected opposing effect on the two life stages, the net effect of mean annual precipitation on early tree establishment was positive. 5. Synthesis. Successful tree establishment in Serengeti is maximized by a seemingly unlikely sequence of events: (a) scarification of seeds by browsers, (b) heavy rainfall to promote germination, (c) intensive grazing (but absence of browsers), and (d) dry conditions during juvenile seedling growth (>2 months) to reduce competition with grasses. By considering a wide suite of conditions and their interactions, our experimental results are relevant to ongoing debates about savanna vegetation dynamics and structural shifts in tree:grass ratios.

Intransitivity increases plant functional diversity by limiting dominance in drylands worldwide	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate; community assembly; determinants of plant community diversity and structure; functional diversity; intransitive interactions; plant height; spatial association patterns; specific leaf area	SPECIES INTERACTIONS; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; ECOSYSTEM MULTIFUNCTIONALITY; COMPETITIVE INTRANSITIVITY; STOCHASTIC GEOMETRY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FACILITATION; TRAITS; SOIL; COEXISTENCE	1. Biotic interactions are key determinants of plant community structure. Indirect interactions such as intransitivity (i.e., the absence of competitive hierarchies among species) have been hypothesized to benefit diversity within plant communities. However, their effect on functional diversity remains scarcely explored in real communities. Here, we develop a novel approach to infer intransitivity from plant spatial patterns and functional traits (height and specific leaf area) and quantify its effect on different components of plant diversity along environmental gradients in 100 drylands from all continents except Antarctica. 2. We first calculated the spatial association pattern for all perennials to infer competition between species. Trait values were used as a proxy of competitive hierarchies to infer the direction of these interactions. We used multiple regression models to evaluate how intransitivity responds to environmental variables (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality, soil pH, sand content and woody cover). We also used confirmatory path analysis to evaluate the effects of intransitivity on species richness and evenness, trait dispersion and functional diversity. 3. Intransitivity mostly responded to climatic variables and significantly increased with precipitation scarcity and seasonality. We found that intransitivity had significant effects on functional diversity, mostly by promoting plant community evenness. However, the dominance of woody vegetation (steppes versus shrublands) modulated this effect. 4. Synthesis. Intransitivity increased the functional diversity of drylands, particularly under high rainfall seasonality, by limiting functionally dominant species. Our findings specify how intransitivity structures the functional diversity of dryland vegetation worldwide. Intransitivity may be particularly important in ecosystems where the availability of abiotic resources changes over time, thereby breaking down inherent competitive hierarchies between plant species. Neglecting intransitivity will bias our estimation of the impacts of biotic interactions on plant communities, a fundamental issue to fully understand how plant communities will respond to ongoing environmental changes.

Shifting species and functional diversity due to abrupt changes in water availability in tropical dry forests	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						artificial reservoirs; biodiversity-ecosystem functioning; community-weighted mean traits; functional traits; soil moisture; species composition; temporal dynamics; tropical forests	RIVER-MARGIN VEGETATION; DROUGHT; CLIMATE; AMAZON; PRODUCTIVITY; BIOMASS; TREE; DEFORESTATION; FRAMEWORK; INCREASE	1. Recent insights show that tropical forests are shifting in species composition, possibly due to changing environmental conditions. However, we still poorly understand the forest response to different environmental change drivers, which limits our ability to predict the future of tropical forests. Although some studies have evaluated drought effects on tree communities, we know little about the influence of increased water availability. 2. Here, we evaluated how an increase in water availability caused by an artificial reservoir affected temporal changes in forest structure, species and functional diversity, and community-weighted mean traits. Furthermore, we evaluated how demographical groups (recruits, survivors and trees that died) contributed to these temporal changes in tropical dry forests. 3. We present data for the dynamics of forest change over a 10-year period for 120 permanent plots that were far from the water's edge before reservoir construction and are now close to the water's edge (0-60 m). Plots close to the water's edge had an abrupt increase in water availability, while distant plots did not. 4. Plots close to the water's edge showed an increase in species and functional diversity, and in the abundance of species with traits associated with low drought resistance (i.e., evergreen species with simple leaves and low wood density), whereas plots far from the water's edge did not change. Changes in overall community metrics were mainly due to recruits rather than to survivors or dead trees. Overall stand basal area did not change because growth and recruitment were balanced by mortality. 5. Synthesis. Our results showed that tropical dry forests can respond quickly to abrupt changes in environmental conditions. Temporal changes in vegetation metrics due to increased water availability were mainly attributed to recruits, suggesting that these effects are lasting and may become stronger over time. The lack of increase in basal area towards the water's edge, and the shift towards higher abundance of soft-wooded species, could reduce the carbon stored and increase the forest's vulnerability to extreme weather events. Further "accidental" large-scale field experiments like ours could provide more insights into forest responses and resilience to global change.

Habitat filtering and limiting similarity are well-documented ecological assembly processes that hierarchically filter species across spatial scales, from a regional pool to local assemblages. However, information on the effects of fine-scale spatial partitioning of species, working as an additional mechanism of coexistence, on community patterns is much scarcer. 2. In this study, we quantified the importance of fine-scale spatial partitioning, relative to habitat filtering and limiting similarity in structuring grassland communities in the western Swiss Alps. To do so, 298 vegetation plots (2 mx2 m) each with five nested subplots (20 cmx20 cm) were used for trait-based assembly tests (i.e., comparisons with several alternative null expectations), examining the observed plot and subplot level alpha-diversity (indicating habitat filtering and limiting similarity) and the among-subplot beta-diversity of traits (indicating fine-scale spatial partitioning). We further assessed variations in the detected signatures of these assembly processes along a set of environmental gradients. 3. We found habitat filtering was the dominating assembly process at the plot level with diminished effect at the subplot level, whereas limiting similarity prevailed at the subplot level with weaker average effect at the plot level. Plot-level limiting similarity was positively correlated with fine-scale partitioning, suggesting that the trait divergence resulted from a combination of competitive exclusion between functionally similar species and environmental micro-heterogeneities. Overall, signatures of assembly processes only marginally changed along environmental gradients, but the observed trends were more prominent at the plot than at the subplot scale. 4. Synthesis. Our study emphasises the importance of considering multiple assembly processes and traits simultaneously across spatial scales and environmental gradients to understand the complex drivers of plant community composition.

Tropical cyclones (TCs) are large-scale disturbances that regularly impact tropical forests. Although long-term impacts of TCs on forest structure have been proposed, a global test of the relationship between forest structure and TC frequency and intensity is lacking. We test on a pantropical scale whether TCs shape the structure of tropical and subtropical forests in the long term. 2. We compiled forest structural features (stem density, basal area, mean canopy height and maximum tree size) for plants >= 10cm in diameter at breast height from published forest inventory data (438 plots >= 0.1ha, pooled into 250 1 x 1-degree grid cells) located in dry and humid forests. We computed maps of cyclone frequency and energy released by cyclones per unit area (power dissipation index, PDI) using a high-resolution historical database of TCs trajectories and intensities. We then tested the relationship between PDI and forest structural features using multivariate linear models, controlling for climate (mean annual temperature and water availability) and human disturbance (human foot print). 3. Forests subject to frequent cyclones (at least one TCs per decade) and high PDI exhibited higher stem density and basal area, and lower canopy heights. However, the relationships between PDI and basal area or canopy height were partially masked by lower water availability and higher human foot print in tropical dry forests. 4. Synthesis. Our results provide the first evidence that tropical cyclones have a long-term impact on the structure of tropical and subtropical forests in a globally consistent way. The strong relationship between power dissipation index and stem density suggests that frequent and intense tropical cyclones reduce canopy cover through defoliation and tree mortality, encouraging higher regeneration and turnover of biomass. The projected increase in intensity and poleward extension of tropical cyclones due to anthropogenic climate change may therefore have important and lasting impacts on the structure and dynamics of forests in the future.

Distinct responses of niche and fitness differences to water availability underlie variable coexistence outcomes in semi-arid annual plant communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						annual plants; climate change; coexistence; competition; fitness differences; niche differences; stabilization	SPECIES INTERACTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GRASSLAND RESPONSES; COMPETITION; IMPACTS; VARIABILITY; MAINTENANCE; MECHANISMS; FUTURE	1. Climate change is predicted to have profound consequences for multispecies coexistence, and thus, patterns of biological diversity. These consequences will be mediated by direct and indirect impacts of environmental change on species' vital rates and interactions. While the impacts of environmental change on individual species has received much attention to date, the consequences for coexistence mediated by changes in the strength and direction of multispecies interactions are not as well understood. 2. To investigate how coexistence dynamics may be sensitive to environmental change, we conducted a field experiment in a diverse semi-arid annual plant system. We imposed a water manipulation treatment in two sites that vary in aridity and associated rainfall. Focusing on four common annual plant species in these sites, we quantified the fecundity (seed production) of individuals in response to a gradient of intra- and interspecific competitor densities and aridity. We then used these fecundities to parameterize an annual plant population model and examine the influence of aridity and species identity on resultant coexistence dynamics (as a function of stabilizing niche differences and fitness inequalities). 3. While the responses of some vital rates and competitive impacts to watering varied somewhat predictably across sites, coexistence metrics encapsulating changes in these vital rates and interaction strengths did not. Fitness inequalities among our focal species were driven largely by differences in sensitivity to competition, which were almost always much greater than the magnitude of stabilizing niche differences. These findings were surprising given observational evidence suggesting that these species do coexist at local scales in these natural communities. 4. Synthesis. Our study is one of the first to explicitly consider the influence of environmental variation on the individual components of coexistence outcomes. We show that environmental change has the ability to influence coexistence not only through direct pathways (i.e., vital rates), but also indirect pathways (i.e., species interactions). Despite the consistency of many of the responses of these individual components to environmental variation, their combined influence on predictions of both current and future coexistence remains unclear.

Seed size regulates plant dispersal distances in flowing water	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						hydrochory; lowland streams; restoration; seed dispersal; seed size; water dispersal; wetland vegetation	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; STREAM RESTORATION; RIPARIAN; HYDROCHORY; COLONIZATION; DEPOSITION; RIVERS; MECHANISMS; MORPHOLOGY; DIVERSITY	1. Dispersal is an essential component of plant life, especially under the current threats of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and climate change. For many wetland species, water is a key dispersal vector, as it can presumably disperse seeds long distances and towards suitable sites for establishment. Seed dispersal distance is affected by stream characteristics and seed traits. Yet, the effect of relevant seed traits, such as size, remains largely unknown. 2. Here, we report on an experimental field study examining the effect of seed size on dispersal distance in lowland streams. We released cork seed mimics of different sizes in four Dutch lowland streams in restored and channelized sections. After 24hr, we recorded their entrapment location, entrapment mechanism, and the vegetation type in which they were caught. 3. Large seeds generally dispersed over longer distances than smaller seeds. This effect of seed size is likely caused by the different entrapment mechanisms-net trapping, surface tension, and wake trapping-which were highly correlated with seed size. Especially net trapping was responsible for the capture of a large proportion of small seed mimics in vegetation such as aquatic and riparian grasses, starwort, and reed. Due to the prevalent occurrence of these vegetation types in lowland streams, particularly during summer, smaller seeds are more likely to become entrapped and, hence, disperse less far. Our analysis on existing seed data reveals that water-dispersed riparian plants have relatively large seeds and are thereby evolutionarily adapted to long-distance dispersal. Furthermore, our results indicate that median dispersal distances are 0.02-1.8 km (99-percentile <8.5 km) in lowland streams in summer. In winter, less vegetation is present in and surrounding the streams, which leads to median dispersal distances of 0.12-14.2 km (99-percentile <65 km). 4. Synthesis. This study demonstrates that (a) large seeds generally disperse further than smaller seeds in lowland steams and (b) distances depend strongly on stream vegetation. This information should inform future restoration, for instance, by planning efforts to coincide with times or conditions of open water which are more favourable for the dispersal of target plant species-especially those with small seeds (<10 mm).

Hydrological niche segregation defines forest structure and drought tolerance strategies in a seasonal Amazon forest	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						2015 ENSO; Amazon functional diversity; cavitation; embolism resistance; hydraulic traits; root depth; stable isotopes; water potential	CANOPY LEAF-AREA; WATER-UPTAKE; SOIL-WATER; CARBON DYNAMICS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; EASTERN AMAZON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ROOTING DEPTH; PLANTS	1. The relationship between rooting depth and above-ground hydraulic traits can potentially define drought resistance strategies that are important in determining species distribution and coexistence in seasonal tropical forests, and understanding this is important for predicting the effects of future climate change in these ecosystems. 2. We assessed the rooting depth of 12 dominant tree species (representing c. 42% of the forest basal area) in a seasonal Amazon forest using the stable isotope ratios (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of water collected from tree xylem and soils from a range of depths. We took advantage of a major ENSO-related drought in 2015/2016 that caused substantial evaporative isotope enrichment in the soil and revealed water use strategies of each species under extreme conditions. We measured the minimum dry season leaf water potential both in a normal year (2014; Psi(non-ENSO)) and in an extreme drought year (2015; Psi(ENSO)). Furthermore, we measured xylem hydraulic traits that indicate water potential thresholds trees tolerate without risking hydraulic failure (P-50 and P-88). 3. We demonstrate that coexisting trees are largely segregated along a single hydrological niche axis defined by root depth differences, access to light and tolerance of low water potential. These differences in rooting depth were strongly related to tree size; diameter at breast height (DBH) explained 72% of the variation in the delta O-18(xylem). Additionally, delta O-18(xylem) explained 49% of the variation in P-50 and 70% of P-88, with shallow-rooted species more tolerant of low water potentials, while delta O-18 of xylem water explained 47% and 77% of the variation of minimum Psi(non-ENSO) and Psi(ENSO). 4. We propose a new formulation to estimate an effective functional rooting depth, i.e. the likely soil depth from which roots can sustain water uptake for physiological functions, using DBH as predictor of root depth at this site. Based on these estimates, we conclude that rooting depth varies systematically across the most abundant families, genera and species at the Tapajos forest, and that understorey species in particular are limited to shallow rooting depths. 5. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance, which also affect the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest. 6. Synthesis. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and demonstrate its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance (access to deep water vs. tolerance of very low water potentials). We found that the single hydrological axis defining water use traits was strongly related to tree size, and infer that periodic extreme droughts influence community composition and the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest.

Temperate forests are predicted to experience an increased frequency and intensity of climate change-induced summer droughts and heat waves in the near future. Yet, while previous studies clearly showed a high drought sensitivity of different temperate tree species, the vulnerability of the physiological integrity of these trees remains unclear. 2. Here, we assessed the sensitivity of six temperate tree species to severe water limitation during three consecutive growing seasons, including the exceptional 2015 central European summer drought and heat wave. Specifically, we assessed stem increment growth, sap flow, water potentials, hydraulic vulnerability, and nonstructural carbohydrate contents in leaves and branches to determine how mature temperate trees responded to this exceptional weather event and how the observed responses relate to variation in xylem embolism and carbohydrate economy. 3. We found that the trees' predawn water potentials reached their minimum values during the 2015 summer drought and most species reduced their sap flow by up to 80%. Also, increment growth was strongly impaired with the onset of the drought in all species. Despite the strong responses in the trees' growth and water relations, all species exhibited minimum midday shoot water potentials well away from values associated with severe embolism (P-50). In addition, we detected no distinct decrease in nonstructural carbohydrate contents in leaves, bark, and stems throughout the drought event. 4. Synthesis. This study shows that mature individuals of six common central European forest tree species strongly reacted to a severe summer drought by reducing their water consumption and stopping growth. We found, however, no indications for xylem embolism or carbohydrate depletion in these trees. This suggests, that xylem embolism formation and carbohydrate reserve depletion are not routine in temperate trees during seasonal strong drought and reveals a low vulnerability of the physiological integrity of temperate trees during drought events as we describe here.

Trait plasticity is more important than genetic variation in determining species richness of associated communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						arthropods; community genetics; functional traits; heritability; intraspecific variation; phenotypic plasticity; rhizosphere	ANT-APHID INTERACTIONS; PLANT GENOTYPE; ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY; NATURAL-SELECTION; ABIOTIC FACTORS; WIDE IMPACTS; SPECIFICITY; HERBIVORES; DIVERSITY	1. Intraspecific variation can be an important driver of ecological interactions in species-rich communities. Predicting the effects of intraspecific variation in different environments, however, remains a major challenge. This is because we often do not quantify both the effects of functional traits on associated communities and the extent to which trait variation is due to genetics (genotype effects) vs. plasticity (environment effects). As a consequence, the relative importance of trait plasticity vs. genetic variation in structuring associated communities remains unclear. 2. We sought to fill this gap by conducting common garden experiments with the plant Salix hookeriana across biotic (ant-aphid interactions) and abiotic (wind exposure) environmental gradients in a coastal dune ecosystem. In each experiment, we simultaneously measured plant traits and species richness of associated above- and below-ground communities. We then used statistical models to quantify the relative importance of trait plasticity vs. genetic variation in structuring communities. 3. Our major finding was that trait plasticity was more important than genetic variation in determining the number of species in associated communities. This result was consistent across different environmental contexts (experimental manipulations of ant-aphid interactions and wind exposure), multiple years, and for above-ground arthropods and root microbes. This occurred because the traits that had the largest effect on species richness were also the most plastic. 4. Synthesis. These results indicate that trait plasticity can be a dominant driver of above- and below-ground biodiversity.

The shifting defence hypothesis (SDH) predicts that after invasive plants are introduced to new ranges, they will evolve reduced resistance to specialist herbivores and increased resistance to generalist herbivores because they can escape from specialists but are still attacked by generalists in their nonnative ranges. For this to be true, the subsequent introduction of native specialist herbivores should reverse the above evolutionary processes, but evidence collected so far is scarce. 2. Here, we address this research gap by comparing resistance to specialist and generalist herbivores and resistance-related traits in the invasive plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia from five populations with about a decade history of infestation by the accidentally introduced native specialist leaf beetle Ophraella communa (infested populations), and three populations without such infestation history (uninfested populations). 3. In common garden experiments, the specialist O. communa performed better on uninfested populations than on infested populations, whereas two generalist insects, Spodoptera litura and Helicoverpa armigera, performed better on infested populations. Chemical analyses showed that plants from infested populations had lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid, an antigeneralist secondary compound that can attract O. communa. Furthermore, across mother plants from all populations studied, chlorogenic acid content was negatively correlated with larval growth of S. litura and positively correlated with that of O. communa. Finally, quantitative defence traits did not differ between infested and uninfested populations. 4. Although our results are most consistent with rapid evolution caused by enemy reassociation, we cannot exclude the possibility that observed differences in resistance result from multiple introductions or selections from other environmental factors. 5. Synthesis. These results suggest that reassociation with a specialist herbivore from the native range may result in a rapid evolution of increased resistance to specialist herbivores and reduced resistance to generalist herbivores in the introduced range, which is likely to be mediated by the reduced production of secondary chemicals that can deter generalists while attracting the introduced specialist. This study supports the shifting defence hypothesis (SDH) from a new viewpoint, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the impacts of both specialist and generalist herbivores when evaluating the long-term control effects of classical biological control programmes.

A long-standing explanation for invasion success is that invasive plants could evolve to be more competitive following introduction. This evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis, however, has seldom been tested with regard to intraspecific competition. Given that plants can display different responses to related and unrelated conspecifics, the evolution of intraspecific competitive ability might be specific to genotypes of different relatedness. 2. Here, we grew five native (South American) and five introduced (North American) genotypes of the clonal herbaceous invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides alone, with above-ground competition from kin (the same genotype) or from one of two types of strangers (another genotype from the same range or another genotype from the other range). 3. When grown alone, introduced and native genotypes produced similar total biomass and storage-root biomass. However, in response to intraspecific competition, introduced genotypes showed increases in total biomass and stem length, and a decrease in specific stem length, whereas native genotypes showed the opposite pattern. When grown with kin instead of strangers, introduced genotypes showed an increase in branch number, whereas native genotypes showed the opposite. 4. Synthesis. Our study provided evidence for evolution of increased intraspecific competitive ability in an invasive plant. We also found, for the first time, that the interactions among kin were likely to shift from competition towards facilitation following introduction.

Evolution during population spread affects plant performance in stressful environments	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arabidopsis thaliana; competition; drought; heat; invasion; range expansion; spread velocity; stress tolerance	LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; FECUNDITY TRADE-OFF; LARGE SEED SIZE; RAPID EVOLUTION; RANGE EXPANSION; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DISPERSAL; ARABIDOPSIS; TOLERANCE	1. Reliable predictions of population spread rates are essential to forecast biological invasions. Recent studies have shown that populations spreading through favourable habitat can rapidly evolve higher dispersal and reproductive rates at the expansion front, which accelerates spread velocity. However, spreading populations are likely to eventually encounter stressful conditions in the expanded range. How evolution during spread in favourable environments affects subsequent population growth in harsher environments is currently unknown. 2. We examined evolutionary change in performance under drought, interspecific competition, and heat stress for populations of Arabidopsis thaliana that experienced six generations of spread through replicated experimental landscapes of favourable habitat. To quantify how population performance under stress differed between leading edge and founding populations, we combined individual tests of genotype performance under stress with knowledge of the genotype frequency changes that occurred over the replicate invasions. 3. After spreading through favourable environments, the average silique production of individuals exposed to drought or interspecific competition was lower in leading edge than founding populations. This change was driven by the evolution of lower intrinsic silique production, which was correlated with increased seed size, a trait that evolved as populations spread. The ability of plants to tolerate drought or interspecific competition, however, did not change markedly during spread. Heat tolerance did increase in leading edge populations, and this trait was associated with the evolution of taller plants during spread through favourable habitat. 5. Synthesis. We conclude that evolution during spread in favourable environments may affect the ability of populations to grow under stressful conditions as experienced in the expanded range, through changes in either intrinsic fecundity or stress tolerance. Thus, evolution during spread may constrain or extend the eventual range limit of nonnative species invasions.

The often patchy distribution of serpentine geology can lead to abrupt changes in soil and microclimates. Thus, serpentine areas provide an ideal natural setting to understand how divergent selection drives the process of local adaptation in edaphically specialized plants. When the serpentine ecotype is surrounded by a related nonserpentine ecotype, a balance of natural selection and potential gene flow should maintain the different ecotypes over very short distances. We aimed to reveal the mechanisms allowing soil ecotypes of a goldenrod species to co-occur sympatrically in Japan. 2. We performed field surveys to characterize microenvironments and flowering phenology of each ecotype, common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments and artificial crossing, and population genetic analysis to investigate the levels of genetic differentiation between ecotypes. 3. Growth chamber experiments show that serpentine plants showed lower specific leaf area (SLA) and greater resource allocation to their root systems than did their nonserpentine counterparts, a potential adaptation to drier and less fertile soil condition in serpentine habitats. Reciprocal transplant studies demonstrated a clear pattern of local adaptation in the plant growth rate. Importantly, serpentine populations completed flowering by midsummer versus late summer in nonserpentine plants. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that early flowering ensures reproductive success, before the microclimatic conditions becomes severe in open habitats. Although prezygotic isolation was a strong barrier to gene flow, genetic differentiation was very low, indicating a recent origin for the serpentine ecotypes and/or gene flow at low frequencies. 4. Synthesis. The findings indicate that the early flowering times of serpentine ecotypes, which would have been selected for by microclimates in serpentine areas, can play roles in local adaptation, but also population isolation via a by-product of diverged reproductive timings. This study contributes to general understanding of the initial stages of plant ecological speciation under potential gene flow in very small geographic scales.

Long time series of primary production are rarely available, restricting our mechanistic understanding of vegetation and ecosystem dynamics under climate change. Dendrochronological tools are increasingly used instead, particularly in the Arcticthe world's most rapidly warming biome. Yet, high-latitude plant species are subject to strong energy allocation trade-offs, and whether annual allocations to secondary growth (e.g. "tree-rings") actually reflect primary production above-ground remains unknown. Taking advantage of a unique ground-based monitoring time series of annual vascular plant biomass in high Arctic Svalbard (78 degrees N), we evaluated how well retrospective ring growth of the widespread dwarf shrub Salix polaris represents above-ground biomass production of vascular plants. 2. Using a balanced design in permanent plots for plant biomass monitoring, we collected 30 S. polaris shrubs across five sites in each of two habitats. We established annual ring growth time series using linear mixed-effects models and related them to weather records and 13 years of above-ground biomass production in six habitats. 3. Annual ring growth was positively correlated with above-ground biomass production of both S. polaris (r = 0.56) and the vascular plant community as a whole (r = 0.70). As for above-ground biomass, summer temperature was the main driver of ring growth, with this ecological signal becoming particularly clear when accounting for plant, site and habitat heterogeneity. The results suggest that ring growth measurements performed on this abundant shrub can be used to track fluctuations in past vascular plant production of high arctic tundra. 4. Synthesis. Dendrochronological tools are increasingly used on arctic shrubs to enhance our understanding of vegetation dynamics in the world's most rapidly warming biome. Fundamental to such applications is the assumption that annual differences in ring growth reflect between-year variation in above-ground biomass production. We showed that ring growth indeed was a robust proxy for the annual above-ground productivity of both the focal shrub and the vascular plant community as a whole. Despite the challenges of constructing ring growth chronologies from irregularly growing arctic shrubs, our findings confirm that shrub dendrochronology can open new opportunities for community-dynamic studies, including in remote places where annual field sampling is difficult to achieve.

MILL.; BLACK SPRUCE; DENDROCHRONOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION; FOREST PRODUCTIVITY; DROUGHT; GROWTH; FIR; IMPACTS; RESOLUTION	1. As major alterations are occurring in climate and pest ranges, it is imperative to evaluate their combined contribution to tree mortality in order to propose mitigation measures and limit losses in forest productivity. The objective of this study was to explore the association between declines in tree growth resulting from climatic and biotic (spruce budworm) disturbances, and their interactions on tree mortality of two dominant tree species, Abies balsamea and Picea mariana, of the eastern North-American boreal forest. 2. We disentangle the influences of abiotic and biotic components on growth through a combination of model-data comparison techniques. First, we characterized the variability in tree growth and mortality in the study area using a network of tree-ring width measurements collected from living and dead trees. Subsequently, a bioclimatic simulation model was used to estimate the past annual, nonlinear, responses of stand-level net primary production (NPP) to climate variability (period 1902-2012). From these two data sources, we defined the biotic stress events as the variance in the tree-ring data unexplained by the bioclimatic forest growth simulation. 3. Throughout the 20th century, two periods of adverse climatic conditions preceded spruce budworm outbreaks episodes and induced tree mortality. Climatic stress events were associated with cold springs, warmer than average summers. We found that past stress history in interaction with tree characteristics and species predisposed trees to mortality. In addition, co-occurring events (climatic and biotic) increased the severity of mortality episodes. 4. Synthesis. Our study challenges the belief that spruce budworm outbreak is the primary driver of broad-scale tree mortality in eastern boreal forest. Rather, tree mortality is the result of cumulative events that combine unfavourable conditions for growth, resulting in loss of tree vigour and subsequently, mortality. Co-occurrence of stresses in the future may lead to more severe episodes of mortality, as extreme climatic events become more frequent.

Pollination niches are important components of ecological niches and have played a major role in the diversification of Angiosperms. In this study, we focused on Euro-Mediterranean orchids, which use diverse pollination strategies and interact with various functional groups of insects. In these orchids, we investigated the determinants of pollination niche breadth and overlap by analysing the orchid-pollinator network and the factors that may have shaped it. 2. We constructed a database reporting 1,278 interactions between 243 orchid and 773 pollinator species based on a thorough literature review. We then focused on 153 orchid species for which phylogenetic data were available. We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to study the relationship between specialisation (as estimated by the degree and degree in the projected network), pollination strategy and breadths of orchids' spatial and temporal distributions, while correcting for the effect of phylogenetic relationships among orchid species and sampling effort. We then used a singular value decomposition of the orchid-pollinator matrix combined to a redundancy and variation partitioning analyses to investigate the determinants of similarity in pollination niches between orchids. 3. Specialisation was higher in deceptive than in nectar-producing orchids and decreased with the breadth of orchids' spatial distribution. When interactions were considered at the insect family level, similarity in pollination niches between orchids was solely explained by their pollination strategy and phylogeny. By contrast, when they were considered at the insect species level, this similarity was primarily explained by their geographical range and flowering time, although other factors had significant effects as well, with orchids using the same pollination strategy, being closely related and growing in the same habitats sharing more insect species than expected. 4. Synthesis. Specialisation in orchid-pollinator interactions depends on orchids' pollination strategy and geographical range. The pool of insect families with which orchids interact depends on their pollination strategy and phylogeny, with consistent associations between some functional or phylogenetic groups of orchids and some families of pollinators. By contrast, the pool of insect species with which orchids interact depends on their spatio-temporal distribution, suggesting that at a finer scale, orchid-pollinator interactions are more opportunistic than previously thought.

Quantifying the benefits of pollinator abundance and diversity for plant reproduction is a critical challenge, especially given recent pollinator declines. Many studies test for pollen limitation (PL), but huge gaps remain in our understanding of how often and why plants experience PL. Most studies are limited to a few sites or years. Little existing research mechanistically links pollinator visitation with plant reproduction. Also, buffering against variability in visitation is a key but largely untested potential benefit of pollinator diversity. Long-term studies pairing visitation data with PL experiments are essential to addressing these gaps, but extremely rare. 2. I measured pollinator visitation, responses to pollen supplementation, and fruit weights in the generalist plant Scrophularia californica across multiple sites for 8years. I determined how often S. californica experienced significant PL and tested mechanistic models predicting PL and fruit (capsule) weight from visitation. I then used those models to simulate pollinator loss and evaluate the relative effects of changes in visit quantity and quality. I explored the stabilizing benefits of visitor diversity by quantifying both covariation among pollinators and effects of simulated species loss on variation in PL and capsule weights. 3. Scrophularia showed significant PL in only 26.9% of patch/year combinations tested. Visitation by the most abundant (Apis mellifera) and effective (Vespulapensylvanica) pollinators strongly predicted PL and capsule weights. Both response curves were highly nonlinear, but PL saturated more with increased visitation. Pollinator loss simulations predicted substantially increased PL and reduced capsule weights, mostly because of lower visit numbers rather than changes in visit quality. Visitation rates of individual pollinators varied substantially and without correlation. Simulated pollinator loss increased the spatial and temporal skew in visitation, resulting in higher predicted coefficients of variation for PL and capsule weights. 4. Synthesis. Previous work predicts a nonlinear relationship between pollinator visitation and plant reproduction, but this is the first long-term study I am aware of that quantifies such a pattern. The analysis of covariance in pollinator visitation combined with my simulation results provide novel empirical support for another important hypothesis, that multiple pollinators can provide stabilizing benefits for plant reproduction.

Legacy, Rather Than Adequacy, Drives the Selection of Hydrological Models	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						model selection; model evaluation; bibliometric study; text mining; community model; modular modeling frameworks	INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; SCIENCE; WATER; NEED; IMPLEMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; PROTOCOL; SCHEMES; SUPPORT; SYSTEM	The findings of hydrological modeling studies depend on which model was used. Although hydrological model selection is a crucial step, experience suggests that hydrologists tend to stick to the model they have experience with, and rarely switch to competing models, although these models might be more adequate given the study objectives. To gain quantitative insights into model selection, we explored the use of seven rainfall-runoff models based on the abstract of 1,529 peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 and 2018. The models selected were the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV), the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), the mesoscale Hydrological model (mHM), the TOPography-based hydrologic model (TOPMODEL), the Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS), the Genie Rural model a 4 parametres Journaliers (GR4J), and the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model. We provide quantitative evidence of regional preferences in model use across the world and demonstrate that specific models are consistently preferred by certain institutes. Model attachment is particularly strong. In similar to 74% of the studies, the model selected can be predicted solely based on the affiliation of the first author. The influence of adequacy on the model selection process is less clear. Our data reveal that each model is used across a wide range of purposes, landscapes, and temporal and spatial scales (i.e., as a model of everything and everywhere). Model intercomparisons can provide guidance for model selection and improve model adequacy, but they are still rare (because each model must usually be setup individually) and the insights they provide are currently limited (because they are rarely controlled experiments). We suggest that moving from fixed-structure models to modular modeling frameworks (master templates for model generation) can overcome these issues, enable a more collaborative and responsive model development environment, and result in improved model adequacy.

Saplings were more abundant at a distance of ca. 50m from the edge of small, large and connected patches, but large patches also exhibited reduced recruitment towards the interior of the patch. Conversely, sapling density in simple-shaped or connected patches was lower at the edge, exhibiting linear and concave-down increase trends towards the interior of patches, respectively.ConclusionsBoundary conditions could be interacting with interior forest conditions, making regeneration more frequent at 50m from the edge. Shady and cooler sites in large patches may be inhibiting oak regeneration. The activity of acorn-dispersing animals and oak predators may increase in unconnected patches, thus increasing the likelihood of edge effects. These results provide insights into the restoration of temperate forest patches in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes.

These benefits largely depend on the plant species richness and composition of yards.ObjectivesWe aim to determine the factors that drive plant species richness and phylogenetic composition of cultivated and spontaneous flora in urban yards at the continental scale, and how these potential drivers interact.MethodsWe analyzed plant species richness and phylogenetic composition of cultivated and spontaneous flora of 117 private yards from six major metropolitan areas in the US. Yard plant species richness and phylogenetic composition were expressed as a function of biophysical and socioeconomic variables and yard characteristics using linear mixed-effects models and spatially explicit structural equation modeling.ResultsExtreme temperatures largely determined yard species richness and phylogenetic composition at the continental scale. Precipitation positively predicted spontaneous richness but negatively predicted cultivated richness. Only the phylogenetic composition of the spontaneous flora was associated with precipitation. The effect of lower temperatures and precipitation on all yard diversity parameters was partly mediated by yard area. Among various socioeconomic variables, only education level showed a significant effect on cultivated phylogenetic composition.ConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that irrigation compensates for precipitation in driving cultivated yard plant diversity at the continental scale. Socioeconomic variables among middle and upper class families have no apparent influence on yard diversity. These findings inform the adaptation of US urban vegetation in cities in the face of global change.

In southern Switzerland, where herbicides are applied at large scales, vegetated vineyards are limited in extent and isolated from one another, potentially limiting the distribution and dispersal ability of organisms.ObjectivesWe tested the separate and interactive effects of habitat amount and fragmentation on invertebrate abundance using a multi-scale framework, along with additional environmental factors. We identified which variables at which scales were most important in predicting patterns of invertebrate abundance.MethodsWe used a factorial design to sample across a gradient of habitat amount (area of vegetated vineyards, measured as percentage of landscape PLAND) and fragmentation (number of vegetated patches, measured as patch density PD). Using 10 different spatial scales, we identified the factors and scales that most strongly predicted invertebrate abundance and tested potential interactions between habitat amount and fragmentation.ResultsHabitat amount (PLAND index) was most important in predicting invertebrate numbers at a field scale (50m radius). In contrast, we found a negative effect of fragmentation (PD) at a broad scale of 450m radius, but no interactive effect between the two.ConclusionsThe spatial scales at which habitat amount and fragmentation affect invertebrates differ, underpinning the importance of spatially explicit study designs in disentangling the effects between habitat amount and configuration. We showed that the amount of vegetated vineyards has more influence on invertebrate abundance, but that fragmentation also contributed substantially. This suggests that efforts for augmenting the area of vegetated vineyards is more beneficial for invertebrate numbers than attempts to connect them.

Diet and trophic interactions of a circumglobally significant gelatinous marine zooplankter, Dolioletta gegenbauri (Uljanin, 1884)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						diet; doliolid; next-generation sequencing; pelagic tunicate; qPCR; selective feeding; South Atlantic Bight; trophic interactions	DOLIOLIDS TUNICATA; QUANTITATIVE PCR; GUT CONTENTS; JELLYFISH; BLOOMS; RATES; SALPS; SEA; QUANTIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY	Gelatinous zooplankton play a crucial role in marine planktonic food webs. However, primarily due to methodological challenges, the in situ diet of zooplankton remains poorly investigated and little is known about their trophic interactions including feeding behaviour, prey selection and in situ feeding rates. This is particularly true for gelatinous zooplankton including the marine pelagic tunicate, Dolioletta gegenbauri. In this study, we applied an 18S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding approach to identify the diet of captive-fed and wild-caught D. gegenbauri on the midcontinental shelf of the South Atlantic Bight, USA. Sequencing-based approaches were complimented with targeted quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Captive-fed D. gegenbauri gut content was dominated by pico-, nano- and micro-plankton including pico-dinoflagellates (picozoa) and diatoms. These results suggested that diatoms were concentrated by D. gegenbauri relative to their concentration in the water column. Analysis of wild-caught doliolids by quantitative real-time PCR utilizing a group-specific diatom primer set confirmed that diatoms were concentrated by D. gegenbauri, particularly by the gonozooid life stage associated with actively developing blooms. Sequences derived from larger metazoans were frequently observed in wild-caught animals but not in captive-fed animals suggesting experimental bias associated with captive feeding. These studies revealed that the diet of D. gegenbauri is considerably more diverse than previously described, that parasites are common in wild populations, and that prey quality, quantity and parasites are likely all important factors in regulating doliolid population dynamics in continental shelf environments.

Finding flies in the mushroom soup: Host specificity of fungus-associated communities revisited with a novel molecular method	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						community structure; DNA extraction and purification; ecological interaction networks; fungi; host specificity; metabarcoding	BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENT; INSECT COMMUNITY; GNATS DIPTERA; DNA; PATTERNS; PCR; DIVERSITY; EXTRACTION; FOREST; MYCETOPHILIDAE	Fruiting bodies of fungi constitute an important resource for thousands of other taxa. The structure of these diverse assemblages has traditionally been studied with labour-intensive methods involving cultivation and morphology-based species identification, to which molecular information might offer convenient complements. To overcome challenges in DNA extraction and PCR associated with the complex chemical properties of fruiting bodies, we developed a pipeline applicable for extracting amplifiable total DNA from soft fungal samples of any size. Our protocol purifies DNA in two sequential steps: (a) initial salt-isopropanol extraction of all nucleic acids in the sample is followed by (b) an extra clean-up step using solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) magnetic beads. The protocol proved highly efficient, with practically all of our samples-regardless of biomass or other properties-being successfully PCR-amplified using metabarcoding primers and subsequently sequenced. As a proof of concept, we apply our methods to address a topical ecological question: is host specificity a major characteristic of fungus-associated communities, that is, do different fungus species harbour different communities of associated organisms? Based on an analysis of 312 fungal fruiting bodies representing 10 species in five genera from three orders, we show that molecular methods are suitable for studying this rich natural microcosm. Comparing to previous knowledge based on rearing and morphology-based identifications, we find a species-rich assemblage characterized by a low degree of host specialization. Our method opens up new horizons for molecular analyses of fungus-associated interaction webs and communities.

Quantity accounts for the number of seeds dispersed and quality for the probability of recruitment of dispersed seeds. Research on this topic has largely focused on the spatial patterns of seed deposition because seed fates often vary between microhabitats due to differences in biotic and abiotic factors. However, the temporal dimension has remained-completely overlooked despite these factors-and even local disperser assemblages - can change dramatically during long fruiting periods. Here, we test timing effects on seed dispersal effectiveness, using as study case a keystone shrub species dispersed by frugivorous birds and with a fruiting period of 9 months. We evaluated quantity and quality in different microhabitats of a Mediterranean forest and different periods of the fruiting phenophase. We identified the bird species responsible for seed deposition through DNA barcoding and evaluated the probability of seedling recruitment through a series of field experiments on sequential demographic processes. We found that timing matters: The disperser assemblage was temporally structured, seed viability decreased markedly during the plant's fruiting phenophase, and germination was lower for viable seeds dispersed in the fruiting peak. We show how small contributions to seed deposition by transient migratory species can result in a relevant effectiveness if they disperse seeds in a high-quality period for seedling recruitment. This study expands our understanding of seed dispersal effectiveness, highlighting the importance of timing and infrequent interactions for population and community dynamics.

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to gut content analysis, thereby deriving a new perspective on community interactions and their responses to environment. For this, we use an elevational gradient in the High Arctic, asking how the environment and species traits interact in shaping predator-prey interactions involving the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis. To characterize the community of potential prey available to this predator, we used pitfall trapping and vacuum sampling. To characterize the prey actually consumed, we applied molecular gut content analysis. Using joint species distribution models, we found elevation and vegetation mass to explain the most variance in the composition of the prey community locally available. However, such environmental variables had only a small effect on the prey community found in the spider's gut. These observations indicate that Pardosa exerts selective feeding on particular taxa irrespective of environmental constraints. By directly modelling the probability of predation based on gut content data, we found that neither trait matching in terms of predator and prey body size nor phylogenetic or environmental constraints modified interaction probability. Our results indicate that taxonomic identity may be more important for predator-prey interactions than environmental constraints or prey traits. The impact of environmental change on predator-prey interactions thus appears to be indirect and mediated by its imprint on the community of available prey.

Interactions along abiotic gradients can provide clues as to how organisms will face changing environmental conditions, such as future range shifts. However, it is challenging to find replicated systems to study these effects. Phytotelmata, such as those found in carnivorous plants, are isolated aquatic communities and thus form a good model for the study of replicated food webs. Due to the degraded nature of the prey, molecular techniques provide a useful tool to study these communities. We studied the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea L. in allochthonous populations along an elevational gradient in the Alps and Jura. We predicted that invertebrate richness in the contents of the pitcher plants would decrease with increasing elevation, reflecting harsher environmental conditions. Using metabarcoding of the COI gene, we sequenced the invertebrate contents of these pitcher plants. We assigned Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units at ordinal level as well as recovering species-level data. We found small but significant changes in community composition with elevation. These recovered sequences could belong to invertebrate prey, rotifer inquilines, pollinators and other animals possibly living inside the pitchers. However, we found no directional trend or site-based differences in MOTU richness with elevational gradient. Use of molecular techniques for dietary or contents analysis is a powerful way to examine numerous degraded samples, although factors such as DNA persistence and the relationship with species presence still have to be completely determined.

Seasonally varying marine influences on the coastal ecosystem detected through molecular gut analysis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						DNA metabarcoding; marine inflow; molecular gut content analysis; Pardosa	MIXED-SPECIES DIETS; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; GENERALIST PREDATOR; ALTERNATIVE PREY; DEPOSITION; LYCOSIDAE; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; SPIDERS	Terrestrial predators on marine shores benefit from the inflow of organisms and matter from the marine ecosystem, often causing very high predator densities and indirectly affecting the abundance of other prey species on shores. This indirect effect may be particularly strong if predators shift diets between seasons. We therefore quantified the seasonal variation in diet of two wolf spider species that dominate the shoreline predator community, using molecular gut content analyses with general primers to detect the full prey range. Across the season, spider diets changed, with predominantly terrestrial prey from May until July and predominantly marine prey (mainly chironomids) from August until October. This pattern coincided with a change in the spider age and size structure, and prey abundance data and resource selection analyses suggest that the higher consumption of chironomids during autumn is due to an ontogenetic diet shift rather than to variation in prey abundance. The analyses suggested that small dipterans with a weak flight capacity, such as Chironomidae, Sphaeroceridae, Scatopsidae and Ephydridae, were overrepresented in the gut of small juvenile spiders during autumn, whereas larger, more robust prey, such as Lepidoptera, Anthomyidae and Dolichopodidae, were overrepresented in the diet of adult spiders during spring. The effect of the inflow may be that the survival and growth of juvenile spiders is higher in areas with high chironomid abundances, leading to higher densities of adult spiders and higher predation rates on the terrestrial prey next spring.

Yet, who visits the flower of specific plants, how the composition of these visitors varies in space and time and how such variation translates into pollination services are hard to establish. The use of DNA barcodes allows us to address ecological patterns involving thousands of taxa that are difficult to identify. To clarify the regional variation in the visitor community of a widespread flower resource, we compared the composition of the arthropod community visiting species in the genus Dryas (mountain avens, family Rosaceae), throughout Arctic and high-alpine areas. At each of 15 sites, we sampled Dryas visitors with 100 sticky flower mimics and identified specimens to Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) using a partial sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene. As a measure of ecosystem functioning, we quantified variation in the seed set of Dryas. To test for an association between phylogenetic and functional diversity, we characterized the structure of local visitor communities with both taxonomic and phylogenetic descriptors. In total, we detected 1,360 different BINs, dominated by Diptera and Hymenoptera. The richness of visitors at each site appeared to be driven by local temperature and precipitation. Phylogeographic structure seemed reflective of geological history and mirrored trans-Arctic patterns detected in plants. Seed set success varied widely among sites, with little variation attributable to pollinator species richness. This pattern suggests idiosyncratic associations, with function dominated by few and potentially different taxa at each site. Taken together, our findings illustrate the role of post-glacial history in the assembly of flower-visitor communities in the Arctic and offer insights for understanding how diversity translates into ecosystem functioning.

However, little is known on what prey sustains these predators at the start of succession and which factors drive the structure of these food webs. As prey availability can be extremely patchy and episodic in pioneer stages, trophic networks might be highly variable. Moreover, the importance of allochthonous versus autochthonous food sources for these pioneer predators is mostly unknown. To answer these questions, the gut content of 1,832 arthropod predators, including four species of carabid beetles, two lycosid and several linyphiid spider species caught in early and late pioneer stages of three glacier forelands, was screened molecularly to track intraguild and extraguild trophic interactions among all major prey groups occurring in these systems. Two-thirds of the 2,310 identified food detections were collembolans and intraguild prey, while one-third were allochthonous flying insects. Predator identity and not successional stage or valley had by far the strongest impact on the trophic interaction patterns. Still, the variability of prey spectra increased significantly from early to late pioneer stage, as did the niche width of the predators. As such the structure of pioneer arthropod food webs in recently deglaciated Alpine habitats seems to be driven foremost by predator identity while site and early successional effects contribute to a lesser extent to food web variability. Our findings also suggest that in these pioneer sites, predatory arthropods depend less on allochthonous aeolian prey but are mainly sustained by prey of local production.

Here, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of plant-AM fungal interactions in a biodiverse semi-natural grassland. We sampled all plant species in a 1,000-m(2) homogeneous plot of dry calcareous grassland in two seasons (summer and autumn) and identified root-colonizing AM fungi by SSU rDNA sequencing. In the network of 33 plant and 100 AM fungal species, we found a significant effect of both host plant species and host plant functional group on AM fungal richness and community composition. Comparison with network null models revealed a larger-than-random degree of partner selectivity among plants. Grasses harboured a larger number of AM fungal partners and were more generalist in partner selection, compared with forbs. More generalist partner association and lower specialization were apparent among obligately, compared with facultatively, mycorrhizal plant species and among locally more abundant plant species. This study provides the most complete data set of co-occurring plant and AM fungal taxa to date, showing that at this particular site, the interaction network is assembled non-randomly, with moderate selectivity in associations between plant species and functional groups and their fungal symbionts.

Here, we used DNA metabarcoding to study feather mites on passerine birds in Spain, sequencing mtDNA (COI) for 25,540 individual mites (representing 64 species) from 1,130 birds (representing 71 species). Surprisingly, 1,228 (4.8%) mites from 84 (7.4%) birds were found on host species that were not the expected to be a host according to a recent bird-feather mite associations catalog. Unexpected associations were widespread across studied mite (40.6%) and bird (43.7%) species and showed smaller average infrapopulation sizes than typical associations. Unexpected mite species colonized hosts being distantly related to the set of their usual hosts, but with similar body size. The network of bird-mite associations was modular (i.e., some groups of bird and mite species tended to be more associated with each other than with the others), with 75.9% of the unexpected associations appearing within the module of the typical hosts of the mite species. Lastly, 68.4% of mite species found on unexpected hosts showed signatures of genetic differentiation, and we found evidence for reproduction or the potential for it in many of the unexpected associations. Results show host colonization as a common phenomenon even for these putatively highly host-specific symbionts. Thus, host-switching by feather mites, rather than a rare phenomenon, appears as a relatively frequent phenomenon shaped by ecological filters such as host morphology and is revealed as a fundamental component for a dynamic coevolutionary and codiversification scenario.

While there are several experimental studies that report quantitative metabarcoding results, there are a similar number that fail to do so. Here, we provide the rationale to understand under what circumstances the technique can be quantitative. In essence, we simulate a mixture of DNA of S species with a defined initial abundance distribution. In the simulated PCR, each species increases its concentration following a certain amplification efficiency. The final DNA concentration will reflect the initial one when the efficiency is similar for all species; otherwise, the initial and final DNA concentrations would be poorly related. Although there are many known factors that modulate amplification efficiency, we focused on the number of primer-template mismatches, arguably the most important one. We used 15 common primers pairs targeting the mitochondrial COI region and the mitogenomes of ca. 1,200 insect species. The results showed that some primers pairs produced quantitative results under most circumstances, whereas some other primers failed to do so. In conclusion, depending on the primer pair used in the PCR amplification and on the characteristics of the mixture analysed (i.e., high species richness, low evenness), DNA metabarcoding can provide a quantitative estimate of the relative abundances of different species.

How quantitative is metabarcoding: A meta-analytical approach	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						biomass; high-throughput sequencing; meta-analysis; metabarcoding; next-generation sequencing	DNA; COMMUNITY; DIET; SELECTION; BIOMASS	Metabarcoding has been used in a range of ecological applications such as taxonomic assignment, dietary analysis and the analysis of environmental DNA. However, after a decade of use in these applications there is little consensus on the extent to which proportions of reads generated corresponds to the original proportions of species in a community. To quantify our current understanding, we conducted a structured review and meta-analysis. The analysis suggests that a weak quantitative relationship may exist between the biomass and sequences produced (slope = 0.52 +/- 0.34, p < 0.01), albeit with a large degree of uncertainty. None of the tested moderators, sequencing platform type, the number of species used in a trial or the source of DNA, were able to explain the variance. Our current understanding of the factors affecting the quantitative performance of metabarcoding is still limited: additional research is required before metabarcoding can be confidently utilized for quantitative applications. Until then, we advocate the inclusion of mock communities when metabarcoding as this facilitates direct assessment of the quantitative ability of any given study.

While basic species-level pollen identification using standard DNA barcode markers is established, the extent to which metabarcoding (a) correctly assigns species identities to mixes (qualitative matching) and (b) generates sequence reads proportionally to their relative abundance in a sample (quantitative matching) is unclear, as these have not been assessed relative to known standards. We tested the quantitative and qualitative robustness of metabarcoding in constructed pollen mixtures varying in species richness (1-9 species), taxonomic relatedness (within genera to across class) and rarity (5%-100% of grains), using Illumina MiSeq with the markers rbcL and ITS2. Qualitatively, species composition determinations were largely correct, but false positives and negatives occurred. False negatives were typically driven by lack of a barcode gap or rarity in a sample. Species richness and taxonomic relatedness, however, did not strongly impact correct determinations. False positives were likely driven by contamination, chimeric sequences and/or misidentification by the bioinformatics pipeline. Quantitatively, the proportion of reads for each species was only weakly correlated with its relative abundance, in contrast to suggestions from some other studies. Quantitative mismatches are not correctable by consistent scaling factors, but instead are context-dependent on the other species present in a sample. Together, our results show that metabarcoding is largely robust for determining pollen presence/absence but that sequence reads should not be used to infer relative abundance of pollen grains.

Here, we demonstrate three key methods for incorporating DNA data into network ecology and discuss analytical considerations using a model consisting of plants, insects, bats and their parasites from the Costa Rica dry forest. The simplest method involves the use of Sanger sequencing to acquire long sequences to validate or refine field identifications, for example of bats and their parasites, where one specimen yields one sequence and one identification. This method can be fully quantified and resolved and these data resemble traditional ecological networks. For more complex taxonomic identifications, we target multiple DNA loci, for example from a seed or fruit pulp sample in faeces. These networks are also well resolved but gene targets vary in resolution and quantification is difficult. Finally, for mixed templates such as faecal contents of insectivorous bats, we use DNA metabarcoding targeting two sequence lengths (157 and 407 bp) of one gene region and a MOTU, BLAST and BIN association approach to resolve nodes. This network type is complex to generate and analyse, and we discuss the implications of this type of resolution on network analysis. Using these data, we construct the first molecular-based network of networks containing 3,304 interactions between 762 nodes of eight trophic functions and involving parasitic, mutualistic and predatory interactions. We provide a comparison of the relative strengths and weaknesses of these data types in network ecology.

Protocol for the Development of a Food Stress Index to Identify Households Most at Risk of Food Insecurity in Western Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						food insecurity; food stress; food affordability	HEALTHY; AFFORDABILITY; QUALITY; BASKET; COST; DIET	Food stress, a similar concept to housing stress, occurs when a household needs to spend more than 25% of their disposable income on food. Households at risk of food stress are vulnerable to food insecurity as a result of inadequate income. A Food Stress Index (FSI) identifies at-risk households, in a particular geographic area, using a range of variables to create a single indicator. Candidate variables were identified using a multi-dimensional framework consisting of household demographics, household income, household expenses, financial stress indicators, food security, food affordability and food availability. The candidate variables were expressed as proportions, of either persons or households, in a geographic area. Principal Component Analysis was used to determine the final variables which resulted in a final set of weighted raw scores. These scores were then scaled to produce the index scores for the Food Stress Index for Western Australia. The results were compared with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas to determine suitability. The Food Stress Index was found to be a suitable indicator of the relative risk of food stress in Western Australian households. The FSI adds specificity to indices of relative disadvantage specifically related to food insecurity and provides a useful tool for prioritising policy and other responses to this important public health issue.

We present the validations of two instruments to measure bullying (European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, EBIPQ) and discriminatory bullying with respect to SEN (EBIPQ-Special Education Needs Discrimination version, henceforth EBIPQ-SEND). A total of 17,309 teenagers from Ecuador took part in the study (M = 14.76, SD = 1.65; 49.9% male). The item response theory analyses evidenced accuracy and quality of the measures. The confirmatory factor analyses of the EBIPQ and the EBIPQ-SEND revealed the same two-factor structureaggression and victimizationregardless of gender, showing optimal fit indexes. We present the results of the prevalence according to the roles of participation in traditional bullying and discriminatory bullying around SEN. Significant gender and age differences were observed for involvement in both phenomena. We also discuss the advantages of applying the EBIPQ and the EBIPQ-SEND to evaluate and diagnose harassment and discriminatory harassment around SEN.

Here we document the in situ impact of submarine CO2 volcanic emissions (CO2 vents) on live shelled-pteropods (planktonic gastropods) species Creseis conica in the Gulf of Naples (Tyrrhenian Sea, Mediterranean). Since the currents inside the Gulf will likely drive those pelagic calcifying organisms into and out of the CO2 vent zones, we assume that pteropods will be occasionally exposed to the vents during their life cycle. Shell degradation and biomass were investigated in the stations located within and nearby the CO2 vent emission in relation to the variability of sea water carbonate chemistry. A relative decrease in shell biomass (22%), increase in incidence of shell fractures (38%) and extent of dissolution were observed in Creseis conica collected in the Gulf of Naples compared to those from the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea (control stations). These results suggest that discontinuous but recurrent exposure to highly variable carbonate chemistry could consistently affect the characteristic of the pteropod shells.

Identifying changes in nutritional quality, as well as species most at risk, is crucial if societies are to secure food production. Here, changes in the biochemical composition and nutritional properties of the commercially valuable oysters, Magallana gigas and Ostrea edulis, were evaluated following a 12-week exposure to six ocean acidification and warming scenarios that were designed to reflect the temperature (+ 3 degrees C above ambient) and atmospheric pCO(2) conditions (increase of 350-600 ppm) predicted for the mid-to end-of-century. Results suggest that O. edulis, and especially M. gigas, are likely to become less nutritious (i.e. containing lower levels of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate), and have reduced caloric content under ocean acidification and warming. Important changes to essential mineral composition under ocean acidification and warming were evident in both species; enhanced accumulation of copper in M. gigas may be of concern regarding consumption safety. In light of these findings, the aquaculture industry may wish to consider a shift in focus toward species that are most robust to climate change and less prone to deterioration in quality, in order to secure future food provision and socio-economic benefits of aquaculture.

Using Stable Carbon Isotopes of Seasonal Ecosystem Respiration to Determine Permafrost Carbon Loss	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						permafrost; carbon; thaw; warming; isotope partitioning; respiration	MICROBIAL DECOMPOSITION; AUTOTROPHIC RESPIRATION; WARMING PERMAFROST; ORGANIC-MATTER; SOIL CARBON; TUNDRA; CO2; TEMPERATURE; DELTA-C-13; NITROGEN	High latitude warming and permafrost thaw will expose vast stores of deep soil organic carbon (SOC) to decomposition. Thaw also changes water movement causing either wetter or drier soil. The fate of deep SOC under different thaw and moisture conditions is unclear. We measured weekly growing-season delta C-13 of ecosystem respiration (Reco delta C-13) across thaw and moisture conditions (Shallow-Dry; Deep-Dry; Deep-Wet) in a soil warming manipulation. Deep SOC loss was inferred from known delta C-13 signatures of plant shoot, root, surface soil, and deep soil respiration. In addition, a 2-year-old vegetation removal treatment (No Veg) was used to isolate surface and deep SOC decomposition contributions to Reco. In No Veg, seasonal Reco delta C-13 indicated that deep SOC loss increased as the soil column thawed, while in vegetated areas, root contributions appeared to dominate Reco. The Reco delta C-13 differences between Shallow-Dry and Deep-Dry were significant but surprisingly small. This most likely suggests that, under dry conditions, soil warming stimulates root and surface SOC respiration with a negative C-13 signature that opposes the more positive C-13 signal from increased deep SOC respiration. In Deep-Wet conditions, Reco delta C-13 suggests reduced deep SOC loss but could also reflect altered diffusion or methane (CH4) dynamics. Together, these results demonstrate that frequent Reco delta C-13 measurements can detect deep SOC loss and that plants confound the signal. In future studies, soil profile delta C-13 measurements, vegetation removal across thaw gradients, and isotopic effects of CH4 dynamics could further deconvolute deep SOC loss via surface Reco.

Water availability is a critical driver of productivity in semiarid ecosystems, which often alternate between carbon sink/source functioning during wet/dry years. In this study, we investigate how groundwater availability resulting from groundwater-river water exchange influences net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), evapotranspiration (ET), and the surface energy balance at two semiarid ecosystems along the Columbia River in central Washington, USA. We examined 1year of eddy covariance measurements from an upland sagebrush ecosystem primarily fed by rainfall without groundwater access and a riparian grassland ecosystem with groundwater access during the dry season due to lateral groundwater-river water exchange. The two sites had distinct seasonal patterns of NEE and ET, driven by differences in water availability. While NEE at the upland sagebrush site was strongly constrained by water availability during the dry months, access to groundwater allowed the riparian site to maintain high NEE magnitude and ET during the same dry months. The riparian site had larger annual gross primary productivity than the upland site (612 vs. 424 gC/m(2)), which was offset by higher ecosystem respiration (558 vs.363 gC/m(2)). Thus, the magnitude of the annual NEE at the upland site was larger than that at the riparian site (-62 vs. -54 gC/m(2)). Our results demonstrate that groundwater access determined by connectivity between groundwater and surface water can be a critical driver of carbon uptake and ET in semiarid ecosystems.

The biofiltering capacity, distribution patterns and degradation of the antimicrobial sulfamethazine (SMT) by halophyte Chenopodium quinoa under hydroponic conditions and its further biodegradation through anaerobic digestion were evaluated. C. quinoa was cultivated for a complete life cycle under different concentrations of SMT (0, 2 and 5 mg/L) and sodium chloride (0 and 15 g/L). C. quinoa is able to uptake and partially degrade SMT. The higher the SMT concentration in the culture medium, the higher the SMT content in the plant tissue. SMT has different distribution patterns within the plant organs, and no SMT is found in the seeds. Dry crop residues containing SMT have a great potential to produce methane through anaerobic digestion and, in addition, SMT is further biodegraded. The highest specific methane yields are obtained using crop residues of the plants cultivated in the presence of salt and SMT with concentrations between 0 and 2 mg/L.

A growing body of empirical work demonstrates that environmental governance outcomes depend upon how well patterns of interaction among actors align with patterns of ecological connectivity, such as wildfire transmission. However, the factors that facilitate or inhibit this alignment remain poorly understood. It is crucial to improve understanding of the conditions under which actors establish or maintain linkages with other actors with whom they are interdependent because of ecological linkages. To this end, we introduce the concept of "risk interdependence archetypes" based on the spatial configurations by which one actor (i.e. a particular organization) is exposed to risk via the actions of another actor. We then develop a set of hypotheses to explore how different sets of conditions associated with each spatial configurations of risk interdependence may shape the likelihood that an actor coordinates with another actor in ways that promote social-ecological alignment. We test these hypotheses using network analysis of a wildfire transmission network developed through simulation of wildfires over several thousand fire seasons and a governance network created from interviews with 154 representatives of 87 organizations involved in efforts to mitigate wildfire risk in the Eastern Cascades Ecoregion, USA. Results indicate that social-ecological alignment is more likely when actors have opportunities to influence forest management practices on ignition-prone lands that they do not manage themselves, and when actors bear greater responsibility for averting losses from wildfires that spread to lands they manage independently. Importantly, not all forms of risk interdependence increase the likelihood of alignment, implying that organizations have limited capacity for interaction and may prioritize certain risk mitigation partnerships over others. While the performance of risk governance systems may hinge on the alignment of social and ecological networks, our results suggest that alignment in turn may depend on actor-level strategies for interaction with other actors.

A similar PF-C remobilization might have contributed to the increase in atmospheric CO2 during deglacial warming after the last glacial maximum. Using carbon isotopes and terrestrial biomarkers (Delta C-14, delta C-13, and lignin phenols), this study quantifies deposition of terrestrial carbon originating from permafrost in sediments from the Chukchi Sea (core SWERUS-L2-4-PC1). The sediment core reconstructs remobilization of permafrost carbon during the late Allerod warm period starting at 13,000 cal years before present (BP), the Younger Dryas, and the early Holocene warming until 11,000 cal years BP and compares this period with the late Holocene, from 3,650 years BP until present. Dual-carbon-isotope-based source apportionment demonstrates that Ice Complex Deposit-ice- and carbon-rich permafrost from the late Pleistocene (also referred to as Yedoma)-was the dominant source of organic carbon (66 +/- 8%; mean +/- standard deviation) to sediments during the end of the deglaciation, with fluxes more than twice as high (8.0 +/- 4.6 g.m(-2).year(-1)) as in the late Holocene (3.1 +/- 1.0 g.m(-2).year(-1)). These results are consistent with late deglacial PF-C remobilization observed in a Laptev Sea record, yet in contrast with PF-C sources, which at that location were dominated by active layer material from the Lena River watershed. Release of dormant PF-C from erosion of coastal permafrost during the end of the last deglaciation indicates vulnerability of Ice Complex Deposit in response to future warming and sea level changes.

In this study we compared soil and vegetation properties at a jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb) forest adjacent to one of the largest mines in the region with a jack pine stand located approximately 15km from the mine. At the site closest to the mine, throughfall deposition of SO4-S and DIN (NO3+NH4) exceeds 30 and 20kgha(-1)y(-1), respectively, compared with less than 9kgha(-1)y(-1) for SO4-S and less than 2kgha(-1)y(-1) DIN at the distant site. However, on an equivalence basis, base cation (Ca+Mg+Na) deposition in throughfall at both sites exceeded the combined S and N deposition. Total S and N as well as Ca and Mg concentrations in epiphytic lichens and tree bark were significantly higher at the site adjacent to the mine, reflecting the higher acidic and base cation throughfall deposition. The forest floor at the stand close to the mine had a significantly higher pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K and total S concentrations compared with the distant site. The chemistry of deeper mineral soil horizons was more consistent between the two sites. Foliar concentrations of S, Ca, Mg, Fe and Al in jack pine, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium myrtilloides and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi were also higher at the site close to the mine, but these differences were not always significant. Coincidental with differences in atmospheric deposition, herbaceous cover and biomass, especially A. uva-ursi, was significantly higher, and terricolous lichen cover was several fold lower at the site closest to the mine. This work indicates that despite high S and N emissions from oil sands activities, forest fertilization and alkalization may be of greater concern than acidification owing to large dust emissions from the mines and the Acid Deposition Management Framework for the region should be modified accordingly.

One well-documented such phase-shift has been from coral to algal domination on tropical reefs. On South Pacific coral reefs, the macroalga Turbinaria ornata has expanded its range and habitat but, unlike algae that often dominate after phase-shifts, T. ornata is structurally complex and generally unpalatable to herbivores. Therefore, it may serve a foundational role on coral reefs, such as providing habitat structure to more palatable primary producers and corresponding trophic support to fishes. We predicted increasing T. ornata density would facilitate growth of associated algae, resulting in a positive trophic cascade to herbivorous fish. An experiment manipulating T. ornata densities showed a unimodal relationship between T. ornata and growth of understory algae, with optimal growth occurring at the most frequent natural density. Epiphyte cover also increased with density until the same optimum, but remained high with greater T. ornata densities. Foraging by herbivorous fishes increased linearly with T. ornata density. An herbivore exclusion experiment confirmed T. ornata facilitated epiphytes, but resource use of epiphytes by herbivores, though significant, was not affected by T. ornata density. Therefore, T. ornata performs foundational roles because it provides novel habitat to understory and epiphytic macroalgae and trophic support to consumers, though likely this function is at the expense of the original foundational corals.

Post-fire Redistribution of Soil Carbon and Nitrogen at a Grassland-Shrubland Ecotone	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						shrub encroachment; wildfire; spatial heterogeneity; soil redistribution; microsites; geostatistics	SOUTHERN NEW-MEXICO; DESERT GRASSLAND; AEOLIAN SEDIMENT; WIND EROSION; FIRE; VEGETATION; TRANSPORT; HETEROGENEITY; ENCROACHMENT; NUTRIENTS	The rapid conversion of grasslands into shrublands has been observed in many arid and semiarid regions worldwide. Studies have shown that fire can negatively affect shrub communities and promote resource homogenization, thereby providing some reversibility to the resource heterogeneity induced by shrub encroachment, especially in the early stages of encroachment. Here, we used prescribed fire in a grassland-shrubland transition zone in the northern Chihuahuan Desert to test the hypothesis that fire facilitates the remobilization of nutrient-enriched soil from shrub microsites to grass and bare microsites and thereby reduces the spatial heterogeneity of soil resources. Results show that the shrub microsites had the lowest water content compared to grass and bare microsites after fire, even when rain events occurred. Significant differences of total soil carbon (TC) and total soil nitrogen (TN) among the three microsites were not detected 1year after the fire. The spatial autocorrelation distance increased from 1 to 2m, approximately the mean diameter of an individual shrub canopy, to over 5m 1year after the fire for TC and TN. Patches of high soil C and N decomposed 1year after the prescribed fire. Overall, fire stimulates the redistribution of soil C and N from shrub microsites to nutrient-depleted grass and bare microsites, leading to a decrease in spatial heterogeneity of these elements. The redistribution of soil C and N from shrub to grass and bare microsites, coupled with the reduced soil water content under the shrub canopies but not in grass and bare microsites, suggests that fire might influence the competition between shrubs and grasses, leading to a higher grass, compared to shrub, coverage in this ecotone.

Most studies focusing on urban ecosystems have been conducted in temperate forests of the Northern hemisphere; the ecological and socioeconomic contexts, however, may influence biodiversity responses to urbanization. We ask whether the biomes (here, the humid subtropical forest and the semiarid shrubland) where human settlements and land uses are developed determine bird diversity along urbanization gradients in the southern Neotropics. We propose theoretical responses based on expected variations in vegetation cover along urbanization gradients and fit our data to different models of bird richness from highly developed to non-urban areas and also examine changes in species composition. Species richness was positively correlated to vegetation cover in both human settlements. Results supported some of our predictions. In the city located in the arid biome, the highly developed area supported higher bird richness than the natural habitat, unlike the city from the humid biome; yet, the native bird assemblage was better preserved in the urban area established in the humid biome. Richness in moderately developed areas was either higher than or similar to that in rural or natural areas in the settlement from the arid biome, but lower than or similar to richness in the humid biome. In all the studied urban-rural gradients, bird richness reached a plateau in moderately developed areas, in contrast to urban-natural habitat gradients, where richness either increased (in the humid biome) or declined (in the arid biome). Our study helps to understand how the mechanisms changing biodiversity in urbanized areas may act in different biomes and land uses, and therefore contributes to the search of global explanations of diversity patterns.

The raw percentage of individuals in the sample (naive prevalence) is generally used for this purpose, but it is likely to be subject to two main sources of bias. First, the detectability of individuals is ignored; second, classification errors may occur due to some inherent limits of the diagnostic methods. We developed a hidden Markov (also known as multievent) capture-recapture model to estimate prevalence in free-ranging populations accounting for imperfect detectability and uncertainty in individual's classification. We carried out a simulation study to compare naive and model-based estimates of prevalence and assess the performance of our model under different sampling scenarios. We then illustrate our method with a real-world case study of estimating the prevalence of wolf (Canis lupus) and dog (Canis lupus familiaris) hybrids in a wolf population in northern Italy. We showed that the prevalence of hybrids could be estimated while accounting for both detectability and classification uncertainty. Model-based prevalence consistently had better performance than naive prevalence in the presence of differential detectability and assignment probability and was unbiased for sampling scenarios with high detectability. We also showed that ignoring detectability and uncertainty in the wolf case study would lead to underestimating the prevalence of hybrids. Our results underline the importance of a model-based approach to obtain unbiased estimates of prevalence of different population segments. Our model can be adapted to any taxa, and it can be used to estimate absolute abundance and prevalence in a variety of cases involving imperfect detection and uncertainty in classification of individuals (e.g., sex ratio, proportion of breeders, and prevalence of infected individuals).

Inferring species richness using multispecies occupancy modeling: Estimation performance and interpretation	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						data augmentation; detectability; imperfect detection; richness; species occupancy; Switzerland	IMPERFECT DETECTION; BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; PROBABILITIES; BIODIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; INFERENCE; SUBJECT; SIZE; BIAS	Multispecies occupancy models can estimate species richness from spatially replicated multispecies detection/non-detection survey data, while accounting for imperfect detection. A model extension using data augmentation allows inferring the total number of species in the community, including those completely missed by sampling (i.e., not detected in any survey, at any site). Here we investigate the robustness of these estimates. We review key model assumptions and test performance via simulations, under a range of scenarios of species characteristics and sampling regimes, exploring sensitivity to the Bayesian priors used for model fitting. We run tests when assumptions are perfectly met and when violated. We apply the model to a real dataset and contrast estimates obtained with and without predictors, and for different subsets of data. We find that, even with model assumptions perfectly met, estimation of the total number of species can be poor in scenarios where many species are missed (>15%-20%) and that commonly used priors can accentuate overestimation. Our tests show that estimation can often be robust to violations of assumptions about the statistical distributions describing variation of occupancy and detectability among species, but lower-tail deviations can result in large biases. We obtain substantially different estimates from alternative analyses of our real dataset, with results suggesting that missing relevant predictors in the model can result in richness underestimation. In summary, estimates of total richness are sensitive to model structure and often uncertain. Appropriate selection of priors, testing of assumptions, and model refinement are all important to enhance estimator performance. Yet, these do not guarantee accurate estimation, particularly when many species remain undetected. While statistical models can provide useful insights, expectations about accuracy in this challenging prediction task should be realistic. Where knowledge about species numbers is considered truly critical for management or policy, survey effort should ideally be such that the chances of missing species altogether are low.

However, many modeling efforts ignore the dynamic processes that drive distributional patterns at different scales, which may result in misleading inference about the factors influencing species distributions. Current occupancy models allow estimation of occupancy at different scales and, separately, estimation of immigration and emigration. However, joint estimation of local extinction, colonization, and occupancy within a multi-scale model is currently unpublished. We extended multi-scale models to account for the dynamic processes governing species distributions, while concurrently modeling local-scale availability. We fit the model to data for lark buntings and chestnut-collared longspurs in the Great Plains, USA, collected under the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program. We investigate how the amount of grassland and shrubland and annual vegetation conditions affect bird occupancy dynamics and local vegetation structure affects fine-scale occupancy. Buntings were prevalent and longspurs rare in our study area, but both species were locally prevalent when present. Buntings colonized sites with preferred habitat configurations, longspurs colonized a wider range of landscape conditions, and site persistence of both was higher at sites with greener vegetation. Turnover rates were high for both species, quantifying the nomadic behavior of the species. Our model allows researchers to jointly investigate temporal dynamics of species distributions and hierarchical habitat use. Our results indicate that grassland birds respond to different covariates at landscape and local scales suggesting different conservation goals at each scale. High turnover rates of these species highlight the need to account for the dynamics of nomadic species, and our model can help inform how to coordinate management efforts to provide appropriate habitat configurations at the landscape scale and provide habitat targets for local managers.

Precision gain versus effort with joint models using detection/non-detection and banding data	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						abundance; data integration; integrated population models; recruitment; study design; survival; western bluebird; wildfire effects	ESTIMATING ABUNDANCE; MARK-RECAPTURE; POPULATION; DYNAMICS; SURVIVAL; MOVEMENT; RATES; FIRE	Capture-recapture techniques provide valuable information, but are often more cost-prohibitive at large spatial and temporal scales than less-intensive sampling techniques. Model development combining multiple data sources to leverage data source strengths and for improved parameter precision has increased, but with limited discussion on precision gain versus effort. We present a general framework for evaluating trade-offs between precision gained and costs associated with acquiring multiple data sources, useful for designing future or new phases of current studies.We illustrated how Bayesian hierarchical joint models using detection/non-detection and banding data can improve abundance, survival, and recruitment inference, and quantified data source costs in a northern Arizona, USA, western bluebird (Sialia mexicana) population. We used an 8-year detection/non-detection (distributed across the landscape) and banding (subset of locations within landscape) data set to estimate parameters. We constructed separate models using detection/non-detection and banding data, and a joint model using both data types to evaluate parameter precision gain relative to effort.Joint model parameter estimates were more precise than single data model estimates, but parameter precision varied (apparent survival>abundance>recruitment). Banding provided greater apparent survival precision than detection/non-detection data. Therefore, little precision was gained when detection/non-detection data were added to banding data. Additional costs were minimal; however, additional spatial coverage and ability to estimate abundance and recruitment improved inference. Conversely, more precision was gained when adding banding to detection/non-detection data at higher cost. Spatial coverage was identical, yet survival and abundance estimates were more precise. Justification of increased costs associated with additional data types depends on project objectives.We illustrate a general framework for evaluating precision gain relative to effort, applicable to joint data models with any data type combination. This framework evaluates costs and benefits from and effort levels between multiple data types, thus improving population monitoring designs.

Use of classical bird census transects as spatial replicates for hierarchical modeling of an avian community	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Bayesian multispecies occupancy models; cell size; community models; community size; detectability; environmental covariates; forest birds; historical data	ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; SPECIES RICHNESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INFERENCE; DYNAMICS; ABUNDANCE; HABITAT; SHIFTS	New monitoring programs are often designed with some form of temporal replication to deal with imperfect detection by means of occupancy models. However, classical bird census data from earlier times often lack temporal replication, precluding detection-corrected inferences about occupancy. Historical data have a key role in many ecological studies intended to document range shifts, and so need to be made comparable with present-day data by accounting for detection probability. We analyze a classical bird census conducted in the region of Murcia (SE Spain) in 1991 and 1992 and propose a solution to estimating detection probability for such historical data when used in a community occupancy model: the spatial replication of subplots nested within larger plots allows estimation of detection probability. In our study, the basic sample units were 1-km transects, which were considered spatial replicates in two aggregation schemes. We fit two Bayesian multispecies occupancy models, one for each aggregation scheme, and evaluated the linear and quadratic effect of forest cover and temperature, and a linear effect of precipitation on species occupancy probabilities. Using spatial rather than temporal replicates allowed us to obtain individual species occupancy probabilities and species richness accounting for imperfect detection. Species-specific occupancy and community size decreased with increasing annual mean temperature. Both aggregation schemes yielded estimates of occupancy and detectability that were highly correlated for each species, so in the design of future surveys ecological reasons and cost-effective sampling designs should be considered to select the most suitable aggregation scheme. In conclusion, the use of spatial replication may often allow historical survey data to be applied formally hierarchical occupancy models and be compared with modern-day data of the species community to analyze global change process.

Estimability of migration survival rates from integrated breeding and winter capture-recapture data	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Bayesian; Cormack-Jolly-Seber; demography; integrated population model; mark-recapture; migration; migratory connectivity; survival	ANNUAL-CYCLE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; SURVIVORSHIP; TRACKING; CLIMATE	Long-distance migration is a common phenomenon across the animal kingdom but the scale of annual migratory movements has made it difficult for researchers to estimate survival rates during these periods of the annual cycle. Estimating migration survival is particularly challenging for small-bodied species that cannot carry satellite tags, a group that includes the vast majority of migratory species. When capture-recapture data are available for linked breeding and non-breeding populations, estimation of overall migration survival is possible but current methods do not allow separate estimation of spring and autumn survival rates. Recent development of a Bayesian integrated survival model has provided a method to separately estimate the latent spring and autumn survival rates using capture-recapture data, though the accuracy and precision of these estimates has not been formally tested. Here, I used simulated data to explore the estimability of migration survival rates using this model. Under a variety of biologically realistic scenarios, I demonstrate that spring and autumn migration survival can be estimated from the integrated survival model, though estimates are biased toward the overall migration survival probability. The direction and magnitude of this bias are influenced by the relative difference in spring and autumn survival rates as well as the degree of annual variation in these rates. The inclusion of covariates can improve the model's performance, especially when annual variation in migration survival rates is low. Migration survival rates can be estimated from relatively short time series (4-5years), but bias and precision of estimates are improved when longer time series (10-12years) are available. The ability to estimate seasonal survival rates of small, migratory organisms opens the door to advancing our understanding of the ecology and conservation of these species. Application of this method will enable researchers to better understand when mortality occurs across the annual cycle and how the migratory periods contribute to population dynamics. Integrating summer and winter capture data requires knowledge of the migratory connectivity of sampled populations and therefore efforts to simultaneously collect both survival and tracking data should be a high priority, especially for species of conservation concern.

Effects of distance on detectability of Arctic waterfowl using double-observer sampling during helicopter surveys	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						aerial survey; detection probability; distance sampling; mark-recapture	VISIBILITY BIAS; MARK-RECAPTURE; LINE TRANSECT; AERIAL SURVEYS; POPULATIONS; MODELS	Aerial survey is an important, widely employed approach for estimating free-ranging wildlife over large or inaccessible study areas. We studied how a distance covariate influenced probability of double-observer detections for birds counted during a helicopter survey in Canada's central Arctic. Two observers, one behind the other but visually obscured from each other, counted birds in an incompletely shared field of view to a distance of 200 m. Each observer assigned detections to one of five 40-m distance bins, guided by semi-transparent marks on aircraft windows. Detections were recorded with distance bin, taxonomic group, wing-flapping behavior, and group size. We compared two general model-based estimation approaches pertinent to sampling wildlife under such situations. One was based on double-observer methods without distance information, that provide sampling analogous to that required for mark-recapture (MR) estimation of detection probability, (p) over cap, and group abundance, (G) over cap, along a fixed-width strip transect. The other method incorporated double-observer MR with a categorical distance covariate (MRD). A priori, we were concerned that estimators from MR models were compromised by heterogeneity in (p) over cap due to un-modeled distance information; that is, more distant birds are less likely to be detected by both observers, with the predicted effect that (p) over cap would be biased high, and (G) over cap biased low. We found that, despite increased complexity, MRD models (Delta AICc range: 0-16) fit data far better than MR models (Delta AICc range: 204-258). However, contrary to expectation, the more naive MR estimators of p were biased low in all cases, but only by 2%-5% in most cases. We suspect that this apparently anomalous finding was the result of specific limitations to, and trade-offs in, visibility by observers on the survey platform used. While MR models provided acceptable point estimates of group abundance, their far higher stranded errors (0%-40%) compared to MRD estimates would compromise ability to detect temporal or spatial differences in abundance. Given improved precision of MRD models relative to MR models, and the possibility of bias when using MR methods from other survey platforms, we recommend avian ecologists use MRD protocols and estimation procedures when surveying Arctic bird populations.

Understanding the relationships between land use and variation in population growth rates is therefore critical for the management of many farmland species. Using 24 years of data of a declining farmland bird in an integrated population model, we examined how spatiotemporal variation in land use (defined as habitats with Short and Tall ground vegetation during the breeding season) and habitat-specific demographic parameters relates to variation in population growth taking into account individual movements between habitats. We also evaluated contributions to population growth using transient life table response experiments which gives information on contribution of past variation of parameters and real-time elasticities which suggests future scenarios to change growth rates. LTRE analyses revealed a clear contribution of Short habitats to the annual variation in population growth rate that was mostly due to fledgling recruitment, whereas there was no evidence for a contribution of Tall habitats. Only 18% of the variation in population growth was explained by the modeled local demography, the remaining variation being explained by apparent immigration (i.e., the residual variation). We discuss potential biological and methodological reasons for high contributions of apparent immigration in open populations. In line with LTRE analysis, real-time elasticity analysis revealed that demographic parameters linked to Short habitats had a stronger potential to influence population growth rate than those of Tall habitats. Most particularly, an increase of the proportion of Short sites occupied by Old breeders could have a distinct positive impact on population growth. High-quality Short habitats such as grazed pastures have been declining in southern Sweden. Converting low-quality to high-quality habitats could therefore change the present negative population trend of this, and other species with similar habitat requirements.

Their amount has decreased dramatically during the 20th century in whole Europe due to the intensification of agriculture. Wood-pastures host some fungal species that prefer warm areas and are adapted to semi-open conditions, but still very little is known about fungi in these habitats. We studied how management, historical land-use intensity, present grazing intensity, time since abandonment, and stand conditions affect the species richness and community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We surveyed fruit bodies on three 10 m x 10 m study plots in 36 sites and repeated the surveys three times. Half of the sites were currently unmanaged but had a grazing history. We measured soil pH, soil moisture and the basal area of different tree species, and interviewed landowners about grazing history. We found that the proportion of broadleaved trees, soil pH, and soil moisture are the major drivers of the communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi in boreal wood-pastures. Management or grazing intensity did not have significant effects on fungal species richness, whereas historical land-use intensity seemed to have a negative effect on species richness. To conclude, present stand conditions are the most important factors to evaluate when planning the conservation of ectomycorrhizal fungi living in semi-open forest habitats.

Here, we evaluate if a woody biochar can produce both agronomic and environmental benefits in deficit irrigation systems by ameliorating water stress, improving crop N uptake and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. To evaluate these responses, we established a maize field trial in northern Colorado under deficit irrigation treatments with a woody biochar amendment. Irrigation treatments included recommended irrigation (Full), recommended irrigation except during non-essential growth phases (Limited) and 50% of recommended irrigation (Drought). We measured crop biomass, grain yield, grain N uptake, mineral N availability, soil water content, soil field capacity, soil C sequestration and N2O emissions. Drought treatments reduced both grain and biomass yield while Limited irrigation showed no significant yield reduction relative to Full irrigation. Biochar amendments did not provide any yield improvements. Biochar also did not alter mineral N availability within the soil profile or grain N uptake. Biochar amendments increased gravimetric soil water content by 9.7% over the field season and increased water retention by 7.4%. However, these increases failed to alleviate the water stress coefficient, an index of how much the water content has dropped below the maximum soil water depletion acceptable between irrigation applications, which was correlated with yield. Biochar sequestered C primarily as coarse biochar particles with significant losses, likely a result of erosion. Across irrigation treatments biochar treatments trended towards a lower mean cumulative N2O emissions over the growing season, but such effect was not significant due to high spatial variability in N2O fluxes. Both biochar amendments and Limited irrigation treatments did not significantly impact yield-scaled cumulative N2O emissions or irrigation water-use efficiency. This research highlights the importance of targeting the deficit irrigation treatment timing and amount to maximize biochar's improved water retention in order to reduce crop water stress. It also confirms the diminished biochar N2O emission reductions in the field relative to most lab incubations due to drier field conditions and crop N uptake.	[Ramlow, M.; Foster, E. J.; Cotrufo, M.

Madagascar is no exception and land-use change, mostly driven by slash-and-burn agriculture, is impacting the island's exceptional biodiversity. Although most species are negatively affected by agricultural expansion, some, such as synanthropic bats, are capable of exploring newly available resources and benefit from man-made agricultural ecosystems. As bats are known predators of agricultural pests it seems possible that Malagasy bats may be preferentially foraging within agricultural areas and therefore provide important pest suppression services. To investigate the potential role of bats as pest suppressors, we conducted acoustic surveys of insectivorous bats in and around Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, during November and December 2015. We surveyed five landcover types: irrigated rice, hillside rice, secondary vegetation, forest fragment and continuous forest. 9569 bat passes from a regional assemblage of 19 species were recorded. In parallel, we collected faeces from the six most common bat species to detect insect pest species in their diet using DNA metabarcoding. Total bat activity was higher over rice fields when compared to forest and bats belonging to the open space and edge space sonotypes were the most benefited by the conversion of forest to hillside and irrigated rice. Two economically important rice pests were detected in the faecal samples collected - the paddy swarming armyworm Spodoptera mauritia was detected in Mops leucogaster samples while the grass webworm Herpetogramma licarsisalis was detected from Mormopterus jugularis and Miniopterus majori samples. Other crops pests detected included the sugarcane cicada Yanga guttulata, the macadamia nut-borer Thaumatotibia batrachopa and the sober tabby Ericeia inangulata (a pest of citrus fruits). Samples from all bat species also contained reads from important insect disease vectors. In light of our results we argue that Malagasy insectivorous bats have the potential to suppress agricultural pests. It is important to retain and maximise Malagasy bat populations as they may contribute to higher agricultural yields and promote sustainable livelihoods.

However, such wetlands are often embedded in a matrix of agricultural fields, potentially putting species within these wetlands at risk. One recommendation for conservation of amphibians in agriculture-dominated landscapes is to maintain a buffer of permanent vegetation around the wetland. However, it is not clear how wide wetland buffers must be to effectively conserve amphibians in agriculture-dominated landscapes or what vegetation types are suitable buffer vegetation. Furthermore, it is not clear whether wetland buffers produce similar or better conservation outcomes for amphibians than actions conducted at larger spatial extents. We addressed these questions using data from anuran (frog and toad) breeding call surveys in 36 wetlands in rural eastern Ontario, Canada. First, we tested for the effects of 49 different wetland buffer measurements on anuran richness, relative anuran abundance, and the abundance/probability of occurrence of individual species. These 49 measurements represented all combinations of seven different ways to measure the wetland buffer size and seven types of buffer vegetation. Wetland buffer size was measured as the minimum width of buffer vegetation contiguous with the wetland and proportion of the area within 5, 16, 30, SO, 120, or 300 m of the wetland containing buffer vegetation that was contiguous with the wetland. Then, to compare the strength of effect of wetland buffers versus landscape context on anurans, we compared the wetland buffer measurement with the strongest positive effect on each anuran response (from the previous analysis) to the effects of three landscape-scale variables: area of woodland; area of wetlands, streams, rivers, and lakes; and road density. We did not detect positive effects of wetland buffers on anuran richness or relative anuran abundance. This is because positive effects of wetland buffers on individual species were rare, i.e. positive effects were only supported for two of the six species with enough data to model individually: American toads (Anaxyrus americanus) and green frogs (Lithobates clamitans). Furthermore, we found that the landscape context had much stronger effects on relative anuran abundance than the wetland buffer, with effect sizes ranging from 4 (road density) to 14 (woodland cover) times that of the wetland buffer. These findings suggest that guidelines for anuran conservation in agricultural landscapes should generally focus on protection of terrestrial habitat at the landscape scale rather than on maintenance of wetland buffers.

HNVf comprises agricultural areas of semi-natural state, low-intensity farming and fine-scale landscape mosaics of different habitat types. For a successful implementation, the identification of HNVf should correctly reflect the variation in biodiversity values between different agricultural landscapes. We examined how well the Finnish HNVf indicator and the sub-indicators constituting it recalculated for the purposes of this study for five study regions reflect the variation in bird and butterfly species richness and diversity patterns at different spatial scales. We found that butterfly diversity index was positively associated with the HNVf indicator at the finest scale of 0.5 km x 0.5 km squares. Among the HNVf sub-indicators, extensive cultivation of grasslands was most strongly related to the farmland bird diversity and the density of edge to the butterfly diversity. Thus, the HNVf concept reflects well the distribution of butterflies in the Finnish agricultural landscapes but insufficiently the diversity patterns of farmland birds. Importantly, semi-natural vegetation and long-term pastures the backbone of the concept presently occur in small and highly fragmented patches in agricultural landscapes in Finland. The Pan-European concept of HNVf has restricted application to farmland birds of this boreal country and the national HNVf concept may need to be revised.

We modeled the potential distribution of Bombina variegata, Hyla arborea, Hyla meridionalis, and Triturus cristatus using ecological niche modeling, in the French administrative region Nouvelle-Aquitaine. The species are all at range margin in the study area which makes them interesting model species to study range shifts because of their potential local adaptations to their marginal habitat. We used Dyna-CLUE modeling framework to produce land-use change scenarios and combined them with RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios to predict their impact on local amphibian distributions. B. variegata, H. arborea, and T. cristatus were predicted to shift eastward and northward. H. meridionalis was predicted to increase its probability of presence in the study area. The effect of climate determined the general pattern of distribution and was modulated depending on the scenarios of land-use change.

Here, we examine vegetation resilience in coastal wetlands of subtropical Australia to altered salinity and flooding regimes likely to occur with climate change. We conducted field surveys and glasshouse experiments to examine plant diversity and regeneration responses of understorey and canopy species across four habitats. Vegetation composition, but not richness, varied between seaward and inland habitats while soil seed bank diversity was greatest in more inland sites. Experimental salinity and flooding treatments strongly influenced emergence from seed banks with most species germinating under fresh, waterlogged conditions and very few in saline treatments. Composition of emerging seedling assemblages was similar across habitats and treatments but differed considerably from the extant vegetation, indicating a relatively minor role of soil seed banks in sustaining current vegetation structure in this wetland. An exception to this was Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) which was common in both the vegetation and seed banks suggesting a high capacity for this species to re-establish following disturbances. Seedlings of dominant canopy species also reacted strongly to increased salinity treatments with decreased survivorship recorded. Overall, our findings suggest a high probability of constrained vegetation regeneration in this wetland in response to key projected climate change disturbances with implications for vegetation diversity at a landscape scale including declines in the extent and diversity of more landward vegetation communities and expansion of salt-tolerant marshes dominated by Sporobolus virginicus.

This paper represents the first study to determine the spatial and temporal trends of floating macro debris quantities and polymer composition within Maui County waters. Ocean surveys were conducted from 2013 to 2017 and collected 2095 debris items of which 90% were plastic. Attempts to categorize items by source resulted in only 6% likely from land, 12% from ocean-based sources, 50% from either land or ocean, and 32% from unknown sources. Results found a multi-step process for debris accumulation, with temporal trends linked to survey day and year and spatial trends linked to ocean processes. High- and low-density polyethylene and polypropylene accounted for the majority of polymer types. The results of this study demonstrate minimal debris in Maui originates from land/local sources, and the importance of baseline data to guide further research and mitigation measures.

Understanding how oils interact with feathers is an important step in mitigating this threat. Seabird feathers from 12 taxa, representing most seabird families from the tropics and southern latitudes, were exposed to crude and condensate oil films under laboratory settings. Feathers were measured for changes in mass proportional to feather size, and for barbule clumping. Seabird feathers from six distinct families exposed to very thin oil sheens (< 0.3 mu m) showed no significant change in proportional mass relative to control treatments, and 10 of the 12 species exposed to these films revealed no significant difference in barbule clumping. By contrast, exposure to both crude and condensate oil films >= 3 mu m resulted in significant increases in feather mass and clumping. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the influence of oil on feather structure when compiling threat assessments involving seabirds.

Conservation and restoration of a keystone species: Understanding the settlement preferences of the European oyster (Ostrea edulis)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Ostrea edulis; Oyster; Keystone species; Settlement; Conservation; Restoration	UCIDES-CORDATUS UCIDIDAE; LARVAL SETTLEMENT; PACIFIC OYSTER; CHEMICAL CUES; METAMORPHOSIS; BIOFILMS; INDUCTION; BACTERIA; HABITAT; OCEAN	The European oyster Ostrea edulis is a keystone species that is internationally recognised as 'threatened and declining' in the NE Atlantic by OSPAR and several nations have consequently adopted strategies for its conservation and restoration. Understanding the settlement behaviour of O. edulis larvae is crucial to inform these strategies. We compared the efficiency of several treatments in triggering settlement. The most effective settlement occurred with the presence of conspecifics: 100% settled in < 23 h. Marine stones with habitat-associated biofilms induced 81% settlement that started after a 45 h delay. Sterile shells and terrestrial stones did not induce more settlement than control treatments. These results indicate that O. edulis larvae are gregarious and finely-tuned to settle in response to cues which are indicative of their adult habitat requirements. The role of chemical cues in mediating settlement, and the importance of this to restoration, are discussed.

This work aimed to model coastal accumulation of microplastic particles (1-5 mm) emitted by the Po River over 1.5 years. We posit that river-induced microplastic accumulation on adjacent coasts can be predicted using (1) hydrodynamic-based and (2) remote sensing-based modelling. Model accumulation maps were validated against sampling at nine beaches, with sediment microplastic concentrations up to 78 particles/kg (dry weight). Hydrodynamic modelling revealed that discharged particle amount is only semi-coupled to beaching rates, which are strongly mouth dependent and occur within the first ten days. Remote sensing modelling was found to better capture river mouth relative strength, and accumulation patterns were found consistent with hydrodynamic modelling. This methodology lays groundwork for developing an operational monitoring system to assess microplastic pollution emitted by a major river.

The C/N ratio in sediments from Lake Lielais SvA"tiA dagger u, eastern Latvia, was compared with other sediment variables that are used as proxies of past climate and environment. Analysis revealed that although the organic matter (OM) content in late glacial sediments was extremely low, the C/N ratio captured information about OM origin, and fluctuations in the ratio tracked climate oscillations. The C/N ratio was significantly positively correlated with pollen-inferred mean summer temperature. Therefore, C/N ratio was lower under colder conditions, indicating a predominantly phytoplankton origin of OM, and was higher during warmer conditions, when there was more vegetation around the lake. A strong positive correlation between C/N ratio and the paleopigment beta carotene suggested that elevated phytoplankton production resulted from higher nutrient availability that was controlled largely by the input of terrestrial OM to the lake during warmer climate episodes. Thus, C/N ratio was a good indicator of paleoclimate changes, at least for the late glacial period, when generally cold conditions prevailed. This study also demonstrates the power of multi-proxy paleolimnological analyses for investigating past environmental changes in lakes and their watersheds.

Lac Lili (unofficial name) is located in the boreal forest of western Quebec, Canada, and was chosen for its shallowness (z(max) = 1.40 m) to assess if chironomid assemblages in the sediments could be used to reconstruct Holocene temperature fluctuations quantitatively. Inferred temperatures displayed a decreasing trend from a maximum value ca. 8000-3500 cal year BP, slight warming between ca. 3500 and 3000 cal year BP, followed by cooling to the present. Although chironomid assemblages were influenced by factors other than climate, primarily water depth and changes in macrophyte richness, the reconstructed Holocene temperature pattern was very similar to the known regional climate history. Temperature inferences derived from the chironomid assemblages were, however, warmer than the two reference periods. This deviation was likely a consequence of three factors: (1) shallowness of the lake, which favoured littoral taxa with warmer-than-today temperature optima, (2) the low number of lakes warmer than 16 A degrees C in the training set, and (3) the absence of shallow lakes in the training set.

This study examined the rapidity of the change in diatom assemblages over the period from 6.5 to 4.5 cal ka BP, in a core studied previously at a coarser resolution. This transition was characterized by high variability of assemblages, which could be related, in part, to changes in water conductivity, and potentially enhanced by a site-specific hydrological threshold or ecological salinity threshold. We hypothesize that the variations in diatom assemblages reflect climate fluctuations, which may have been an early warning signal of an impending climate regime shift.

The effect of agriculture on the seasonal dynamics and functional diversity of benthic biofilm in tropical headwater streams	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						bioenergy; Brazil; diatoms; periphyton; Sao Paulo; sugarcane; traits	LAND-USE; ECOLOGICAL GUILDS; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; METABOLISM; FRAMEWORK; BIODIVERSITY; RICHNESS; NUTRIENT; IMPACTS; INDEXES	Tropical streams are one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world due to the constant pressures from human activities. Among these activities, agriculture represents a land use that is crucial for human development but also a key driver of stream degradation and biodiversity decline in the tropics. Against this background, we investigated indirect effects of agriculture (alterations in stream flow and nutrient availability) and climate characteristics (water temperature) on benthic biofilm communities in tropical streams (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Three first-order streams draining catchments dominated by agricultural land use (sugarcane for bioenergy production, pasture) with some remaining riparian forest were studied for 1 year. We focused on the relationships of benthic biofilm biomass, algal biomass, diatom community, and functional structure with streamflow dynamics, nitrate concentrations, and water temperature. Our results indicate that these biological responses were mainly mediated by flow and water temperature and not by resource availability in the studied headwater streams. This result could be explained by the heavy rains and elevated runoff generation in these tropical catchments under agricultural influence, which might override the known effects of nutrient enrichment on benthic biofilm communities. Considering forecast climate and land-use changes in tropical streams, our findings may suggest potential shifts in benthic biofilm communities, with functional consequences for aquatic food webs in these environments.

This classification is compared with other systems based on plant morphology or traits relevant to vertebrate fruit dispersers. Our syndromes are based on fruits sampled from 1,192 plant species at three Forest Global Earth Observatory plots: Barro Colorado Island (Panama), Khao Chong (Thailand), and Wanang (Papua New Guinea). The three plots differed widely in fruit syndrome composition. Plant species with fleshy, indehiscent fruits containing multiple seeds were important at all three sites. However, in Panama, a high proportion of species had dry fruits, while in New Guinea and Thailand, species with fleshy drupes and thin mesocarps were dominant. Species with dry, winged seeds that do not develop as capsules were important in Thailand, reflecting the local importance of Dipterocarpaceae. These differences can also determine differences among frugivorous insect communities. Fruit syndromes and colors were phylogenetically flexible traits at the scale studied, as only three of the eight seed syndromes, and one of the 10 colors, showed significant phylogenetic clustering at either genus or family levels. Plant phylogeny was, however, the most important factor explaining differences in overall fruit syndrome composition among individual plant families or genera across the three study sites.

Vegetation connectivity increases ant activity and potential for ant-provided biocontrol services in a tropical agroforest	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						ant foraging; Azteca ants; biological control; coffee berry borer; foraging behavior; vegetation connectivity	COFFEE BERRY BORER; HYPOTHENEMUS-HAMPEI COLEOPTERA; RAIN-FOREST; HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; SPECIES RICHNESS; SHADE COFFEE; COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION; EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES; ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY	In natural and managed systems, connections between trees are important structural resources for arboreal ant communities with ecosystem-level effects. However, ongoing agricultural intensification in agroforestry systems, which reduces shade trees and connectivity between trees and crop plants, may hinder ant recruitment rates to resources and pest control services provided by ants. We examined whether increasing connectivity between coffee plants and shade trees in coffee plantations increases ant activity and enhances biological control of the coffee berry borer, the most devastating insect pest of coffee. Further, we examined whether artificial connections buffer against the loss of vegetation connectivity in coffee plants located at larger distances from the nesting tree. We used string to connect Inga micheliana shade trees containing Azteca sericeasur ant nests to coffee plants to compare ant activity before and after placement of the strings, and measured borer removal by ants on coffee plants with and without strings. Ant activity significantly increased after the addition of strings on connected plants, but not on control plants. Borer removal by ants was also three times higher on connected plants after string placement. Greater distance from the nesting tree negatively influenced ant activity on control coffee plants, but not on connected plants, suggesting that connections between coffee plants and nest trees could potentially compensate for the negative effects that larger distances pose on ant activity. Our study shows that favoring connectivity at the local scale, by artificially adding connections, promotes ant activity and may increase pest removal in agroecosystems.

Successional dynamics of the bee community in a tropical dry forest: Insights from taxonomy and functional ecology	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						bee guilds; eusociality; flower visitors; nesting habit; parasociality; secondary succession; solitary bees	SPECIES TRAITS; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; HYMENOPTERA APOIDEA; FORAGING RANGES; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; PLANT; DISTURBANCE; RESPONSES; PATTERNS	Despite the recent rapid growth of tropical dry forest succession ecology, most studies on this topic have focused on plant community attribute recovery, whereas animal community successional dynamics has been largely overlooked, and the few existing studies have used taxonomic approaches. Here, we analyze the successional changes in the bee community in a Mexican tropical dry forest, by integrating taxonomic (species, genus, and family diversity) and functional (sociability, nesting strategy, and body size) information for bees. Over one year, in a successional chronosequence (2-67 years after abandonment) we collected 469 individual bees, representing five families, 36 genera, and 69 species. Linear modeling showed decreases in taxonomic diversity with succession, more strongly so for species. Bee species turnover along succession ranged from moderate to high, decreasing slightly at intermediate stages. An RLQ analysis (ordination method that allows relating environmental variables with functional attributes) revealed clear relations between bee functional traits and the plant community. RLQ axis 1 was positively related to vegetation structural and diversity variables, and to eusociality, while solitary, parasociality, and ground nesting was negatively associated with it. Early successional fallows attract mostly solitary and parasocial bees; older fallows tend to attract eusocial bees with aerial nesting. The continuous taxonomic turnover observed by us and the functional analysis suggest that the disappearance of old fallows from agricultural landscapes would likely result in significant reductions and even local extinctions of particular bee guilds. Considering the low viability of preserving large mature tropical dry forest tracts, the conservation of older successional stands emerges as a crucial component of landscape management.

On Christmas Island, the invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) has detrimental impacts on many animals ranging from the iconic red crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis) to the Christmas Island Thrush (Turdus poliocephalus erythropleurus). However, the full extent of its effects on the island's fauna is not yet known. In this study, we investigated the impact of the yellow crazy ants on the island's last native mammal: the Christmas Island flying-fox (Pteropus natalis). This species has been described as a keystone species, but has recently experienced substantial population decline to the extent that it is now listed as Critically Endangered. We examined the impacts of the yellow crazy ants on the roosting behavior of the Christmas Island flying-fox, and on its local and island-wide distribution patterns. We showed that the crazy ants increased behaviors in the flying-foxes that were associated with avoidance of noxious stimuli and decreased behaviors associated with resting. Roost tree selection and roost site location were not related to variation in the abundance of crazy ants on the island. Our results indicate that the crazy ants interfere with the activity budgets of the flying-foxes. However, the flying-foxes failed to relocate to ant-free roost trees or roost sites when confronted with the noxious ant, suggesting that the flying-foxes are either not sufficiently disturbed to override strong cultural attachment to roosts, or, are behaving maladaptively due to ecological naivete.

Habitat amount hypothesis and passive sampling explain mammal species composition in Amazonian river islands	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						community assembly; habitat patch; island biogeography; matrix resistance; nestedness; non-equilibrium; riverscapes; sample area effect	NESTED SUBSET PATTERNS; VEGETATION; COMMUNITY; COLONIZATION; CONSERVATION; TURNOVER; BIOLOGY	Nested structures of species assemblages have been frequently associated with patch size and isolation, leading to the conclusion that colonization-extinction dynamics drives nestedness. The 'passive sampling' model states that the regional abundance of species randomly determines their occurrence in patches. The 'habitat amount hypothesis' also challenges patch size and isolation effects, arguing that they occur because of a 'sample area effect'. Here, we (a) ask whether the structure of the mammal assemblages of fluvial islands shows a nested pattern, (b) test whether species' regional abundance predicts species' occurrence on islands, and (c) ask whether habitat amount in the landscape and matrix resistance to biological flow predict the islands' species composition. We quantified nestedness and tested its significance using null models. We used a regression model to analyze whether a species' relative regional abundance predicts its incidence on islands. We accessed islands' species composition by an NMDS ordination and used multiple regression to evaluate how species composition responds to habitat amount and matrix resistance. The degree of nestedness did not differ from that expected by the passive sampling hypothesis. Likewise, species' regional abundance predicted its occurrence on islands. Habitat amount successfully predicted the species composition on islands, whereas matrix resistance did not. We suggest the application of habitat amount hypothesis for predicting species composition in other patchy systems. Although the island biogeography perspective has dominated the literature, we suggest that the passive sampling perspective is more appropriate for explaining the assemblages' structure in this and other non-equilibrium patch systems.

BMA is a popular method for combining the forecasts of individual simulation models by weighted averaging and characterizing the uncertainty induced by simulating the model structure. This method is referred to as the GEV-embedded BMA. It is, however, based on a point-wise analysis of extreme events, which means it overlooks the spatial dependency between nearby grid cells. Instead of a point-wise model, a spatial extreme model such as the max-stable process (MSP) is often employed to improve precision by considering spatial dependency. We propose an approach that integrates the MSP into BMA, which is referred to as the MSP-BMA herein. The superiority of the proposed method over the GEV-embedded BMA is demonstrated by using extreme rainfall intensity data on the Korean peninsula from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-models. The reanalysis data called Asian precipitation highly-resolved observational data integration towards evaluation, v1101 and 17 CMIP5 models are examined for 10 grid boxes in Korea. In this example, the MSP-BMA achieves a variance reduction over the GEV-embedded BMA. The bias inflation by MSP-BMA over the GEV-embedded BMA is also discussed. A by-product technical advantage of the MSP-BMA is that tedious regridding' is not required before and after the analysis while it should be done for the GEV-embedded BMA.

The proposed method has been inspired by the seminal study of Nadarajah et al. (J R Stat Soc B 60(2):473-496, 1998), who used a multivariate extreme value distribution (MEVD) to estimate (IDF) curves from rainfall records. Max-stable processes are continuous extensions of MEVD (i.e. the marginal distributions of rainfall maxima at different durations are generalized extreme valued), which are more flexible, allow for extreme rainfall estimation at any arbitrary duration d (i.e. not just a discrete set, as is the case of MEVD), while preserving asymptotic dependencies. The latter characteristic of IDF estimates results from the combined effect of the statistical structure of rainfall (i.e. temporal dependencies), as well as the IDF construction process, which involves averaging of the original series to obtain rainfall maxima at different temporal resolutions. We apply the method to hourly precipitation data, and compare it to empirical estimates and the results produced by a semiparametric approach. Our findings indicate that max-stable processes fit well the statistical structure and inter-dependencies of annual rainfall maxima at different durations, produce slightly more conservative estimates relative to semiparametric methods, while allowing for extrapolations to durations and return periods beyond the range of the available data. The proposed statistical model is fully parametric and likelihood based, providing a theoretically consistent basis in solving the problem at hand.

As studies that assess the environmental effect caused by pisciculture are scarce, the present study aimed at evaluating the water quality in two fish farms in the region of Grande Dourados, Brazil, from the site of water collection to the site of water disposal. The tools used for this purpose were the analysis of land use and cover and the determination of physical, chemical, and biological parameters of water samples. Maps of land use and cover were created, and water samples were collected at four sampling sites in two fish farms. The Allium cepa test, assays with Astyanax lacustris, and the Salmonella/microsome assay were performed. In addition, physical and chemical parameters were measured and metal and emerging contaminants in the water samples were investigated. The A. lacustris demonstrated the genotoxicity and the Salmonella/microsome assay suggested the mutagenic potential of water samples from the fish farms and indicated higher genotoxicity in the disposal tanks than in the collection tanks of the Brilhante fish farm. However, all the samples at the Dourados fish farm were genotoxic, and mutagenicity was shown to start at the water collection site. With regard to the A. cepa test, there was no statistical difference between the collection sites in both fish farms. Moreover, the observed genetic damage may be associated with the presence of metals and emerging contaminants in the water samples, which suggests that these chemicals have potential genotoxic and mutagenic effects that are related to the type of land use and cover in the area of the region studied. Considering that contaminated waters can potentially disturb the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems, the present study demonstrated the importance of treating fish farm effluent to minimize the negative effect of this activity on water bodies.

This enhances the risk for accidental oil spills throughout the Arctic, which emphasises the need to quantify potential consequences to the marine ecosystem and to evaluate risk and choose appropriate remediation methods. This study investigated the sensitivity of Arctic marine plankton to the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of heavy fuel oil. Arctic marine phytoplankton and copepods (Calanus finmarchicus) were exposed to three WAF concentrations corresponding to total hydrocarbon contents of 0.07mgl(-1), 0.28mgl(-1) and 0.55mgl(-1). Additionally, the potential phototoxic effects of exposing the WAF to sunlight, including the UV spectrum, were tested. The study determined sub-lethal effects of WAF exposure on rates of key ecosystem processes: primary production of phytoplankton and grazing (faecal pellet production) of copepods. Both phytoplankton and copepods responded negatively to WAF exposure. Biomass specific primary production was reduced by 6, 52 and 73% and faecal pellet production by 18, 51 and 86% with increasing WAF concentrations compared to controls. The phototoxic effect reduced primary production in the two highest WAF concentration treatments by 71 and 91%, respectively. This experiment contributes to the limited knowledge of acute sub-lethal effects of potential oil spills to the Arctic pelagic food web.

Traditional plant functional groups explain variation in economic but not size-related traits across the tundra biome	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						cluster analysis; community composition; ecosystem function; plant functional groups; plant functional types; plant traits; tundra biome; vegetation change	LITTER DECOMPOSITION RATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARCTIC TUNDRA; LEAF TRAITS; RESPONSES; VEGETATION; CARBON; TERM; NUTRIENT; ECOLOGY	Aim Plant functional groups are widely used in community ecology and earth system modelling to describe trait variation within and across plant communities. However, this approach rests on the assumption that functional groups explain a large proportion of trait variation among species. We test whether four commonly used plant functional groups represent variation in six ecologically important plant traits. Location Tundra biome. Time period Data collected between 1964 and 2016. Major taxa studied 295 tundra vascular plant species. Methods We compiled a database of six plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen, seed mass) for tundra species. We examined the variation in species-level trait expression explained by four traditional functional groups (evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, graminoids, forbs), and whether variation explained was dependent upon the traits included in analysis. We further compared the explanatory power and species composition of functional groups to alternative classifications generated using post hoc clustering of species-level traits. Results Traditional functional groups explained significant differences in trait expression, particularly amongst traits associated with resource economics, which were consistent across sites and at the biome scale. However, functional groups explained 19% of overall trait variation and poorly represented differences in traits associated with plant size. Post hoc classification of species did not correspond well with traditional functional groups, and explained twice as much variation in species-level trait expression. Main conclusions Traditional functional groups only coarsely represent variation in well-measured traits within tundra plant communities, and better explain resource economic traits than size-related traits. We recommend caution when using functional group approaches to predict tundra vegetation change, or ecosystem functions relating to plant size, such as albedo or carbon storage. We argue that alternative classifications or direct use of specific plant traits could provide new insights for ecological prediction and modelling.	[Thomas, H. J. D.; Myers-Smith, I.

However, the direction of thermal stress may differ between climatic regions. We predicted that morphological response to temperature fluctuations should vary throughout species ranges, depending on the local climate. Hot temperature anomalies are expected to induce size reduction in hot regions where species live close to their upper thermal limit, whereas size stasis (or increase) would be expected in cold regions, where species live close to their lower thermal limit. Location France (204 sites). Time period 2000-2014 springs. Major taxa studied Songbird species (n = 9). Methods We tested whether the effect of temperature anomalies on juvenile body size varied along an 11 degrees C thermal gradient. Results In warmer springs, juveniles were larger overall at the coldest sites, but this effect decreased toward the hottest sites, becoming negative for two species. Main conclusions Warming should induce body size increases more frequently at the cold edge of species distribution ranges, and rather body size declines at the hot edg. The climate dependency of the effect of weather fluctuations on body size is still under-acknowledged, and the pattern identified deserves to be investigated over broader climatic gradients and taxonomic coverage. Climate-driven changes in body size are therefore not uniform across climatic regions and within species ranges.

Trophic interactions across 61 degrees of latitude in the Western Atlantic	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biotic interactions; fish-benthos interaction; herbivory; latitudinal gradient; marine biogeography; reef fish	MARINE HERBIVOROUS FISHES; DEFENDED PALATABILITY; PATTERNS; GRADIENTS; PLANTS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; PREDATION; STRONGER	Aim The aim was to evaluate the hypothesis that biotic interactions are more intense in the tropics using reef fishes (from both functional and taxonomic perspectives), the crucial consumers on most reefs. Location Fifteen reef locations between 34 degrees N and 27 degrees S in the Western Atlantic. Time period 2011-2014. Major taxa studied Reef fishes. Methods We quantified fish feeding pressure on the benthos across 61 degrees of latitude in the Western Atlantic via 1,038 10 min videos of 2 m(2) reef areas, where every fish feeding on the benthos was identified, had its total length estimated, and the number of bites on the reef substratum was counted. Fish were assigned to functional groups based on diet and feeding modes. Benthic cover estimates were also obtained through visual assessments from the videos. Results We documented feeding rates that were 2- to 22-fold higher in tropical versus extratropical locations. This pattern was driven mainly by an interaction between fish functional group and temperature, with herbivory dominating in tropical regions (c. 20-fold higher), shifting to omnivory in temperate regions of both Hemispheres. Feeding by invertivores was common across all latitudes. Consumer species composition differed between Northern and Southern Hemispheres, but functional groups were similar, and their feeding changed in a similar manner with temperature regardless of Hemisphere. Main conclusions Our results support the hypothesis that biotic interactions, especially plant-herbivore interactions, are more intense in the tropics. These findings help to explain the lower palatability of tropical versus extratropical seaweeds and suggest that herbivory is favoured in warm conditions but omnivory in colder waters. The functional approach indicated that factors associated with latitude or temperature have selected for similar feeding functions among the different species occupying these geographical regions. Understanding the shifting trophic interactions across latitudes might help to predict the impacts of global changes on ecosystem function as tropical species move polewards and contact temperate systems.

However, there is little understanding of which hypotheses associated with these geological and climatic processes garner strong support as explanations for the observed diversity patterns. Here, we test support for hypotheses related to uplift and climate changes that could account for the high endemicity and phylogenetic diversity of the world's highest plateau. Location Tibetan Plateau (TP). Time period Neogene, Quaternary and current period. Major taxa studied Tibetan endemic seed plants. Methods We collated data on endemic seed-plant distribution based on county-level mapping from published monographs and online databases. We calculated species richness (SR) and phylogenetic diversity for endemic herbs, shrubs, trees, and all plants for 0.5-degree x 0.5-degree grid cells covering the TP. We derived environmental and evolutionary predictors to evaluate eight biogeographical hypotheses associated with plateau uplift and climate fluctuations, and used partial regression analysis and mixed conditional autoregressive (CAR) models to assess the relative contribution of each predictor to the extant diversity of the TP. Results We found plateau uplift independently explained more variance in diversity than climate fluctuations, but there were also strong interaction effects. The full CAR models including all predictors explained 37%-75% of the total variation across diversity measures and life forms. The predictor representing the montane museum hypothesis explained the most variation (c. 25%), but each predictor explained at least 6%. Main conclusions These results demonstrate that both the plateau uplift and Quaternary climate fluctuations had large impacts on current patterns of species diversity, but the influence of plateau uplift was more pronounced than that of climate changes. Our study suggests that plateau uplift and climate changes are the original drivers of complex biogeographical processes accounting for the biodiversity of the TP.

Location Continental areas worldwide and zoogeographical realms. Methods Using species distribution maps for mammals and amphibians, we calculated five metrics of species endemism, based on inverse and median range size, and range size cut-offs. We performed multi-model averaging. We tested the accuracy of fitted models using cross-validation, comparing observed versus predicted values of endemism among zoogeographical realms. Results Model averaging showed that species endemism for amphibians and mammals was statistically related to all set of predictors (H1, H2, H4 and richness), except for climate distinctiveness (H3). Effect sizes for spatial heterogeneity were larger and more consistent among zoogeographical realms than the effect sizes of climate stability. The effect of species richness on species endemism varies widely and depends on the metric of endemism and taxonomic group used in the analysis. Cross-validation across all zoogeographical realms showed that predictions of endemism systematically fail for both taxa. In most cases, low to moderate endemism is predicted reasonably well. However, areas with high numbers of endemic species are systematically under-predicted. Main conclusions Our results are not consistent with any of the processes hypothesized to create and maintain global patterns of endemism. Although we found statistically significant relationships, they failed the stronger test of a causal relationship: accurate prediction in independent data. The inconsistent effect of richness in our models suggests that patterns of endemism are not driven by the same variables as total richness. Patterns of endemism have no consistent relationships with climatic stability among zoogeographical realms, so suggestions that endemism reflect climatic stability are likely due to collinearity with other factors, especially spatial heterogeneity.

Beyond the Last Glacial Maximum: Island endemism is best explained by long-lasting archipelago configurations	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						archipelago configuration; biotic interchange; endemism; flowering plants; glacial-interglacial cycles; land snails; late Quaternary; past environmental change; sea-level oscillations; volcanic oceanic islands	SEA-LEVEL; MULTIMODEL INFERENCE; BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY; MODEL SELECTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIATION; DIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; AREA	Aim To quantify the influence of past archipelago configuration on present-day insular biodiversity patterns, and to compare the role of long-lasting archipelago configurations over the Pleistocene to configurations of short duration such as at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present-day. Location 53 volcanic oceanic islands from 12 archipelagos worldwide-Azores, Canary Islands, Cook Islands, Galapagos, Gulf of Guinea, Hawaii, Madeira, Mascarenes, Pitcairn, Revillagigedo, Samoan Islands and Tristan da Cunha. Time period The last 800 kyr, representing the nine most recent glacial-interglacial cycles. Major taxa studied Land snails and angiosperms. Methods Species richness data for land snails and angiosperms were compiled from existing literature and species checklists. We reconstructed archipelago configurations at the following sea levels: the present-day high interglacial sea level, the intermediate sea levels that are representative of the Pleistocene and the low sea levels of the LGM. We fitted two alternative linear mixed models for each archipelago configuration using the number of single-island endemic, multiple-island endemic and (non-endemic) native species as a response. Model performance was assessed based on the goodness-of-fit of the full model, the variance explained by archipelago configuration and model parsimony. Results Single-island endemic richness in both taxonomic groups was best explained by intermediate palaeo-configuration (positively by area change, and negatively by palaeo-connectedness), whereas non-endemic native species richness was poorly explained by palaeo-configuration. Single-island endemic richness was better explained by intermediate archipelago configurations than by the archipelago configurations of the LGM or present-day. Main conclusions Archipelago configurations at intermediate sea levels-which are representative of the Pleistocene-have left a stronger imprint on single-island endemic richness patterns on volcanic oceanic islands than extreme archipelago configurations that persisted for only a few thousand years (such as the LGM). In understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics of insular biota it is essential to consider longer-lasting environmental conditions, rather than extreme situations alone.

We tested to which extent the distributions of morphological traits are supported by extreme morphologies and how those extreme morphologies are distributed among realms and affect the functional vulnerability. We also analysed the contribution of between- and within-order morphological variability to the morphological differences between realms. Major taxa studied Freshwater fish. Location Global. Time period 1960s-2010s. Methods We used a global database of freshwater fishes from the six realms. Ten morphological traits were measured on 9,150 species, that is, 75% of the ca. 13,000 freshwater fish species. A principal components analysis was conducted to combine the 10 traits into a multidimensional space. We used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare the difference in morphological diversity between the six realms and between and within the major fish orders. We then identified the morphologically extreme species and quantified their contributions to the morphological range to assess the functional vulnerability and redundancy of fish faunas in the six biogeographical realms for freshwater ecosystems. Results We report a strong morphological variability among freshwater fishes of the world, with significant morphological differences among realm fish faunas, caused by an interplay between taxonomic composition of the realm faunas and morphological differences within orders among the realms. Morphologically extreme species accounted for a large percentage of the filling of the global morphological space and are distributed throughout the world. Main conclusions Fish morphological diversity is largely supported by a few species with extreme trait combinations, indicating that functional vulnerability exists throughout the world. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to these morphologically extreme species and that they should be protected to ensure the sustainability of functions they support.

Biotic resistance or introduction bias? Immigrant plant performance decreases with residence times over millennia	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						alien-native species continuum; Asteraceae; biotic resistance; competitive ability; introduction bias; long-term dynamics; multi-species experiment; plant invasion; range size; residence time	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; RAPID EVOLUTION; POTENTIAL RANGE; ENEMY RELEASE; ALIEN PLANTS; DYNAMICS; TRAITS; METAANALYSIS; COMMUNITIES; COMPETITORS	Aim Invasions are dynamic processes. Invasive spread causes the geographical range size of alien species to increase with residence time. However, with time native competitors and antagonists can adapt to invaders. This build-up of biotic resistance may eventually limit the invader's performance and reduce its range size. Using a species-for-time approach, we test (a) whether native communities more strongly reduce the fitness of immigrants with longer residence times, and (b) whether the range size of immigrant species shows a unimodal response to residence time. Location Germany. Time period 18,000 years BP to present. Major taxa studied 352 plant species in the Asteraceae family. Methods For plant species with a wide range of minimum residence times in Germany (6-18,000 years), we combined a common garden experiment with historical and macroecological analyses. In a multi-species experiment, we quantified the effect of native communities on fitness components of 30 annual Asteraceae. For these and other species, we then analysed how current range size depends on minimum residence time and other covariates. Results Native communities reduced survival, reproductive output and fitness of Asteraceae. This fitness reduction was stronger for immigrant species with long residence times. We found a unimodal relationship between range size and residence time of Asteraceae in Germany, when including natives that immigrated after the last glaciation. Main conclusions Biotic resistance may limit the performance and geographical ranges of immigrant species over long time-scales. The initial advantages invaders have over natives thus may not persist over millennia, supporting the concept of an alien-native species continuum defined by gradual changes in eco-evolutionary processes. While our analysis controlled for major ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical factors, it is conceivable that the detected patterns are influenced by additional differences between natives and aliens. Experimental macroecology has great potential to disentangle these processes and predict long-term invasion dynamics.

Neotropical ecosystems have higher diversity and a different composition of frugivores and fleshy-fruited plants compared with Afrotropical systems, but a lack of intercontinental comparisons limits understanding of (a) whether plant-frugivore networks are structured in a similar manner, and (b) whether the same species traits define the roles of animals across continents. Location Afrotropics and Neotropics. Time period 1977-2015. Taxa Fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous vertebrates. Methods We compiled a dataset comprising 17 Afrotropical and 48 Neotropical weighted seed-dispersal networks quantifying frugivory interactions between 1,091 fleshy-fruited plant and 665 animal species, comprising in total 8,251 interaction links between plants and animals. In addition, we compiled information on the body mass of animals and their degree of frugivory. We compared four standard network-level metrics related to interaction diversity and specialization, accounting for differences related to sampling effort and network location. Furthermore, we tested whether animal traits (body mass, degree of frugivory) differed between continents, whether these traits were related to the network roles of species and whether these relationships varied between continents. Results We found significant structural differences in networks between continents. Overall, Neotropical networks were less nested and more specialized than Afrotropical networks. At the species level, a higher body mass and degree of frugivory were associated with an increasing diversity of plant partners. Specialization of frugivores increased with the degree of frugivory, but only in the Neotropics. Main conclusions Our findings show that Afrotropical networks have a greater overlap in plant partners among vertebrate frugivores than the more diverse networks in the Neotropics that are characterized by a greater niche partitioning. Hence, the loss of frugivore species could have stronger impacts on ecosystem functioning in the more specialized Neotropical communities compared with the more generalized Afrotropical communities.

Challenging the European southern refugium hypothesis: Species-specific structures versus general patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among small mammals	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						colonization; Europe; mammals; molecular diversity; mtDNA; phylogeography; refugia	MITOCHONDRIAL CONTROL REGION; COMMON VOLE; BANK VOLE; CLETHRIONOMYS-GLAREOLUS; CRICETUS-CRICETUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POSTGLACIAL COLONIZATION; BIOGEOGRAPHIC HISTORY; NUCLEOTIDE DIVERSITY; EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY	Aim In this study, we conduct a quantitative meta-analysis to investigate broad patterns of genetic variation throughout large geographical regions in order to elucidate concordant geographical patterns across species and identify common historical processes to better inform the "cryptic refugia" versus the traditional "southern refugia" hypothesis debate. Location Europe. Time period Late Pleistocene to present day. Major taxa studied Small mammals (Rodentia, Eulipotyphla). Methods A meta-analysis was performed on large-scale patterns of genetic diversity for 19 species from 59 papers. For each species, haplotype and nucleotide diversity were calculated using the mitochondrial D-loop and compared to the species' range. Results No consistent patterns were observed between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity indices (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) and any of the indicators of distribution examined [latitude and longitude (max, min, centre, range)]. The patterns of genetic diversity observed in all the 19 species studied appear to be species-specific. Main conclusions In contrast to the traditional southern refugial hypotheses, we found no evidence for a consistent south-north post-glacial expansion. Instead individual species appear to respond to climate oscillations in niche-specific ways. This individual nature of each species' phylogeographical history indicates a complex web of post-glacial recolonization dynamics across Europe.

Phylogenetically weighted regression: A method for modelling non-stationarity on evolutionary trees	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						flowering time; geographically weighted regression; latent variables; non-stationarity; phylogenetic comparative methods; phylogenetically weighted regression; trait correlations	WITHIN-SPECIES VARIATION; STABILIZING SELECTION; TRAIT EVOLUTION; CLIMATE; PHYLOGENIES; EXAMPLE; ERROR; SIZE	Aim Closely related species tend to resemble each other in their morphology and ecology because of shared ancestry. When exploring correlations between species traits, therefore, species cannot be treated as statistically independent. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) attempt to correct statistically for this shared evolutionary history. Almost all such approaches, however, assume that correlations between traits are constant across the tips of the tree, which we refer to as phylogenetic stationarity. We suggest that this assumption of phylogenetic stationarity might be often violated and that relationships between species traits might evolve alongside clades, for example, owing to the effects of unmeasured traits or other latent variables. Specific examples range from shifts in allometric scaling relationships between clades (e.g., basal metabolic rate and body mass in endotherms, and tree diameter and biomass in trees) to the differing relationship between leaf mass per area and shade tolerance in deciduous versus evergreen trees and shrubs. Innovation Here, we introduce an exploratory modelling framework, phylogenetically weighted regression, which represents an extension of geographically weighted regression (GWR) used in spatial studies, to allow non-stationarity in model parameters across a phylogenetic tree. We demonstrate our approach using empirical data on flowering time and seed mass from a well-studied plant community in southeastern Sweden. Our model reveals strong, diverging trends across the phylogeny, including changes in the sign of the relationship between clades. Main conclusions By allowing for phylogenetic non-stationarity, we are able to detect shifting relationships among species traits that would be obscured in traditional PCMs; thus, we suggest that PWR might be an important exploratory tool in the search for key missing variables in comparative analyses.

Previous research in Scandinavia has documented that brown bears (Ursus arctos) show a variety of behavioral reactions to different human activities. We investigated how proximity to human settlements and roads, as proxies of human influence, affected brown bears' reactions to encountering humans. We analyzed experimental approaches to GPS collared bears, 18 males and 23 single females, in Sweden (n = 148 approaches) and Finland (n = 33), conducted between 2004 and 2012. The bears in Finland inhabited areas with higher human density compared to Sweden. However, the proportion of bears staying or moving when approached and the flight initiation distances were similar in both countries. In Sweden, the flight responses were not dependent on human densities or roads inside the bears' home ranges or the distances from the bears to roads and settlements. Brown bears in Fennoscandia live in areas with relatively low human population densities, but in many areas with high forestry road densities. Our results show that bears' flight reactions were consistent between areas, which is an important message for management, reinforcing previous studies that have documented human avoidance by bears at different spatial and temporal scales.

However, biodiversity measurements often remain incomplete due to the limited efficiency of sampling methods. This is particularly true in freshwater tropical environments that host rich fish assemblages, for which assessments are uncertain and often rely on destructive methods. Developing an efficient and nondestructive method to assess biodiversity in tropical freshwaters is highly important. In this study, we tested the efficiency of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess the fish diversity of 39 Guianese sites. We compared the diversity and composition of assemblages obtained using traditional and metabarcoding methods. More than 7,000 individual fish belonging to 203 Guianese fish species were collected by traditional sampling methods, and similar to 17 million reads were produced by metabarcoding, among which similar to 8 million reads were assigned to 148 fish taxonomic units, including 132 fish species. The two methods detected a similar number of species at each site, but the species identities partially matched. The assemblage compositions from the different drainage basins were better discriminated using metabarcoding, revealing that while traditional methods provide a more complete but spatially limited inventory of fish assemblages, metabarcoding provides a more partial but spatially extensive inventory. eDNA metabarcoding can therefore be used for rapid and large-scale biodiversity assessments, while at a local scale, the two approaches are complementary and enable an understanding of realistic fish biodiversity.

Using metabarcoding to compare the suitability of two blood-feeding leech species for sampling mammalian diversity in North Borneo	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						biodiversity; Borneo; Haemadipsidae; invertebrate-derived DNA; mammals; metabarcoding	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; IDENTIFICATION; FOREST; TOOL; EXTRAPOLATION; RAREFACTION; IDNA	The application of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for metabarcoding of mixed samples offers new opportunities in conservation biology. Recently, the successful detection of prey DNA from the guts of leeches has raised the possibility that these, and other blood-feeding invertebrates, might serve as useful samplers of mammals. Yet little is known about whether sympatric leech species differ in their feeding preferences, and whether this has a bearing on their relative suitability for monitoring local mammalian diversity. To address these questions, we collected spatially matched samples of two congeneric leech species Haemadipsa picta and Haemadipsa sumatrana from lowland rainforest in Borneo. For each species, we pooled similar to 500 leeches into batches of 10 individuals, performed PCR to target a section of the mammalian 16S rRNA locus and undertook sequencing of amplicon libraries using an Illumina MiSeq. In total, we identified sequences from 14 mammalian genera, spanning nine families and five orders. We found greater numbers of detections, and higher diversity of OTUs, in H. picta compared with H. sumatrana, with rodents only present in the former leech species. However, comparison of samples from across the landscape revealed no significant difference in mammal community composition between the leech species. We therefore suggest that H. picta is the more suitable iDNA sampler in this degraded Bornean forest. We conclude that the choice of invertebrate sampler can influence the detectability of different mammal groups and that this should be accounted for when designing iDNA studies.

Using noninvasive metagenomics to characterize viral communities from wildlife	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						Desmodus rotundus; microbial community; shotgun metagenomics; virome	GUT MICROBIOME; TRANSPORT MEDIA; VIRUSES; DIVERSITY; VIROME; PATHOGENS; HOST; IDENTIFICATION; ECOLOGY; TOOLS	Microbial communities play an important role in organismal and ecosystem health. While high-throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.

For instance, SODMs are increasingly used to analyse environmental DNA (eDNA) data, taking into account the occurrence of both false-positive and false-negative errors. However, species occurrence data are often characterized by spatial and temporal autocorrelation, which might challenge the use of standard SODMs. Here we reviewed the literature of eDNA biodiversity surveys and found that most of studies do not take into account spatial or temporal autocorrelation. We then demonstrated how the analysis of data with spatial or temporal autocorrelation can be improved by using a conditionally autoregressive SODM, and show its application to environmental DNA data. We tested the autoregressive model on both simulated and real data sets, including chronosequences with different degrees of autocorrelation, and a spatial data set on a virtual landscape. Analyses of simulated data showed that autoregressive SODMs perform better than traditional SODMs in the estimation of key parameters such as true-/false-positive rates and show a better discrimination capacity (e.g., higher true skill statistics). The usefulness of autoregressive SODMs was particularly high in data sets with strong autocorrelation. When applied to real eDNA data sets (eDNA from lake sediment cores and freshwater), autoregressive SODM provided more precise estimation of true-/false-positive rates, resulting in more reasonable inference of occupancy states. Our results suggest that analyses of occurrence data, such as many applications of eDNA, can be largely improved by applying conditionally autoregressive specifications to SODMs.	[Chen, Wentao; Ficetola, Gentile Francesco] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France; [Ficetola, Gentile Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Milan, Italy	Chen, WT (reprint author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Lab Ecol Alpine LECA, Grenoble, France.	wentao.chen.ecol@gmail.com	Ficetola, Gentile Francesco/A-2813-2008	Ficetola, Gentile Francesco/0000-0003-3414-5155	Labex OSUG@ 2020 [ANR10 LABX56]; Horizon 2020 Programme [772284]	Labex OSUG@ 2020, Grant/Award Number: ANR10 LABX56; Horizon 2020 Programme, Grant/Award Number: 772284		54	1	1	7	10	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1755-098X	1755-0998		MOL ECOL RESOUR	Mol.

An improved method for utilizing high-throughput amplicon sequencing to determine the diets of insectivorous animals	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						AMPtk; arthropod mock community; bat guano; dietary analysis; insectivore; next-generation sequencing	INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER; RDNA REGION; DNA; BATS; PRIMERS; INSECTS; FUNGAL; PREY; SELECTION; BARCODE	DNA analysis of predator faeces using high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTS) enhances our understanding of predator-prey interactions. However, conclusions drawn from this technique are constrained by biases that occur in multiple steps of the HTS workflow. To better characterize insectivorous animal diets, we used DNA from a diverse set of arthropods to assess PCR biases of commonly used and novel primer pairs for the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome oxidase C subunit 1 (COI). We compared diversity recovered from HTS of bat guano samples using a commonly used primer pair "ZBJ" to results using the novel primer pair "ANML." To parameterize our bioinformatics pipeline, we created an arthropod mock community consisting of single-copy (cloned) COI sequences. To examine biases associated with both PCR and HTS, mock community members were combined in equimolar amounts both pre- and post-PCR. We validated our system using guano from bats fed known diets and using composite samples of morphologically identified insects collected in pitfall traps. In PCR tests, the ANML primer pair amplified 58 of 59 arthropod taxa (98%), whereas ZBJ amplified 24-40 of 59 taxa (41%-68%). Furthermore, in an HTS comparison of field-collected samples, the ANML primers detected nearly fourfold more arthropod taxa than the ZBJ primers. The additional arthropods detected include medically and economically relevant insect groups such as mosquitoes. Results revealed biases at both the PCR and sequencing levels, demonstrating the pitfalls associated with using HTS read numbers as proxies for abundance. The use of an arthropod mock community allowed for improved bioinformatics pipeline parameterization.

Most studies have so far focused on the exome using short-read technology. These approaches are not designed to capture intergenic regions needed to reconstruct genomic organization, including regulatory regions and gene synteny. Here, we demonstrate the power of combining targeted sequence capture with long-read sequencing technology for comparative genomic analyses of the haemoglobin (Hb) gene clusters across eight species separated by up to 70 million years. Guided by the reference genome assembly of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) together with genome information from draft assemblies of selected codfishes, we designed probes covering the two Hb gene clusters. Use of custom-made barcodes combined with PacBio RSII sequencing led to highly continuous assemblies of the LA (similar to 100 kb) and MN (similar to 200 kb) clusters, which include syntenic regions of coding and intergenic sequences. Our results revealed an overall conserved genomic organization of the Hb genes within this lineage, yet with several, lineage-specific gene duplications. Moreover, for some of the species examined, we identified amino acid substitutions at two sites in the Hbb1 gene as well as length polymorphisms in its regulatory region, which has previously been linked to temperature adaptation in Atlantic cod populations. This study highlights the use of targeted long-read capture as a versatile approach for comparative genomic studies by generation of a cross-species genomic resource elucidating the evolutionary history of the Hb gene family across the highly divergent group of codfishes.

Model selection with overdispersed distance sampling data	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						animal abundance; camera trapping; cue counting; distance sampling; model selection; overdispersion; QAIC	TRANSECT SURVEYS; SPATIAL MODELS; INFERENCE	Distance sampling (DS) is a widely used framework for estimating animal abundance. DS models assume that observations of distances to animals are independent. Non-independent observations introduce overdispersion, causing model selection criteria such as AIC or AIC(c) to favour overly complex models, with adverse effects on accuracy and precision. We describe, and evaluate via simulation and with real data, estimators of an overdispersion factor (c), and associated adjusted model selection criteria (QAIC) for use with overdispersed DS data. In other contexts, a single value of c<^> is calculated from the "global" model, that is the most highly parameterised model in the candidate set, and used to calculate QAIC for all models in the set; the resulting QAIC values, and associated Delta QAIC values and QAIC weights, are comparable across the entire set. Candidate models of the DS detection function include models with different general forms (e.g. half-normal, hazard rate, uniform), so it may not be possible to identify a single global model. We therefore propose a two-step model selection procedure by which QAIC is used to select among models with the same general form, and then a goodness-of-fit statistic is used to select among models with different forms. A drawback of this approach is that QAIC values are not comparable across all models in the candidate set. Relative to AIC, QAIC and the two-step model selection procedure avoided overfitting and improved the accuracy and precision of densities estimated from simulated data. When applied to six real datasets, adjusted criteria and procedures selected either the same model as AIC or a model that yielded a more accurate density estimate in five cases, and a model that yielded a less accurate estimate in one case. Many DS surveys yield overdispersed data, including cue counting surveys of songbirds and cetaceans, surveys of social species including primates, and camera-trapping surveys. Methods that adjust for overdispersion during the model selection stage of DS analyses therefore address a conspicuous gap in the DS analytical framework as applied to species of conservation concern.

Carrying a logger reduces escape flight speed in a passerine bird, but relative logger mass may be a misleading measure of this flight performance detriment	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						bird flight; Eurasian blackcap; experiment; geolocator; predation; Sylvia atricapilla	TAKE-OFF; METAANALYSIS; GEOLOCATORS; MODELS	The recent boost in bird migration studies following the development of various tracking devices raised awareness of how detrimental attaching devices can be for animals. Such effects can occur during migration, but also immediately post-release if the device impairs escape flight performance and, consequently, the bird's ability to evade predators. In this study, we investigated the effect of carrying a device on the escape flight speed and aerodynamic force production in a migratory passerine. We recorded upward-directed escape flights of 15 male blackcaps. Each individual was tested without a tag, and when equipped with three different leg-loop dummy tags with masses representing around 3%, 5%, and 7% of their body mass. The experiment was designed such that all individuals passed through all treatments in a randomized order. We found that two factors affected flight speed in roughly equal amounts: first, tagged escape flights had lower flight speeds compared to the control flights, irrespective of tag mass. Second, we found an effect of the total mass, that is, the sum of the masses of the individual bird and of the tag, with heavier birds being slower. In contrast, flight speed was not correlated with relative tag mass in percentage of body mass, the metric commonly used in ethical guidelines for tag attachment. Aerodynamic flight force production also depended on total mass, with heavier birds producing higher forces. But these flight forces did not differ between flights with or without a tag. We conclude that, when tagging birds, it is misleading to choose heavy individuals for tagging in order to minimize the tag mass as a percentage of body mass. This is particularly relevant in species for which body mass is not necessarily related to size, like migratory birds that accumulate large fat reserves. The lower escape speed in "tagged" flights could not be explained by differences in net flight force production, because these did not differ between flights with and without a tag. This suggests that the tag also affected pre-flight take-off dynamics, possibly due to a leg harness-induced reduction in leg push-off performance.

This requires the communication of the details of a mathematical model, including the use of mathematical notation to represent ecological variables, parameters and processes. In our experience, the clarity of mathematical notation varies between papers and can often be inconsistent with general conventions. Poor notation can impede communication and understanding of ideas, and make models appear more complicated than necessary. Here, we present some guidelines, including: (a) define every term in an equation, (b) use fonts appropriately (italicise mathematical symbols, use bold lower case for vectors and bold upper case for matrices), (c) use subscripts appropriately (to index quantities, for example, by year), (d) use superscripts appropriately (to indicate a power, the transpose of a matrix or the steady-state value of a quantity), (e) avoid multiletter variable names, and (f) revisit notation early on in a project to see if it should be refined. Although we focus mainly on ecology, our guidelines should be of interest to researchers applying models in evolutionary biology and broader areas of biology.

We apply a likelihood-based framework to estimate the number of contributors to a DNA mixture for ecological applications. We then assess the performance of DNA mixture estimation through a combination of simulation analyses, laboratory testing, and a field trial to estimate fish predation rates from stomach content analysis. Simulations indicated reasonably sized genetic marker panels could estimate the number of contributors to mixtures comprised of up to 10 individuals, with potential to resolve larger mixtures with additional markers. Mixture estimates demonstrated robustness to common genotyping errors associated with fish and wildlife genetics applications. Laboratory trials demonstrated that DNA combined from multiple yellow perch (Perca flavescens) could be successfully genotyped with a 14-loci microsatellite panel and led to successful estimation for up to 5-contributor mixtures. Stomach content analysis with DNA mixtures indicated a 5-fold increase in estimated predation rates of yellow perch by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) relative to conventional visual assessment of diet contents which can miss partially digested prey items. DNA mixtures have potential to expand applications of count-based ecological analyses. Technical challenges in generating genotypes from DNA mixtures may initially limit their use, however, advances in next generation genotyping platforms are anticipated to surmount these obstacles. Chiefly, we envision opportunity for DNA mixtures to advance eDNA analysis beyond presence/absence based inference to enumeration of specimens.

Impacts of DNA extraction and PCR on DNA metabarcoding estimates of soil biodiversity	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						DNA extraction; eukaryotes; metabarcoding; metazoans; PCR replicates; prokaryotes; soil biodiversity	MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; EXTRACELLULAR DNA; SAMPLE-SIZE; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; PATTERNS; FUNGAL; REVEAL; BIAS	Soils are ubiquitous and important components of terrestrial ecosystems, richly populated with diverse organisms with important ecological roles. DNA metabarcoding is a promising tool for efficient and taxonomically comprehensive analyses of soil biodiversity, but the outcomes of these analyses are likely affected by basic methodological factors such as sampling and laboratory protocols. We investigated the impacts of DNA extraction methodology and multiple PCRs on DNA metabarcoding biodiversity estimates for multiple taxonomic groups in soil. We applied four DNA extraction methods with different size constraints in parallel to fixed volumes of soil from a pair of forest sites, followed by sets of ten individually indexed PCRs and Illumina sequencing of prokaryote (16S) and eukaryote (18S, fungal 26S, and metazoan cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) barcodes. Methods utilizing larger soil volumes resulted in higher biodiversity estimates for arthropods but not for prokaryotes or microeukaryotes, and improved spatial discrimination of metazoan communities but not prokaryotes. Each DNA extraction method resulted in a biased community composition, and these biases were consistent across sites and amplicons. Some 36%-41% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared between all four DNA extraction methods and OTUs from many phyla had contrasting abundances from different methods. From 0.2% to 19% of OTUs, accounting for 9.4% to 97% of sequence reads, were amplified in all 10 PCRs from each DNA extraction method and sample. OTUs detected in only a single PCR accounted for 26% to 41% of OTUs but only 0.3% to 2.8% of the sequence reads from each extraction method and sample. The inferred species richness increased strongly with the number of PCRs carried out. We conclude that a consistent DNA extraction method should be used for comparisons between samples, confirm that larger samples of soil (>= 15 g) should be used for analyses of metazoan biodiversity than for microbes, and that the number of PCR replicates undertaken strongly affects species richness estimates.

The species is nocturnal, crepuscular, and elusive, making direct observation of habitat use and behavior difficult. However, musk deer establish and repeatedly use the same latrines for defecation. To quantify musk deer habitat correlates, we used observational spatial data based on presence-absence of musk deer latrines, as well as a range of fine spatial-scale ecological covariates. To determine presence-absence of musk deer, we exhaustively searched randomly selected forest trails using a 20-m belt transect in different study sites within the Neshyang Valley in the Annapurna Conservation Area. In a subsequent way, study sites were classified as habitat or nonhabitat for musk deer. A total of 252 plots, 20 x 20 m, were systematically established every 100 m along 51 transects (each similar to 0.5 km long) laid out at different elevations to record a range of ecological habitat variables. We used mixed-effect models and principal component analysis to characterize relationships between deer presence-absence data and habitat variables. We confirmed musk deer use latrines in forests located at higher elevations (3,200-4,200 m) throughout multiple seasons and years. Himalayan birch (Betula utilis) dominated forest, mixed Himalayan fir (Abies spectabilis), and birch forest were preferred over pure Himalayan fir and blue pine (Pinus wallichiana) forest. Greater crown cover and shrub diversity were associated with the presence of musk deer whereas tree height, diameter, and diversity were weakly correlated. Topographical attributes including aspect, elevation, distance to water source, and slope were also discriminated by musk deer. Over- and understory forest management can be used to protect forests likely to have musk deer as predicted by the models to ensure long-term conservation of this rare deer.

One such outbreaking pest, Zapatella davisae (Cynipidae: Cynipini), causes significant damage and mortality to black oak, Quercus velutina, in the northeastern United States. In this study, we aimed to identify the parasitoid community associated with Z. davisae, compare differences in percent parasitism of Z. davisae in Cape Cod and Long Island, and determine which parasitoid species contribute most to parasitism in each region. From both locations, we reared parasitoids, identified morphological groups, analyzed percent parasitism rates for each group, and used DNA barcoding to provide species-level identifications. On Long Island, there was nearly 100% parasitism in 2015 followed by a near total collapse of the population in 2016. In contrast, parasitism rates were lower and remained consistent on Cape Cod between 2015 and 2016, which may explain the greater canopy damage observed in that region. Species of Sycophila were the dominant parasitoids, with one species Sycophila nr. novascotiae representing similar to 65% of reared parasitoids from Long Island, and two species of Sycophila (S. nr. novascotiae and S. foliatae) with near equal representations on Cape Cod. In order to manage an insect pest, it is important to understand factors that influence its mortality and survival. An understanding of how these infestations progress overtime can help predict the impact that newer infestations in Nantucket, MA, and coastal Rhode Island will have on black oak populations and will aid in the management of this rapidly spreading gall wasp pest.

In this study, the relative importance of flower color and color contrast patterns on pollinator attraction was examined in two pollinator groups, swallowtail butterflies and hawkmoths using two Hemerocallis species; butterfly-pollinated H. fulva and hawkmoth-pollinated H. citrina, having reddish and yellowish flowers in human vision, respectively. Flowers of both species have UV bullseye patterns, composed of UV-absorbing centers and UV-reflecting peripheries, known to function as a typical nectar guide, but UV reflectance was significantly more intense in the peripheries of H. citrina flowers than in those of H. fulva flowers. Comparison based on the visual systems of butterflies and hawkmoths showed that the color contrast of the bullseye pattern in H. citrina was more intense than that in H. fulva. To evaluate the relative importance of flower color and the color contrast of bullseye pattern on pollinator attraction, we performed a series of observations using experimental arrays consisting of Hemerocallis species and their hybrids. As a result, swallowtail butterflies and crepuscular/nocturnal hawkmoths showed contrasting preferences for flower color and patterns: butterflies preferred H. fulva-like colored flower whereas the preference of hawkmoths was affected by the color contrast of the bullseye pattern rather than flower color. Both crepuscular and nocturnal hawkmoths consistently preferred flowers with stronger contrast of the UV bullseye pattern, whereas the preference of hawkmoths for flower color was incoherent. Our finding suggests that hawkmoths can use UV-absorbing/reflecting bullseye patterns for foraging under light-limited environments and that the intensified bullseye contrast of H. citrina evolved as an adaptation to hawkmoths. Our results also showed the difference of visual systems between pollinators, which may have promoted floral divergence.

The ecological effects of roads often extend far into the surrounding habitat, over a distance known as the road-effect zone. The quality of habitat in the road-effect zone is generally degraded (e.g., due to edge effects, noise, light, and chemical pollution) and can be reflected in species presence, abundance, or demographic parameters. Road-effect zones have been quantified for some vertebrate species but are yet to be quantified for insects. Investigating the road-effect zone for insects will provide a better understanding of how roads impact ecosystems, which is particularly important given the role insects play as pollinators, predators, and prey for other species. We quantified the road-effect zone for nocturnal flying insects along three major freeways in agricultural landscapes in southeast Australia. We collected insects using light traps at six points along 2-km transects perpendicular to each highway (n = 17). We sorted the samples into order, and dried and weighed each order to obtain a measure of dry biomass. Using regression models within a Bayesian framework of inference, we estimated the change in biomass of each order with distance from the road, while accounting for environmental variables such as temperature, moon phase, and vegetation structure. The biomass of nine of the ten orders sampled did not change with distance from the freeway. Orthoptera (i.e., grasshoppers and crickets) was the only order whose biomass increased with distance from the freeway. From our findings, we suggest that the impacts of roads on insects are unlikely extending into the surrounding landscape over a distance of 2 km. Therefore, if there are impacts of roads on insects, these are more likely to be concentrated at the road itself, or on finer taxonomic scales such as family or genus level.

Parks and protected lands, while designed to conserve wildlife, often cannot provide the habitat protection needed for wide-ranging animals such as the American black bear (Ursus americanus). Conversely, private lands are often working landscapes (e.g., farming) that have high human footprints relative to protected lands. In southwestern Alberta, road densities are highest on private lands and black bears can be hunted year-round. On protected lands, road densities are lowest, and hunting is prohibited. On public lands under the jurisdiction of the provincial government (Crown lands), seasonal hunting is permitted. Population estimates are needed to calculate sustainable harvest levels and to monitor population trends. In our study area, there has never been a robust estimate of black bear density and spatial drivers of black bear density are poorly understood. We used non-invasive genetic sampling and indices of habitat productivity and human disturbance to estimate density and abundance for male and female black bears in 2013 and 2014 using two methods: spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) and resource-selection functions (RSF). Land tenure best explained spatial variation in black bear density. Black bear densities for females and males were highest on parkland and lowest on Crown lands. Sex ratios were female-biased on private lands, likely a result of lower harvests and movement of females out of areas with high male density. Synthesis and application: Both SECR and RSF methods clearly indicate spatial structuring of black bear density, with a strong influence based on how lands are managed. Land tenure influences the distribution of available foods and risk from humans. We emphasize the need for improved harvest reporting, particularly for non-licensed hunting on private land, to estimate the extent of black bear harvest mortality.

Failing to account for such variation can result in biased estimates of population-level rates. However, estimating age-dependent survival rates can be challenging because ages of individuals are rarely known unless tagging is done at birth. For many species, it is possible to infer age based on size. In capture-recapture studies of such species, it is possible to use a growth model to infer the age at first capture of individuals. We show how to build estimates of age-dependent survival into a capture-mark-recapture model based on data obtained in a capture-recapture study. We first show how estimates of age based on length increments closely match those based on definitive aging methods. In simulated analyses, we show that both individual ages and age-dependent survival rates estimated from simulated data closely match true values. With our approach, we are able to estimate the age-specific apparent survival rates of Murray and trout cod in the Murray River, Australia. Our model structure provides a flexible framework within which to investigate various aspects of how survival varies with age and will have extensions within a wide range of ecological studies of animals where age can be estimated based on size.

We aimed at identifying thermal response curves (TRCs) of European freshwater species and evaluating the potential impact of climate warming across species, taxonomic groups, and latitude. We first applied generalized additive models using catchment-scale global data on distribution ranges of 577 freshwater species native to Europe and four different temperature variables (the current annual mean air/water temperature and the maximum air/water temperature of the warmest month) to describe species TRCs. We then classified TRCs into one of eight curve types and identified spatial patterns in thermal responses. Finally, we integrated empirical TRCs and the projected geographic distribution of climate warming to evaluate the effect of rising temperatures on species' distributions. For the different temperature variables, 390-463 of 577 species (67.6%-80.2%) were characterized by a unimodal TRC. The number of species with a unimodal TRC decreased from central toward northern and southern Europe. Warming tolerance (WT = maximum temperature of occurrence-preferred temperature) was higher at higher latitudes. Preferred temperature of many species is already exceeded. Rising temperatures will affect most Mediterranean species. We demonstrated that freshwater species' occurrence probabilities are most frequently unimodal. The impact of the global climate warming on species distributions is species and latitude dependent. Among the studied taxonomic groups, rising temperatures will be most detrimental to fish. Our findings support the efforts of catchment-based freshwater management and conservation in the face of global warming.

Landscape features can also drive population structure additive to baseline IBD resulting in differentiation through isolation-by-resistance (IBR). We assessed the population genetic structure of boreal caribou across western Canada using nonspatial (STRUCTURE) and spatial (MEMGENE) clustering methods and investigated the relative contribution of IBD and IBR on genetic variation of 1,221 boreal caribou multilocus genotypes across western Canada. We further introduced a novel approach to compare the partitioning of individuals into management units (MU) and assessed levels of genetic connectivity under different MU scenarios. STRUCTURE delineated five genetic clusters while MEMGENE identified finer-scale differentiation across the study area. IBD was significant and did not differ for males and females both across and among detected genetic clusters. MEMGENE landscape analysis further quantified the proportion of genetic variation contributed by IBD and IBR patterns, allowing for the relative importance of spatial drivers, including roads, water bodies, and wildfires, to be assessed and incorporated into the characterization of population structure for the delineation of MUs. Local population units, as currently delineated in the boreal caribou recovery strategy, do not capture the genetic variation and connectivity of the ecotype across the study area. Here, we provide the tools to assess fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic variation, partition drivers of genetic variation, and evaluate the best management options for maintaining genetic connectivity. Our approach is highly relevant to vagile wildlife species that are of management and conservation concern and demonstrate varying degrees of IBD and IBR with clinal spatial genetic structure that challenges the delineation of discrete population boundaries.

The high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and meta-barcoding methods now used for bioassessment traditionally employ an arbitrary sequence similarity threshold (SST) around 95% or 97% to cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units, which is considered descriptive of species-level resolution. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the SST on the resulting diatom-based ecological quality index, which is based on OTU abundance distribution along a defined environmental gradient, ideally avoiding taxonomic assignments that could result in high rates of unclassified OTUs and biased final values. A total of 90 biofilm samples were collected in 2014 and 2015 from 51 stream sites on Mayotte Island in parallel with measures of relevant physical and chemical parameters. HTS sequencing was performed on the biofilms using the rbcL region as the genetic marker and diatom-specific primers. Hierarchical clustering was used to group sequences into OTUs using 20 experimental SST levels (80%-99%). An OTU-based quality index (Idx(OTU)) was developed based on a weighted average equation using the abundance profiles of the OTUs. The developed Idx(OTU) revealed significant correlations between the Idx(OTU) values and the reference pressure gradient, which reached maximal performance using an SST of 90% (well above species level delimitation). We observed an interesting and important trade-off with the power to discriminate between sampling sites and index stability that will greatly inform future applications of the index. Taken together, the results from this study detail a thoroughly optimized and validated approach to generating robust, reproducible, and complete indexes that will greatly facilitate effective and efficient environmental monitoring.

Species-based and community-wide estimates of preferred and realized predator-prey mass ratios (PPMR) are required inputs to size-based size spectrum models of marine communities, food webs, and ecosystems. Here, we clarify differences between PPMR definitions in different size spectrum models, in particular differences between PPMR measurements weighting prey abundance in individual predators by biomass (r(bio)) and numbers (r(num)). We argue that the former weighting generates PPMR as usually conceptualized in equilibrium (static) size spectrum models while the latter usually applies to dynamic models. We use diet information from 170,689 individuals of 34 species of fish in Alaskan marine ecosystems to calculate both PPMR metrics. Using hierarchical models, we examine how explained variance in these metrics changed with predator body size, predator taxonomic resolution, and spatial resolution. In the hierarchical analysis, variance in both metrics emerged primarily at the species level and substantially less variance was associated with other (higher) taxonomic levels or with spatial resolution. This suggests that changes in species composition are the main drivers of community-wide mean PPMR. At all levels of analysis, relationships between weighted mean r(bio) or weighted mean r(num) and predator mass tended to be dome-shaped. Weighted mean r(num) values, for species and community-wide, were approximately an order of magnitude higher than weighted mean r(bio), reflecting the consistent numeric dominance of small prey in predator diets. As well as increasing understanding of the drivers of variation in PPMR and providing estimates of PPMR in the north Pacific Ocean, our results demonstrate that that r(bio) or r(num), as well as their corresponding weighted means for any defined group of predators, are not directly substitutable. When developing equilibrium size-based models based on bulk energy flux or comparing PPMR estimates derived from the relationship between body mass and trophic level with those based on diet analysis, weighted mean r(bio) is a more appropriate measure of PPMR. When calibrating preference PPMR in dynamic size spectrum models then weighted mean r(num) will be a more appropriate measure of PPMR.	[Reum, Jonathan C.

ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						domestication; natural selection; RMR; Salmo salar; semi-natural; SMR	GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; WILD POPULATIONS; JUVENILE SALMON; EGG SIZE; SALAR L.; SELECTION; TEMPERATURE; HYBRID; GROWTH; CONSEQUENCES	Escaped farmed Atlantic salmon interbreed with wild Atlantic salmon, leaving offspring that often have lower success in nature than pure wild salmon. On top of this, presence of farmed salmon descendants can impair production of wild-type recruits. We hypothesize that both these effects connect with farmed salmon having acquired higher standard metabolic rates (SMR, the energetic cost of self-maintenance) during domestication. Fitness-related advantages of phenotypic traits associated with both high SMR and farmed salmon (e.g., social dominance) depend on environmental conditions, such as food availability. We hypothesize that farmed offspring have an advantage at high food availability due to, for example, dominance behavior but suffer increased risks of starvation when food is scarce because this behavior is energy-demanding. To test these hypotheses, we first compare embryo SMR of pure farmed, farmed-wild hybrids and pure wild offspring. Next, we test early-life performance (in terms of survival and growth) of hybrids relative to that of their wild half-siblings, as well as their competitive abilities, in semi-natural conditions of high and low food availability. Finally, we test how SMR affects early-life performance at high and low food availability. We find inconclusive support for the hypothesis that domestication has induced increased SMR. Further, wild and hybrid juveniles had similar survival and growth in the semi-natural streams. Yet, the presence of hybrids led to decreased survival of their wild half-siblings. Contrary to our hypothesis about context-dependency, these effects were not modified by food availability. However, wild juveniles with high SMR had decreased survival when food was scarce, but there was no such effect at high food availability. This study provides further proof that farmed salmon introgression may compromise the viability of wild salmon populations. We cannot, however, conclude that this is connected to alterations in the metabolic phenotype of farmed salmon.

This lack of knowledge is partly due to the difficulties of monitoring juveniles in the wild, which is linked to high mortality early in life. Pinnipeds are good models for studying the development of foraging behaviors because juveniles are large enough to robustly carry tracking devices for many months. Moreover, parental assistance is absent after a juvenile departs for its first foraging trip, minimizing confounding effects of parental input on the development of foraging skills. In this study, we tracked 20 newly weaned juvenile southern elephant seals from Kerguelen Islands for up to 338 days during their first trip at sea following weaning. We used a new generation of satellite relay tags, which allow for the transmission of dive, accelerometer, and location data. We also monitored, at the same time, nine adult females from the colony during their post-breeding trips, in order to compare diving and foraging behaviors. Juveniles showed a gradual improvement through time in their foraging skills. Like adults females, they remarkably adjusted their swimming effort according to temporal changes in buoyancy (i.e., a proxy of their body condition). They also did not appear to exceed their aerobic physiological diving limits, although dives were constrained by their smaller size compared to adults. Changes in buoyancy appeared to also influence their decision to either keep foraging or return to land, alongside the duration of their haul outs and choice of foraging habitat (oceanic vs. plateau). Further studies are thus needed to better understand how patterns in juveniles survival, and therefore elephant seal populations, might be affected by their changes in foraging skills and changes in their environmental conditions.

We have addressed host specialization in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Our study builds on comparative analyses of infection and gene expression phenotypes of three isolates and reveals the extent to which genomic variation translates into phenotypic variation. The isolates exhibit genetic and genomic variation but are similarly virulent. By combining confocal microscopy, disease monitoring, staining of ROS, and comparative transcriptome analyses, we conducted a detailed comparison of the infection processes of these isolates in a susceptible wheat cultivar. We characterized four core infection stages: establishment, biotrophic growth, lifestyle transition, and necrotrophic growth and asexual reproduction that are shared by the three isolates. However, we demonstrate differentiated temporal and spatial infection development and significant differences in the expression profiles of the three isolates during the infection stages. More than 20% of the genes were differentially expressed and these genes were located significantly closer to transposable elements, suggesting an impact of epigenetic regulation. Further, differentially expressed genes were enriched in effector candidates suggesting that isolate-specific strategies for manipulating host defenses are present in Z. tritici. We demonstrate that individuals of a host-specialized pathogen have highly differentiated infection programs characterized by flexible infection development and functional redundancy. This illustrates how high genetic diversity in pathogen populations results in highly differentiated infection phenotypes, which fact needs to be acknowledged to understand host-pathogen interactions and pathogen evolution.

Livestock overgrazing and the associated reduction of fine fuels has been a primary driver of shrub encroachment in the southwestern United States, but shrublands continue to persist despite livestock removal and grassland restoration efforts. We hypothesized that an herbivory feedback from native mammals may contribute to continued suppression of grasses after the removal of livestock. Our herbivore exclusion experiment in southeastern Arizona included five treatment levels and allowed access to native mammals based on their relative body size, separating the effects of rodents, lagomorphs, and mule deer. We included two control treatments and replicated each treatment 10 times (n = 50). We introduced uniform divisions of lawn sod (Cynodon dactylon) into each exclosure for 24-hr periods prior to (n = 2) and following (n = 2) the monsoon rains and used motion-activated cameras to document herbivore visitations. In the pre-monsoon trials, treatments that allowed lagomorph access had less sod biomass relative to other treatments (p 0.001), averaging 44% (SD 36%) and 29% (SD 45%) remaining biomass after the 24-hr trial periods. Following the onset of monsoons, differences in remaining biomass among treatments disappeared. Desert cottontails (Sylvilagus audubonii) were detected more frequently than any of the other 11 herbivore species present at the site, accounting for 83% of detections during the pre-monsoon trials. Significantly more (p 0.001) desert cottontails were detected during the pre-monsoon trials (2,077) compared to the post-monsoon trials (174), which coincided with biomass removal from lagomorph accessible treatments. We conclude that desert cottontails are significant consumers of herbaceous vegetation in shrub-encroached arid grasslands and they, along with other native herbivores, may act as a biotic feedback contributing to the competitive advantage and persistence of shrubs.
