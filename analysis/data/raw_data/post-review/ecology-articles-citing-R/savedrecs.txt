Pond-breeding anuran composition depends on environmental predictors such as climate, vegetation type and habitat features as well as spatial processes (e.g., dispersal limitation or distances among patches). Here, we investigated the role of spatial and local (water chemistry and habitat structure) and regional (climate) environmental predictors to tadpole beta diversity (and its turnover and nestedness-resultant components) in temporary ponds distributed along a forest-grassland transition in the southern Brazilian Coastal Plain. Additionally, we investigated the role of the assessed predictors within forest and grassland sub-regions to test for congruence in their contribution across vegetation types. Turnover was the most relevant component of beta diversity. Spatial predictors alone explained beta diversity (and both components) at the broadest scale. However, the contribution of environmental and spatial predictors to beta diversity differed between sub-regions. Spatial and local environmental predictors independently explained beta diversity in the grassland, while in the forest sub-region, local predictors and spatially-structured climate were the most important. Our results revealed a complex interplay of niche-based and spatial assembly processes shaping anuran metacommunities. The different relationships of environmental and spatial predictors with beta diversity in the forest and grassland sub-regions suggest that the contribution of assembly processes to anuran metacommunity structure change with vegetation type.

However, little is known about the long-term impact of O-3 on the microbial communities. In the present study, two biofilters treating gaseous ethyl acetate were operated continuously for 230 days with inlet loads up to 180 g m(-3).h(-1). A biofilter operated under continuous O-3 addition (90 ppb(v)) yielded consistently higher removal efficiency (RE) and elimination capacity (EC) compared to the control system. After 120 days of operation, a lower biomass content accompanied by a pH of 1.5 was observed in the ozonated biofilter, which was 2 units lower compared to the control reactor. Both reactors developed a distinct microbial community composition over the course of 230 days. The bacterial community was dominated in both biofilters by Beijerinckia and Gluconacetobacter, while Rhinocladiella similis, Trichosporon veenhuissi and Exophilia oligosperma were abundant in the fungal community. These findings suggest that ozonation of the biofiltration systems not only reduced clogging, but also contributed to the selection of biomass suitable for degradation of ethyl acetate.

Due to the presence of a multitude of environmental contaminants in this complex matrix causing a mixed toxicity, the identification and assessment of main toxicants is a challenge. One approach in identifying main toxicants is the application of effect-directed analysis (EDA). In this study, an EDA approach was developed using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) coupled to bioluminescence bacteria detection with Aliivibrio fischeri for the determination of marine sediments acute toxicity. In a first attempt, the HPTLC separation was optimized with a fast, two-step gradient to separate main hydrophobic organic contaminant (HOC) classes found in marine sediments. An easy-touse evaluation script for the resulting bioluminescence inhibition images was programed using R. The developed method was applied to sediment extracts of two different sample sets: (i) Fourteen marine sediment samples from the German Bight representing a wide range of contaminant loads and sediment properties and (ii) sediment samples from a core representing temporal trends of contamination. Results from the HPTLC-bioluminescence bacteria assay were compared to HOC concentrations determined by GC-MS/MS. A correlation of the determined inhibition r-values for the PAH inhibition zone to PAH concentrations showed a very good agreement (R-2 = 0.91). The results of this study were used to evaluate the suitability of the EDA approach to be used as an assessment tool for marine sediments. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Extreme rates and diel variability of planktonic respiration in a shallow sub-arctic lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Respiration; Plankton; Metabolism; Community; Food web; Lake; Diel	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; METABOLIC BALANCE; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; CARBON-CYCLE; OXYGEN; ISOTOPES; PATTERNS; LIGHT	Planktonic community respiration (CR) is a major component of aquatic biogeochemical cycling and food web energetics. Accurate, direct characterizations of short-term patterns and drivers of plankton CR are needed to understand aquatic biogeochemical processes and food web functioning. Recent work indicates CR may be commonly underestimated, and may undergo considerable diel changes that are missed using standard methodological approaches. To explore these possibilities, we applied an immediate, in situ, dark incubation approach at similar to 3h intervals over 2.5 diel cycles in a shallow, productive, sub-arctic lake in interior Alaska, USA. Rates of CR varied 17-fold, strongly coupled to diel oscillations in water temperature. A weak inverse relationship to similar to 3mgL(-1) diel changes in dissolved organic carbon concentrations suggests CR partially modulated the standing stock of organic matter over short timescales. Average rates of CR were similar to 6 to 100-fold greater than published, conventional CR measurements, but comparable to existing free-water estimates of ecosystem respiration for nearby Alaskan lakes. Overall, this study places new weight on the importance of CR in whole-ecosystem biogeochemical transformations by supporting recent suggestions that planktonic CR may be commonly underestimated.

Ecological effects of a supra-seasonal drought on macroinvertebrate communities differ between near-perennial and ephemeral river reaches	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Aquatic conservation; Biodiversity; Community composition; Disturbance; Ephemeral streams; Lotic habitat	INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; LIFE-HISTORY; INTERMITTENT STREAMS; FLOW VARIABILITY; RESPONSES; ASSEMBLAGES; PERSISTENCE; RESILIENCE; RESISTANCE; RECOLONIZATION	The duration, intensity and frequency of hydrological droughts are predicted to increase significantly over the 21st century globally, threatening the long-term stability of lotic communities. In this paper we examine the recovery and recolonization of macroinvertebrate taxa in ephemeral and near perennial reaches of the River Lathkill (UK) after a supra-seasonal drought event. Following flow resumption, species accumulation (recolonization) occurred rapidly over a 4-month period, with a steady increase observed thereafter. Taxonomic richness was significantly higher in the section with near perennial flow after the first month of the study than the naturally ephemeral reach. Serial correlation was observed in the near perennial section but not in the upstream ephemeral reach. Serial correlation in the near perennial section may reflect: (1) the ongoing process of recovery or (2) the macroinvertebrate community following a new ecological trajectory. Our results suggest that supra-seasonal droughts may cause initial reductions in lotic diversity during stream desiccation events but may re-set ecological succession and/or temporarily provide new ecological niches, thereby supporting increased taxonomic diversity when the full range of hydrological conditions are considered. Quantifying the recovery of ecological communities following supra-seasonal drought can provide information to help develop ecologically effective conservation and management strategies.	[Hill, M.

The colonization and consequent structuring of the communities in these systems is influenced by several environmental and spatial factors. Among them, urbanization is one of the important structuring factors of these communities. Metacommunity theory is an important tool for assessing how local (e.g. environment, competition and predation) and regional/spatial (e.g. dispersion) factors can influence the structure of communities distributed in patches in an area. We evaluated the diversity of the metacommunity of microcrustaceans in two categories of urban aquatic environments, preserved and constructed, looking for how the environmental and spatial factors influenced their diversity. We also sought to verify which beta diversity mechanism explained the dissimilarity between communities. We hypothesized that the richness of taxa would be greater in aquatic environments of preserved areas and in constructed areas there would be a loss of species, thus generating a beta diversity explained by the nestedness pattern. We sampled temporary environments in an urban area, eight in a preserved and six in a construction area. The results showed a clear difference between the two areas, both in environmental characteristics and in the composition of taxa. In relation to the richness of taxa, the areas did not present significant differences, thus rejecting our first hypothesis. The beta diversity was explained mainly by the turnover mechanism, refuting our second hypothesis. This pattern was mainly explained by the difference in the composition of taxa between the preserved and construction area environments.

Herbivorous and omnivorous zooplankton may be particularly susceptible to HAB toxins, due to their close trophic relationship to algae as grazers. In this study, the acute toxigenic effects of the haptophyte Prymnesium parvum on a zooplankton community were investigated under laboratory conditions. Total zooplankton abundances decreased during 48-h exposure, although species responses to P. parvum densities varied. Changes in community composition were driven by declines in Daphnia mendotae and Keratella spp. abundances, which resulted in an average shift in copepod abundance from 47.1 to 72.4%, and rotifer abundance from 35.0 to 7.1%. Total cladocerans were relatively unchanged in relative abundance (11.1-10.4%), though the dominant cladoceran shifted from Daphnia mendotae (61.3% of cladocerans) to Bosmina longirostris (81.5% of cladocerans). Daphnia mendotae and Keratella spp. are known to be non-selective or generalist feeders and were likely harmed through a combination of ingestion of and contact by P. parvum. Proportional increases in copepod and Bosmina abundances in the presence of P. parvum likely reflect selective or discriminate feeding abilities in these taxa. This study corroborates previous field studies showing that P. parvum can negatively affect zooplankton, reflecting species-specific differences in zooplankton-P. parvum interactions. Such changes can alter zooplankton community composition, leading to substantial food-web consequences and potential long-term ecosystem-level impacts in lakes that experience blooms.

We studied spontaneously created post-mining calcareous brooks located at the brown coal spoil heap in the Sokolov coal basin (Czechia). Despite their extreme water conditions, linked most to the ionic mixture of dissolved ions (mainly SO42-, Ca2+ and Mg2+), and ferric hydroxide precipitations, we recorded unexpectedly species-rich assemblages there (150 species), including several spring fen specialists (31 species) and eight threatened red-listed species. Macroinvertebrate assemblages of post-mining calcareous habitats were compared with those reported from natural brooks draining Western Carpathians calcareous spring fens. The species richness found in the post-mining calcareous brooks was significantly lower than that of the natural calcareous spring brooks. Although we found 29% of species recorded in the two study systems in common (i.e. 80 species), species composition of their assemblages was systematically distinct. This suggests a possible role of environmental filtering in the post-mining brooks and/or dispersal limitation of some species typical for natural calcareous spring brooks (e.g. Trichodrilus strandi, Bythinella austriaca). In contrast, many macroinvertebrates, particularly those of high dispersal capacities (i.e. Odonata, Coleoptera and Diptera), can recognize post-mining calcareous brooks as surrogate habitats for the natural calcareous spring brooks.

A project to improve water quality in the Velky Bolevecky pond (Plzen, Czech Republic) began in 2006. The main activities in this project were: large scale fish reduction; stocking of predatory fish; usage of phosphorus binding coagulants; and reintroduction of macrophytes. During five years the impact of a eutrophic system with massive cyanobacterial blooms with low water transparency transformed into a clear water system with high water transparency and well developed macrophyte cover. All aspects relating to the ecological status of the water body such as total phosphorus concentration, chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton density improved significantly during or immediately after the project realization. For example, water transparency increased three fold. Zooplankton density also increased, however the difference was not significant. Oligotrophication of the system became evident also in the species composition of zooplankton and phytoplankton. Species adapted to nutrient reduction and macrophyte cover developed. Seven years after the project was over, the fish stock remained on the low densities naturally. A good ecological stage was achieved with low nutrient levels, high water transparency, very low densities of cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton together with a well-developed macrophyte cover. All of which has been maintained without any expensive impact. The highest expenditure is, paradoxically, due to macrophyte harvesting because their massive explosion in the pond is not in accordance with recreational and sporting utilization. It seems, that reduction of nutrient loading and switching of a formerly eutrophic system to an oligotrophic one is possible and sustainable over a relatively long time period in a shallow temperate pond. Subsequent good management of the system will, of course, be necessary.

One possible solution is the use of fixed ratios, i.e. rays of increasing metal concentrations. But fixed ratios rays are compromised when soils dosed with metal salts are leached due to metal-soil selectivity rules. Two alternative metal forms, metal oxides and spinel minerals of quinary metal mixtures (Pb, Cu, Co, Ni, Zn), were evaluated for their toxicity to soil microorganisms measured by the activity of ammonia monooxygenases and acid-phosphatases in three soils. Leaching, a required step for salts, had a larger effect on ammonia monooxygenases than metals. Generally, metal salts were the most toxic form, while the spinet minerals were the least toxic form. Two extractants, CaCl2 and DTPA, were evaluated for their ability to link toxicity to metals across all three metal forms. Salt toxicity was closely linked to CaCl2 extractable concentrations but DTPA was the most appropriate for oxides. We strongly recommend combining fixed ratio rays with metal oxides for metal mixture studies, since soil ratios created using oxides were more precise and required less experimental effort compared to salts and spinet minerals. Furthermore, because DTPA and CaCl2 closely tracked the toxicity of more realistic metal forms (i.e. oxides), we recommend that field studies investigating metal mixtures use both DTPA and CaCl2.

The effects of diltiazem on growth, reproduction, energy reserves, and calcium-dependent physiology in Daphnia magna	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Daphnia magna; Diltiazem; Pharmaceutical; Reproduction; Feeding; Behaviour	PROCESS-AFFECTED WATER; PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; FEEDING-ACTIVITY; ACUTE TOXICITY; HEART-RATE; PHARMACEUTICALS; RIVER; INVOLVEMENT; EXPOSURE; BEHAVIOR	With the growth of both the pharmaceutical industry and the human population and longevity, more drugs are used and processed each day. Inevitably, these pharmaceuticals enter wastewater through human excretion and improper disposal of leftovers. One such medication, diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is of importance due to its widespread consumption, and prevalence in aquatic environments. To study the sub-lethal effects of diltiazem on aquatic animals, we investigated its impacts no feeding behaviour, heart rate, respiration, growth, and reproduction of a bioindicator species, Daphnia magna. When exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations, D. magna increased their heart rate by 12% and oxygen consumption by 48%. However, exposure did not have any effects on thoracic limb movement frequency or peristalsis (i.e. feeding behaviour). Individuals exposed to diltiazem for a longer duration (16 days) showed a 44% decrease in lipid reserves and produced between 17 and 28% fewer neonates which were 10-12% larger. Our study demonstrated that exposure to diltiazem creates an energy imbalance in D. magna which could, in the long run, influence their populations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The importance of dietary uptake for aquatic invertebrates has been increasingly assessed in recent years. However, the model parameters are estimated on limited specific laboratory data sets that are bounded by several uncertainties. The aim of this study was to implement a Bayesian framework for simultaneously estimating the parameters of a generic TK model for benthic invertebrate species from all data collected. We illustrate our approach on the bioaccumulation of PCB153 by two species with different life traits and therefore exposure routes: Chironomus riparius larvae exposed to spiked sediment for 7 days and Gammarus fossarum exposed to spiked sediment and/or leaves for 7 days and then transferred to a clean media for 7 more days. The TK models assuming first-order kinetics were fitted to the data using Bayesian inference. The median model predictions and their 95% credibility intervals showed that the model fit the data well. From a methodological point of view, this paper illustrates that simultaneously estimating all model parameters from all available data by Bayesian inference, while considering the correlation between parameters and different types of data, is a real added value for TK modeling. Moreover, we demonstrated the ability of a generic TK model considering uptake and elimination routes as modules to add according to the availability of the data measured. From an ecotoxicological point of view, we show differences in PCB153 bioaccumulation between chironomids and gammarids, explained by the different life traits of these two organisms.

The impact of dietary crude oil on growth and metabolism of polar cod was investigated in the early spring (March April) when individuals are expected to be in a vulnerable physiological state with poor energy stores. Adult polar cod were exposed dietarily to three doses of Kobbe crude oil during an eight weeks period and followed by two weeks of depuration. Significant dose-responses in exposure biomarkers (hepatic ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase [EROD] activity and 1-OH phenanthrene metabolites in bile) indicated that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were bioavailable. Condition indices (i.e. Fulton's condition factor, hepatosomatic index), growth, whole body respiration, and total lipid content in the liver were monitored over the course of the experiment. The majority of females were immature, while a few had spawned during the season and showed low hepatic lipid content during the experiment. In contrast, males were all, except for one immature individual, in a post-spawning stage and had larger hepatic energy stores than females. Most specimens, independent of sex, showed a loss in weight, that was exacerbated by exposure to crude oil and low hepatic liver lipids. Furthermore, females exposed to crude oil showed a significant elevation of oxygen consumption compared to controls, although not dose-dependent. This study highlights the importance of the energy status of individuals for their response to a crude oil exposure.

Concomitantly, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels continue to rise, increasing the concentrations of bicarbonate ions in aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates the influence of CeO2 NPs (from 0 to 100 mu gL(-1)) in the presence and absence of an elevated bicarbonate (HCO3-) ion concentration (1 mM), on vibrational biochemical parameters and photosystem II (PSII) activity in leaf discs of Salvinia auriculata. Fourier transform-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) was capable of diagnostic use to understand biochemical and metabolic changes in leaves submitted to the CeO2 NPs and also detected interactive responses between CeO2 NPs and HCO3- exposure at the tissue level. The results showed that the higher CeO2 NPs levels in the presence of HCO3- increased the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and coefficient of photochemical quenching in dark (qPd) compared to the absence of HCO3. Moreover, the presence of HCO3- significantly decreased the NPQ at all levels of CeO2 NPs demonstrating that HCO3- exposure may change the non-radiative process involved in the operation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Overall, the results of this study are useful for providing baseline information on the interactive effects of CeO2 NPs and elevated HCO3- ion concentration on photosynthetic systems.

Groundwater appears to be one of the main natural resources capable to reverse this situation. Uncovering the spatial patterns of groundwater occurrence is a crucial factor that could assist in carrying out successful water resources management projects. The main objective of the current study was to provide a novel methodology approach which utilized Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to perform a feature selection procedure and data mining methods for generating a groundwater spring potential map. Three data mining methods, Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to construct a groundwater spring potential map that had over 0.81 probability of occurrence for the Wuqi County, Shaanxi Province, China. Groundwater spring locations and sixteen related variables were analyzed, namely: lithology, soil cover, land use cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope angle, aspect, planform curvature, profile curvature, curvature, stream power index (SPI), stream transport index (STI), topographic wetness index (TWI), mean annual rainfall, distance from river network and distance from road network. The Frequency ratio method was used to weight the variables, whereas a multi-collinearity analysis was performed to identify the relation between the parameters and to decide about their usage. The optimal set of parameters, which was determined by the GA, reduced the number of parameters into twelve removing planform curvature, profile curvature, curvature and STI. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUROC) were estimated so as to evaluate the predictive power of each model. The results indicated that the optimized models were superior in accuracy than the original models. The optimized RF model produced the best results (0.9572), followed by the optimized SVM (0.9529) and the optimized NB (0.8235). Overall, the current study highlights the necessity of applying feature selection techniques in groundwater spring assessments and also that data mining methods may be a highly powerful investigation approach for groundwater spring potential mapping.

Results showed that the total dissipation of sulfonamides was above 70%, which was higher than that of quinolones and tetracyclines. Quinolones were more persistent in compost than in AD biosolids. Similar dissipation rates in AD biosolids and compost were observed for tetracyclines. Of the four commonly used models, the availability-adjusted first-order model (AAFO) was the optimal to fit the dissipation of antibiotics, which was mainly governed by their initial concentrations, matrix pH, and the presence of organic matter and microorganisms. The half-lives of sulfonamides, quinolones, and tetracyclines in AD biosolids were 6-51 days, 1-136 days, and 15-19 days; while those were 3-21 days, 3-74 days, and 7-27 days in compost, respectively. In particular, enrofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most persistent in AD biosolids and compost, respectively. Moreover, tetracyclines were more prone to cause pseudo-persistent pollution due to their much higher residuals in comparison to sulfonamides and quinolones. Thus, both AD biosolids and compost should be further treated before their farmland applications to control antibiotic introduction to the environment. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Urban groundwater dissolved silica concentrations are elevated due to vertical composition of historic land-filling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Land-use; Watershed silica export; Global silica cycle; Urbanization; Groundwater	NUTRIENT LOADINGS; HONG-KONG; DISCHARGE; LOSSES; MODELS; BOSTON; TIDE; CITY	Human influences on global silicon (Si) cycling include land-use change, deforestation, and wastewater discharge. Here we quantified the effect of urban expansion and historic land fill on dissolved silica (DSi) concentrations in urban groundwater in a northern temperate city. We hypothesized that historical land use, fill material, and urban infrastructure buried below cities create a unique anthropogenic geology which acts as a DSi source. We found that concentrations of DSi in urban groundwater are significantly higher than those from non-urban environments. We also found that historic land-use variables out-perform traditional topographic variables predicting urban DSi concentrations. We show that higher groundwater DSi concentrations result in increased subterranean groundwater discharge (SGD) fluxes, thereby altering coastal receiving water DSi availability. Further, we demonstrate that accounting for urban SGD DSi fluxes globally, could increase DSi SGD export by 20%. Together these results call for a re-evaluation of anthropogenic impacts on the global Si cycle. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ecosystem resilience depends on both functional redundancy (the number of species making a similar contribution to a given ecosystem function) and response diversity (variability in the responses of functionally similar species to disturbance). Ants provide numerous important ecosystem functions that are rooted in their dietary ecology. We focused on food resource exploitation and analyzed how functional redundancy and response diversity changed across common habitats for Mediterranean ant communities. Our aim was to assess the vulnerability of ant-famished ecosystem functions to future environmental change. We used cafeteria experiments to identify ant functional groups: we offered ants a variety of seeds, insects, and liquid sugars. Then, using more general baits, we estimated ant species richness and abundance. We also examined 12 ant traits (morphological, social, ecobehavioral, and physiological) thought to reflect responses to disturbance. We found that most Mediterranean ant species are dietary generalists. Functional redundancy was highest and lowest for sugar and seed consumers, respectively, a consistent trend across habitats that was unrelated to species richness. Response diversity did not depend on ant functional group. Interestingly, both functional redundancy and response diversity were higher in pine forests and shrublands than in oak forests, a pattern that was consistent regardless of whether the functional groups were examined collectively or individually. Variation in functional redundancy and response diversity was strongly driven by site-specific species richness. Response diversity also varied based on trait type. Ecosystem functions mediated by seed-consuming ants should be the most vulnerable to environmental change, and habitat type and local species richness should affect the vulnerability of any ecosystem functions mediated by ant dietary ecology. Species-poor communities in forests should be the most vulnerable, while species-rich communities in open habitats should be the most resilient. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In water bodies falling in this category, hydromorphological modifications are permanent, significantly alter the character of the river and cannot be removed without compromising the use of the water body. In HMWBs a dedicated approach to the evaluation of their status is set, and their Ecological Potential must be assessed. Crucial to the process is the definition of Maximum Ecological Potential (MEP) as the reference conditions for HMWB. In the present paper we aim to define MEP conditions for Italian heavily modified lowland rivers, affected by strong bank protection (i.e. levees or bank reinforcement) in reason of flood protection and land drainage uses. The approach applied to identify MEP conditions follows the one considered for natural (not heavily modified) rivers in Italy and large part of Europe and bases on the identification of 'reference sites' representative for the river category and alteration. For the selection of MEP sites environmental features representing mitigation measures and/or expected natural features were considered. The ability of such features in discriminating MEP and disturbed sites was verified by multivariate analyses run on abiotic features (Principal Component Analysis) and biological communities (nonmetric multidimensional scaling). We demonstrated differences both in terms of invertebrate community and biological metrics used to assess ecological status (and potential) between MEP and impaired river stretches. Finally, we recognized relevant habitat features able to clearly separate MEP reaches from nonMEP reaches with indication on the type and quantity of measures significant for benthic invertebrates and applicable in lowland Heavily Modified Water Bodies.

Seasonal variation of arsenic and antimony in surface waters of small subarctic lakes impacted by legacy mining pollution near Yellowknife, NT, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Arsenic; Antimony; Sediment efflux; Subarctic lakes; Seasonality; Cryoconcentration	SOLID-PHASE SPECIATION; NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES; GIANT MINE; MOBILITY; SEDIMENTS; CONTAMINATION; EUTROPHICATION; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR; SOILS	The seasonal variation in lake water arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) concentrations was assessed in four small (<1.5 km(2)) subarctic lakes impacted by As and Sb emissions from legacy mining activities near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. Substantial variation in As concentrations were measured over the two-year period of study in all but the deepest lake (maximum depth 6.9 m), induding a four-fold difference in As in the shallowest lake ([As]: 172-846 mu g L-1; maximum depth 0.8 m). Arsenic concentrations were enriched following ice cover development in the three shallowest lakes (50-110%) through a combination of physical and biogeochemical processes. Early winter increases in As were associated with the exclusion of solutes from the developing ice-cover; and large increases in As were measured once oxygen conditions were depleted to the point of anoxia by mid-winter. The onset of anoxic conditions within the water column was associated with large increases in the concentration of redox sensitive elements in lake waters (As, iron [Fe], and manganese [Mn]), suggesting coupling of As mobility with Fe and Mn cyding. In contrast, there was little difference in Sb concentrations under ice suggesting that Sb mobility was controlled by factors other than Fe and Mn associated redox processes. A survey of 30 lakes in the region during fall (open-water) and late-winter (under-ice) revealed large seasonal differences in surface water As were more common in lakes with a maximum depth <4 m. This threshold highlights the importance of winter conditions and links between physical lake properties and biogeochemical processes in the chemical recovery of As-impacted subarctic landscapes. The findings indicate annual remobilization of As from contaminated lake sediments may be inhibiting recovery in small shallow lakes that undergo seasonal transitions in redox state.

Establishing nutrient thresholds in the face of uncertainty and multiple stressors: A comparison of approaches using simulated datasets	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Eutrophication; Phosphorus; Nitrogen; Threshold; Multiple stressors; Water Framework Directive	BIOLOGICAL CONDITION GRADIENT; LAKE ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; FRESH-WATER; QUANTILE REGRESSION; CRITERIA; ECOSYSTEMS; IMPACTS; COASTAL; MARINE; PHOSPHORUS	Various methods have been proposed to identify threshold concentrations of nutrients that would support good ecological status, but the performance of these methods and the influence of other stressors on the underlying models have not been fully evaluated. We used synthetic datasets to compare the performance of ordinary least squares, logistic and quantile regression, as well as, categorical methods based on the distribution of nutrient concentrations categorised by biological status. The synthetic datasets used differed in their levels of variation between explanatory and response variables, and were centered at different positions along the stressor (nutrient) gradient. In order to evaluate the performance of methods in "multiple stressor" situations, another set of datasets with two stressors was used. Ordinary least squares and logistic regression methods were the most reliable when predicting the threshold concentration when nutrients were the sole stressor; however, both had a tendency to underestimate the threshold when a second stressor was present. In contrast, threshold concentrations produced by categorical methods were strongly influenced by the level of the stressor (nutrient enrichment, in this case) relative to the threshold they were trying to predict (good/moderate in this instance). Although all the methods tested had limitations in the presence of a second stressor, upper quantiles seemed generally appropriate to establish non-precautionary thresholds. For example, upper quantiles may be appropriate when establishing targets for restoration, but not when seeking to minimise deterioration. Selection of an appropriate threshold concentration should also attend to the regulatory regime (i.e. policy requirements and environmental management context) within which it will be used, and the ease of communicating the principles to managers and stakeholders.

The used approach follows the guidelines established by the Decree of the Italian Ministry of Environment, n. 173/2016, concerning the determination of threshold values of metal concentration, and including only samples with low or absent toxicological content. A statistical analysis, using the adjusted Tuckey's boxplot to identify the percentiles and potential outliers, was performed. The background concentrations were calculated as the values of the 90th percentile of distribution, according to the national regulation. This study represents the first attempt to calculate the background levels of marine sediments done at regional level in Abruzzo. A few outliers have been found, and interpreted as potential anthropic contamination. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In single-constituent models, we found that each one interquartile-range increase of naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluoranthene and pyrene were associated with 26.82, 60.99, 45.25 and 23.37 mL decline in FVC respectively: while fluoranthene and pyrene were associated with 27.43 and 15.49 mL decline in FEV1 respectively. Similar results were observed in consitituent-PM2.5 joint models and single-constituent residual models. Persistently long-term high levels of three HMW-PAHs (benzo[ajanthracene, dibenzo[a, h]anthracene, and benzo[ghi]perylene) were associated with 214.65, 226.13, and 265.00 mL decline in PVC decline in three years, compared with persistently low exposure level groups. The associations were different between Wuhan and Zhuhai. The results of diagnostic ratios suggested the differences in PAH emissions between two cities. Our findings provide evidence that both short- and long-term PM2.5-bound PAH exposures might affect lung function. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Understanding the mechanisms of self-reinforcing feedbacks in a macrophyte-dominant clear state is critical for lake management. Based on a survey of 35 lakes in the Yangtze River floodplain and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection, the results showed that water clarity is the most limiting factor that influences the community structure and biomass of submerged macrophytes. The canopy length of tall macrophytes (i.e., Myriophyllum spicatum L. and Potamogeton malaianus Miq.) showed positive allometry with plant height, while the canopy length of small mac-rophytes (e.g., Potamogeton maackianus A. Benn.) showed isometry. Our results indicated the existence of positive feedbacks between macrophyte vegetation and water clarity in a "more vegetation, higher water clarity" pattern. We found that the relationships between monospecific community biomass and water clarity differed among community types, indicating that the strength of the positive feedback was interspecific. Furthermore, we found significant differences in the Secchi depth (SD), chlorophyll a (Chl a), light attenuation coefficient (K) and dissolved oxygen (DO) associated with monospecific macrophyte patches. Plant height had significant relationships with the mean values of SD, Chl a, total phosphorus (TP) and K, suggesting that plant height was one of the mechanisms underlying the positive feedbacks. In management practices, efforts to build and maintain the resilience of an ecosystem should be trait-based rather than merely focusing on vegetation abundance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Urbanisation of floodplain ecosystems: Weight-of-evidence and network meta-analysis elucidate multiple stressor pathways	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecological complexity; Bioassessment; Information discovery; Literature review; EcoEvidence; Netmeta	FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS; SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES; METROPOLITAN-AREA; BIODIVERSITY; WETLANDS; IMPACT; DIVERSITY; AUSTRALIA; ECOLOGY; QUALITY	Freshwater floodplains are dynamic, diverse ecosystems that represent important transition zones between terrestrial, riparian, subsurface and aquatic habitats. Given their historic importance in human development, floodplains have been exposed to a variety of pressures, which in combination have been instrumental in driving changes within these ecosystems. Here, we present an evidence-based framework to explore direct and indirect effects of pressures and stressors on floodplain ecosystems and test this structure within the urban landscape. Evidence was obtained from peer-reviewed scientific literature, focusing on effects of key pressures and stressors on receptors, including species composition (e.g., species presence-absence, diversity) and ecosystem function (e.g., biomass, decomposition). The strength of direct and indirect effects of individual and multiple stressors on biological receptors was quantified using two separate analyses: an evidence-weighted analysis and a quantitative network meta-analysis using data extracted from 131 studies. Results demonstrate the power of adopting a systematic framework to advance quantitative assessment of floodplain ecosystems affected by multiple stressors. While direct pathways were generally stronger and provided the core network skeleton, there were many more significant indirect pathways indicating evidence gaps in our mechanistic understanding of these processes. Indeed, the importance of indirect pathways (e.g. increase in impervious surface -> increase in the accumulation rate of sediment nutrients) suggests that embracing complexity in network meta-analysis is a necessary step in revealing a more complete snapshot of the network. Results from the weight-of-evidence approach generally mirrored the direct pathway structure and demonstrated the strength of incorporating study quality alongside data sufficiency. Networks illustrated novel disturbance pathways (e.g., decrease in habitat structure -> decrease in structure and function of aquatic and riparian assemblages) that can be used for hypothesis generation for future scientific enquiries. Our results highlight the broader applicability of adopting the proposed framework for assessing complex environments, such as floodplains. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Multi-tracing of recharge seasonality and contamination in groundwater: A tool for urban water resource management	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Urban hydrology; Stable isotopes; Emerging compounds; Aquifer; Nitrate; Pesticide	NITRATE CONTAMINATION; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; STABLE-ISOTOPES; OXYGEN; CONSTRAINTS; HYDROGEN; SEAWATER; BALANCE; MARKERS; SYSTEM	In this study, sources of recharge and contamination in urban groundwater and in groundwater underneath a forest in the same aquifer were determined and compared. Data on hydro-chemical parameters and stable isotopes of water were collected in urban and forest springs in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine, over a period of 12 months. Groundwater transit time and precipitation contribution were calculated using hydrogeological data and stable isotopes of water to delineate groundwater recharge conditions. Hydro-chemical data, stable isotopes and emerging contaminants were used to trace anthropogenic groundwater recharge and approximate sewage and tap water contributions to the aquifer. The results indicated that each spring had unique isotopic signatures that could be explained by recharge conditions, groundwater residence time, and specific mixing patterns with sewage and water leaks. Elevated nitrate content, stable isotopes of nitrate, and the presence of emerging pollutants (mainly illicit drugs) in most of the urban springs confirmed mixing of urban groundwater with sewage leaks. These leaks amounted to up to 25% of total recharge and exhibited seasonal variations in some springs. Overall, the results show that urban groundwater receives variable seasonal contributions of anthropogenic components that increase the risk to the environment and human health, and reduce its usability for drinking water production. The multi-tracing approach presented can be useful for other cities worldwide that have similar problems of poor water management and inadequate sewage and water supply infrastructure.

However, divergent directions of phenological changes under current climate warming have been frequently reported but poorly understood. Here we collate the long-term filed phenological and climatic records at 8 sites in Inner Mongolian grassland to assess how climate changes regulate the phenological variations with divergent directions and magnitudes in this region. We found that the spring climatic changes (e.g., changes in air temperature and precipitation during March and April) correlate well with variations in SOS. However, our in situ observations show divergent changes in SOS across space, which can be attributed to the generally insignificant changes of climates during the preseasons of SOS. The climate warming prior to the end of plant growing season (EOS) was generally significant at most sites. Nevertheless, the effects of such warming on changes in EOS were possibly overshadowed by the impacts of precipitation in this arid/semi-arid region. As a result, the temporal variations in EOS distribute divergent directions and magnitudes across space and species. Using climate attributes during the preseason of EOS alone can hardly explain changes in EOS. Alternatively, by introducing changes in SOS as an additional driving factor, variations in EOS can be well represented. We therefore infer that plant phenologies can divergently response to current global warming (depending on the seasonal patterns of warming). Moreover, other influential factors such as precipitation and the interactions between the timings of different phenological stages are also needed in predicting the phenological dynamics.

Decay and persistence of empty bivalve shells in a temperate riverine system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ecosystem engineer; Shell morphology; Leaf burial effect; River flow; Native species; Invasive species	FRESH-WATER BIVALVES; CORBICULA-FLUMINEA MULLER; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; MOLLUSCAN FAUNA; MINHO ESTUARY; ORGANISMS; RATES; DISSOLUTION; IMPACTS; LEGACY	Bivalve shells can persist over a geological time, acting as important physical resources to the associated fauna. However, few studies have investigated their relevance as persistent long-term ecological attributes to the ecosystem. As such, it is relevant to investigate the shell decays in riverine systems subjected to different environmental conditions. Towards this end, shells of four bivalve species (Anodonta anatina, Corbicula fluminea, Potomida littoralis and Unio delphinus) were made available individually and in clusters of different sizes. The effects of river flow and seasonality were assessed by recording the decay rates of shells in lentic and lotic habitats throughout the year. Our results evidenced that the decays varied among species and depend on shell size, water flow and season. Thin shelled species (A. anatina and U. delphinus) showed the highest mean percentage of decay per month, 3.17% (lotic) and 2.77% (lotic), respectively, and thick shelled species (C. fluminea and P. littoralis) the lowest, 2.02% (lotic) and 1.83% (lotic), respectively. Size was a relevant variable explaining decays, with the smallest shells presenting the highest values, 1.2-2.0 times higher compared to the other size classes. Also, robustness showed to be the most relevant feature explaining the decays in thick shelled species. River flow was also a relevant descriptor of the decays, with higher decays observed in the lotic compared to the lentic habitats. Furthermore, lower decays were observed mainly during summer (lentic site), and autumn (lotic site) associated to the burial effect of leaves. In summary, shells of the native species A. anatina and U. delphinus are expected to persist and contribute less as habitat engineering species, than shells of the native P. littoralis and invasive C. fluminea species. This is especially valid to lotic habitats where the decays were up to 2.13 times higher than in lentic habitats. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ilarri, M.

Remnant freshwater tributaries in salinized landscapes provide significant biodiversity values, including discrete areas of refuge, dilution of salinized reaches, and potential source populations for recolonisation. The importance of these areas for aquatic fauna is widely accepted but rarely evaluated in the field. This study explored how spatial distribution of southwestern Australia's only freshwater mussel species, Westralunio carteri, has responded to the ongoing salinity trend in the Kent River catchment. Our results showed that salinity in the river has begun to reverse following improved catchment management, and also detected the first evidence of an associated recovery of the freshwater mussel population. Mussels in the mainstem were limited to sites around and downstream of a permanently flowing freshwater tributary, suggesting that dilution from this source provides a refuge in the lower reach. At two of those sites, all individuals were <15 years of age, indicative of recolonisation coinciding with salinity reversal around the turn of the century. Interestingly, mussels clearly persisted in other parts of the lower reach throughout the peak salinity period, when salinities regularly exceeded laboratory derived toxicity thresholds for the species. Mussels were not found in the majority of the mainstem or in highly acidic parts of the freshwater tributaries. The presence of old shells at those sites shows that the species was once widespread, and that the current distribution probably reflects a contraction due to historical salinization as well as acidification. Overall, our results show that the W. carteri population in the catchment has taken a first step towards recovery, and highlights the importance of freshwater tributaries in providing both refuge from disturbance and a source of new recruits.

Ragweed pollen and allergic symptoms in children: Results from a three-year longitudinal study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ambrosia artemisiifolia; Allergic rhinitis; Asthma; Daily diary; Daily pollen count; Croatia	AMBROSIA-ARTEMISIIFOLIA L.; COMMON RAGWEED; ASTHMA SYMPTOMS; HAY-FEVER; SENSITIZATION; RHINITIS; CLIMATE; PREVALENCE; HEALTH; RISK	Common ragweed is a highly allergenic invasive species in Europe, expected to become widespread under climate change. Allergy to ragweed manifests as eye, nasal and lung symptoms, and children may retain these throughout life. The dose-response relationship between symptoms and pollen concentrations is unclear. We undertook a longitudinal study, assessing the association between ragweed pollen concentration and allergic eye, nasal and lung symptoms in children living under a range of ragweed pollen concentrations in Croatia. Over three years, 85 children completed daily diaries, detailing allergic symptoms alongside daily location, activities and medication, resulting in 10,130 individual daily entries. The daily ragweed pollen concentration for the children's locations was obtained, alongside daily weather and air pollution. Parents completed a home/lifestyle/medical questionnaire. Generalised Additive Mixed Models established the relationship between pollen concentrations and symptoms, alongside other covariates. Eye symptoms were associated with mean daily pollen concentration over four days (day of symptoms plus 3 previous days); 61 grains/m(3)/day (95%CI: 45, 100) was the threshold at which 50% of children reported symptoms. Nasal symptoms were associated with mean daily pollen concentration over 12 days (day of symptoms plus 11 previous days); the threshold for 50% of children reporting symptoms was 40 grains/m(3)/day (95%CI: 24, 87). Lung symptoms showed a relationship with mean daily pollen concentration over 19 days (day of symptoms plus 18 previous days), with a threshold of 71 grains/m(3)/day (95%CI: 59, 88). Taking medication on the day of symptoms showed higher odds, suggesting responsive behaviour. Taking medication on the day prior to symptoms showed lower odds of reporting, indicating preventative behaviour. Different symptoms in children demonstrate varying dose-response relationships with ragweed pollen concentrations. Each symptom type responded to pollen exposure over different time periods. Using medication prior to symptoms can reduce symptom presence. These findings can be used to better manage paediatric ragweed allergy symptoms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we collected water samples from eastern Lake Taihu, China. We targeted sites varying in their intensity of aquacultural activities and sampled them over multiple seasons. For each sample, we measured physicochemical variables, and we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene of the respective bacterial communities using an Illumina second-generation sequencing platform. Marked differences in diversity and bacterial community composition were observed between seasons, whereas we observed relatively weak differences between sites. Remarkable differences in the abundance of the bacterial community were observed at the phylum and genus levels across the different seasons. Stochastic processes dominated the assembly of bacterial communities in the aquaculture-influenced systems, and the assembly processes of bacterial community differed between seasons. Our observations highlight the effect of seasonality on bacterial communities and provide a more complete knowledge base for the proper assessment of the effects of aquacultural activities on freshwater ecosystems.

Seasonal temperature patterns and durations of acceptable temperature range in houses in Brisbane, Australia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Indoor temperature; Thermal comfort; Residential houses; Temperature pattern; Temperature sensors; k-Shape algorithm cluster analysis	LOW-ENERGY DWELLINGS; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; THERMAL COMFORT; SUMMERTIME TEMPERATURES; OCCUPANT BEHAVIOR; MOUTH-DISEASE; MORTALITY; HEAT; INDOOR; IMPACT	A paradigm shift to the use of indoor rather than outdoor temperature to estimate the exposure risk of low and high temperatures is vital for better prediction of temperature health effects and timely health warnings, and will also assist in understanding the influence of temperature on energy consumption and comfort. This study aimed to quantify the percentage of hours during the year that indoor temperature (living room) was in the extended comfort band (18-28 degrees C) of a subtropical climate, and identify the diurnal pattern of indoor temperatures in different seasons. Data used was collected in a previous study on the association between indoor and outdoor temperature. A k-shape cluster analysis resulted in two clusters of indoor temperature patterns for both weekdays and weekends. A bimodal pattern was identified during the cool season and a flat top pattern for the warm season, with many variations at weekends. These patterns can be attributed to the influence of cooling and heating processes depending on the season as well as occupancy, occupants' interference, and building materials. During the intermediate season, a sinusoidal pattern was observed for both weekdays and weekends because occupants likely relied on outdoor temperature conditions which were similar to those expected indoors without heating or cooling devices. The percentage of hours in which the indoor temperature of the houses ranged within the extended comfort band was 72-97% throughout the year, but for the coldest and hottest months it was 50-75%. These findings show that Brisbane residents are at possible risk of exposure to cold and hot temperatures due to the poor thermal performance of houses, and confirm that there is no standard indoor temperature pattern for all houses.

Soil fungal responses to experimental warming and drying in a Mediterranean shrubland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Biodiversity hotspot; Shrubs; Endophytes; Soil; Western Australia	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER RELATIONS; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY; DROUGHT; BACTERIAL; CARBON; FIRE; BIODIVERSITY; PERSISTENCE	Implications of a drying and warming climate have been investigated for aboveground vegetation across a range of biomes yet below-ground effects on microorganisms have received considerably less attention, especially in Mediterranean Type Ecosystems (MTE) that are predicted to be negatively impacted by climate change. We experimentally reduced rainfall and increased temperature across two contrasting study sites (deep sand dune vs shallows and swale) to test how projected future climate conditions may impact soil fungal composition, richness and diversity. We also assessed fungal OTU warming responses and putative functions of 100 most abundant OTUs and 120 OTUs that either increased or decreased based on their presence/absence across treatments. We found a significant effect of study site, treatment and canopy species on fungal composition. Soil fungal diversity increased under warming treatment in swale plots as compared to control plots indicating a positive effect of warming on fungal diversity. In dunes, significantly more OTUs responded to drought than warming treatment. Among the most abundant soil fungal putative functional groups were endophytes, ericoid mycorrhizas, yeasts and ectomycorrhizas consistent with previous studies. Plant pathogens were found to increase across dunes and swales, while ericoid mycorrhizae decreased. In summary, our study revealed that it is critical to understand belowground microbial patterns as a result of climate change treatments for our ability to better predict how ecosystems may respond to global environmental changes in the future.

In this field experiment we tested whether a single pulse exposure to a mixture of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which are commonly found in European inland waters, can influence the size distributions of natural lake phytoplankton communities. Size is one of the most influential determinants of community structure and functioning, particularly in planktonic communities and food webs. Using an in-situ microcosm approach, phytoplankton communities in two lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic) were exposed to a concentration gradient of the PPCPs mixture at five levels. We tested whether sub-lethal PPCPs doses affect the scaling of organisms' abundances with their size, and the slope of these size spectra, which describe changes in the abundances of small relative to large phytoplankton. Our results showed that a large proportion (approximately 80%) of the dataset followed a power-law distribution, thus suggesting evidence of scale invariance of abundances, as expected in steady state ecosystems. PPCPs were however found to induce significant changes in the size spectra and community structure of natural phytoplankton assemblages. The two highest treatment levels of PPCPs were associated with decreased abundance of the most dominant size class (nano-phytoplankton: 2-5 mu m), leading to a flattening of the size spectra slope. These results suggest that a pulse exposure to PPCPs induce changes that potentially lead to unsteady ecosystem states and cascading effects in the aquatic food webs, by favoring larger non-edible algae at the expense of small edible species. We propose higher susceptibility due to higher surface to volume ratio in small species as the likely cause of these structural changes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Biofilm facilitates metal accumulation onto microplastics in estuarine waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Plastic debris; Microplastics; Biofilm; Metal; Sorption	PLASTIC PRODUCTION PELLETS; TRACE-METALS; SURFACE-CHARGE; RESIN PELLETS; ADSORPTION; POLYMERS; RIVER; LIFE; BIOSORPTION; COMMUNITIES	In aquatic environments, plastic debris accumulates chemical pollutants from the surroundingwater, potentially altering the fate of xenobiotics in these ecosystems. The effects of biofouling on the potential for plastic to sorb environmental pollutants remain poorly understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that concentrations of metals are directly related to biofilm accumulation on microplastics submerged in natural estuarine waters. Two types of pre-production plastic pellets (polylactic acid (PLA) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE)) and glass pellets, were suspended for up to 28 days in an urbanized estuary (San Francisco Bay, California) to investigate how biofilm affects the accumulation of metals on these materials. During the initial weeks of the experiment, biofilm growth differed between locations, but after 28 days, PLA and LDPE had similar amounts of biofilm at the two field sites. Biofilm was the only significant predictor variable for Ba, Cs, Fe, Ga, Ni and Rb, and simple regressions of these metals after one month of submersion predicted much of the variability in the data (respective adjusted R-2 values: 0.46, 0.90, 0.86, 0.81, 0.87, 0.90; p < 0.001). For othermetals influenced by location or substrate material, multivariate analysis showed that increases in metal concentrations were predicted by increases in biofilm for Cu, Pb, Al, K, U, Co, Mg (p < 0.001) and Mn (p < 0.01). This work highlights the role of biofilm in facilitating metal accumulation on plastic debris and contributes to current understanding of the underlying processes that influence the behavior of microplastics as aquatic contaminants.

Nitrogen deposition sources and patterns in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem determined from ion exchange resin collectors, lichens, and isotopes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Throughfall N deposition; delta 15N; Lichens; Mountain ecosystem	MOUNTAIN NATIONAL-PARK; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; REACTIVE NITROGEN; CRITICAL LOADS; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; SULFUR; EMISSIONS; AMMONIA; RESPONSES	Over the past century, atmospheric nitrogen deposition (N-dep) has increased across the western United States due to agricultural and urban development, resulting in degraded ecosystem quality. Regional patterns of N-dep are often estimated by coupling direct measurements from large-scale monitoring networks and atmospheric chemistry models, but such efforts can be problematic in the western US because of complex terrain and sparse sampling. This study aimed not only to understand N-dep patterns in mountainous ecosystems but also to investigate whether isotope values of lichens and throughfall deposition can be used to determine N-dep sources, and serve as an additional tool in ecosystem health assessments. We measured N-dep amounts and delta N-15 in montane conifer forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem using canopy throughfall and bulk monitors and lichens. In addition, we examined patterns of C:N ratios in lichens as a possible indicator of lichen physiological condition. The isotopic signature of delta N-15 of N-dep helps to discern emission sources, because delta N-15 of NOx from combustion tends to be high (-5 to + 25 parts per thousand) while NHx from agricultural sources tends to be comparatively low (-40 to -10 parts per thousand). Summertime N-dep increased with elevation and ranged from 0.26 to 1.66 kg ha(-1). N-dep was higher than expected in remote areas. The delta N-15 values of lichens were typically -15.3 to -10% suggesting agriculture as a primary emission source of deposition. Lichen % N, delta N-15 and C:N ratios can provide important information about N-dep sources and patterns over small spatial scales in complex terrain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Express yourself: Individuals with bold personalities exhibit increased behavioral sensitivity to dynamic herbicide exposure	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Personality; Dynamic exposure; Anti-predator behavior; Behavioral ecotoxicology	ENVIRONMENTAL RISK-ASSESSMENT; CRAYFISH ORCONECTES-RUSTICUS; JUVENILE RAINBOW-TROUT; CHEMICAL ALARM CUES; PREDATOR RECOGNITION; AQUATIC ORGANISMS; ODOR PLUMES; ATRAZINE; FISH; RESPONSES	The majority of ecotoxicological studies performed measure average responses from individuals which do not account for the inter-individual variation in the responses of animals to environmental stimuli (i.e. the personality of individuals). Thus, these designs assume that all individuals will respond to contaminant exposure in a similar manner. Additionally, commonly used constant, static exposure regime designs neglect to recognize the spatial and temporal variation in contaminant plume structures as they move throughout fluid environments. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of the structural characteristics (concentration, duration, and frequency) of temporally and spatially variant contaminant plumes on the personality of individuals. This experimental design aimed to construct a sensitive definition of exposure by connecting sublethal effects of toxicants and realistic exposure regimes. This study used escape response of Faxonius virilis crayfish from the predatory odor of Micropterus saltnoides prior to and following exposure to the herbicide, atrazine. Atrazine was delivered in pulses to flow through exposure arenas for a total of 47 h while manipulating the concentration, frequency, and duration of the herbicide pulses. Escape response of crayfish prior to exposure was used to categorize animals into bold and shy personalities. The change in escape response was analyzed and resulted in a personality-dependent behavioral sensitivity to the polluted environment. Individuals classified as bold showed increased change in response to predatory odor relative to shy animals. Bold animals exhibited decreased activity after exposure where no change was presented in shy individuals. Shifts in individual behavior have impacts on the population level (e.g. resource acquisition/value; interspecies competition) and the ecosystem level (e.g. food web dynamics; trophic cascades). This study demonstrates the importance of sensitive measures in ecological risk assessment methods.

Despite the recognized significant impact of environmental noise on public health, mostly because of road traffic, until now noise has not been systematically included in LCA. Research has showed, however, that the addition of the impacts of noise could significantly change the interpretation of LCA results, specifically considering the importance of road transportation in the global economy. This paper proposes a method to calculate characterization factors (CF) for life cycle impact assessment of noise emissions from road traffic on human health. The method builds on up-to-date noise emission and propagation models. It was successfully tested on a demonstrative test bed case, which allowed us to identify the most suitable elementary flows, and draw the spatial variability of the CF and the associated uncertainties. Finally, the case proved that the consideration of noise could double the magnitude of the human health damages due to road transportation, which could significant affect policy decisions.

However, next to the wealth of studies describing the effect of rising growing season temperature on trees, much less is known about the concurrent effects of precipitation and snowpack dynamics on the other key component of alpine vegetation represented by prostrate life forms. Selecting the most widespread shrub species in the North Hemisphere, we assembled a monospecific (Juniperus communis L.) network of 7 sites overarching the European Alps, measured the annual growth on >330 individuals and assessed the climate-growth associations for the last century (1910-2010) adopting a new model estimating the solid fraction of precipitation from unique highly-resolved daily climate records. Despite the high space-time variability of the yearly precipitation amount and distribution across the region, our analysis found a prominent, consistent and negative role of winter precipitation for shrub growth. Moreover, this crucial role of snow is maintained even in recent years, despite the persistent and significant warming trend. The presence of this underrated key factor for Alpine long-lived vegetation will require a thorough consideration. For the prostrate life form, not only temperature but also the solid fraction of winter precipitation should be considered to improve the projections of future growth trajectories.

Neonicotinoid-treated seeds could be available to wildlife through spillage or exposed seeds near or at the soil surface due to incomplete or shallow drilling. We quantified seed spills that may occur during loading or refilling the hopper at a landscape-scale using road-based surveys. We also quantified undrilled seeds in 1-m(2) frames on the soil in the center and corner of fields to obtain estimates at the field scale. We broadcast seeds on the soil surface of a tilled field and left them for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 30 days to quantify the decrease of neonicotinoids under field conditions. Lastly, we documented wildlife at neonicotinoid-treated seed spills with trail cameras. We estimated the number of spills during planting to be 3496 (95% CI: 1855-5138) and 2609 (95% CI: 862-4357) for corn, 11,009 (95% CI: 6950-15,067) and 21,105 (95% CI: 6162-36.048) for soybean, and 830 (95% CI: 160-1500) and 791 (95% CI: 0-1781) for wheat in 2016 and 2017. respectively. Exposed seeds were present at the soil surface in 35% of 71 fields. The probability that seeds were present on the soil surface was higher for soybeans (18.8 and 49.4% in the center and corners, respectively) than for corn (1.6 and 2.7%, respectively), and seed densities were also higher (1.04 vs 0.07 seeds/m(2). respectively). Neonicotinoids decreased rapidly on seeds on the soil surface but persisted as long as 30 days. Over a dozen species of birds and mammals consumed seeds at simulated spills, with an average time for birds to find spills of 1.3 +/- 1.5 days and an average time to consumption of 4.1 = 3.4 days. Seeds are abundant on the soil surface for wildlife to consume during the spring planting season and should be considered in pesticide risk assessments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Will temperature increases associated with climate change potentiate toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of chloride on larval green frogs (Lithobates clamitans)?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Road salt; Runoff; Amphibians; Increased temperature; Multiple stressors	AMPHIBIAN POPULATION DECLINES; ROAD DEICING SALT; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; FRESH-WATER; EXPOSURE; DENSITY; BIOMASS; SALINIZATION; SENSITIVITY; PESTICIDES	An important challenge in amphibian ecotoxicology and conservation is that amphibian toxicity tests are usually focused on a single chemical while populations experience multiple, simultaneous stressors. For example, about 14 million tons of road de-icing salts are used each year in North America with NaCl accounting for 98% of total salt use and, hence, elevated chloride is an important environmental stressor to aquatic organisms, including amphibians. As well, higher temperature as a result of climate change is becoming an increasingly important environmental stressor. There are no data on the combined effects of chloride and temperature on amphibians hinders conservation efforts. We conducted field studies to characterize chloride concentrations and water temperatures in known amphibian breeding habitats and performed toxicity tests to explore impacts of these two stressors on a common anuran, the green frog (Lithobates clamilans). A 96-hour acute toxicity test was conducted to first determine a chloride LC50 (2587.5 mg Cl-/L) at a single, neutral temperature, which was used to inform the treatment levels of the sub-chronic test, which also included a temperature range. In the sub-chronic study. green frog larvae were exposed to three temperatures (18, 22, and 25 degrees C), and four concentrations of chloride (0. 500, 1000, and 2000 mg Cl-/L) for 35 days. At all temperatures, tadpoles exposed to 2000 mg Cl-/L had significantly higher mortality. While there was no significant effect of temperature alone on mortality, survival of tadpoles was significantly lower at 1000 mg Cl-/L at the two higher temperatures suggesting a potentiation of chloride ion toxicity with increasing temperature. Comparing toxicity results to field measurements of chloride and temperature suggests green frog tadpoles and other species with similar sensitivity are likely negatively affected. Data on additional species and populations would further increase our understanding of how salt and temperature may shape aquatic communities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Exploring determinants for the implementation of mixed TURF-aquaculture systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						TURFS; Aquaculture; Social capital; Chile; Livelihood diversification	TERRITORIAL USE RIGHTS; SCALLOP ARGOPECTEN-PURPURATUS; USER RIGHTS; SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS; FISHING COMMUNITIES; FISHERIES; COMANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; OPPORTUNITIES	Territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) have been highlighted as a means to deter the race for fish. Nevertheless, in many situations TURFs are not able to meet all their goals, jeopardizing their continuity. Here we explore one of several innovations on TURFS, mixed TURF-aquaculture systems, which can help overcome the challenges of maintaining sustainable socio-ecological systems. We analyzed the history of mixed TURF and small-scale aquaculture systems in Chile, particularly 8 recent learning platforms in the Coquimbo region. Additionally, we assessed the impact of 6 variables, from multiple spheres, on the implementation of mixed TURF-aquaculture systems. Despite low values in several variables, 75% of the learning platforms managed to implement aquaculture systems and 38% have been successful in developing monitoring efforts. Social capital was key in the implementation of the mixed systems. By investing in social capital policy makers can contribute to the successful implementation of mixed TURF-aquaculture systems, thus promoting a livelihood diversification strategy for fishing communities that encompasses the economic benefits of aquaculture with the socio-ecological benefits of TURFs. However, their development and enabling conditions must be monitored to embrace their synergies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impacts of experimental alteration of water table regime and vascular plant community composition on peat mercury profiles and methylmercury production	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Hg(II) methylation; Demethylation; Enriched mercury isotope; Soil; Climate change; Water table fluctuation	SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; METHYL-MERCURY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PEATLANDS; SULFATE; DECOMPOSITION; VEGETATION; ISOTOPES; CARBON	Climate change is expected to alter the hydrology and vascular plant communities in peatland ecosystems. These changes may have as yet unexplored impacts on peat mercury (Hg) concentrations and net methylmercury (MeHg) production. In this study, peat was collected from PEATcosm, an outdoor, controlled mesocosm experiment where peatland water table regimes and vascular plant functional groups were manipulated over several years to simulate potential climate change effects. Potential Hg(II) methylation and MeHg demethylation rate constants were assessed using enriched stable isotope incubations at the end of the study in 2015, and ambient peal total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentration depth profiles were tracked annually from 2011 to 2014. Peat THg and MeHg concentrations and the proportion of THg methylated (%MeHg) increased significantly within the zone of water table fluctuation when water tables were lowered, but potential Hg(II) methylation rate constants were similar regardless of water table treatment. When sedges dominate over ericaceous shrubs, MeHg concentrations and %MeHg became significantly elevated within the sedge rooting zone. Increased desorption of Hg(II) and MeHg from the solid phase peat into pore water occurred with a lowered water table and predominant sedge cover, likely due to greater aerobic peat decomposition. Deeper, more variable water tables and a transition to sedge-dominated communities coincided with increased MeHg accumulation within the zone of water table fluctuation. Sustained high water tables promoted the net downward migration of Hg(II) and MeHg. The simultaneous decrease in Hg(II) and MeHg concentrations in the near-surface peat and accumulation deeper in the peat profile, combined with the trends in Hg(II) and MeHg partitioning to mobile pore waters, suggest that changes to peatland hydrology and vascular plant functional groups redistribute peat Hg(II) and MeHg via vertical hydrochemical transport mechanisms.

Moreover, some of its biological traits (long life span, inshore feeding, high trophic position) make this species a suitable sentinel of coastal pollution. Here, we investigated contamination by multiple legacy and emerging organic pollutants, such as brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), in whitemouth croakers from two estuaries (Guanabara and Sepetiba Bays) located in industrialized and urbanized areas in Rio de Janeiro State, Southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we assessed how biological and ecological features could explain the observed contamination patterns. Regarding brominated flame retardants, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) varied from 7.6 to 879.7 pg g(-1) wet weight (w.w.), with high contribution of tetra-, penta-, hexa- and deca-BDEs. The sum of chlorinated flame retardants (dechlorane-related compounds, Sigma DRC) ranged from <LOD to 41.1 pg g(-1) w.w., mostly represented by Dechlorane 603 and Dechlorane Plus (DP). Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs varied from <LOD to 1.7 pg g(-1) w.w., while the Toxic Equivalent (TEQ-PCDD/Fs) levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 pg g(-1) w.w. Positive correlations between delta 15N and concentrations of tri-, tetra- and penta-BDEs, as well as Sigma DRC, DP and anti-DP isomers suggested that ecological factors (namely biomagnification along the food web) influence contamination of whitemouth croakers in the estuaries studied. Moreover, the sum of PBDEs (Sigma PBDE), tri- and tetra-BDEs concentrations were negatively correlated with fish size, suggesting that depuration by fishes and/or habitat shift throughout the whitemouth croaker's life cycle might also influence concentrations.

However, the distribution of biodiversity is spatially asymmetric among regions and lineages, and the extent to which PAs offer effective protection for species and ecosystems remains uncertain. Penguins, regarded as prime bioindicator birds of the ecological health of their terrestrial and marine habitats, represent priority targets for such quantitative assessments. Of the world's 18 penguin species, eleven are undergoing population declines, for which ten are classified as Vulnerable' or Endangered'. Here, we employ a global-scale dataset to quantify the extent to which their terrestrial breeding areas are currently protected by PAs. Using quantitative methods for spatial ecology, we compare the global distribution of penguin colonies, including range and population size analyses, with the distribution of terrestrial PAs classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and generate hotspot and endemism maps worldwide. Our assessment quantitatively reveals<40% of the terrestrial range of eleven penguin species is currently protected, and that range size is the significant factor in determining PA protection. We also show that there are seven global hotspots of penguin biodiversity where four or five penguin species breed. We suggest that future penguin conservation initiatives should be implemented based on more comprehensive, quantitative assessments of the multi-dimensional interactions between areas and species to further the effectiveness of PA networks.

Different sampling strategies have been proposed to efficiently allocate such limited resources (i.e. accessibility-based, stratified random and grid samplings), but their effectiveness may depend on the aim of the survey. Our aim was to assess which approach can provide the best trade-off between sampling costs and accuracy in estimating both single species distribution and species set composition. We generated simulated species distribution data to compare costs and performances of the three sampling methods in assessing species distribution. When we aim at measuring species range (i.e. area of occupancy or extent of occurrence), or obtaining baseline ecological data for conservation assessments (i.e. niche breadth), grid sampling usually provided the best trade-off between performance and costs at both the single- and multi-species levels. Otherwise, the stratified random sampling outperformed the other methods when we are interested in assessing the relative rarity (i.e. species frequency) of the species across the study area. Low quality distribution data can lead to heavily biased conclusions on biodiversity trends or impacts of environmental changes; our findings highlight that selecting the right sampling strategy is essential to obtain reliable estimates of both single species distribution and species set composition.

Contrasting patterns of decline in two arboreal marsupials from Northern Australia	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Arboreal marsupial; Comparative methods; Distribution; Disturbance; Mammal decline; Occupancy model; Petaurus ariel; Presence data; Trichosurus vulpecula	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; SMALL MAMMALS; FELIS-CATUS; EXTINCTION; RODENT; GLIDER; FAUNA; PETAURIDAE	Widespread declines of small- to medium-sized, semi-arboreal mammals in the drier regions of Northern Australia are of global concern. These declines have been variously attributed to either disruption of available resources or increased predation pressure. We aimed to clarify causes of mammal decline in Northern Australia using a comparative methods approach, examining historical changes in the distribution of two arboreal mammals, the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and the savanna glider (Petaurus ariel), and model drivers of their current abundance. We used single-season occupancy models to describe changes in the geographic range of P. ariel and T. vulpecula based on multiple-source occurrence data, from before and after 1993. We conducted spotlighting surveys in 2016 across the mesic savannas of the Northern Territory to identify environmental correlates of the current abundance of each species. Our results show that, within northwestern Australia, the geographic range (area where the probability of occupancy was >= 5%) has declined by 72% for T. vulpecula and 35% for P. ariel, between the historical and contemporary periods (before and after 1993, respectively). The abundance of each species varied substantially across the study area, but high T. vulpecula abundance was associated with high shrub density. We propose that areas with high shrub density are providing refuge for T. vulpecula, due to an increase in protection from predation by feral cats (Felis catus). Regardless of the driver, conservation management within Northern Australia should concentrate efforts on maintaining or increasing shrub abundance in tropical savannas. Our findings should also be viewed as an indicator of early stages of P. ariel decline and prompt targeted monitoring efforts.

Thinking green, circular or bio: Eliciting researchers' perspectives on a sustainable economy with Q method	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Bioeconomy; Circular economy; De-growth; Green economy; Q-method; Sustainability	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIOECONOMY; GROWTH; TRANSFORMATION; ENVIRONMENT; INNOVATION; COMPANIES; FORESTRY; PROJECTS; POLICIES	The continuous emergence of new ideas and terms simultaneously enables and impedes the advancement of sustainability, because of an increasingly complex conceptual landscape. This study aims at highlighting combinations of sustainability concepts (circular, green and bioeconomy) and of development models (growth, steady-state, degrowth) which selected researchers have considered priorities for pursuing sustainability transformations. Leading scholars working on sustainability issues were asked to rank 36 statements describing activities related to either circular, green, bio, growth, steady-state or degrowth economy. Using Q methodology, an exploratory approach to the identification of shared or diverging opinions, three archetypical perspectives were identified across the respondents: 1. circular solutions towards economic-environmental decoupling in a degrowth perspective; 2. a mix of circular and green economy solutions; 3. a green economy perspective, with an emphasis on natural capital and ecosystem services, and critical towards growth. Economic growth was perceived negatively across all perspectives, in contrast to the current lack of political and societal support for degrowth ideas. Neither did bioeconomy-oriented activities have support among the participating researchers, even though half of the respondents were working with bioeconomy issues, which are currently high on the political agenda. The lack of support for pro-growth and bioeconomy solutions are unexpected results given the current political discourses. While the results are not to be generalised beyond the sample, they provide valuable orientation for emerging and under-investigated research and policy directions. If bioeconomy policies are to be implemented on a broader scale, it seems worthwhile evaluating the acceptability of the bioeconomy agenda among various societal actors. Furthermore, our results point to the (still under explored) potential of formulating synergic circular, green and bioeconomy policies, possibly without a focus on economic growth.

Decreased N-2 fixation during reproductive phases may constrain seed nitrogen concentrations ([N]), reducing protein concentration of grain legumes. Plants grown under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2)) have greater water use efficiency. This may result in reduced use of conserved/ stored soil water, potentially helping to reduce soil water deficits later during grain filling. The extent that this process applies to drought sensitive grain legumes, which are extensively cultivated in Mediterranean environments is unclear. The objectives of this study were to investigate yield, N-2 fixation and seed N response of faba bean (Vicia faba L. cv. 'Fiesta') grown in a dryland Mediterranean-type environment under elevated [CO2]. Plants were grown in soil columns under ambient [COO ("400 ppm) or elevated [CO2] (e[CO2], (similar to)550 ppm) in a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility in the field. One sub-group was continuously well-watered (80% field capacity, FC), whereas a second sub-group was exposed to a drought treatment (water was withheld until 30% FC was reached, which was then maintained during the reproductive phases). Biomass, gas exchange, C-13 isotopic discrimination, N-2 fixation by the natural abundance 13N method, nodulation and soil water content were assessed throughout the crop developmental stages. Initially, plants grown under elevated [CO2] depleted soil water more slowly in the drought treatment than those under ambient [CO2], but as plants grown under elevated [CO2] produced more biomass they used soil water more rapidly, especially towards the critical pod-filling phase. Water savings during the first phase of the drought treatment, through flowering up to the start of pod-filling, were associated with increased yield ( + 25%) and N-2 fixation (+15%) under drought. Elevated [CO2]-induced stimulation of nodulation and nodule density helped maintain N-2 fixation under drought, even though nodule activity decreased under the combined effect of e[CO2] and drought from pod-filling onwards. This later stage decrease was associated with decreased carbohydrate and increased amino acid concentrations in nodules, indicating a down-regulation of N-2 fixation. Associated with the decrease of N-2 fixation during pod-filling, seed N concentration was lower under the combination of e[CO2] and drought. We propose a conceptual model to explain the importance of N-2 fixation during the grain filling stage to maintain seed N concentration under e[CO2]. These findings suggest that e[CO2]induced savings in soil water may mitigate negative effects of drought on yield and N-2 fixation of faba bean, without fully compensating the effect of prolonged drought on seed N concentration.

At the sites with less favourable conditions, the plasticity of fundamental drought adaptive traits can be exceeded under severe drought, even in well adapted species. In our study, anatomical and physiological adjustments to drought were studied in pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) growing on adjacent sub-Mediterranean plots (ecosites) differing in bedrock and soil type (limestone with rendzic leptosol, low water retention - L; transition from limestone to flysch with eutric cambisol, high water retention - F). In both years of the study, 2015 and 2016, in the part of the season with sufficient water supply, sap flow density (SFD) was higher in oaks growing on L than those growing on F. With decreasing soil water content (SWC) in July, SFD was reduced on both plots, most in trees growing on limestone. In the period of severe drought, SFD in trees growing on L was decoupled from the changes of VPD, due to increased employment of water conservation strategies, such as decreases in stomatal conductance. This was further translated into stomatal limitation of photosynthesis and contributed to reduced radial stem growth. The seasonal dynamics of traits indicate that Q. pubescens trees use a predisposed anatomical strategy (average size of vessels in different years), adjusted to average ecosite conditions. At the same time, trees respond to local conditions and interanual variability of drought by shortening/prolonging the production and growth of vessels and by adjusting leaf functioning (stomatal conductance, sap flow) in accordance with hydraulic properties.

Relationships between vegetation in student environments and academic achievement across the continental U.S	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Urban vegetation; Green space; Academic achievement; High school graduation rates; Reading proficiency; Mathematics proficiency	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; LAND-COVER CHANGE; GREEN SPACE; PERCEIVED RESTORATIVENESS; SCHOOL SURROUNDINGS; FOREST LANDSCAPES; CANOPY COVER; URBAN; HEALTH; BENEFITS	Recent studies suggest that vegetation in student environments can enhance academic achievement. Identified relationships vary, however, and our understanding of the links between urban nature and academic performance remains incomplete. This study broadens this understanding by investigating associations between vegetation and urban intensity in school attendance areas and high school reading and mathematics proficiency and graduation rates. We utilize a sample of schools from across the U.S. This study is the first to explore these relationships at this extent. We estimated relationships between these indicators of academic achievement and tree canopy cover, non-forest vegetation, agricultural vegetation, and urban intensity using negative-binomial, mixed-effects models. Models included indicators of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, poverty, and class size and state and ecoregion random effects to account for socioeconomic, political, and ecological factors that could influence achievement and vegetation abundance. We found no significant relationships between environmental variables and academic achievement indicators across the full sample. However, we did observe significant interactions between urban intensity and non-forest vegetation as well as between socioeconomic status and tree canopy cover. These interactions indicated a positive relationship between non-forest vegetation and graduation rate for schools in highly-urban settings, and a negative relationship between canopy cover and graduation rate for schools that serve primarily low socioeconomic status populations. These results indicate that the effects of some vegetation types on academic achievement vary with urban intensity and socioeconomic context. These findings also suggest that managing urban vegetation to support academic performance requires an understanding of population social and environmental context.

Previous studies reveal that cities can harbor a considerable biological richness, including endangered plant species. Yet, a key question on the urban contribution to plant conservation remains critically open, as little information is available on how populations of endangered plant species occur across different biotope types within cities and to what extent anthropogenically shaped vs. natural ecosystems provide habitats for endangered plants. We analyzed a unique dataset on the exact geographical position of 1742 populations of 213 endangered plant species in the city of Berlin. We first assessed the relative importance of Berlin's nine major biotope classes as habitats of these species. Second, we applied the novel ecosystem concept to quantify endangered plant populations for natural remnants vs. hybrid vs. novel ecosystems within Berlin. Populations of endangered plant species were generally, although unevenly, associated with specific biotope classes, with forest, grassland, and ruderal biotopes as the most important habitats. Surprisingly, novel ecosystems harbored the highest numbers of total populations, of total species, and of species that were exclusively confined to one type of ecosystem novelty. Quantifying the relative importance of biotope classes and novel vs. (near-)natural ecosystems as habitats of endangered species demonstrates that the urban contribution to biodiversity conservation is best ensured by providing a range of ecosystems. Rather than prioritizing only natural remnants, we thus argue for broad approaches to urban biodiversity conservation that include novel ecosystems.

Our work analysed land use/cover changes (LULCC) between 1985 and 2015 at 5 year intervals, to describe and understand the main processes and drivers of landscape change. LULCC were mapped using Landsat images and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), based on the Random Forests supervised algorithm. Over 30 years, we show a dichotomic trend for the two main land change trajectories: forest persistence and fast urban growth. We found only 8% of forest disturbance within the State Parks, while dense urban settlements grew 163% outside the park, mainly replacing rural uses. We estimate that all available land for human settlement may be occupied by 2030 as a result of this fast urban growth. Our study exemplifies a likely pattern of land use change for coastal regions, with fast urban growth driven by economic interests in transforming these regions into urban and touristic hubs, clashing with environmental policies for forest conservation and afforestation. The history of LULCC in the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State has resulted in several land use conflicts in the present, especially when considering fast urban growth versus a very large proportion of areas where no human settlement is permitted. This complex combination of drivers has led to rural depopulation and decrease in small-scale agricultural uses, reducing the diversity and functionality of the studied landscape.

Using GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Networks as a tool for modelling urban biodiversity	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						BBN; Bird; Invertebrate; Fragmentation; Model; Species richness	SPECIES RICHNESS; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; CIRCUIT-THEORY; ECOLOGY; CITIES; BIRDS; CONNECTIVITY; LANDSCAPE; COVER; ALIEN	The ability to predict spatial variation in biodiversity is a long-standing but elusive objective of landscape ecology. It depends on a detailed understanding of relationships between landscape and patch structure and taxonomic richness, and accurate spatial modelling. Complex heterogeneous environments such as cities pose particular challenges, as well as heightened relevance, given the increasing rate of urbanisation globally. Here we use a GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Network approach to test whether landscape and patch structural characteristics (including vegetation height, green-space patch size and their connectivity) drive measured taxonomic richness of numerous invertebrate, plant, and avian groups. We find that modelled richness is typically higher in larger and better-connected green-spaces with taller vegetation, indicative of more complex vegetation structure and consistent with the principle of 'bigger, better, and more joined up'. Assessing the relative importance of these variables indicates that vegetation height is the most influential in determining richness for a majority of taxa. There is variation, however, between taxonomic groups in the relationships between richness and landscape structural characteristics, and the sensitivity of these relationships to particular predictors. Consequently, despite some broad commonalities, there will be trade-offs between different taxonomic groups when designing urban landscapes to maximise biodiversity. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using a GIS-coupled Bayesian Belief Network approach to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales in complex landscapes where current data and appropriate modelling approaches are lacking, and our findings have important implications for ecologists, conservationists and planners.

Blacicwater collected from toilets contains high concentrations of organic matter, ideal for energy recovery using anaerobic digestion. Up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors treating conventional toilet (CT, 9 L water per flush) and vacuum toilet (VT, 1 L water per flush) blackwater with increments of loadings were successfully operated to steady state in three phases. The organic loading rates were maintained at comparable levels between the two reactors. The methanisation rates were 0.23-0.29 and 0.41-0.48 gCH(4)-COD/gfeedCOD in the CT and VT reactors, and the COD removal rates were 72% and 89%, respectively. The enriched microbial consortia and the community dynamics under different loading phases were compared. The rank abundance distributions and alpha-diversity showed that archaeal communities were predominated by mono-enrichments in both CF and VT reactors, while bacterial communities showed lower diversity in the VT reactor. Through principal coordinates analysis (beta-diversity), clear divergences of archaeal and bacterial communities between the CT and VT reactors were revealed, and the archaeal community developed at a slower rate than the bacterial community. The enriched archaea were hydrogenotrophic methanogens, Methanolinea in the CT reactor (56.6%), and Methanogenium in the VT reactor (62.3%). The enriched bacteria were Porphyromonadaceae in both CT (15.9%) and VT (13.4%) reactors, sulfate-reducing bacteria in the CT reactor, and Fibrobacteraceae in the VT reactor (13.8%). Links between enriched consortia and ammonia stress were discussed. isotope fraction analysis of the biogas showed a slight shift from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. A closer look into the predicted metagenomic functional profiles showed agreeing results, where hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and jhs gene abundances were higher in the VT reactor. We demonstrated that different blackwater types enriched different microbial consortia, probably due to ammonia concentrations and sulfate loadings, which should be taken into consideration for practical applications.

Most chemical-fate models assume that attenuation is directly proportional to the concentration of available dissolved organic carbon, and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in watercourses, but there are multiple evidences of saturation and even inhibition of attenuation at higher concentrations. Our current comprehension of nutrient attenuation kinetics in streams remains a limiting factor for the development and calibration of predictive models of the chemical fate of these compounds in rivers, thus hindering the development and implementation of more effective regulatory strategies. Here, we assessed the in-stream attenuation of dissolved organic carbon, inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-) and phosphorus (PO43-) compounds at increasing concentrations of these compounds, and analyzed the interaction between attenuation kinetics and biofilm structure and function. Specifically, the net balances of these compounds were assessed in artificial streams exposed to eight treatments following the gradient of WWTP contribution to the river flow (0, 14, 29, 43, 58, 72, 86, and 100% of WWTP effluent water). Results indicate that biological in-stream attenuation by a given biofilm of an effluent dominated watercourse might be saturated if exposed for short periods to high nutrient concentrations such as during combined sewer overflow events, but that communities can adapt if exposed long enough to high concentrations, therefore avoiding or at least minimizing saturation. More attention should be therefore given to the management of effluent-dominated watercourses, as reductions in the temporal variability of the discharged wastewater by WWTP might enhance attenuation and thus reduce water quality issues downstream.

However, monitoring is challenged by i) high spatiotemporal variability of contaminants in events of hard-to-predict durations, and ii) a large number of remote sites, which would imply enormous efforts with traditional sampling equipment. Therefore, we evaluate the applicability of passive samplers (Empore styrene-divinylbenzene reverse phase sulfonated (SDB-RPS)) to monitor a set of 13 polar organic contaminants. We present calibration experiments at high temporal resolution to assess the rate limiting accumulation mechanisms for short events (<36 h), report parameters for typical sewer conditions and compare passive samplers with composite water samples in a field study (three locations, total 10 events). With sampling rates of 0.35-3.5 L/d for 1 h reference time, our calibration results indicate a high sensitivity of passive samplers to sample short, highly variable sewer overflows. The contaminant uptake kinetic shows a fast initial accumulation, which is not well represented with the typical first-order model. Our results indicate that mass transfer to passive samplers is either controlled by the water boundary layer and the sorbent, or by the sorbent alone. Overall, passive sampler concentration estimates are within a factor 0.4 to 3.1 in comparison to composite water samples in the field study. We conclude that passive samplers are a promising approach to monitor a large number of discharge sites although it cannot replace traditional stormwater quality sampling in some cases (e.g. exact load estimates, high temporal resolution). Passive samplers facilitate identifying and prioritizing locations that may require more detailed investigations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the mitigation of viruses was investigated using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment prior to electrooxidation treatment using boron-doped diamond electrodes. This research is the first to investigate a sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment system for virus removal. Bench-scale, batch reactors were used to evaluate mitigation of viruses in variable water quality via: a) electrooxidation, and b) a sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train. Electrooxidation of two bacteriophages, MS2 and Phi X174, was inhibited by natural organic matter and turbidity, indicating the probable need for pretreatment. However, the electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train was beneficial only in the model surface waters employed. In model groundwaters, electrocoagulation alone was as good or better than the combined electrocoagulation-electrooxidation treatment train. Reduction of human echovirus was significantly lower than one or both bacteriophages in all model waters, though bacteriophage Phi X174 was a more representative surrogate than MS2 in the presence of natural organic matter and turbidity. Compared to conventional treatment by ferric salt coagulant and free chlorine disinfection, the electrocoagulation-electrooxidation system was less effective in model surface waters but more effective in model groundwaters. Sequential electrocoagulation-electrooxidation was beneficial for some applications, though practical considerations may currently outweigh the benefits. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Quantification of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in surface water: a risk assessment and molecular characterization	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						Cryptosporidium; Giardia; infection risk; QMRA; water supply	SAO-PAULO STATE; DRINKING-WATER; IDENTIFICATION; OUTBREAK; HOMINIS; PCR	This study aimed to estimate the annual probability of Giardia and Cryptosporidium infection for a population supplied by contaminated drinking water sources. Parasites were quantified by the USEPA Method 1623.1/2012. Annual risk was estimated using the quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach. Genotyping was performed using specific primers based on the 18S rRNA gene for Cryptosporidium and gdh gene for Giardia. Giardia was detected in 83.3% of the samples (<0.1 to 8.6 cysts/L) and Cryptosporidium in 37.5% (<0.1 to 2 oocysts/L). In general, annual risk values for Giardia were 1 log higher when compared with those obtained for Cryptosporidium. Giardia intestinalis A and B were present as well as C. hominis and C. parvum. The lack of protection measures for the water supply catchment point put the population's health at risk. The results provide data to support decision-makers to take actions to improve environmental quality resulting in a positive impact on consumers' health.	[Bataiero, M.

However, there are few systematic tests for determining what kind of spatial resolution and data combinations are needed and what the differences in mapping accuracy are when different datasets are omitted or included. We conducted 78 different object-based supervised random forest classifications on a patterned fen and its surroundings in Kaamanen, northern Finland, using remotely sensed optical imagery, topography, and vegetation height datasets from different platforms (unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aerial, satellite) with spatial resolution ranging from 5 cm to 3m. We compared differences in classification performance when we altered (1) classification and segmentation input data and features calculated from the data, or (2) the segmentation scale. We constructed training data with the help of transect-based field sampling and UAV imagery and tested classification accuracy using 412 field-surveyed vegetation plots. The most accurate classifications (75.7% overall accuracy) were obtained when we segmented a 5 cm resolution UAV image with a small segmentation scale and calculated features from all datasets. Classification accuracy was 2.2 percentage points (pp) lower with the most accurate aerial image (50 cm resolution) based classification, and 7.6 pp and 11.9pp lower with the most accurate WorldView-2 (2 m resolution) and PlanetScope (3 m resolution) satellite image based classifications respectively. Classification accuracies were low (46.7-56.0%) when we used only spectral data from one dataset. The inclusion of gray-level co-occurrence matrix textural features increased classification accuracy by 0.4-12.1pp and inclusion of multiple datasets by 8.2-25.0pp. Segmentation scale had a minor effect on classification accuracy (2.5-7.3pp difference between the finest and coarsest segmentation scale); however, both too small and large segmentation scale might lead to suboptimal classification. The differences in land cover type areal coverage were relatively small between classifications with multiple datasets, but if classifications included features from only one dataset, the differences were larger. We conclude that multiple different optical, topographical, and vegetation height datasets should be used when mapping vegetation in spatially heterogeneous landscapes, and that sub-meter resolution data (e.g. UAV or aerial) are necessary for the most accurate maps. Although UAV data is not essentially needed for classification, it is useful for training dataset construction and especially helpful in areas lacking other sub-meter resolution data.

Earth observation and social media: Evaluating the spatiotemporal contribution of non-native trees to cultural ecosystem services	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aesthetics; Plant invasion; Protected area; Remote sensing; Social media; Tourism	AESTHETIC VALUE; ECOTOURISM; FRAMEWORK; VALUES; BIODIVERSITY; INDICATOR; INVASIONS; SCIENCE; MAP	Understanding how non-material benefits from ecosystems, known as cultural services, are shaped by non-native biota is paramount to manage biological invasions and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite recent advances, assessments of cultural services still lack an explicit temporal dimension, which is relevant for developing monitoring systems. Here, we evaluate the spatiotemporal contributions of non-native trees to landscape aesthetics and nature recreation in a National Park in Portugal. We use a multimodel framework to understand how those cultural services (evaluated from social media photos) relate to the environmental context (physical and visual accessibility, and wilderness; derived from ancillary GIS data) and landscape visual-sensory features (colour diversity, landscape heterogeneity, and vegetation functioning). The latter were computed from satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors) for the four seasons of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. We found that, during Autumn, contributions of non-native trees prevailed mostly in landscapes with greater colour diversity (green-band, Sentinel 2). During Spring, their contributions prevailed in landscapes with lower wilderness and heterogeneous levels. In Winter, those contributions were less evident in more remote areas. As for Summer, no significant relations were found for those cultural contributions. These results are congruent with the phenology of dominant tree species: deciduous natives occurring with coniferous non-natives and evergreen invaders, leading to higher colour diversity in Autumn, versus the dominance of blooming invaders in accessible areas during Spring. Results also seem to match the seasonal dynamics of touristic demand in the National Park: the pursuit of wilder areas for ecotourism in Winter, versus the experience of popular recreational activities in Summer. We discuss the usefulness of Earth observations in the research of cultural services and, particularly, for supporting SDG targets 15.8 (on invasive species), 8.9 (touristic revenues) and 12.8 (nature awareness).

Summer crop sequences consisted of corn and soybean monoculture and corn-soybean rotation. Winter crops were corn, millet, pigeon pea, grain sorghum, and crotalaria. Treatments consisted of combinations of three summer crop sequences with five winter crops. Sixteen assessments of FCO2, soil temperature, and soil moisture were carried out under the remaining straw from the combination of summer sequences and winter crops over a 51-day period. Subsequently, soil physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes were assessed at depths of 0-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m. The experiment was conducted in strips in a randomized block design with three replications. The multivariate analysis showed that the characterization of the pattern of FCO2 and other soil attributes as a function of the management with summer and winter crop residues differed according to the soil layer. In the 0.10-0.20 m layer, no difference was observed between treatments. However, the contents of clay, organic matter, sum of bases, microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase and amylase enzyme activity, and humification index of organic matter in the most superficial soil layer (up to 0.10 m) contributed to characterize differences in FCO2. Therefore, FCO2 variation is more influenced by soil microorganisms and the management in the most superficial layer. Soil attributes such as organic matter, enzyme activity, and biomass carbon had a higher influence on FCO2 dynamics in the 0-0.10 m layer, while soil density became a significant factor in FCO2 variation in the subsurface layer (0.10-0.20 m). Strategies such as soil management under no-tillage systems can be considered very efficient because, regardless of the residues generated by different crops, it contributes significantly to reduce FCO2, assisting in mitigating greenhouse gases in agriculture. Further studies on soil metagenomic analyses with quantification of functional genes related to carbon cycle will allow establishing direct relationships between FCO2 and microbiota dynamics and soil management since microbiota is the most sensitive bioindicator to changes in the environment.

Nevertheless, academia has generally considered conservation and use of forest resources to be incompatible. We describe the spatial configuration of MCFR, evaluate floristic and structural characteristics of woody vegetation present in selected reserves, and identify social norms that govern use and conservation of MCFR. These reserves largely consist of mature vegetation (80% of total cover); their plant structure is similar to that of the surrounding tropical sub-deciduous forest; and they house a large number of endemic species. The MCFR studied contain a total of 146 tree species and cover 11% of the study area, which includes at least 140 villages in the north-central part of the Yucatan Peninsula. These reserves are collectively managed and conserved by Mayan peasants in the interest of the common good. The communities in our study area combine conservation and use of forest resources, and we recommend that in public policy, government agencies and NGOs incorporate MCFR as a model of biological conservation and sustainable natural resource use, taking into account traditional knowledge and local norms that allow these reserves to function in a sustainable manner.

Coastal erosion management falls into soft and hard shoreline stabilization options with the United States tending to favor hard. However, post-Hurricane Sandy 2012, soft dune and beach replenishment have become more favorable in the U.S. with support being necessarily contingent upon an understanding of the pros, cons, and concepts surrounding each management strategy. Misconceptions could thus lead to a halt in progress and poor decisions with implications for community safety. We sought to gain a better understanding of current knowledge surrounding best practices in coastal management communities. Our assumption was that misconceptions in one coastal area, New Jersey, are likely echoed in other coastal areas in the U.S. and internationally. We employed a two-phase research design with an exploratory phase using semi-structured interview guidelines to collect data from a quota sample of 53 local residents and then tested the distribution of knowledge about coastal management facts by asking a convenience sample of 300 residents a structured set of 15 questions. Study participants identify differences in how beaches are managed and how protected they conversely consider an area to be. Dunes are generally preferred over hard engineering and replenishment. However, many key concepts regarding how dunes function naturally, with regards to the role of vegetation and fencing, are poorly understood suggesting a need for greater education surrounding these topics. Participants support continued tax investment in coastal areas to avoid retreat but recognize a tragedy of the commons in such actions for future generations. Learning who knows what, may contribute to more fruitful dialogues among stakeholders to pave the way for the adoption of suitable and sustainable management practices for better protected shorelines.

To enhance the collection of recyclables materials, local authorities and waste management companies invest considerable resources in planning. While the planning of these centres requires a comprehensive understanding of collected solid waste, only limited studies have consistently investigated waste data from HWRC. To fill this knowledge gap, historical data for HWRC from the Greater Copenhagen, Central Zealand, Silkeborg and Djursland in Denmark were analysed with regards to temporal and geographical variation. The results showed the mass of collected waste varies seasonally; this trend was consistently seen during the period 2010-2016. Moreover, the data revealed that the total waste collected was principally driven by the number of visitors. The geometric bar plot and ternary plot depicted an increase in the percentage of recyclable materials, whereas the percentage of incinerated waste decreased during the period 2010-2016. The waste characterisation study indicated that about 7% of small miscellaneous combustible waste was brought in black plastic bag, although these bags were forbidden; the results suggest that the percentage of misplaced recyclable materials could considerably decrease if citizens bring their waste in clear plastic bags.

Testing sorption behavior with DOM is more representative of the environmental conditions and mercury speciation expected during in-situ remediation efforts. Isotherms were fit using a robust, iterative re-weighting scheme. This fitting approach improves upon the traditionally used indirect sorption method by removing the dependence between aqueous and solid phase concentrations in isotherm fitting. Developed isotherms show that without DOM, BC, TS, and SM adsorbed similar amounts of MeHg while OC-199 sorbed substantially less MeHg. Below an equilibrium concentration of 5.6 ng L-1 BC was the best performing sorbent, between 5.6 and 20.9 ng L-1 SM sorbed the most MeHg, and above an equilibrium concentration of 20.9 ng L-1 TS outperformed the other sorbents. BC and OC-199 showed indication of MeHg sorption saturation over the tested concentration range of 3.5-680 ng L-1. With DOM, SM outperformed the other sorbents at equilibrium concentrations less than 0.98 ng L-1 and TS was the superior MeHg:DOM sorbent at higher concentrations. MeHg:DOM sorption was controlled by DOM-sorbent interactions. DOM decreased MeHg sorption onto BC and SM whereas TS exhibited similar sorption with and without DOM. OC-199 had slightly higher MeHg uptake with DOM. East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC), an industrially Hg contaminated site, was used as a case study example to build a relationship between aqueous and fish MeHg concentrations and subsequently compare the cost of sorbent materials required to meet regulatory objectives. For this case study, SM provided the most cost-effective sorbent option for in-situ remediation efforts to reduce aqueous MeHg concentrations.

We tested the hypothesis that lichens exposed inside a nylon cover with mesh size of 1 mu m accumulate less heavy metals than lichens exposed without any cover. To this purpose, thalli of the lichen Evernia prunastri were transplanted for three months along a busy road of the urban area of Siena (Central Italy), with half of the samples exposed inside a nylon cover with a mesh size of 1 mu m. The content of Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Zn was measured by ICP-MS before and after the exposure. The results showed that samples exposed inside the nylon cover accumulated a lower amount of most chemical elements and that Sb, along with Cd and Cu were the main traffic-related elements in the study area. Differences in element uptake were not caused by differences in sample vitality caused by the experimental procedure. Using a conversion factor it was possible to estimate element deposition rates for PM1 and PM > 1. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Utility-scale solar energy facilities - Effects on invertebrates in an arid environment	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						CSP parabolic trough; Invertebrate abundance; Invertebrate diversity; Solar energy; Habitat loss	RENEWABLE ENERGY; ECOLOGICAL TRAPS; IMPACTS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; ORTHOPTERA; MORTALITY; RESPONSES; PANELS; GREEN	Attempts to reduce carbon emissions have seen a growth in renewable energy developments globally. "Green" alternatives also have impacts for biodiversity, but few studies assess the effects of solar energy facilities on invertebrate communities. We investigated effects of a concentrated solar power (CSP) trough facility on invertebrate communities in the arid Northern Cape province of South Africa. Epigaeic and flying invertebrates were sampled using pitfall and sticky traps in three habitats: solar field, power block and surrounding rangeland. There were no significant differences in abundance or order richness in either epigaeic or flying invertebrate communities across the three habitats. Shannon diversity was significantly lower in rangeland plots for epigaeic invertebrates, and significantly greater in solar field for flying invertebrates. Despite the lack of significant differences in order richness or abundance, community composition of both invertebrate groups differed significantly between habitats, but the two habitats within the plant only differed for epigaeic invertebrate assemblages. Differences in invertebrate densities and composition demonstrate an effect of construction of the facility on invertebrate communities. While facilities may have relatively small footprints, the rate at which the industry is expanding internationally suggests that further research on impacts and mitigation measures is needed.

Patches and inter-patches are the fundamental hydrological units, and their properties can be scaled up to describe ecohydrological functioning at the hillslope or catchment levels. The objective was to compare ecohydrological properties at the patch level in relation to ground cover and at the vegetation type level using landscape function analysis (LFA). Runoff and sediment production were measured in vegetation types of rosetophilous desert shrubland, microphyllous desert shrubland, and crassicaulescent shrubland. Inter-patches (cover = 12.54% +/- 2.35% SE) had the highest runoff rates and sediment production, while medium coverage patches (cover = 43.68% +/- 2.37% SE) and dense cover patches (cover = 83.56% +/- 2.48% SE) produced less runoff and sediments. Runoff, sediments and landscape organization were similar between vegetation types. High litter and stone fragment cover and low soil bulk density were associated with low runoff and sediment production. The LFA infiltration and stability indices explained 10 and 19% of the variability of infiltration and sediment production, respectively. Our results show that vegetation types function similarly, but the hydrological and erosional responses of patches and inter-patches are fundamental to supporting ecohydrologically-based management and restoration plans.

Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) represents the most exported species. This is the first comprehensive survey of anthropogenic (Cs-137, Sr-90, Pu-238, Pu-239,Pu-240 and Am-241) and natural (K-40, Ra-226, Ra-228, Pb-210, Po-210) radionuclides in farmed salmon and manufactured fish feed from Norway. The only anthropogenic radionuclide detected in salmon and fish feed was Cs-137. The levels were low with arithmetic means in salmon and feed of 0.13 and 0.30 Bq/kg fresh weight (fw), respectively. The natural radionuclide 40K exhibited the highest levels with arithmetic means in salmon and feed of 115 and 239 Bq/kg fw, respectively. The arithmetic means of Po-210 and Pb-210 in salmon were 0.013 and 0.044 Bq/kg fw, respectively, with a mean Po-210:Pb-210 activity ratio of 0.32. For fish feed, the situation was reversed: the arithmetic means of Po-210 an Pb-210 were 3.8 and 0.67 Bq/kg fw, respectively, with a mean Po-210:Pb-210 activity ratio of 5.7. The radionuclide levels found in farmed salmon in the present study are comparable to or lower than the levels found in other fish species in the North Atlantic Ocean. A highly conservative dose estimate for consumption showed that doses were no higher than 1.2 mu Sv/year for toddlers and 4.0 mu Sv/year for adults. This suggests that the risk associated with radioactivity in farmed salmon is very low even when considering individuals with high consumption and the highest radionuclide levels found in this study.

To understand the possible reasons for the persistence of these pollution "hotspots", we investigated the case of the Krakow region (S Poland) known for its heavy pollution caused by a large steelworks. In 1975, at the apogee of industrial emissions, atmospheric deposition of trace metals was evaluated in this area using moss Pleurozium schreberi as a biomonitor. The survey was repeated in 1992, 1998 and 2014. The collected data showed that air quality improved significantly over 40 years: the amount of Cd, Pb, Fe, Cu and Zn accumulated by mosses decreased by a factor of 10, 9, 3.5, 2 and 2, respectively. The downward trend continued for most metals throughout the study period, although the biggest changes occurred at the very beginning (1975-1992). This improvement was mostly due to drops in industrial production and the introduction of environmentally friendly technologies. At the end of the study (1998-2014), clear increases in the concentrations of some trace metals in moss were observed (overall or at some locations). Spatiotemporal variability of moss elemental composition suggests that this is the result of the recent emergence of new (non-industrial) sources of metal pollution, associated with the urban sprawl and intensification of agriculture. Since this process is unlikely to stop in the near future, air quality will deteriorate rather than improve. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that it induces oxidative stress and endocrine disruption; however, limited data are available regarding the effects of furan on the reproduction of mammals. In the present study, an in vitro experiment was designed to investigate the direct effects of furan exposure on oxidative stress and testosterone concentration in rat testicular tissue. Furan not only generated high oxidative stress but also decreased antioxidant enzyme activity in the testicular tissue. On the basis of in vitro study results, an in vivo sub-chronic exposure study was performed. Male rats were orally exposed to different concentrations of furan (0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg kg(-1)). An increase (P < 0.05) of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and of the lipid profile (cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL) in higher dose treatment groups of furan was observed, while total protein content and antioxidant enzyme activity were considerably decreased after furan exposure. Also, plasma and intratesticular testosterone concentrations were reduced in high-dose treatment groups. Sperm parameters such as sperm viability, sperm count, and sperm motility showed a decrease (P < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological findings revealed significant alterations in testis and epididymis tissues. These results confirm that furan can induce toxic effects on the reproductive system of male rats.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) appear attractive to adsorption of many substances, but CNTs adsorbed with toxic substances becomes a nanocomposite still more toxic. Here, we employ zebrafish embryos as biosensor to examine how a hybrid micro/nanostructured carbonaceous material (HMNC) derived from a combination of activated carbon (AC) with hydrophilic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can remediate waste-water contaminated with the pharmaceutical fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLX). AC and HMNC are practically non-toxic to zebrafish embryos (LC50 > 1000 mg.L-1). HMNC addition to culture medium containing FLX significantly reduces sublethal effects and lethality. Interaction between FLX and HMNC involves chemical adsorption such that embryo co-exposure to HMNC adsorbed with FLX in the range of concentrations evaluated herein does not elicit any behavioral changes in zebrafish.

In Scotland these have been formalised as Ecosystem Health Indicators. Indicators work best where there is a direct link between what is measured and environmental change; changes in indices of species diversity or abundance provide alerts to environmental change but do not in themselves provide evidence of mechanisms. An alternative approach is to replace species occurrence data with species habitat or attribute values to create an indicator that links changes in species occurrences to environmental drivers. A series of indicators based on biological recording data, Ellenberg habitat preference values and mean climate niche was created by taking all records for bryophytes in Scotland (522187 records, 1960-2016) and analysing changes in mean attribute values through time for each 10 kmx10 km grid square. The resulting mean attribute values were analysed at the country level and showed clear quadratic (humped) trends for Ellenberg Nitrogen (N) and Reaction (R), an index of environmental acidity. There are linear decreasing trends for Ellenberg Light (L) and Precipitation, and linear increasing trends for January and July Temperature. Ellenberg Moisture (F) showed a clear trend, but it was not interpretable and appeared influenced by recording effort. Disaggregating to region was partly successful, but reduced samples sizes meant that for many regions the national trend was not significant. Ellenberg N and the two Temperature indices appear to be useful indicators as they are interpretable and performed better in the downscaling. Changes in L were also interpretable, but it performed poorly in downscaling to regional values. Ellenberg R appeared to be driven by changes in N as the two values are highly correlated across species. The downward trend in Precipitation ran counter to increases in rainfall suggesting that temperature driven evaporation is more likely to be driving changes in bryophyte distribution and whilst the indicator performed well it is difficult to explain to non-experts. Opportunistically collected data, like plant records, have great potential to be employed as indicators, especially as citizen scientists are involved and state resources can be used for data archiving and analysis. Also, conversion to attribute values removes many of the biases brought by differences in recorder effort and it directly links changes in species occurrences to environmental drivers.

Functional data analysis of multi-species abundance and occupancy data sets	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Biodiversity indicators; Butterfly; Citizen science data; Functional principal component analysis; Multi-species indices; Procrustes analysis	UNITED-KINGDOM; BIODIVERSITY; INDICATORS; INDEX	Multi-species indicators are widely used to condense large, complex amounts of information on multiple separate species by forming a single index to inform research, policy and management. Much detail is typically lost when such indices are constructed. Here we investigate the potential of Functional Data Analysis, focussing upon Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), which can be easily carried out using standard R programs, as a tool for displaying features of the underlying information. Illustrations are provided using data from the UK Butterflies for the New Millennium and UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme databases. The FPCAs conducted result in a huge simplification in terms of dimensional reduction, allowing species occupancy and abundance to be reduced to two and three dimensions, respectively. We show that a functional principal component arises for both occupancy and abundance analyses that distinguishes between species that increase or decrease over time, and that it differs from percentage trend, which is a simplification of complex temporal changes. We find differences in species patterns of occupancy and abundance, providing a warning against routinely combining both types of index within multi-species indicators, for example when using occupancy as a proxy for abundance when insufficient abundance data are available. By identifying the differences between species, figures displaying functional principal component scores are much more informative than the simple bar plots of percentages of significant trends that often accompany multi-species indicators. Informed by the outcomes of the FPCA, we make recommendations for accompanying visualisations for multi-species indicators, and discuss how these are likely to be context and audience specific. We show that, in the absence of FPCA, using mean species occupancy and total abundance can provide additional, accessible information to complement species-level trends. At the simplest level, we suggest using jitter plots to display variation in species-level trends. We encourage further application to other taxa, and recommend the routine augmentation of multi-species indicators in the future with additional statistical procedures and figures, to serve as an aid to improve communication and understanding of biodiversity metrics, as well as reveal potentially hidden patterns of behaviour and guide additional directions for investigation.

Beetle ecological indicators - A comparison of cost vs reward to understand functional changes in response to restoration actions	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Beetles; Conservation entomology; Ecosystem restoration; Functional traits; Mulligans Flat - Goorooyarroo Woodland; Experiment; Phylogeny; Species traits	HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; BODY-SIZE; DIVERSITY; TRAITS; PLANT; ASSEMBLAGES; MANAGEMENT; GRASSLAND; CARABIDAE	Ecosystem restoration can play a vital role in conserving biodiversity, but its effectiveness can be difficult to assess for hyperdiverse biota such as insects. Species traits of insects can be used to understand their functional responses to restoration, but their use often requires considerable effort, and few studies have examined what additional insight can be gained from this approach. We used a spatially and temporally controlled restoration experiment to examine beetle species, grouped by flight ability, family membership and feeding guild, as indicators of ecosystem functional change. We tested for the effects of reduced vertebrate grazing on beetle assemblages sampled from two different microhabitats (next to log and in open ground) one year prior and two years after a vertebrate grazing treatment was applied. We compared the responses of the different beetle functional groupings, and then related these to the effort involved in employing these indicators. We found that beetle species traits gave several functional insights into their responses to reduced grazing, including responses to changes in vegetation structure and biomass. Species richness indicators and abundance indicators of beetle functional groups showed similar responses in many cases, whereas biomass indicators gave additional insights related to the extra biomass of vegetation and detritus resulting from the reduction in grazing. We found that most results were revealed by using family groups as indicators for functional change. This is because the traits that often define beetle families, such as size, flight ability and feeding guilds each have distinctive functional roles, allowing a link from family to function, and supporting the idea that phylogeny is often a useful shortcut to species ecology. We conclude that in our study system, the least-cost approach to identifying functional responses of beetles to reduced vertebrate grazing, and possibly other restoration actions, is to use abundance indicators of the most common family groups.

Several studies have shown changes in odonate species richness and/or community composition in response to deforestation, suggesting their potential as bioassessment tools in the tropics. However, former approaches using Odonata as an indicator group required comparative samples from differently disturbed sites and/or knowledge of the focal species environmental specificity. Here, we tested a robust, adult-based bioassessment method assuming that the level of tropical forest degradation reflects the proportional representation of the taxa above species. Based on Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases, we used data from previously published studies linking odonate assemblages to human-mediated disturbances in tropical forests. We hypothesized that along a disturbance gradient (from primary forest to non-forest), (i) the proportion of the suborder Zygoptera (mostly habitat specialists sensitive to deforestation) will decrease in favor of the suborder Anisoptera (high proportion of generalists); and (ii) the proportions of largely generalist families Coenagrionidae and Libellulidae will increase at the expense of other Zygoptera and Anisoptera, respectively. Our results revealed that a ratio of Zygoptera/Anisoptera is a poor indicator of tropical forest conditions, probably because of ecological diversity within these groups. However, the proportions of Coenagrionidae/other Zygoptera and Libellulidae/other Anisoptera significantly increased along a disturbance gradient, suggesting their potential to be a good indicator of well-preserved, altered, and heavily degraded forest habitats. Therefore, our results are in line with studies presenting the usefulness of adult Odonata as versatile indicators for assessing human-mediated changes in tropical forest environments, supporting the practical use of this group in biological monitoring.

Using common vs. rare dung beetles and ants, we test how species rarity shapes richness patterns across a timber plantation mosaic with remnant natural grassland conservation corridors as a mitigation measure. We then determine how environmental and spatial factors shape assemblage composition of common and rare grassland species, and how matrix-derived species influence these patterns. For each taxon, species were ranked from common-to-rare, and from rare-to-common. This ranking gave sequences of species richness patterns for increasing numbers of species. Along each stage of these two sequences, species richness of the sub-assemblage was correlated with that of the whole assemblage. This was repeated with matrix-derived species excluded. Deconstructing the species response matrices according to species traits, variation in composition of common vs. rare grassland specialists, as well as in matrix-derived species, were related to environmental (natural environmental heterogeneity and habitat quality) and spatial factors. For both taxa, common species reflected overall species richness patterns better than rare species. Matrix-derived species reduced the contribution of rare species to species richness patterns of dung beetles. Environmental variables were relatively more important for rare species than for common species composition, especially rare ants. We found that in a fragmented landscape: 1) common species reflect overall species richness patterns better than rare species, 2) overall species richness patterns do not reflect those of rare species, 3) the relative influence of regional-and local-scale factors are determined by an organism's scale of life function, 4) rare species are especially affected by habitat quality, 5) knowledge of ecological processes governing communities in landscape mosaics are crucial for conserving grassland species diversity within these corridors.

We examined the influence of: weather conditions, hatching date and brood size on nestling sex ratio in the black stork Ciconia nigra. We used molecular methods to determine the sex of 284 nestlings. Samples were collected during a 12-years study in central Poland. The overall nestling sex ratio was skewed towards females (61%), which are smaller, and presumably easier to raise than males. Delayed hatching date significantly increased the proportion of female nestlings. Warmer temperatures in the pre-breeding season were correlated with lower proportions of males. This is probably mediated by the influence of weather on water levels in black stork foraging sites. The second most important weather trait was total rainfall in May, the month in which the majority of nestlings hatch. Total May rainfall was negatively correlated with the percentage of male offspring. We used blood haemoglobin concentration as an indicator of body condition in a subsample of 122 nestlings. The males from the study population had lower blood haemoglobin concentrations, indicating their poorer body condition and supporting the hypothesis that they are the more vulnerable sex. We also observed that blood haemoglobin concentration of nestlings is lower in late broods. Deteriorating body condition of late offspring can explain the observed increase in female nestling proportions in delayed broods.

Species distribution models (SDMs) have been regarded as an effective tool to examine the impacts of climate change on species' potential distribution. In this study, we developed a SDM for a marine fish, the Japanese whiting Sillago japonica by using records of its occurrence and five predictor variables (ocean depth, distance to shore, mean sea surface temperature, salinity, and currents velocity) and predicted its habitat suitability for current conditions and under scenarios of future climates. The SDM suggests that ocean depth, distance to shore, and temperature are the three most important predictor variables determining the distribution of S. japonica. Our SDM accurately predicted the current distribution of the species, with values of true skill statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve above 0.95. Under future climate scenarios, the suitable habitat of S. japonica is predicted to become smaller in size and to shift northward. Differences between climate change scenarios for 2040-2050 and 2090-2100 showed that this species will lose more suitable habitat as climate change progresses over time. Future fisheries management strategies should take this range contraction and associated northward shift into account.

The absence of evidence-based systematic overviews on this topic motivated us to perform meta-analyses and to synthetize the present state of knowledge. We observed significant heterogeneity among individual case studies, reporting negative, neutral and positive effects. As expected, urbanization had an overall negative effect on the diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates. These results are based mainly on the study of lotic (stream and river) ecosystems because there are insufficient data available for lentic (pond and lake) ecosystems. Compared to individual case studies, the present review reports an evidence-based synthesis for the first time. We identified knowledge gaps regarding case studies reporting the effects of urbanization on pond and lake ecosystems, case studies examining the phylogenetic and functional facets of biodiversity, as well case studies investigating the effect of urbanization on the beta diversity component of macroinvertebrate communities. The identification of these knowledge gaps allowed us to make recommendations for future research: (1) report results on specific taxonomic groups and not only the entire macroinvertebrate community, (2) study the impacts of urbanization on macroinvertebrate diversity in different habitat types and understudied continents, (3) focus on the functional and phylogenetic facets of diversity and (4) examine community differentiation (e.g. beta diversity) in urban freshwater ecosystems. Our results also suggested that the analysis of diversity-environment relationships is crucial for developing macroinvertebrate indicators especially in the increasingly urbanized world.

The study collected 77 variables with 30 years record, for a set of 48 sites, interpolated to create raster files at 30m spatial resolution. After applying Pearson correlation analyses to eliminate redundant variables, nine variables were found to have strong positive predictive value for estimating stream flow at ungauged sites. Nine prediction rasters portraying spatial variation of stream flow for the study region at three key index months during wet, dry, and average rainfall conditions. The predictive power of the variables was tested and cross validated over a subset of data not included when building the model. Model validation by site at monthly temporal resolution showed mixed results. While some sites where accurately predicted others did not. The comparison of observed vs predicted values by month suggest that this statistically based approach is able to predict the general patterns of stream flow at the regional scale, however it may be inaccurate in estimating actual flow values by month since the models tends to under-predict monthly discharge.

Integrating different approaches in the analyses of structure and diversity in these forests can provide complementary information on non-spatial, spatial and functional diversity patterns. The study aimed at evaluating the spatio-temporal dynamics in forest structure and diversity in a semi-natural mixed oak-hornbeam floodplain forest. All standing trees were mapped and inventoried in 1995, 2005 and 2016 in three 1-ha mixed forest stands, with different soil moisture regime (xeric, mesic, moist conditions). Traditional, non-spatial structure and diversity measures were coupled with spatially-explicit and functional diversity measures. Results indicated that the three stands showed limited variation in stand structure and similar non-spatial diversity attributes, despite the different species composition. Only the extension to spatial and functional analyses was able to reveal more pronounced differences of diversity patterns, as higher complexity, species mingling, and functional tree complementarity was observed in the moister stand. These findings support use of spatially-explicit measurements in traditional inventory measurement protocols to allow more refined analysis of diversity patterns. On the other hand, functional diversity can be easily implemented in diversity analyses, as it requires species abundance information (which is traditionally collected in forest inventory) and species-specific tree traits which can be inferred from literature.

Current niche approaches involving stable isotope analysis (SIA) have been used to clarify niche population and community dynamics, mainly through carbon and nitrogen signatures in organisms modeled in an isotopic delta-space. We modeled over a thousand delta C-13 and delta N-15 samples from six intertidal rocky reefs, three in oceanic islands and three in mainland coastal habitats, to test whether island reef communities follow the prediction of ecological release and vacant niche theories and exhibit higher niche width, resource exploitation and trophic diversity if compared to mainland communities. Additionally, we used an endemic island species to verify if, as hypothesized, niche was conserved along the evolutionary history of the species in relation its mainland sister species. Our results indicate that niche width (standard ellipse area), resource exploitation range (delta C-13 range) and trophic heterogeneity were higher in island communities in comparison to mainland communities. We found that the niche of island endemic species was more similar to the niche of mainland sister species than to the niche of confamiliar sympatric species suggesting that island endemic species have retained their ancestral niche. Niche expansion processes in island populations commonly occurred in response to ecological release effects, which are associated with lower biotic resistance (competition and predation pressure) in depauperate island communities. Although niche expansion by competition release is well-known for island terrestrial fauna, to this day evidence for marine organisms, mainly at a community-scale, had remained weak. Based on our results island communities may be prone to biological invasions into vacant niches promoted by anthropogenic activities. More research is needed to understand how potential invasions can affect island intertidal reef communities.

To fill this research gap, the whole district was ecologically explored for the collection of field data from August 2014 to July 2016. For vegetation studies, a total of 16 altitudinal transects comprising 110 sampling stations (samples) with 990 plots were studied by using a stratified random vegetation sampling method. Different multivariate statistical tools including Monte Carlo permutation test, Indicator species analysis, hierarchical clustering, ordination, variation partitioning and multi-response permutation procedures tests were used for the first time for the study area to elucidate the number of significant vegetation groups, ranking and placement of plant species in these groups, classification of vegetation units, detection of important gradients, importance of groups of environmental variables and pairwise compositional differences of the species groups respectively. The results showed that all the recorded 343 plant species belong to seven significant plant associations which were further placed into 5 major forest types. Out of the total 19 variables studied, CCA detected the significant contribution of the majority (simple effects: 12; unique effects: 8) of them. The latter (unique effects) in descending order included altitude, forest cover, deforestation, community maturity, forest density, latitude, slope aspect, and longitudinal variations. Similarly, variation partitioning results depicted that topography was the leading driver affecting vegetation distribution, followed by the biotic and edaphic factors. The forest edges, especially the sub-alpine ecosystem, were most diverse, supported higher tree density and also faced maximum deforestation pressure. Furthermore, rangelands in the temperate to alpine zones were affected by heavy overgrazing. Due to the disrupted local ecosystem functioning, the study area needs proper management and conservations plans to save its biodiversity wealth in this part of western Himalaya.

Although these rapid assessment methods use a combination of metrics to rate overall ecological condition, they rarely include tests of either the merits of the component metrics being assessed or the method of aggregating the metrics into an overall rating. We used a conceptual model of ecological integrity for wetlands and field data to select and test 15 rapid assessment indicators (using specific metrics) across a spectrum of major ecological factors or MEFs (landscape, buffer, vegetation, hydrology, soil). We applied these metrics to 220 wetland sites across six states (Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Washington), using two assessment area (AA) approaches: 106 sites used 0.5 ha point-based AAs; 114 sites used variable-sized polygon-based AAs. We statistically tested metric ratings and factor scores for their discriminatory power (DP) in relation to a stressor index using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and for redundancy using Spearman rank correlation and scattergrams. Of the 15 metrics, 12 had good or strong DP and were not redundant. Across all metrics, only two pairs (vegetation pair and buffer pair) were strongly correlated. The soil metric had the lowest DP, but it was among the least redundant of any metric. The DP of buffer metrics was lower for point-based approaches than for polygon-based approaches because the buffer for point-based AAs often included additional wetland area. Aggregating individual metrics into MEF scores (e.g., vegetation, hydrology, soil), primary factors scores (Landscape Context, on-site Condition) and overall ecological integrity ratings, either maintained or improved the interpretability of the ratings. Our analyses support the use of 12 rapid field-based metrics, spanning Landscape Context and on-site Condition, to assess the ecological integrity of wetlands. Although tested here for wetlands, the models and metrics are also being applied to upland terrestrial ecosystems. Our findings confirm the merits of our rapid assessment method in providing an intermediate level of assessment that is efficient and ecologically meaningful, within states and across watersheds and regions.

It is crucial to determine the restoration status of wildlife in afforested forests to effectively monitor biodiversity conservation and the self-sustainability of forest ecosystems, as well as to effectively guide the implementation of afforestation projects in the future. China has the largest area of manmade forests around the world, but the effects of the restoration efforts on the faunal diversity in artificial woodlands are unclear. Here, we evaluated the effects of afforestation practices on small mammals in two types of planted forests: Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi, an introduced species) and China Armand pine (Pinus armandii, a native species) plantations, and two reference forests: young- and old-growth forests, at the community, population, and individual levels. The diversity of small mammals did not differ significantly among the four forest types and the population densities of small mammals in two plantations were between the young- and old-growth forests. Collectively, our findings indicated that small mammal assemblages had reestablished in afforested forests. Four body condition indices were measured in the Chinese while-bellied rat (Niviventer confucianus), a predominant species, and differences were found between afforested and reference forests. Chinese while-bellied rats had the lowest body masses and highest endoparasite loads in the Japanese larch planted forest, while body length or carcass mass did not differ among the four forest types. In comparison, study rats had slightly lower body masses and lower endoparasite loads in the China Armand pine planted forest than reference forests. These findings indicated that small mammals inhabiting both types of afforested forests had poor body conditions but these trends were worse in the Japanese larch planted forest, i.e., the introduced species. Given that afforestation is a widespread practice for global forest landscape restoration, we propose two suggestions to guide afforestation efforts and the subsequent management thereof: (1) native species rather than exotic species are preferable for use in afforestation projects, and (2) wildlife diversity in afforested forests should be considered when monitoring the restoration and management of degraded forest ecosystems.

The study area is located in the municipality of Descoberto, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and has one hectare in the process of restoration through the planting of seedlings. The forest inventory of all individuals with Circumference at Breast Height (CBH) >= 15 cm was carried out and the phytosociological parameters were evaluated. The study area shows a high floristic diversity H' = 3.258 as well as equability (J' = 0.783), evidencing that the study area is floristically heterogeneous and has low ecological dominance. In addition, this area presented floristic similarity to other restored areas that were already in a more advanced restoration process. Considering soil quality, the restored study area shows higher levels of cation exchange capacity (t), approximate sum base values (SB) and base saturation (V) than those verified in nearby areas. Evaluating the successional characteristics (greater presence of individuals of secondary succession) and the domain of species with dispersion by animals, we can infer that the area is in an advanced stage of restoration, as well as performing its environmental and social functions. Thus, we can conclude that the restoration of mined areas is feasible when the restoration techniques are applied correctly. Furthermore, we can say that these successful restoration measures are improving the environmental sustainability and helping considerably the recovery of losses caused by mining.

In this study, we hypothesize that tree species abundance distribution is determined by the commonness-rarity balance of species during tropical forest recovery through natural regeneration. We sampled 45 20 m x 50 m plots across three sites in secondary forests with different stand ages (5, 10, 15, and 20 years) after shifting cultivation, and an old-growth forest (> 100 years old) located in the Northern Amazon forest, Venezuela. We explored the variations in woody species abundance distribution and compositional similarity using a chronosequence approach. There was a clear pattern of increasing species abundance in forest successions, from second-growth to old-growth forests. Species abundance in the old-growth forest was much higher than in the second-growth forest. The niche-preemption model showed a high goodnessof-fit to the 5-year old second-growth forest, while 10- and 15-year old second-growth forests and the old-growth forest showed a significant fit to the lognormal model. Along the species-rank axis, the most common species accounted for 54% of the total proportional abundance at the earliest successional stage (5-year old), whereas the relative proportion of the most common species remained relatively stable at 22%-25% in the following successional stages (i.e., old-growth forest). Species dominance was lower in old-growth forest than those in second-growth forest, where there were seven species with the highest importance values within the community. There were obvious differences in relation to the old-growth forest, where rare species were present. The results we present here are crucial for designing and implementing proper, goal-oriented forest restoration strategies, and should aid future research.

Aquatic mesocosms exposed to a fungicide in warm and cold temperate European climate zones: Long-term macroinvertebrate response	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Pyrimethanil; Ecoregions; Environmental risk assessment; Trophic functioning; Taxonomic composition	RISK-ASSESSMENT; PYRIMETHANIL; PESTICIDES; ICE; STRESSORS; COMMUNITY; IMPACT; SOIL; TOOL	At present, the European Union legislation facilitates the use of similar pesticides among European Member States, thereby assuming that biodiversity and ecosystems have equal sensitivities to contaminants throughout the whole of Europe. However, with this assumption, fundamental environmental and biological differences between climatic zones are being ignored in Environmental Risk Assessment. Such differences may strongly influence the behaviour of contaminants, their effects on biodiversity and on the natural functioning of ecosystems. Furthermore, toxicity testing in European ecoregions other than cold-temperate has largely depended on standardized tests using cold-temperate species and conditions, which may lead to a false estimation of risks to organisms from other ecoregions. The present study aim was to determine the response of freshwater macroinvertebrate communities to the fungicide pyrimethanil by conducting aquatic mesocosm experiments in two different ecoregions with different climates: cold-temperate (Frankfurt, Germany) and warm-temperate (Coimbra, Portugal). The results indicate that the community in the cold-temperate climate was more sensitive to the fungicide in comparison to the warm-temperate community. This difference was most likely related to a different rate of fungicide disappearance, which was slower in the colder climate. Based upon our results we discuss important implications for improving Environmental Risk Assessment across climate zones and under present-day global climate change scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the structural stability requirements of infrastructure such as sidewalks, roadways, and parking areas, urban soils are commonly characterized by high compaction levels, low porosity, and nutrient deficiency, often to the detriment of urban tree health. By transmitting surface loads to a compacted subbase, suspended pavement systems create a matrix of uncompacted soil that promotes tree health through increased root access to oxygen, water, and nutrients. Recently, interest has grown in making suspended pavement systems multi-functional by designing them to act as subsurface bioretention practices in ultra-urban areas where space may be limited due to concentrated development and high land costs. Despite this interest, only one study has tested suspended pavement systems in this application. Further, the study utilized lined installations to allow a controlled water quality assessment; however, this negated the ability to fully quantify runoff reduction. Two unlined suspended pavement systems designed to function as subsurface bioretention practices were installed in Knoxville, Tennessee, USA, in 2015 and monitored over 27-months. During that period, over 99% of runoff volumes were reduced by the free-drained north system, which completely captured runoff from 79% of storms. The underdrained south system reduced influent runoff by over 88% and captured all runoff from 83% of events during the study. Influent TSS concentrations were significantly reduced by the south suspended pavement system, though no other significant differences between influent and effluent pollutant concentrations were observed, presumably due to low influent concentrations. This study demonstrates the viability of field-scale suspended pavement systems in a stormwater management application and illustrates the hydrologic and pollutant removal capabilities of these systems to manage urban stormwater runoff.

Capacity for bioreactors and riparian rehabilitation to enhance nitrate attenuation in agricultural streams	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Agricultural land-use; Denitrification; Greenhouse gas; Nitrate-nitrogen flux; Tile drainage; Denitrifying woodchip bioreactor	DENITRIFYING BIOREACTORS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; DENITRIFICATION BIOREACTORS; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; TILE DRAINAGE; LAND-USE; RESTORATION; SCALE; FIELD; PERFORMANCE	Globally, small agricultural waterways fed by springs, tile drains, and seeps can disproportionately contribute to downstream nutrient loading, which is associated with declines in water quality and ecosystem functions. Treating nitrate using a multiple tool, multiple-scale approach in small waterways could offer improved management of these sources. We used a before-after-control-impact design to test the suitability of three small (< 30 m(3)) edge-of-field denitrifying woodchip bioreactors and stream bank re-shaping and riparian planting. Over three-and-a-half-years, riparian rehabilitation enhanced nitrate flux attenuation compared to pre-rehabilitation, but only under relatively low flow conditions. In comparison, there were no significant changes in nitrate flux in a control waterway under any flow condition. N fluxes always increased in both the control and treatment waterways when reaches gained water downstream. Nitrate removal efficiencies for all three bioreactors ranged from < 10 to > 99%, with performance variations due to short residence times and fluctuations in source water chemistry. A single tile drain bioreactor removed 0.41 kg NO3-N d(-1), equivalent to similar to 10% of the mean daily tile drain nitrate load. Greenhouse gas fluxes from the tile drain bioreactor were similar to the surrounding pasture (CO2-C mean: 185-286 mg Cm-2 h(-1); N2O-N mean: 49-90 mu gNm(2) h(-1)), suggesting no negative impacts from the bioreactor. Overall, our results suggest a multiple-tool, multiple-scale application of rehabilitation tools can reduce downstream N fluxes, but only under certain flow conditions. Thus, local rehabilitation tools, like those trialed here, will need to be scaled appropriately if they are to significantly attenuate nutrient losses from small agricultural waterways. Moreover, these will not replace catchment-scale nutrient plans to address losses from land and legacy groundwater N pollution.

Metered consumption data of electricity, gas and water are collected and stored for each household in Australia and provide a valuable source of information for researchers hoping to understand the patterns of consumption and improve resource utilisation. This work tests the assumption that these datasets are sufficiently 'clean' to allow interrogation and details the common errors encountered. An inspection of 1-7 years of meter readings of electricity, gas and water for similar to 60,000 households in Canberra, Australia as well as all datasets of the local government's energy and water efficiency programs, found this not to be the case. Common errors found include: missing data, biases in erroneous data, errors generated by the data custodians, duplicate entries, the effect of different custodian objectives and of poor data constraints (free flowing text).

Larval amphibians rapidly bioaccumulate poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Anura; Bioaccumulation factor; Body burden; Caudata; Ecotoxicology; Uptake rate	PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID PFOA; POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS; PER/POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; WATER; TRANSPORT; TOXICITY; FATE; FOOD; ENVIRONMENT	Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous contaminants that can bioaccumulate in aquatic taxa. Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to contaminants and sensitive to endocrine disruptors during their aquatic larval stage. However, few studies have explored PFAS uptake rates in amphibians, which is critical for designing ecotoxicology studies and assessing the potential for bioaccumulation. Uptake rates of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were measured for larval northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), American toads (Anaxyrus americans), and eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) during a 240-h exposure to 10 and 1000 mu g/L concentrations. We measured body burden and calculated bioconcentration factor (BCF) every 48 h during the experiments. For all species and exposures, body burdens often reached steady state within 48-96 h of exposure. Steady-state body burdens for PFOA and PFOS ranged from 3819 to 16,481 ng/g dry weight (BCF = 0.46-2.5) and 6955-489,958 ng/g dry weight (47-259 BCFs), respectively. Therefore, PFAS steady state occurs rapidly in the larval amphibians we studied and particularly for PFOS. This result reflects a high potential for PFAS trophic transfer because amphibians are often low in trophic position and are important prey for many aquatic and terrestrial species.

We developed and applied an innovative approach for regional parameterization, and calibration of the CENTURY ecosystem model. We quantified spatio temporal variation of soil organic carbon stock (SOC) and above ground plant biomass production (AGB) and examined their responses to the recent climate change across a diverse range of native grassland systems in Alberta, western Canada. The simultaneous integration of SOC and AGB into calibration and analysis accounted for most of the spatio temporal variability in the SOC and AGB measurements and resulted in reduced simulation uncertainty across nine grassland regions. These findings suggest the importance of the systematic parameterization and calibration for the reliable assessment of carbon-related ES across a wide geographic area with heterogeneous ecological conditions. Simulation results showed a pronounced variation in the spatial distribution of SOC and AGB and their associated uncertainty across grassland regions. Under baseline grazing intensity regime, an overall negative effect of recent climatic changes on the SOC, and a less consistent effect on the AGO were found. While, an overall positive or slightly negative impact of recent climate change on the SOC and AGB was found under a proposed 10% lower grazing intensity regime. These heterogeneities in the magnitude and direction of climate change effects under different grazing regimes suggest needs for a range of climate change adaptation strategies to maintain carbon-related ES in Alberta's grasslands. The modeling framework developed in this study can be used to improve the spatially explicit assessment of carbon-related ES in other geographically vast grassland areas and examine the effectiveness of alternative management scenarios to ensure the long-term provision of carbon-related ES in grassland systems.

The objectives of this experiment were to study the effects of biochar and biogas digestate versus mineral fertilizer on crop above-ground biomass as well as fractions and mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC). Samples of a sandy Cambisol were taken 14 months after establishment of a field experiment in Germany. Treatments included application of equal nitrogen in the form of mineral fertilizer or liquid biogas digestate without biochar (B-0), with 1 Mg biochar ha(-1 )season(-1 )for two growing seasons (B-2), or with 40 Mg biochar ha(-1) application (B-40). Soil fractionation in water separated water-extractable and free particulate (fPOM) OM, followed by sonification and sieving to isolate occluded particulate (oPOM) and <20 mu m aggregate-occluded and mineral-associated OM. CO2 emissions were measured during 92-day laboratory incubations at 10 and 20 degrees C. Analysis of variance found digestate lowered (p < 0.05) rye aboveground biomass compared to mineral fertilizer (9.3 vs. 10.6 Mg ha(-1)), while biochar had no effect. B-40 treatments increased C mineralization during incubation by 16% and contained 3.8 times more SOC than B(0 )treatments. This additional SOC was allocated to IPOM (52%), oPOM (22%), and the <20 mu m fraction (26%). Digestate application increased SOC content of oPOM by 11% compared to mineral fertilizer. Furthermore, combined application of 40 Mg biochar ha(-1) with digestate resulted in 20% more SOC in the <20 mu m fraction than biochar with mineral fertilizer. The lack of a significant fertilizer or biochar-fertilizer interaction effect on C mineralization during incubation demonstrates the stability of SOC from digestate alone or in combination with biochar. The absence of significant differences in SOC content between B-0 and B-2 treatments demonstrates the difficulty of documenting SOC sequestration in the field at low biochar application rates.

One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47%) between the bias-reduced (spatial crossvalidation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.

Based on the cradle-to-farm-gate LCA results of the tomato in Rwamagana district in Rwanda commissioned by the European Union, the main objectives of the paper were to validate statistically the differences in environmental impacts among expert-based types for this crop based on location and season and identify the key-drivers of these impacts. The study was developed thanks to two intensive field visits and a survey of 15 plots. The functional unit was one kg of tomato at farm-gate. Combining several statistical analyses allowed identifying three groups of plots with contrasting input profile and eco-efficiency. For most impact categories, the first group with mainly plots in marshland during wet season had the lowest impacts and the third group with plots in hillside showed the highest impacts. The yield of tomato being significantly different between marshland and hillside plots was an important driver of these results. The second group composed of plots in marshland during the dry season generally showed intermediate impacts due to the withdrawing of water for irrigation. The second group obtained a higher freshwater ecotoxicity due to a more intensive use of toxic insecticides. The factorial analysis for mixed data (FAMD) confirmed the importance of the location and the season for the eco-efficiency of tomato plots and the hierarchical clustering on principle components (HCPC) separated the tomato plots into three clusters. The generalized linear models (GLMs) validated the differences in the environmental impacts per kg of tomato between the clusters. The principal component analysis (PCA) combined to GLM revealed that only the use of water was significantly different between the three groups. Compared to existing datasets, all groups showed high freshwater ecotoxicity impacts due to the use of toxic insecticides and the excessive use of mancozeb. The third group also showed a high freshwater eutrophication in relation to P losses due to erosion and low yield. From a methodological point of view, we demonstrated in this paper that using expert-based typologies combined with adapted statistical analyses constituted a relevant approach under such circumstances.

Overall median CO2 fluxes were 7.28; 6.40 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) from the soakaway and control soil, respectively. Overall median CH4 fluxes were - 0.28; -0.67 nmol CH4 m(-2) s(-1) from the soakaway and control soil, respectively. While CO2 fluxes expressed strong diurnal variability driven by soil temperature. CH4 fluxes were less affected by environmental factors and effectively limited to the first few meters from the septic tank. However, localised CH4 degassing events were observed during drying conditions with up to 60-times higher fluxes compared to the overall median. The soakaway was found to be a net emitter of both CO2 and CH4, releasing a total of 7.327 kg CO2 yr(-1) and 0.033 kg CO2Eq. yr(-1), respectively. The apparent spatio-temporal heterogeneity of observed soil gas fluxes identified in this study emphasises the importance of integrating measurements with both high spatial and temporal resolution from on-site installations as engineered nature-based solutions.

Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners.

In this study, we investigate the soil microbial community response to heavy metal contamination at Liberty State Park (LSP), an urban brownfield in Jersey City, NJ, USA. Heavy metal contamination of the soils at LSP is heterogeneous, varying widely across site and among metals. We collected soils along a previously mapped gradient of metal contamination at LSP and sampled soil from a local and uncontaminated reference site (Hutcheson Memorial Forest (HMF)) for comparison. For all soils, we measured soil heavy metal concentrations, soil organic carbon content, bacterial density, and extracellular phosphatase activity as a proxy of ecosystem functioning. Additionally, we analyzed the microbial community composition using high-throughput sequencing. Data show that some sites within ISP have significantly higher phosphatase activity compared to HMF, indicating that some heavily contaminated ISP soils are highly functional. We also found that soil organic carbon and bacterial density have a significant and positive relationship with phosphatase activity. The microbial community analyses showed that the bacterial communities were sensitive to heavy metals and that the composition was significantly affected in particular by copper, zinc, and lead. The fungal communities, however, did not vary significantly with heavy metals. Our results shed important light on the composition and functioning of urban brownfield soils. A deeper understanding of these unique ecosystems is required for successful re mediation, restoration and urban sustainability.

Measurement-based assessment of the regional contribution and drivers of reduction in annual and daily fine particulate matter impact metrics in Paris, France (2009-2018)	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Fine particulate matter; Air pollution; Air quality monitoring; Chemical climatology; Paris; Trends	AIR-QUALITY; POLLUTION EPISODES; EUROPEAN CITIES; PM2.5 LEVELS; AEROSOLS; TRANSPORT; MODEL; PM10	Health effects from long- and short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have resulted in an annual average PM2.5 standard across Europe and World Health Organisation guidelines for annual (10 mu g m(-3)) and 24 h PM2.5 concentrations (25 mu g m(-3)). Developing strategies to reduce both annual and 24 h average PM2.5 requires that the conditions that produce the magnitude of these metrics are understood. This paper presents a standard and replicable set of statistics that link the magnitude of annual and daily PM2.5 metrics to variation in i) hourly PM2.5 concentrations, ii) geographic regions traversed by air mass back trajectories, and iii) the 'urban increment' and 'regional contribution' to urban PM2.5 concentrations. These statistics are calculated between 2009 and 2018 at monitoring sites across Paris and the Ile-de-France region, France, where there is a national objective to achieve the WHO annual PM2.5 guideline, and where short-term PM2.5 episodes still occur. The aim is to investigate changes in the conditions producing annual average, and 24 h PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 25 mu g m(-3,) and how these long- and short-term metrics could be reduced further. The statistics indicate that reductions between 2009 and 2018 in both annual PM2.5 concentrations (PM2.5AA, -0.79 mu g m(-3) y(-1) averaged across 3 urban background sites (33% average 2009-2018 reduction)) and the number of days with 24 h PM2.5 concentrations above 25 mu g m(-3) (D24h25, -6 days y(-1) (62% average 2009-2018 reduction)), were driven by reductions in local emissions in Paris and the Ile-de-France region. For example, reduction in PM2.5AA and D24h25 were greater at urban traffic sites, and between 2009 and 2018 the highest hourly PM2.5 concentrations occurred less frequently during rush hour periods, while the lowest hourly PM2.5 concentrations occurred more frequently during the day. In addition, when relatively moderate and high hourly PM2.5 concentrations were measured, air mass back trajectories spent more time (during the 4 preceding days) over European geographic regions, compared to the ocean indicating an increased relative contribution from regional transport to these hourly PM2.5 concentrations. Consequently, there is now a greater difference in the contribution of different hourly PM2.5 concentrations to annual and 24 h PM2,5 compared with 2009, with relatively high hourly PM2.5 concentrations having a larger contribution to D24h25, and moderate hourly PM2.5 concentrations having a larger contribution to PM2.5AA. Strategies to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in Paris should consider how mitigation measures will affect different ranges of hourly PM2.5 concentrations to understand the (potentially differing) effect on long- and short-term PM2.5 impact metrics. Comparison of hourly PM2.5 concentrations at urban sites and upwind rural sites showed regional contributions to PM2.5AA of approximately 50% and 70% at urban traffic and urban background sites, respectively. The largest regional contributions were also estimated for the highest hourly PM2.5 concentrations, compared to moderate hourly PM2.5 concentrations. Regional emission reductions could therefore make a substantial contribution to achieving the WHO air quality guidelines in Paris.

Short-term responses of greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem carbon fluxes to elevated ozone and N fertilization in a temperate grassland	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Air pollutant; Fertilizer management; Ground level O-3; Plant-soil feedbacks; Soil nutrient cycling	MEDITERRANEAN ANNUAL PASTURES; BOREAL PEATLAND MICROCOSMS; SUB-ALPINE GRASSLAND; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; N2O EMISSIONS; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; METHANE EMISSIONS; EXTRACTION METHOD; SOIL-NITROGEN	Growing evidence suggests that tropospheric ozone has widespread effects on vegetation, which can contribute to alter ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics and belowground processes. In this study, we used intact soil mesocosms from a semi-improved grassland and investigated the effects of elevated ozone, alone and in combination with nitrogen (N) fertilization on soil-borne greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem C fluxes. Ozone exposure under fully open-air field conditions was occurred during the growing season. Across a one-year period, soil methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions did not differ between treatments, but elevated ozone significantly depressed soil CH4 uptake by 14% during the growing season irrespective of N fertilization. Elevated ozone resulted in a 15% reduction of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide, while N fertilization significantly increased ecosystem respiration during the growing season. Aboveground biomass was unaffected by elevated ozone during the growing season but significantly decreased by 17% during the non-growing season. At the end of the experiment, soil mineral N content, net N mineralization and extracellular enzyme activities (Le., cellobiohydrolase and leucine aminopeptidase) were higher under elevated ozone than ambient ozone. The short-term effect of single application of N fertilizer was primarily responsible for the lack of the interaction between elevated ozone and N fertilization. Therefore, results of our short-term study suggest that ozone exposure may have negative impacts on soil CH4 uptake and C sequestration and contribute to accelerated rates of soil N cycling.

Identifying the ecological drivers of arid and semiarid Patagonian waterbodies is a critical requirement for planning action to conserve these still poorly understood habitats. We tested the responses of alpha and beta diversity of invertebrates (presence-absence, abundance, and biomass) to local, landscape, and climatic features, in 45 Patagonian freshwater bodies classified in three groups: isolated ponds, connected ponds, and lotic systems. We first compared the invertebrate community compositions of the different waterbodies. Secondly, using a co-inertia analysis we assessed the relative roles of local, landscape and climatic factors in driving variation in assemblage composition. Finally, we compared different facets of beta diversity and modelled their responses to environmental variables (predictors), by generalized dissimilarity modelling (GDM). Unexpectedly, lotic systems with a total of 109 taxa, were richer than lotic ones, but isolated ponds contributed most to beta diversity and supported more unique and proportionally more endemic species. Alpha and beta diversity were mainly driven by local features and secondly by climatic descriptors. However, these patterns shifted according to different community composition measures. Collectively, our results suggest that isolated ponds have a higher biodiversity value and would be more vulnerable than connected ponds and lotic systems to environmental changes. However, all waterbody types contributed to gamma biodiversity, reinforcing the importance of conserving a diversity of freshwater ecosystems in any landscape and particularly in arid and semiarid Patagonia. Our findings are a first step to resolving and quantifying the amount of changes occurring in Patagonian waterbodies, and are a prerequisite for predicting changes in species distributions in the face of global change.

Quantifying this threat is particularly difficult and complex, especially when evaluating multiple species with different ecological requirements. Here, we examine the semi-enclosed basin of the Mediterranean Sea where the inputs of plastic pollution and its impact on marine diversity are still widely unknown. Eighty-four species from six taxonomic classes were evaluated to assess the risk of ingesting plastic marine debris, integrating inter-specific factors such as plastic exposure rates and life history traits (e.g., motility, habitat, and body size). Species were modelled within a spatial context to identify and estimate their exposure to plastic ingestion across the Mediterranean Sea using literature data, species distribution maps and plastic dispersion models. Our approach identified hotspots for the risk of plastic ingestion across multiple taxa in the Mediterranean Sea, highlighting that coastal species are at higher risk of ingesting plastic in the marine environment than open-sea species. The plastic exposure analysis indicated that species with larger home ranges were more at risk of exposure with increased distances while local species were more likely to be exposed to plastic closer to the centre of their home range location. The approach used in this study can be applied to support management and mitigation efforts throughout the Mediterranean Sea and in other geographic regions to minimize the impact of plastic pollution on marine diversity.

Effects of brownification and warming on algal blooms, metabolism and higher trophic levels in productive shallow lake mesocosms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						DOC; Climate change; Cyanobacteria; Phytoplankton; Fish; Macroinvertebrates	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; SMALL FOREST LAKES; FRESH-WATER; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; CLIMATE; MATTER; COMMUNITIES; NUTRIENTS; PHYTOPLANKTON; TEMPERATURE	An increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland waters has been reported across the northern temperate region but the effects of this on whole lake ecosystems, often combined with other anthropogenic stressors like nutrient inputs and warming, are poorly known. The effects of these changes on different component of the ecosystem were assessed in an experiment using twenty-four large (30001) outdoor mesocosms simulating shallow lakes. Two different temperature regimes (ambient and ambient +4 degrees C) combined with three levels of organic matter (OM, added as filtered peaty water), simulating the DOC increase that is predicted to take place over the next 4 to 21 years were used. Neither temperature nor OM had significant effects on net ecosystem production, respiration or gross primary production. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration was not significantly affected by warming, however in summer, autumn and winter it was significantly higher in mesocosms receiving intermediate OM levels (July-Feb DOC concentrations 2-6 mg L-1). Summer cyanobacterial blooms were highest in intermediate, and lowest in the highest OM treatments. OM concentration also influenced total macroinvertebrate abundance which was greater in spring and summer in mesocosms with intermediate and high OM. Fish abundance was not significantly affected by OM concentration, but abundance was greater in ambient (55 fish subsample(-1)) compared to heated mesocosms (17 fish subsample(-1)) and maximum abundance occurred two weeks later compared to heated mesocosms. The results suggest that changes in OM may have a greater effect on shallow lakes than temperature and that phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria. benefit from intermediate OM concentrations, therefore, nuisance algal blooms might increase in relatively clear shallow eutrophic lakes where DOC concentrations increase.

Applications of AAtrex 4L (atrazine) were made using ultra-coarse nozzles (Teejet TTI11004) under worst-case drift potential conditions of bare soil and high wind speeds (i.e. >10 mph: >16 kph). This study was replicated 4 times, each with two parallel spray swaths (92.5 ft or 28 m per swath) perpendicular to wind direction. Within each replicate application, three sampling lines were used to measure drift deposition (using stainless-steel discs) at distances out to 400 ft (122 m), airborne interception (using stainless-steel rods) at distances out to 75 ft (23 m), and potential direct plant effects at 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 ft (1.5, 4.6, 7.6, 10.7, and 13.7 m) from the downwind edge of the spray swath. Corresponding upwind control discs and plants were also included in each replicate. Each replicate application targeted steady wind speeds between 10 and 15 mph (16 and 24 kph) within a 30-degree angle of the downwind field orientation. On average, each 10% increase in distance from the spray zone resulted in approximately 14% less ground-deposited atrazine. Between 7 and 41 x more atrazine mass was collected from vertical rods (airborne drift), compared to horizontally placed stainless-steel discs (ground deposition). Cucumber and lettuce plants exposed to spray drift were monitored for biological effects over 21 days post-application according to standard protocols. Endpoints of survival, weight (biomass), and shoot length were evaluated by comparing distance groups to up-wind controls. Overall, when trials were combined, the aggregate lowest observable effect distance (LOED) was 5-ft (1.5 m) and the aggregate no observable effects distance (NOED) was 15-ft (4.6 m), with cucumbers affected more than lettuce.

Here, we studied the growth and survival of trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) in a 15-ha temperate coniferous old growth forest plot in northwest China. We examined the relative importance of abiotic (i.e., soil nutrient and topographic) and biotic variables (i.e., tree size, competition intensity, and wood density of each individual) on the growth and mortality Picea schrenkiana, the dominant species in this forest. We found a high mortality rate and a low recruitment rate for P. schrenkiana over a period of six years. The total abundance and basal area of this species decreased, respectively. Overall, nearly 10% of P. schrenkiana individuals died. Our models of mortality had relatively low explanatory power (3% for all trees and 5% for trees <30 cm DBH), while growth models had moderate explanatory power. The growth of P. schrenkiana trees more strongly correlated with biotic factors (i.e., competition and trait) than abiotic factors (i.e., soil nutrients and topography). Overall, DBH, neighborhood crowding index (NCI), wood density (WD), and convexity explained 26% of the variation in the relative growth rate (RGR) of P. schrenkiana trees. The majority of this variation was explained by DBH alone. For trees with DBH <30 cm, DBH, NCI, WD, convexity, and slope) explained 29% of variation in RGR. In contrast, models of the absolute growth rate (AGR) of all P. schrenkiana trees only explained 3% of variation. For trees <30 cm DBH, NCI, WD. and slope explained 21% variation in AGR and the main part was explained by intraspecific variation in WD. Ultimately, our results highlight the importance of intraspecific variation in traits and competition when exploring demographic process in low-density and species-poor forests.

After Cd concentrations in cacao beans of various provenances, particularly from Latin America, were found to exceed the new regulations enforced by the European Union in 2019, there is an urgent need to find measures to lower Cd accumulation in cacao beans to acceptable values. In this research, the long-term cacao cultivar trial CEDEC-JAS in northern Honduras was used to investigate differences between 11 cultivars in Cd uptake and translocation. Sampling of various plant parts, including rootstocks, scions, leaves and beans, from three replicate trees per cultivar and the soil around each tree was conducted at this site. Results indicate that concentrations of available soil Cd were more closely correlated with Cd concentrations of the rootstocks (R-2 = 0.56), scions (R-2 = 0.59) and leaves (R-2 = 0.46) than with bean Cd concentrations (R-2 = 026). In addition, Cd concentrations of rootstocks, scions and leaves showed close relationships to available soil Cd concentrations, with no significant differences between the cultivars. In contrast, bean Cd concentrations showed only weak correlations to available soil Cd and Cd concentrations in the vegetative plant parts, but significant variation among cultivars. Three cultivars, which were analysed in more detail, showed significant differences in Cd concentrations of mature beans, but not of immature beans. These results suggest that cultivar-related differences in bean Cd concentrations primarily result from differences in Cd loading during bean maturation, possibly due to cultivar-specific differences in the xylem-to-phloem transfer of Cd. The results show that selection of cultivars with low Cd transfer from vegetative parts into the beans has high potential to keep Cd accumulation in cacao beans at levels that are safe for consumption.

We studied a plinthic horizon to determine how different micro-zones in a horizon affect the bacterial community. The plinthic horizon is a net-like horizon characterized by the segregation of iron forms as shown by contrasting red matrix and white veins, which share common macro-environmental conditions such as climate and land use but differ only in physical and chemical compositions. The studied horizon is typical of the red soils of southeastern China and is an important layer in the red soil Critical Zone. The plinthite is considered to have been formed in the Quaternary and thus is a record of the paleo-environment. We evaluated the difference in the bacterial community composition between the red matrix and white veins and explored the possible assembly mechanisms of their co-occurrence patterns. Compared to the eutrophic environments of a red matrix, higher relative abundances of Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae were observed in the white veins. Similarly, more niches led to a higher density of bacterial co-occurrence patterns in the red matrix. The differences in the bacterial community composition and association networks are due to environmental selection, including the legacy of the paleoclimate that is represented by major element contents and contemporary hydrological properties that are mainly controlled by the soil texture. Our study shows that micro-zones even within a same plinthic horizon can provide different habitats and thus select for specific bacterial communities.

The fraction of applied material emitted into the atmosphere and the magnitude of peak emissions arc two quantities used by regulators to protect public health and are typically based on field estimates. However, the current body of field studies covers only a narrow subset of the broad range of application practices and soil conditions under which applications are performed and is subject to an unknown level of estimation error. Here we use the HYDRUS model to estimate cumulative and peak emissions of 1,3-D for 17 application methods used in California. The simulations are parameterized with soils data from 16 fields sampled immediately prior to fumigation in order to establish a representative distribution of initial soil conditions. The results demonstrate a wide range in cumulative emissions, with mean losses of initial applied mass between 10 and 58% over two weeks depending on application method. Emissions are highly variable in response to soil conditions, with coefficients of variation ranging from 16 to 54% for cumulative flux and 26 to 67% for peak three-hour flux depending on application method. The simulated distributions show similarities to the available field study estimates in terms of the mean and spread of distributions, particularly in the case of cumulative emissions, indicating that the modeling approach could be a useful tool to support regulatory decision-making in cases where field data is limited.

In the present study, morphological abnormalities in Rhinella arenarum adults from natural and artificial fluoride-rich environments were identified and evaluated. Three sites were sampled in central Argentina: Los Vallecitos stream (LF-LV), Los Cerros Negros stream (MF-CN), and Decantation ponds (HF-DP), with low (0.33 mg/L), middle (2.03 mg/L) and high (14.0 mg/L) fluoride levels respectively; the latter site is associated with a fluoride mine. Abnormal individuals were photographed and then standard radiographs were taken. Abnormality frequencies and relative percentage of abnormal individuals were calculated for each site. In addition, skeletochronology was used to estimate toad's age. Five abnormality types were identified: syndactyly, ectrodactyly, polydactyly, microphthalmia and ectromelia. Percentages of abnormal individuals per site were: LF-LV = 4%, MF-CN = 21.2% and HF-DP = 6.4%. The MF-CN and HF-DP populations had morphological abnormality frequencies that exceeded the reference value (5%) reported in the literature. The average age did not differ between sites. The results of this study indicate that there is an association between frequency of morphological abnormalities and high fluoride levels.

Comprehensive risk assessment of groundwater treated with nano Fe-0-based Carbo-Iron (R)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Environmental risk assessment; Nanoremediation; Fe-0; Groundwater treatment; Chloroethenes	COLLOIDAL ACTIVATED CARBON; SEDIMENT QUALITY TRIAD; ECOLOGICAL RISK; REMEDIATION; IRON; SITE; MANAGEMENT	Groundwater is essential for the provision of drinking water in many areas around the world. The performance of the groundwater-bearing aquifer relies on the ecosystem services provided by groundwater-related organisms. Therefore, if remediation of contaminated groundwater is necessary, the remediation method has to be carefully selected to avoid risk-risk trade-offs that might impact these ecosystems. In the present study, the environmental risk of the in situ remediation agent Carbo-Iron was performed. Carbo-Iron (R) is a composite of zero valent nano-iron and active carbon. Existing ecotoxicity data were complemented by studies with Daphnia magna (Crustacea), Scenedesmus vacuolatus (Algae), Chironomus riparius (Insecta) and nitrifying soil microorganisms. The predicted no effect concentration of 0.1 mg/L was derived from acute and chronic ecotoxicity studies. It was compared to measured and modelled environmental concentrations of Carbo-Iron applied in a groundwater contaminated with chlorohydrocarbons in a field study and risk ratios were derived. A comprehensive assessment approach was developed further based on existing strategies and used to identify changes of the environmental risk due to the remediation of the contaminated site with Carbo-Iron. With the data used in the present study, the total environmental risk decreased by approximately 50% in the heavily contaminated zones after the application of Carbo-Iron. Thus, based on the results of the present study, the benefit of remediation with Carbo-Iron seems to outweigh its negative effects on the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modelling the influence of environmental parameters over marine planktonic microbial communities using artificial neural networks	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Tropical; Estuary; Eutrophication; Pollution; Machine learning; Artificial neural networks; Tune-series	RIO-DE-JANEIRO; GUANABARA BAY; WATER-QUALITY; REMEDIATION; PHOTOINHIBITION; EUTROPHICATION; CYANOBACTERIUM; REDUCTIONS; RESPONSES; ECOSYSTEM	Guanabara Bay is a tropical estuarine ecosystem that receives massive anthropogenic impacts from the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. This ecosystem suffers from an ongoing eutrophication process that has been shown to promote the emergence of potentially pathogenic bacteria, giving rise to public health concerns. Although previous studies have investigated how environmental parameters influence the microbial community of Guanabara Bay, they often have been limited to small spatial and temporal gradients and have not been integrated into predictive mathematical models. Our objective was to fill this knowledge gap by building models that could predict how temperature, salinity, phosphorus, nitrogen and transparency work together to regulate the abundance of bacteria, chlorophyll and Vibrio (a potential human pathogen) in Guanabara Bay. To that end, we built artificial neural networks to model the associations between these variables. These networks were carefully validated to ensure that they could provide accurate predictions without biases or overfitting. The estimated models displayed high predictive capacity (Pearson correlation coefficients >= 0.67 and root mean square error <= 0.55). Our findings showed that temperature and salinity were often the most important factors regulating the abundance of bacteria, chlorophyll and Vibrio (absolute importance >= 5) and that each of these has a unique level of dependence on nitrogen and phosphorus for their growth. These models allowed us to estimate the Guanabara Bay microbiome's response to changes in environmental conditions, which allowed us to propose strategies for the management and remediation of Guanabara Bay.

Environmental impact assessment (EIA) methods traditionally determine the counterfactual based on strong assumptions of stationarity (e.g., using before and after comparisons) and can be particularly challenging to use in the context of substantial data gaps, a vexing problem when combining several time-series data from different sources. Here we propose and test a widely applicable statistical approach for quantifying environmental impacts that avoids the stationarity assumption and circumvents issues associated with data gaps. Specifically, we used a Gaussian Copula (GC) model to assess the hydrological impacts of the Tucurui dam on the Tocantins River in the Brazilian Amazon. Using multi-source water level and climate data, GC predictions of pre-dam hydrology for the validation period were excellent (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.83 to 0.98 and 93-96% of observations within the 95% predictive intervals). In the post-dam period, the river had higher dry-season water levels both upstream and downstream relative to the predicted counterfactual, and the timing and duration of wet-season drawdown was delayed and extended, substantially altering the flood pulse. These impacts were evident as far as 176 km away from the dam, highlighting widespread hydrological impacts. The GC model outperformed standard multiple regression models in representing predictive uncertainty while also avoiding the stationarity assumption and circumventing the issue of sparse and incomplete data. We thus believe the GC approach has wide utility for integrating disparate time-series data to quantify the impacts of dams and other anthropogenic phenomena on riverine hydrology globally.

To support the degradation hypothesis, a microcosm experiment was conducted where a mixture of naturally weathered plastic pieces was incubated with an indigenous pelagic community. A series of analyses were employed in order to describe the alteration of the physicochemical characteristics of the polymer (STIR, SEC and GPC, sinking velocity) as well as the biofilm community (NGS). At the end of phase II, the fraction of double bonds in the surface of microbially treated PE films increased while changes were also observed in the profile of the PS fihns. The molecular weight of PE pieces increased with incubation time reaching the molecular weight of the virgin pieces (230,000 g mol(-1)) at month 5 but the buoyancy displayed no difference throughout the experimental period. The number-average molecular weight of PS pieces decreased (33% and 27% in INDG and BIOG treatment respectively), implying chain scission; accelerated (by more than 30%) sinking velocities compared to the initial weathered pieces were also measured for PS films with biofilm on their surface. The orders Rhodobacterales, Oceanospirillales and Burkholderiales dominated the distinct platisphere communities and the genera Bacillus and Pseudonocardia discriminate these assemblages from the planktonic counterpart. The functional analysis predicts overrepresentation of adhesive cells carrying xenobiotic and hydrocarbon degradation genes. Taking these into account, we can suggest that tailored marine consortia have the ability to thrive in the presence of mixtures of plastics and participate in their degradation.

The 4-nonylphenol (NP) is a degradation product of several compounds, such as detergents and pesticides, affecting the aquatic environment. Here, we test whether treatment with NP has an effect on developing ovarian tissue, nuclear abnormalities in erythrocytes, and body darkness in pre-metamorphic tadpoles of the bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus. Tadpoles were exposed for 14days to three different concentrations of NP (1, 10, and 100 mu g/L) besides the control group, which was maintained only with water. After determining body coloration, animals were euthanized and gonads and blood were collected and processed for histology and genotoxic analysis. Even though most animals were females, intersex tadpoles were observed in control and treated groups and there were no males in any group. The highest concentration of NP showed an increase in atretic oocytes, but the area corresponding to somatic compartment and early and late germ cells were not affected. Furthermore, all treated groups presented higher amount of nuclear abnormalities in erythrocytes and body darkening when compared with the control group. These results suggest that NP causes genetic damage and morphological alterations in L. catesbeianus tadpoles by disrupting oogenesis, inducing genotoxicity and increasing body coloration. Its effects on gonadal development could cause future impairments in reproduction, while its deleterious effects on genotoxicity and body pigmentation could be used as a biomarker of effect to this compound.

In Brazil, the efficiency of Giardia and Cryptosporidium removal by combined fixed-film systems has rarely been studied. The aims of the present study were therefore to verify the removal efficiency of Giardia and Cryptosporidium by a combined system (anaerobic/anoxic filter and aerated submerged biofilter) and to perform the genetic characterization of these parasites. The (oo)cysts were detected by centrifuge concentration and membrane filtration from raw sewage, effluents, adhered biomass, and sludge samples. Immunofluorescence assay and differential interference contrast microscopy were used for the visualization of the (oo)cysts. Nested PCR was applied to confirm Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected in 27% and 5.5% of the 144 analyzed samples of raw sewage and effluents, respectively. A total of 33,000cysts/L were recovered in the adhered biomass samples (n=25) from different points of the aerated submerged biofilter, while 6000oocysts/L were registered in a single point. An average of 11,800cysts/L were found in the sludge samples (n=5). The combined system exhibited a removal efficiency of Giardia cysts of 1.8 +/- 1.0 log removal. The C and BIV assemblages of Giardia were identified in the raw sewage while AII was found in the treated effluent sample. It was not possible to calculate the removal efficiency of Cryptosporidium oocysts by the combined system. The combined system exhibited some potential as a suitable treatment for the removal of parasites from sewage.

Vertical transmission of sponge microbiota is inconsistent and unfaithful	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							CARIBBEAN COMMERCIAL SPONGES; SYMBIOTIC BACTERIA; INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; SWIMMING LARVAE; MATURE EGG; EVOLUTION; PORIFERA; MICROORGANISMS; DEMOSPONGIAE	Co-evolutionary theory predicts that if beneficial microbial symbionts improve host fitness, they should be faithfully transmitted to offspring. More recently, the hologenome theory of evolution predicts resemblance between parent and offspring microbiomes and high partner fidelity between host species and their vertically transmitted microbes. Here, we test these ideas in multiple coexisting host species with highly diverse microbiota, leveraging known parent-offspring pairs sampled from eight species of wild marine sponges (Porifera). We found that the processes governing vertical transmission were both neutral and selective. A neutral model was a better fit to larval (R-2 = 0.66) than to the adult microbiota (R-2 = 0.27), suggesting that the importance of non-neutral processes increases as the sponge host matures. Microbes that are enriched above neutral expectations in adults were disproportionately transferred to offspring. Patterns of vertical transmission were, however, incomplete: larval sponges shared, on average, 44.8% of microbes with their parents, which was not higher than the fraction they shared with nearby non-parental adults. Vertical transmission was also inconsistent across siblings, as larval sponges from the same parent shared only 17% of microbes. Finally, we found no evidence that vertically transmitted microbes are faithful to a single sponge host species. Surprisingly, larvae were as likely to share vertically transmitted microbes with larvae from other sponge species as they were with their own species. Our study demonstrates that common predictions of vertical transmission that stem from species-poor systems are not necessarily true when scaling up to diverse and complex microbiomes.

Global loss of climate connectivity in tropical forests	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							SHIFTS; BIRDS; RESPONSES; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS	Range shifts are a crucial mechanism enabling species to avoid extinction under climate change(1,2). The majority of terrestrial biodiversity is concentrated in the tropics(3), including species considered most vulnerable to climate warming(4), but extensive and ongoing deforestation of tropical forests is likely to impede range shifts(5,6). We conduct a global assessment of the potential for tropical species to reach analogous future climates-'climate connectivity'-and empirically test how this has changed in response to deforestation between 2000 and 2012. We find that over 62% of tropical forest area (similar to 10 million km(2)) is already incapable of facilitating range shifts to analogous future climates. In just 12 years, continued deforestation has caused a loss of climate connectivity for over 27% of surviving tropical forest, with accelerating declines in connectivity as forest loss increased. On average, if species' ranges shift as far down climate gradients as permitted by existing forest connectivity, by 2070 they would still experience 0.77 degrees C of warming under the least severe climate warming scenario and up to 2.6 degrees C warming for the most severe scenario. Limiting further forest loss and focusing the global restoration agenda towards creating climate corridors are global priorities for improving resilience of tropical forest biotas under climate change.

Niche syndromes reveal climate-driven extinction threat to island endemic conifers	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; INVASION; RECORDS; SHIFTS; FLORA; SIZE	Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to cause many extinctions worldwide(1). Although species endemic to islands or archipelagos have high conservation value and are vulnerable to human impacts(2,3), there has been no global analysis of climate-driven extinction risk focused on island endemics. Here, we use conifers as a model system to assess extinction risk among island endemics under climate projections for 2070. We employ the emerging technique of combining native and non-native occurrence data to model climatic conditions under which each species can sustain a population(4-7) and also incorporate horticultural data to model the broader range of conditions that allow short-term survival. Our projections indicate that some species will retain suitable climatic conditions, some will experience conditions completely precluding survival and others will experience intermediate-risk conditions that lead to population decline and eventual extinction. Based on different climate change models, we report island size thresholds of 400 to 20,000 km(2), below which extinction risks increase. These patterns are driven by correlations among island area and the breadth of species' realized, fundamental and tolerance niches. Notably, realized and fundamental niche breadth are positively correlated. Our results highlight management interventions needed to protect species from climate-driven extinction across islands of different sizes.

However, little is known about the role phytotoxicity plays in plant invasions in the neotropics, especially regarding to the response of different native species to the phytotoxic compounds of invasive plants. In this study, we assessed the effect of oil extracted from the rhizomes of Hedychium coronarium J. Konig, an important invasive plant in Brazilian riparian habitats, on the germination speed index (GSI) and germination percentage (GP) of four tree species native from Brazilian riparian forests (Anadenanthera macrocarpa, Peltophorum dubium, Mimosa bimucronata and Sesbania virgata). We also measured the radicle growth of S. virgata. The essential oil was extracted, chemically characterized, and germination bioassays were performed using oil concentrations of 0.01%, 0.1% and 1%, distilled water and Tween 80 (1%) as controls. The concentration 1% of the essential oil inhibited the GP and the GSI of all tested species (except the GP of S. virgata) and the radicle growth of S. virgata. The oil concentration 0.1% also reduced the GSI and GP of M. bimucronata. Our results revealed that some phytotoxic compounds of the invasive H. coronarium negatively affect the germination of native tree species, which may enhance its dominance in riparian forests.

The genus Bidens L. contains some species with two or more types of cypselae in a single capitulum, with dicarpy being more frequently observed. Our work aims to address how the pericarp influences germination in heterocarpic species of Bidens. The species were assigned based on their morphophysiological features: dicarpic species included Bidens alba (L.) DC., B. aristosa (Michx.) Britton, B. bipinnata L., B. frondosa L., B. pilosa L., B. subalternans DC., and a polycarpic species included B. gardneri (Baker). We investigated the variation in cypselae via morphological measurements, pericarp anatomical analysis and secondary metabolites profile by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI+). The pericarp weight and the anatomical structures differed among the types of cypselae, but these differences cannot be assumed to represent a germination barrier. Nonetheless, principal component analysis indicated that the pericarp chemical composition varied among B. aristosa, B. bipinnata, B. pilosa, and B. subalternans. The analysis of metabolic profile of the pericarps revealed esculin, glycosylated flavonoids and nitrogenous compounds in all cypselae. Our work brings new evidence for understanding the way the pericarp influences the germination of heterocarpic species under anatomical and metabolomic frameworks. We discard the differential mechanical constraint as the main inducer of dicarpy for these Bidens species.

Alien plant species invade by occupying similar functional spaces to native species	FLORA			English	Article						Competition; Exotic; Invasion; Plant functional types; Plant strategies; Universal adaptive strategy theory	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; INVASIVE PLANTS; LIFE STRATEGIES; LEAF ECONOMICS; DIVERSITY; TRAITS; METAANALYSIS; FLORA; COMMUNITIES; RESOURCES	Invasive alien species (IAS) are the subset of naturalized species that cause greater impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services. However, despite management actions and eradication plans, their expansion worldwide is seemingly unstoppable. In this paper, based on a large dataset of 1039 records of IAS and native plant species representative of the extensive biogeographic diversity in Southern Europe, we tested the consistency of Grime' concept of CSR universal adaptive strategies (competitors, stress-tolerators and ruderals) to explain plant invasion across a broad elevation gradient. Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, we tested two hypotheses. First, whether IAS occupy a different CSR space compared to native species. Second, whether the success of IAS at the regional scale is linked to higher degree of C- and/or R-selection, according to recent worldwide observations on naturalization success of alien species. We tested such hypotheses on different growth forms (trees, shrubs, long-lived herbs, short-lived herbs, hydrophytes) that are related to plant functional traits. Except for trees, IAS and native plant species essentially occupied the same CSR space, indicating that IAS can occupy the same niches of native species. However, IAS exhibited mainly higher C-scores compared to natives, suggesting that IAS are more competitive and are associated with relatively productive habitats, involving that these sites are highly prone to invasion (and that native species in resource-poor habitats are less likely to experience pressure from IAS). Our findings confirm the utility of CSR classification to broadly represent, and explain, the invasion success of alien plant species at the regional scale. This approach emerges as a viable tool in assessment of IAS characteristics and for development of strategies and plans for their containment.

Predicting the distribution of species under climate change is important for conservation of biodiversity. The aim of this research was to model the current distribution of miombo woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa using seventeen miombo tree species, and to project their distributions under different climate change scenarios. A maximum entropy method, Maxent, was used to model the distributions of the seventeen representative tree species, Albizia antunesiana, Afzelia quanzensis, Baikiaea plurijuga, Brachystegia bakeriana, Brachystegia boehmii, Brachystegia longifolia, Brachystegia microphylla, Brachystegia spiciformis, Brachystegia utilis, Cryptosepalum exfoliatum, Guibourtia coleosperma, Isoberlinia angolensis, Julbernadia globiflora, Julbernadia paniculata, Pericopsis angolensis Pterocarpus angolensis, and Pterocarpus rotundifolius. A total of 3 429 occurrence records, nineteen bioclimatic variables, monthly precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures, soil characteristics and altitude were used in modeling. Distributions were hindcasted to the Mid-Holocene and forecasted to 2050 and 2070 under all four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Hindcasting showed that ranges for A. antunesiana, B. bakeriana, B. boehmii, C. exfoliatum, G. coleosperma and Pterocarpus angolensis were larger in the Mid-Holocene than they are currently, while the ranges of the other species were constricted during this period. When forecasted, range contraction was observed for nine species, A. quanzensis, A. antunesiana, B. microphylla, B. spiciformis, B utilis, C. exfoliatum, J. globiflora, Pericopsis angolensis and P. rotundifolius. Range expansion was observed in the other eight species. Range contraction was acute in 2070 under RCP8.5 for A. quanzensis (-13%), A. antunesiana (-15%) and B. microphylla (-14%). Species whose forecasted ranges contracted should be prioritized for mitigation against climate change. All species should be protected from anthropogenic threats since most are unsustainably harvested.

In some circumstances, asexual reproduction helps to overcome this hindrance, especially in coastal areas exposed to extreme weather events that help produce plant fragments acting as propagules. Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl (Poaceae) is an alien invader colonizing most saltmarshes in NW Iberia (Spain and Portugal). The extent of the invasion in the area is quite large, but it remained unnoticed until recently due to the absence of flowering shoots that would have allowed for quick detection and identification. Here we ask whether vegetative propagules can help to understand the extensive spread of the invader. Both propagule characteristics (number and diameter of nodes) and environmental conditions (season and sediment covering) influenced the sprouting rate. In winter, around 30% of the fragments sprouted and produced short shoots of on average 2.8 cm tall. In spring, 40% of the fragments sprouted and produced larger shoots of 13.3 cm tall. Thus, even when conditions are harsh, this species can sprout from plant fragments abundantly. These results may help explain the success of this species invading NW Iberia, and suggest that asexual reproduction plays a role in the invasion by S. patens. Also, eradication techniques which can release plant fragments should be avoided as a measure to control the invasion of this plant.

Among the several threats affecting the native biodiversity of these systems, invasive plants are one of the most troubling ones. The genus Carpobrotus has been recognized as one of the most abundant invasive genera along the Mediterranean coast, particularly in coastal sand dunes. In Italy, two taxa belonging to this genus have been identified: C. edulis and C. acinaciformis. Given that the taxonomic identification of these two species is still subject of debate, we investigate whether there are differences concerning their ecology in terms of their impact on native plant communities in central Italy coastal dunes. To do so, we analyzed their relative impact on species richness, diversity and relative abundance. Vegetation sampling was carried out through paired-plots, comparing invaded to non-invaded plots. Although our results show a general decrease in native species richness in all the invaded plots, there were no significant differences between the richness and diversity of the native communities invaded by C. edulis and that of the communities invaded by C. acinaciformis, although slight differences on native species' relative cover was observed. In addition, we observed a higher occurrence of C. edulis in the areas closer to the seashore. We conclude that even though there are no meaningful differences in the impacts of the two taxa on native biodiversity, further analyses are needed to exclude potential differences in their relative ecological adaptations to the changing abiotic conditions found along the coastal zonation.

We selected an area nearby the city of aguas de Santa Barbara, central-western part of SAo Paulo State, Brazil to be analyzed between 2014 and 2018, during recent El Nino-Southern Oscillation most active period (2016/2017) and verify its posteriori effects on vegetation (until early 2018). The Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER), with biweekly MODIS and seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery, and the rational method for runoff modeling were applied, which was applied in a daily-basis hydrological model, which is the main novelty of this report. The average annual groundwater recharge potential for each of the land uses (pasture, sugarcane crop, silviculture, and forest) varied between 15 and 50% of the rainfall. Silviculture showed higher evapotranspirations rates than forest and sugarcane crops. Groundwater levels measured at 46 monitoring wells were analyzed to obtain enough data to create the hydrographs required for the validation. 36 shallow wells (which reached depths smaller than 3m) had the best results (R-2>0.92), where the root mean squared absolute error (RMSE) term appeared to be less than 20% of the mean groundwater level, indicating that it has a faster response to remote-sensed actual evapotranspiration and that the water balance is sufficiently understood for policy and decision making. The results of this study lead to the conclusion that including spatiotemporal thermal and soil moisture conditions by remote-sensing tools in the evapotranspiration account improved the modeling of groundwater levels for shallow wells at daily basis.

However, the inadequate availability of ecological time-series data often impedes the development of statistical predictions. On the other hand, considerable amounts of temporally discrete biological records (commonly known as species occurrence records') are being stored in public databases, and often include the location and date of the observation. In this paper, we describe an approach to develop spatiotemporal predictions based on the dates and locations found in species occurrence records. The approach is based on time-series classification', a field of machine learning, and consists of applying a machine-learning algorithm to classify between time series representing the environmental variation that precedes the occurrence records and time series representing the full range of environmental variation that is available in the location of the records. We exemplify the application of the approach for predicting the timing of emergence of fruiting bodies of two mushroom species (Boletus edulis and Macrolepiota procera) in Europe, from 2009 to 2015. Predictions made from this approach were superior to those provided by a null' model representing the average seasonality of the species. Given the increased availability and information contained in species occurrence records, particularly those supplemented with photographs, the range of environmental events that could be possible to predict using this approach is vast.

Latitude and daily-weather effects on gobbling activity of wild turkeys in Mississippi	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						Call counts; Generalized additive mixed model; Phenology; Road survey; Spatial Synoptic Classification	CLASSIFICATION; SUCCESS	Weather has been recognized as a density independent factor influencing the abundance, distribution, and behavior of vertebrates. Male wild turkeys' (Meleagris gallopavo) breeding behavior includes vocalizations and courtship displays to attract females, the phenology of which can vary with latitude. State biologists design spring turkey-hunting season frameworks centered on annual vocalization patterns to maximize hunter engagement. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks has traditionally instituted a statewide, 7-week, spring harvest season. However, hunters routinely argue that different peaks in gobbling activity across the state exist. The objective of this study was to determine whether differences in peak gobbling activity existed across a latitudinal gradient of Mississippi and assess the effect of weather on gobbling. During 2008 and 2009, we conducted a statewide gobbling survey. We used generalized additive mixed models to describe the probability and frequency of gobbling activity within northern and southern regions of the state. We also investigated the effect of daily weather conditions on gobbling activity. Our results revealed an approximate 10-14-day difference in peak gobbling activity between southern and northern Mississippi. The majority of all gobbling activity occurred within the current spring harvest framework. Perhaps more importantly, gobbling activity was more prevalent on days of regionally dry conditions (i.e., less humid) according to the Spatial Synoptic Classification. Our results provide information on gobbling activity phenology relative to hunting-season dates and weather-response information. Our approach may be particularly applicable in states with relatively shorter seasons or highly variable daily weather conditions that moderate gobbling frequency.

Location Forest and open habitats through a 4,230-m elevational gradient across the tropical Andes of Ecuador. Method We examined variability in critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) and thermal breadth (TB; CTmax-CTmin) in 21 species of Pristimantis frogs. Additionally, we monitored maximum and minimum temperatures at the local scale (tmax, tmin) and estimated vulnerability to acute thermal stress from heat (CTmax-tmax) and cold (tmin-CTmin), by partitioning thermal diversity into elevational and microclimatic variation. Results Our results were consistent with Brett's hypothesis: elevation promotes more variation in CTmin and tmin than in CTmax and tmax. Frogs inhabiting thermally variable open habitats have higher CTmax and tmax and greater TBs than species restricted to forest habitats, which show less climatic overlap across the elevational gradient (Janzen's hypothesis). Vulnerability to heat stress was higher in open than forest habitats and did not vary with elevation. Main conclusions We suggest a mechanistic explanation of thermal tolerance diversity in elevational gradients by including microclimatic thermal variation. We propose that the unfeasibility to buffer minimum temperatures locally may explain the rapid increase in cold tolerance (lower CTmin) with elevation. In contrast, the relative invariability in heat tolerance (CTmax) with elevation may revolve around the organisms' habitat selection of open- and canopy-buffered habitats. Secondly, on the basis of microclimatic estimates, lowland and upland species may be equally vulnerable to temperature increase, which is contrary to the pattern inferred from regional interpolated climate estimators.

Geodiversity - the diversity of Earth surface forms, materials and processes - and biodiversity are interlinked at a fundamental level. This relationship is being considered in a growing number of studies, yet research from freshwater environments is scarce. We used geodiversity (rock-type, soil-type and geomorphological richness), local and climatic variables to explore whether geodiversity can be used as a surrogate for aquatic plant species richness in lakes and rivers. Location Finland. Taxon Aquatic plants. Methods We compared geodiversity variables (measured within 1-km(2) grid cells) to well-studied local (e.g. area, alkalinity) and climate (e.g. growing degree-days) variables, and examined the patterns between habitat types (lakes and rivers) and among all taxa and major functional groups (helophytes and hydrophytes). We modelled lake (n = 145) and river (n = 146) plant species richness with generalized linear models, and further partitioned variation to measure the independent and shared contributions of the geodiversity, climate and local environmental variable groups. As a complementary analysis, and to identify single important variables explaining variation in aquatic plant species richness, we utilized boosted regression trees. Results We found a positive relationship between aquatic plant species richness and catchment geodiversity variation with recurring patterns across two different freshwater habitat types and two aquatic plant functional groups. Higher variation in geodiversity (measured at landscape scale) supported higher freshwater biodiversity (measured at the local scale) of lakes and rivers. Main conclusions Geodiversity can be a useful addition to biodiversity modelling, and it should be considered in conservation schemes and monitoring efforts, further supporting the principle of conserving nature's stage. Yet, differences between habitats and functional groups suggest that more habitat-specific approaches and multiple biodiversity measures should be considered. Our study is an important signpost guiding further studies on the biodiversity-geodiversity relationship in freshwater ecosystems.

These areas hold outstanding levels of plant diversity and endemism, but despite their uniqueness they have been neglected in recent bioregionalizations for the Neotropical region. Given their particular levels of species richness and endemism, we here test the recognition of these as distinct bioregions within the Chacoan dominion. Location Mountaintops of eastern South America. Methods We listed 1,748 angiosperm species endemic to the campo rupestre of the Espinhaco Range and Chapada dos Veadeiros regions, based on the data gathered from the Brazilian Flora 2020 Project. We extracted all occurrence information available from GBIF (the Global Biodiversity Information Facility) for such list and also for a polygon gathering all the study area, including information from adjacent vegetations. Data went through standard cleaning procedures and a network clustering analysis was performed to delimitate the boundaries of the new bioregions. Results Our data strongly support the recognition of two distinct bioregions along the Espinhaco Range, but none in the Chapada dos Veadeiros. Given their high levels of endemism and singularity within the Chacoan dominion, we formalize two provinces associated to campo rupestre in the Espinhaco Range, naming them as "Chapada Diamantina" and "Southern Espinhaco" provinces. Within the latter province, three districts are also recognized, based on this and previous studies: "Diamantina Plateau", "Grao-Mogol" and "Iron Quadrangle" districts. Main conclusions The formalization of new and previously described bioregions highlights the campo rupestre as a vegetation harbouring outstanding levels of species richness and endemism in South America, contributing to a better understanding of biogeographical patterns in the Neotropics. Also, as we follow the International Code of Area Nomenclature as a device to standardize recognition of bioregions, this shall facilitate further biogeographical and conservation studies in these areas. Further assessments with new and revisited data are needed to enable minor scale bioregionalization within the Chacoan dominion.	[Colli-Silva, Matheus; Vasconcelos, Thais N.

Location Amazonia. Taxon Ground truth data on ferns and lycophytes; remote sensing results reflect forest canopy properties. Methods We used field plot data to assess main ecological gradients across Amazonia and to relate floristic ordination axes to soil base cation concentration, Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) climatic variables and reflectance values from a basin-wide Landsat image composite with generalized linear models. Ordination axes were then predicted across all Amazonia using Landsat and CHELSA, and a regional subdivision was obtained using k-medoid classification. Results The primary floristic gradient was strongly related to base cation concentration in the soil, and the secondary gradient to climatic variables. The Landsat image composite revealed a tapestry of broad-scale variation in canopy reflectance characteristics across Amazonia. Ordination axis scores predicted using Landsat and CHELSA variables produced spatial patterns consistent with existing knowledge on soils, geology and vegetation, but also suggested new floristic patterns. The clearest dichotomy was between central Amazonia and the peripheral areas, and the available data supported a classification into at least eight subregions. Main conclusions Landsat data are capable of predicting soil-related species compositional patterns of understorey ferns and lycophytes across the Amazon basin with surprisingly high accuracy. Although the exact floristic relationships may differ among plant groups, the observed ecological gradients must be relevant for other plants as well, since surface reflectance recorded by satellites is mostly influenced by the tree canopy. This opens exciting prospects for species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and biogeographical and ecological studies on Amazonian biota. Our maps provide a preliminary geoecological subdivision of Amazonia that can now be tested and refined using field data of other plant groups and from hitherto unsampled areas.

Location Global; case study: Anatolia (Turkey). Methods We discuss the links between surface uplift and biodiversity dynamics and review recent developments for reconstructing the history of geography and biodiversity. To illustrate an integrative approach to biogeography, we present a case study of Neogene Anatolia. In particular, we reconstruct Anatolian paleogeography based on a synthesis of both quantitative and qualitative evidence, and review the fossil record of the regional flora and fauna, to identify changes in compositions that might be induced by surface uplift and associated environmental changes. Results The Central Anatolian Plateau and its mountainous margins display different histories of surface uplift during the late Miocene to Pliocene, which are detectable in the regional fossil record of large mammals. Overall changes in vegetation and climatic conditions for the whole region also align with the general time frame of surface uplift. Main conclusions Our discussion and case study highlight the value of an integrative biogeographic framework, by combining knowledge and techniques from geology and paleobiology to simultaneously consider the biotic and environmental dynamics in space and time. Neogene surface uplift in Anatolia has affected the regional biota, particularly the diversity of plants and large mammals, along with well-known global and regional changes in climate and other environmental factors. To disentangle the effects of different, but most likely interactive environmental changes at various scales, we call for rigorous examination of the geological record in a biogeographic framework, using innovative methods to uncover how environmental and biotic processes have shaped mountain biodiversity.

Opportunities and challenges for operationalizing the ES concept	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES			English	Article						Scientific knowledge; Environmental governance; Latin America; Land-sea connectivity; Social-ecological systems	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE; SCIENCE; GOVERNANCE; MARINE; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; COASTAL; LESSONS; POLICY	The concept of Ecosystem Services (ES) highlights that human wellbeing depends on nature and is a 'whole system aware' view. Land-sea systems are examples of complex systems including interfaces that can be perceived as boundaries, overlooking connections of the whole system. We explored the occurrence of several features of scientific knowledge building and governance of these systems that can hinder the recognition of connectivity, challenging an ES approach. We analyzed online survey responses from academics representing 22 research institutions and 13 case studies, all from Latin America. Results showed that the generation of scientific knowledge is not integrally approached and there are deficiencies in researchers' communication with stakeholders across the land-sea interface. These drawbacks in scientific knowledge building could be one of the reasons why an ES approach is rarely applied on governance of land-sea systems. The cases showed segmented governance schemes and that conflict situations enhance the visibility of ecosystem relations. The establishment of long-lasting institutional instruments and the involvement of intermediaries connecting sectors are complementary paths to improve integrated governance. Using ES as a boundary concept could improve integration between sectors and ES trade-off analysis can help to introduce ecosystem relations to stakeholders related to their own interests.

Environmental impact assessments can misrepresent species distributions: a case study of koalas in Queensland, Australia	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						survey design; stratification; search effort; infrastructure development; perceived habitat quality; Phascolarctos cinereus; EIA, occupancy	PHASCOLARCTOS-CINEREUS; BIODIVERSITY OFFSETS; HABITAT; CONSERVATION; CONSEQUENCES; ABUNDANCE; QUALITY; ROADS; FAUNA; SHIRE	Vegetation clearing has been implicated as a major contributor to biodiversity loss. It therefore stands to reason that developers should face a regulatory requirement to assess potential impacts and to avoid, mitigate and compensate for loss of vegetation wherever proposed infrastructure developments impact on vegetation considered to be habitat for threatened species. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) rely on accurate information to describe the distributions of threatened species within the footprint of proposed infrastructure developments, which is critical to ensuring appropriate mitigation of potentially deleterious impacts on these populations. EIA survey guidelines seek to determine species' presence accurately, while acknowledging the limits imposed by time and budget constraints. As such, the EIA guidelines may recommend: (1) stratifying the landscape based on previous knowledge of habitat variables relevant to a species; and (2) targeting survey effort to strata with high probability of occupancy. Here, we use koala Phascolarctos cinereus surveys as a case study to explore the extent to which application of EIA guidelines result in accurate occupancy estimates. We compared the presence/absence distribution across one landscape survey and three EIA surveys, and found that koala occupancy was not well predicted by koala habitat criteria widely used to inform sampling design. In the context of EIA, we provide an example of how targeting survey effort to strata with high probability of occupancy risks misrepresenting true occurrence patterns. A general issue with survey designs that rely on previous knowledge is that they self-reinforce erroneous assumptions. Our findings stand as a warning that EIA might neither quantify the impact of proposed infrastructure developments adequately, nor inform the ensuing mitigation measures. Threatened species' protection in the face of infrastructure development will require new approaches to EIAs to ensure that providers are enabled to undertake comprehensive environmental surveys capable of detecting priority species.

Loss of forest intactness elevates global extinction risk in birds	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						connectivity; forest-dependence; Red List; extinction risk; Intact Forest Landscapes; conservation; birds	DEFORESTATION; LANDSCAPES; IMPACT	Only around a third of the world's remaining forest cover survives in the form of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL), and that proportion is declining. Loss of intactness could impact on biodiversity in many ways but the relationship between intactness and extinction risk has not been quantified. We created Extent of Suitable Habitat (ESH) maps for all the world's forest-dependent birds and intersected them with an independently derived IFL layer. We also estimate the proportion of the total global range-rarity of forest-dependent birds that is captured by IFL. The majority of forest-dependent bird species are now confined largely or entirely to be degraded, disturbed, or fragmented (non-IFL) forests. Furthermore, only 22.5% of global hotspots of range-rarity for forest-dependent birds are found within intact forests. We find a very strong positive relationship between the global extinction risk of forest-dependent birds and the proportion of forest within their ESH that is no longer intact. This effect was independent of overall range size and phylogeny. There was also a tendency for extinction risk to be higher in species that lost more intactness in their forest ESHs between 2000 and 2016. Restoring intactness to forest landscapes will reduce global extinction risk in forest-dependent birds.	[Donald, P. F.; Arendarczyk, B.] BirdLife Int, Cambridge, England; [Donald, P.

Founder relationships and conservation management: empirical kinships reveal the effect on breeding programmes when founders are assumed to be unrelated	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						captive breeding; conservation genetics; insurance population; molecular data; pedigree data; relatedness estimators; Tasmanian devils; inbreeding	PAIRWISE RELATEDNESS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; HAPLOTYPE RECONSTRUCTION; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; TASMANIAN DEVILS; PEDIGREE; DNA; ESTIMATORS; CAPTIVITY	Conservation breeding programmes have become widespread as natural habitats shrink, and have been historically managed using pedigree data and an assumption that population founders are unrelated. Molecular genotyping is able to determine founder relatedness, but is rarely used. To empirically test the impact of assuming founders to be unrelated, we utilized data from 203 founding individuals and 11 subsequent years of breeding records for the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) insurance population. We integrated molecular data (N = 119 founders) and detailed trapping information (N = 203 founders) to test how founder relationship assumptions impacted the genetic characteristics of the population over time (N = 942 unique individuals). We developed a method to combine molecular kinship (using the TrioML estimator), year of birth and trapping location, and integrated the resulting empirical kinship estimates into population management software. We tested the effect of using pedigree data only, versus our integrated approach, on population outcomes. Inbreeding coefficients evaluated using the integrated approach were significantly higher than pedigree-only inbreeding coefficients in the first few years following population establishment. A geographic distance-only approach showed an association between kinship and probability of successful breeding. Our results show the value in using field and/or molecular data combined with pedigree data in conservation breeding programmes to provide new information for managing crucial populations and improving their success. We caution population managers against commencing expensive conservation breeding programmes in the absence of understanding founder relatedness, especially when wild augmentation is a goal. Long-term costs of assuming founders are unrelated include financial costs, reduced productivity and release of potentially highly inbred individuals.	[Hogg, C. J.; Wright, B.; Morris, K.

Forecasting wildlife die-offs from extreme heat events	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						heat stress; climate change; extreme weather events; heatwaves; Australian flying-foxes; Pteropus spp; ACCESS-R	EVAPORATIVE WATER-LOSS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEATHER; TEMPERATURE; RESPONSES; WAVES; MORTALITY; HUMIDITY; FREQUENT; ANIMALS	Extreme heat events pose increasing challenges to biodiversity conservation worldwide, yet our ability to predict the time, place and magnitude of their impacts on wildlife is limited. Extreme heat events in Australia are known to kill thousands of flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.), and such die-offs are expected to become more frequent and widespread in the future under anthropogenic climate change. There is a growing need for predicting when and where such heat-related die-offs would occur, to facilitate short-term wildlife management and conservation actions. In this study, we used gridded hourly air temperature forecasts [Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator (ACCESS-R) Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model] from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to predict flying-fox heat-related mortality based on an empirically determined threshold of 42.0 degrees C. We tested the accuracy and precision of this model using a twofold evaluation of the ACCESS-R NWP forecast air temperature during a recorded extreme heat event with in situ air temperature measurements and interpolated weather station data. While our results showed a slight discrepancy between the modelled and measured air temperatures, there was no significant difference in the forecast's accuracy to predict die-offs during an extreme heat event and the overall summer period. We evaluated the accuracy of mortality predictions based on different air temperature thresholds (38.0, 40.0, 42.0 and 44.0 degrees C). Our results revealed a significant probability of flying-fox mortality occurrence when forecast air temperature was >= 42.0 degrees C, while the 24- and 48-h forecasts accurately predicted 77 and 73% of the die-offs, respectively. Thus, the use of 42.0 degrees C forecast air temperature from the ACCESS-R NWP model can predict flying-fox mortality reliably at the landscape scale. In principle, the forecaster can be used for any species with known thermal tolerance data and is therefore a promising new tool for prioritizing adaptation actions that aim to conserve biodiversity in the face of climate change.

Predators and pastoralists: how anthropogenic pressures inside wildlife areas influence carnivore space use and movement behaviour	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						cheetah; livestock; movement; human pressure; protected areas; space use	HUMAN DISTURBANCE; MAASAI MARA; PROTECTED AREAS; LIVESTOCK; LAND; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; COEXISTENCE	Across the globe, wildlife populations and their behaviours are negatively impacted by people. Protected areas are believed to be an antidote to increasing human pressures but even they are not immune to the impact of anthropogenic activities. Areas that have been set aside for the protection of wildlife therefore warrant more attention when investigating the impact of anthropogenic pressures on wildlife. We use cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus as a case study to explore how a large carnivore responds to anthropogenic pressures inside wildlife areas. Using GPS-collar data we investigate cheetah space use, both when moving and stationary, and movement parameters (speed and turn angles) in relation to human disturbance, distance to human settlement, livestock abundance and livestock site use inside wildlife areas. Space use was negatively influenced by human disturbance, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation and potentially reducing landscape permeability between neighbouring wildlife areas. Cheetahs were also less likely to stop in areas where livestock numbers were high, but more likely to stop in areas that were frequently used by livestock. The latter could reflect that cheetahs are attracted to livestock however, cheetahs in the study area rarely predated on livestock. It is therefore more likely that areas that are frequently used by livestock attract wild herbivores, which in turn could influence cheetah space use. We did not find any effects of people and livestock on cheetahs' speed and turn angles which might be related to the resolution of the data. We found that cheetahs are sensitive to human pressures and we believe that they could be an indicator species for other large carnivores facing similar challenges. We suggest that further research is needed to determine the levels of anthropogenic pressures needed to maintain ecological integrity, especially inside wildlife areas.

Dormancy in Metacommunities	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						metacommunity; dormancy; dispersal; coexistence; community monopolization	POPULATION GENETIC CONSEQUENCES; SEED BANKS; DISPERSAL STRATEGIES; COMPETITIVE COEXISTENCE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; THROUGH-SPACE; FIELD-TEST; TRADE-OFF; EGG; SIZE	Although metacommunity ecology has improved our understanding of how dispersal affects community structure and dynamics across spatial scales, it has yet to adequately account for dormancy. Dormancy is a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity that enables temporal dispersal within the metacommunity. Dormancy is also a metacommunity-level process because it can covary with spatial dispersal and affect diversity across spatial scales. We develop a framework to integrate dispersal and dormancy, focusing on the covariation they exhibit, to predict how dormancy modifies the importance of species interactions, dispersal, and historical contingencies in metacommunities. We used empirical and modeling approaches to demonstrate the utility of this framework. We examined case studies of microcrustaceans in ephemeral ponds, where dormancy underlies metacommunity dynamics, and identified constraints on the dispersal and dormancy strategies of bromeliad-dwelling invertebrates. Using simulations, we showed that dormancy can alter classic metacommunity patterns of diversity in ways that depend on dispersal-dormancy covariation and spatiotemporal environmental variability. We propose that dormancy may also facilitate evolution-mediated priority effects if locally adapted seed banks prevent colonization by more dispersal-limited species. Last, we present testable predictions for the implications of dormancy in metacommunities, some of which may fundamentally alter our understanding of metacommunity ecology.

Ecologists generally consider intraspecific variation either among or within populations, yet these differences can interact to create patterns of species interactions. These differences can also affect species interactions by altering processes occurring at distinct scales. Specifically, intraspecific variation may shape species interactions simply by shifting a population's position along a trait-function map or by shifting the relationship between traits and their ecological function. I test these ideas by manipulating within- and among-population intraspecific variation in wild populations of a gall-forming insect before quantifying species interactions and phenotypic selection. Within- and among-population differences in gall size interact to affect attack rates by an enemy community, but among-population differences were far more consequential. Intraspecific differences shaped species interactions by both shifting the position of populations along the trait-function map and altering the relationship between traits and their function, with ultimate consequences for patterns of natural selection. I suggest that intraspecific variation can affect communities and natural selection by acting through individual- and population-level mechanisms.

Individual Variation in the Social Plasticity of Water Dragons	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						social plasticity; behavioral reaction norm; water dragon; social competence; social behavior; behavioral plasticity	BEHAVIORAL REACTION NORMS; REPRODUCTIVE COMPETITION; ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; INTERACTING PHENOTYPES; SEXUAL-HARASSMENT; PERSONALITY; ASSOCIATION; SOCIABILITY; POPULATIONS; MECHANISMS	Individuals should alter when they socially associate with conspecifics to avoid potentially costly interactions. Moreover, individuals may vary in their propensity to use information about conspecifics when making such social decisions. However, surprisingly little is known about either the determinants of or the individual variation in such "social plasticity." We show here that eastern water dragons (Intellegama lesueurii lesueurii) may simultaneously use information from different components of their social environment when deciding whether to socially associate. In particular, we found that individuals altered when they socially associated with conspecifics according to the levels of potential conflict and competition in their social environment; both sexes socially associated more at higher local density than would be expected under increased random encounters. Further, females were more likely to socially associate during the breeding season and when there were more males and/or conspecifics whom they typically avoided in their social environment. This suggests that females may seek safety in numbers when the potential for intrasexual conflict or sexual harassment is high. Using a behavioral reaction norm framework, we also provide novel evidence to show that individuals vary in the extent and direction of their social plasticity and that males varied more than females. Our study thus implies that individuals use multiple cues in their environment when deciding to socially associate and that the resulting social plasticity varies between the sexes and between individuals.

Comparative and biogeographic studies suggest that both benign and harsh-as well as stable and fluctuating-environments can favor the evolution of cooperative breeding behavior. The fact that cooperative societies occur in environments of such contrasting quality creates a paradox of environmental quality and sociality. The dual benefits framework-which leads to the prediction that the ecological consequences of sociality (e.g., range size) vary depending on the benefits that individuals of each species receive by forming social groups-offers a potential resolution to this paradox. Here we use a case study of two avian lineages, starlings (Sturnidae) and hornbills (Bucerotidae), in which environmental unpredictability appears to have opposite effects on the evolution of cooperation to test the dual benefits framework. Consistent with previous work, harsh and unpredictable environments promote cooperative breeding behavior in starlings, which in turn leads to larger geographic ranges. However, cooperatively breeding hornbills occur in benign and stable environments, but sociality does not influence range size. Our study suggests that the paradox of environmental quality and sociality arises largely because cooperative breeding is an umbrella term encompassing social species that form groups for different reasons. We demonstrate that differentiating among the functional causes of social group formation is critical for developing a predictive framework for understanding the evolution of cooperative breeding behavior.

Playing out Liem's Paradox: Opportunistic Piscivory across Lake Tanganyikan Cichlids	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						resource pulses; dietary flexibility; specialization; coexistence; adaptive radiation	MODULATORY MULTIPLICITY; FEEDING MECHANISM; FISHES; ECOLOGY; MALAWI; CONSEQUENCES; PRODUCTIVITY; PETROCHROMIS; COMMUNITIES; MORPHOLOGY	Trophic specialization is a key feature of the diversity of cichlid fish adaptive radiations. However, K. F. Liem observed that even species with highly specialized trophic morphologies have dietary flexibility, enabling them to exploit episodic food resources opportunistically. Evidence for dietary flexibility comes largely from laboratory studies, and it is unclear whether cichlid fishes undergo diet shifts in the wild. We report observations of diet switching by multiple cichlid species in Lake Tanganyika as a consequence of unusual concentrations of schooling juvenile clupeid fishes. Fish species with varying degrees of trophic specialization converged on a single prey: juvenile sardines that are also endemic to Lake Tanganyika (Stolothrissa tanganicae and Limnothrissa miodon). We provide evidence for cichlid species acting as jacks-of-all-trades and discuss this evidence in the framework of Liem's classic paradox: that trophic specialization does not preclude dietary flexibility.

Some species of the Chironomus genus have been extensively used in ecotoxicological assays. Among these, Chironomus tentans is usually utilized in the USA and Chironomus sancticaroli in Brazil. We conducted ecotoxicological bioassays to compare a population of C. sancticaroli, kept for 6years under laboratory conditions, with a sylvatic population of the same species, collected in the field. The aim was to test the hypothesis that populations of C. sancticaroli, maintained in the laboratory for long periods, could have a different response to stressors/substances. We analyzed the responses of C. sancticaroli for potassium chloride, zinc chloride, potassium dichromate, linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) and caffeine. The results showed no significant differences between the two populations in the analyses and seems to indicate the possible use of C. sancticaroli from populations kept in the laboratory for long periods.

We used an ensemble modelling approach to predict daily, year-round habitat suitability for a migratory species, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), and demonstrate an application for evaluating the spatiotemporal dynamics of their exposure to ship strike risk. Location The California Current Ecosystem (CCE) and the Southern California Bight (SCB), USA. Methods We integrated a long-term (1994-2008) satellite tracking dataset on 104 blue whales with data-assimilative ocean model output to assess year-round habitat suitability. We evaluated the relative utility of ensembling multiple model types compared to using single models, and selected and validated candidate models using multiple cross-validation metrics and independent observer data. We quantified the spatial and temporal distribution of exposure to ship strike risk within shipping lanes in the SCB. Results Multi-model ensembles outperformed single-model approaches. The final ensemble model had high predictive skill (AUC = 0.95), resulting in daily, year-round predictions of blue whale habitat suitability in the CCE that accurately captured migratory behaviour. Risk exposure in shipping lanes was highly variable within and among years as a function of environmental conditions (e.g., marine heatwave). Main conclusions Daily information on three-dimensional oceanic habitats was used to model the daily distribution of a highly migratory species with high predictive power and indicated that management strategies could benefit by incorporating dynamic environmental information. This approach is readily transferable to other species. Dynamic, high-resolution species distribution models are valuable tools for assessing risk exposure and targeting management needs.

Location Mojave and Sonoran Desert ecoregions; California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, USA. Methods We compare ecological niches of Gopherus agassizii and Gopherus morafkai using species distribution modelling (SDM) and then calibrate a pooled-taxa distribution model to explore local differences in species-environment relationships based on the spatial residuals of the pooled-taxa model. We use multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) applied to those residuals to estimate local species-environment relationships that can vary across the landscape. We identify multivariate clusters in these local species-environment relationships and compare them against models of (a) a geographically based taxonomic designation for two sister species and (b) an environmental ecoregion designation, with respect to their ability to predict a genotype association index for these two species. Results We find non-identical niches for these species, with differences that span physiographic and vegetation niche dimensions. We find evidence for two distinct clusters of local species-environment relationships that when mapped, predict an index of genotype association for the two sister taxa better than did either the geographically based taxonomic designation or an environmental ecoregion designation. Main conclusions Exploring local species-environment relationships by coupling SDM and MGWR can benefit studies of biogeography and conservation. We find that niche separation in habitat selection conforms to genotypic differences between sister taxa of tortoise in a recent secondary contact zone. This result may inform decision making by agencies with regulatory or land management authority for the two sister taxa addressed here.	[Inman, Richard; Fotheringham, A.

Precipitation and tree cover gradients structure avian alpha diversity in North-western Costa Rica	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						binomial mixture models; community ecology; environmental changes; environmental gradients; functional diversity; Neotropical birds; phylogenetic diversity; taxonomic diversity	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; EXTINCTION RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; GLOBAL DIVERSITY; BETA-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; RESPONSES; BIRDS	Aim Changes in climate and land use are modifying biodiversity worldwide. Yet it remains unclear how both drivers interact to structure communities and determine patterns in taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity at local scales. We focused on bird diversity and asked: how do precipitation and forest cover gradients interactively structure these elements of avian diversity? Location Guanacaste, North-western Costa Rica. Methods We quantified changes in the abundance and composition of bird communities along independent gradients of regional precipitation, local forest cover and landscape forest cover that serve as proxies for climate drying and habitat conversion. We conducted point counts at 150 sites and statistically accounted for imperfect detection to test how environmental variation shaped community-wide diversity metrics. Results We found that the three dimensions of diversity diverged in their responses to environmental gradients. Specifically, species richness increased linearly with precipitation, reached maximum values with intermediate tree cover at local scales and peaked at high levels of landscape tree cover. While phylogenetic diversity did not vary strongly across any gradient, functional diversity increased monotonically with both local and landscape-level tree cover. Maximum values of functional diversity only occurred in large patches of forest where the tree cover was >75% at both local and landscape scales. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect significant interactions between precipitation and tree cover gradients on any metric of local bird diversity. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that taxonomic diversity was more sensitive to environmental gradients than functional and phylogenetic diversity. The lack of synergies between precipitation and forest cover gradients on alpha diversity, at least in this system, simplifies the prospects of predicting future biodiversity change at local scales as our results suggest that climate change and land use act independently of one another.

Assessing the impacts of uncertainty in climate-change vulnerability assessments	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						adaptive capacity; climate models; exposure; freshwater crayfish; sensitivity; trait-based vulnerability assessment	EXTINCTION RISK; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; LIFE-HISTORY; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; GAPS	Aim The trait-based vulnerability assessment (TVA) uses Boolean rules to assess species sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure to climate change to identify those that are climate-change vulnerable. The protocol is being increasingly used to assess climate-change impacts to a diversity of taxa, as it requires fewer data compared to niche and mechanistic models. However, uncertainty in TVA results remains unevaluated. We present the first quantitative investigation of the impacts of uncertainty on TVA, using global freshwater crayfish (574 species) as a representative data-poor taxon. Location Global. Methods To assess uncertainty in trait selection, we measured the completeness of information for each trait and how these contributed to the number of vulnerable species. To explore the sensitivity of TVA outcomes to arbitrary threshold selection, we randomly scored 25% species as high for quantitative traits and compared the results to the standard TVA. To investigate uncertainty in climate model selections, we tested the TVA using 66 alternative global climate scenarios. Results Given the structural rules used in TVA, as more traits are included in the protocol, more species are identified as vulnerable to climate change. Some traits also have more dominant contributions. Species vulnerability was relatively robust to arbitrary thresholds in quantitative trait variables. The number (79-156) and identity of vulnerable species varied depending on which climate scenario was selected. Ensemble means of climate models identified fewer vulnerable species, potentially softening the extremes of individual climate models. Main conclusions Assessors applying TVA across taxa and geographical scales should use ecological thresholds for quantitative traits, where possible; most importantly perform sensitivity analyses, including (a) critically assessing assumptions and correlations underpinning the selection of traits in different dimensions; and (b) capturing variability among climate-change models. Further research is required to fill data gaps that improve the robustness of TVA.

Clustering and ensembling approaches to support surrogate-based species management	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						coarse; fine filter; multispecies management; Prairie Pothole Region; surrogate species	PRAIRIE POTHOLE REGION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; BIODIVERSITY; INDICATORS; HABITAT; FRAMEWORK; PREDICT; VULNERABILITY; EXTINCTION	Aim Surrogate species can provide an efficient mechanism for biodiversity conservation if they encompass the needs or indicate the status of a broader set of species. When species that are the focus of ongoing management efforts act as effective surrogates for other species, these incidental surrogacy benefits lead to additional efficiency. Assessing surrogate relationships often relies on grouping species by distributional patterns or by species traits, but there are few approaches for integrating outputs from multiple methods into summaries of surrogate relationships that can inform decision-making. Location Prairie Pothole Region of the United States. Methods We evaluated how well five upland-nesting waterfowl species that are a focus of management may act as surrogates for other wetland-dependent birds. We grouped species by their patterns of relative abundance at multiple scales and by different sets of traits, and evaluated whether empirical validation could effectively select among the resulting species groupings. We used an ensemble approach to integrate the different estimated relationships among species and visualized the ensemble as a network diagram. Results Estimated relationships among species were sensitive to methodological decisions, with qualitatively different relationships arising from different approaches. An ensemble provided an effective tool for integrating across different estimates and highlighted the Sora (Porzana carolina), American Avocet (Recurvirostra Americana) and Black Tern (Chlidonias niger) as the non-waterfowl species expected to show the strongest incidental surrogacy relationships with the waterfowl that are the focus of ongoing management. Main conclusions An ensemble approach integrated multiple estimates of surrogate relationship strength among species and allowed for intuitive visualizations within a network. By accounting for methodological uncertainty while providing a simple continuous metric of surrogacy, our approach is amenable to both further validation and integration into decision-making.

Incorporating habitat suitability into community projections: Ant responses to climate change in the Australian Wet Tropics	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						climate change; composition turnover; ecological environments; GDMs; habitat condition; rain forest	RAIN-FOREST; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; BETA DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SPACE; INVERTEBRATES; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EXTINCTIONS; DISTURBANCE; COMPETITION	Aim Studies of climate change impacts on animal distributions typically consider only the direct impacts of a changing climate, under the assumption that future areas of suitable climate will otherwise remain ecologically suitable. Here we assess both the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on rain forest ant communities, where substantial shifts are projected to occur for both climate and habitat types. Location Australian Wet Tropics (AWT). Methods Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling was used to model turnover in the composition of similar to 300 rain forest ant species sampled at 150 sites across six mountains spanning five degrees of latitude. Ants were sampled within the leaf litter, on the litter surface and on tree trunks. By modelling the rate of turnover among sites, we determined the current effective area of similar ecological environments (SEE) for ant communities and consequently the expected change in species persistence when habitat shifts under two climate projections for the years 2035, 2055 and 2085. We compared results when SEE considered only the direct effects of a changing climate, with those when changes in habitat were also included. Results The rain forest ant communities modelled will lose a substantial proportion of SEE under both climate change scenarios. Under combined direct (changes in climate) and indirect (changes in rain forest habitat) impacts of climate change, >90% of the communities in the region were predicted to lose up to half their similar habitats compared with 50%-60% when only considering direct climate change impacts. The highest risk of reduction in area of SEE is projected in drier inland areas of the AWT, where profound compositional turnover is linked to dramatic changes in rain forest vegetation, including extensive conversion into savanna. Main conclusions Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating habitat suitability into future projections of species turnover under a changing climate, particularly for habitats where vegetation structure is projected to undergo profound change.

Seasonal spatial segregation in blue sharks (Prionace glauca) by sex and size class in the Northeast Pacific Ocean	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						dynamic oceanographic variables; fisheries management; habitat partitioning; home range; spatial segregation; species distribution modelling	FISHERIES STOCK ASSESSMENT; CATCH RATES; PELAGIC HABITAT; DYNAMIC OCEAN; SHORTFIN MAKO; ATLANTIC; MOVEMENT; SPACE; TURTLES; DISTRIBUTIONS	Aim Animal tracking can provide unique insights into the ecology and conservation of marine species, such as the partitioning of habitat, including differences between life history stages or sexes, and can inform fisheries stock assessments, bycatch reduction and spatial management such as dynamic management. Location Northeast Pacific Ocean. Methods We used satellite tracking data from 47 blue sharks (Prionace glauca) from the Northeast Pacific to determine movements and home range along the west coast of North America, and sex-size class (immature females, mature males) specific habitat preferences using boosted regression trees. Using a suite of static and dynamic environmental variables, we determined distribution and habitat preferences across summer and fall for each sex-size class. Results We found that there was spatial segregation between sex-size classes particularly in the summer months with immature females found largely north of 33 degrees N, and males south of 35 degrees N. In fall, females travelled south, resulting in an overlap in distributions south of 37 degrees N. Sea surface temperature (SST), latitude and longitude were top predictors. However, immature females and adult males demonstrated unique habitat preferences including SST, with immature females preferring cooler temperatures (SST < 15 degrees C) than adult males in summer, and a broader band of SST than adult males in fall. All models performed well, explaining 50%-67% of deviance, and 23%-41% of deviance when predictions were cross-validated. Main conclusions We provide first insights into coastal movements and habitat preferences of blue sharks in the Northeast Pacific. We found that immature females undergo a seasonal southward migration in this more coastal habitat, similar to patterns observed in the North Atlantic. We also found some overlap between adult males and immature females in fall months, suggesting the importance of more coastal habitat in managing this species, particularly in determining population structure for blue shark stock assessments, and reducing blue shark bycatch.

Climatic predictors of species distributions neglect biophysiologically meaningful variables	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						climate change; conservation; plant physiology; range shifts; species distribution models	DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SOIL-MOISTURE; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; ECOLOGICAL THEORY; EXTREME WEATHER; IMPACTS; NICHE; SELECTION; PATTERNS; LIMITS	Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) have played a pivotal role in predicting how species might respond to climate change. To generate reliable and realistic predictions from these models requires the use of climate variables that adequately capture physiological responses of species to climate and therefore provide a proximal link between climate and their distributions. Here, we examine whether the climate variables used in plant SDMs are different from those known to influence directly plant physiology. Location Global. Methods We carry out an extensive, systematic review of the climate variables used to model the distributions of plant species and provide comparison to the climate variables identified as important in the plant physiology literature. We calculate the top 10 SDM and physiology variables at 2.5 degrees spatial resolution for the globe and use principal component analyses and multiple regression to assess similarity between the climatic variation described by both variable sets. Results We find that the most commonly used SDM variables do not reflect the most important physiological variables and differ in two main ways: (a) SDM variables rely on seasonal or annual rainfall as simple proxies of water available to plants and neglect more direct measures such as soil water content; and (b) SDM variables are typically averaged across seasons or years and overlook the importance of climatic events within the critical growth period of plants. We identify notable differences in their spatial gradients globally and show where distal variables may be less reliable proxies for the variables to which species are known to respond. Main conclusions There is a growing need for the development of accessible, fine-resolution global climate surfaces of physiological variables. This would provide a means to improve the reliability of future range predictions from SDMs and support efforts to conserve biodiversity in a changing climate.

Location Upper Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, UK. Methods Data on environment, macrophytes and invertebrates were assembled for three basins of a large central lake and its satellite floodplain lakes via field surveys and palaeolimnological analyses. Space-time interaction analyses of palaeoecological data were compared pre-1950 and post-1950. Multivariate analyses examined how connectivity, environment and zebra mussels influenced contemporary lake communities, and explain their divergence from historical communities in the past. Results Pre-1950, we found high community variation across sites and low within-lake variation in macrophytes, but progressive eutrophication accentuated within-lake community variation after 1950. Partitioning analysis showed larger effects of connectivity than nutrient enrichment on contemporary macrophyte composition, while local effects structured invertebrate communities. Three clusters of lakes were revealed according to variation in macrophyte composition, isolation from the central lake and nutrient enrichment: Group 1- the central lake and six nearby lakes were meso-eutrophic (TP = 66.7 +/- 47.6 mu g/L; TN = 0.79 +/- 0.41 mg/L) and had the highest zebra mussel abundances and organismal biodiversity; Group 2- Eight eutrophic (TP = 112 +/- 36.6 mu g/L; TN = 1.25 +/- 0.5 mg/L) and connected lakes; Group 3- Seven isolated and hypertrophic (TP = 163.2 +/- 101.5 mu g/L; TN = 1.55 +/- 0.3 mg/L) lakes. Pre-1950 palaeolimnological data for macrophytes and invertebrates for 5 lakes and a basin in the central lake most resembled extant lake communities of Group 1. However, palaeo-records revealed that macrophytes and invertebrates subsequently converged towards those of Groups 2 and 3. Main conclusions Our study reveals that the central "mother" lake acts as a hub for preserving biodiversity via shared hydrological connectivity with satellite lakes and high zebra mussel abundances. These may buffer the impoverishing effects of eutrophication and sustain unexpectedly high biodiversity in the short term. Such protective buffering, however, cannot be relied upon indefinitely to conserve biodiversity.

Ecosystem service bundles in global hinterlands	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						global; ecosystem services; teleconnections; bundles; urban ecology; hinterland; equity	URBAN LAND TELECONNECTIONS; TRADE; CONSERVATION; STEWARDSHIP; DISSERVICES; FRAMEWORK; GRADIENT; THREATS; DRIVES; GROWTH	In the face of projected increases in globalization and urbanization, there is growing recognition that cities and their hinterlands will play a pivotal role in both creating and addressing the sustainability challenges of the future. Hinterlands, the rural areas that surround cities, are connected to cities as the source of many of the ecosystem services (ES) that are used in urban areas. While much is known about the provision of multiple ES in and around a few well-studied cities, there is a limited amount of consistently measured, global-scale data about the provision of multiple ES in urban areas and their hinterlands. Wemapped eight ES globally, and examined how the production of ES varied between the hinterlands (within 200 km) of 768 major city centers (population. >. 500 000). We found that there are seven archetypes of ES supply bundles in global hinterlands. Hinterlands near wealthy cities are specialists in regulating ES production while the poorest and most populated hinterlands are specialists in food production, with low levels of regulating and cultural ES provision. These hinterlands also experience different synergies and tradeoffs between ES, with interesting implications for landscape management. Global teleconnections have likely also played a role in the ES bundles of hinterlands, since they have allowed cities to exploit remote areas to meet their demand for ES, undermining the traditional supply-demand relationship between each city and its proximal hinterland. These results emphasize the diverse, and sometimes inequitable, ways that urbanization and globalization are influencing ES supply in the planet's most human-modified landscapes.

We predicted that 1) species richness and ant diversity would increase with increasing park size, and species richness and ant diversity would be inversely related to distance from a peri-urban forest. 2) Larger ants would be predictably prevalent in less-complex habitats but the reverse should be true for small ants. The study was conducted in 47 parks of varying size located in Taichung City, Taiwan. In total, 14,324 ant individuals from 50 morphospecies and 22 genera were collected. No relationship between ant diversity and distance from a peri-urban forest. No significant clustering in functional composition with increasing park size and distance from a peri-urban forest. However, urban ant diversity marginally increased with increasing park size. Larger parks, characterize by heterogeneous fine-scale habitats, had the highest ant species and abundance of ants. The prevalences of opportunist, generalised myrmicinae (GM), and cryptic ant species were linked to increased soil moisture, number of tree species, and leaf litter depth. The positive association between GM and the number of trash bins. Our finding disproved the size-grain hypothesis, but hotter ground surface favored the presence of long-legged ants. The significant association between head width, inter-eye distance, eye width, and environmental variables such as understory vegetation cover, leaf litter depth, and soil temperature suggest that predaceous ants might be prevalent in heterogeneous fine-scale local microhabitats. In conclusion, our study evidenced the importance of heterogeneous fine-scale habitats in urban park to biodiversity.

A more functional and quantitative view of transpirational and shading effect, particularly the magnitude of both surface and air cooling potential can further strengthen motivations for urban tree planting. We investigated the transpirational and the surface cooling potential of two contrasting tree species in Munich, Germany: ring porous Robinia pseudoacacia L. and diffuse porous Tilia cordata Mill. Throughout the summer 2016 we monitored meteorological and edaphic variables and tree sap-flow along with the air temperature within and outside tree shade at different heights. With 30% higher leaf area index (LAI), double sap-flux density and sapwood area, T. cordata trees showed three times higher transpiration compared to the R. pseudoacacia. Consequently, T. cordata trees showed higher within canopy air cooling effect. Surface cooling (Delta T-shade) were higher under the denser canopies of T. cordata compared to R. pseudoacacia for asphalt surfaces but Delta T-shade for grass surfaces were not significantly different under the canopies of two species. Linear regression indicated a decrease in grass surface temperature of 3 degrees C with every unit of LAI but for asphalt, the reduction in surface temperature was about 6 degrees C. Additionally, higher water using efficiencies of R. pseudoacacia coupled with higher soil moisture and radiation probably increased the grass evapotranspiration and subsequently showed positive relationship with the near ground air cooling. Therefore, species with higher canopy density might be preferred over asphalt surfaces but low water using species with lower canopy density could be chosen over grass surfaces.

Being responsible for billions of avian deaths, bird-window collisions have been widely studied in the US and Canada, with few studies from Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Thus, there is still a dearth of knowledge regarding this alarming phenomenon in regions where biodiversity and urbanization peek, such as Latin America. In this study, we assessed bird-window collisions in Xalapa, a small-to-medium-sized Neotropical city located in Southeast Mexico. We gathered data under two schemes: (1) a standardized survey procedure and (2) non-systematic records. Regarding the former, we evaluated the role of building and surrounding vegetation traits, as well as the location of focal buildings in driving bird-window collisions. Considering both schemes, we recorded bird-window collisions for 43 species. The most frequent striking groups were hummingbirds and thrushes, which had already been identified as vulnerable given some of their natural and life history traits. Regarding the standardized survey, we found no statistical differences in the number of collisions among seasons; yet, we did record a predominance of strikes from resident bird species over migrants among all studied seasons. Our results show a significant positive relationship between the amount of surrounding vegetation area of the studied buildings and bird-window collision frequency, while building non-glass material area showed a significant negative relationship. Based on our findings and the limitations of our study, we encourage future research to combine systematic and standard surveys throughout the year with citizen science, together with carcass removal assessments and bird density surveys in the immediate vicinity of focal buildings.

We present a study investigating the relationship between bird species richness, abundance and assemblage to the built environment in Suva, Fiji. Field surveys were taken at 54 randomly selected sites throughout the city, stratified by three building density classes and the central business district (CBD). At each site bird counts were recorded, along with environmental data such as average building height, within a 150 m radius. Land-use information was obtained from screen digitized high-resolution satellite imagery within the same radius. Distance to undeveloped patches of land within the urban area was calculated using a GIS. Analysis of the effects of the built environment was carried out for all species, and for exotic and native species separately. Abundance of exotics was significantly higher in the central business district (CBD) than all other urban density classes, and significantly higher than natives in all other density classes. We found a negative relationship between native species richness and distance to undeveloped patches, but no relationship for exotics. Species assemblage was not related to urban density class. We conclude that the status of native and exotic bird species in Suva is similar to what has been found in urban areas in temperate climates, and conservation efforts should focus on minimizing the amount of heavily urbanized "core areas" and protecting undeveloped areas of forested vegetation to improve bird biodiversity in small tropical islands cities.

Escape in the city: urbanization alters the escape behavior of Anolis lizards	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Anolis cristatellus; Anole; Artificial substrates; Habituation; Flight-initiation distance; Structural habitat	FLIGHT INITIATION DISTANCE; TROPICAL LIZARD; RISK-ASSESSMENT; PERCH DIAMETER; URBAN; HABITAT; PERFORMANCE; MORPHOLOGY; HABITUATION; LOCOMOTION	Behavioral adjustments may allow organisms to cope with the drastic environmental change caused by urbanization. We compared the escape behavior of Anolis lizards during simulated predator approaches on trees in both urban and forest habitats and on artificial structures (i.e., cement walls and metal posts) in urban areas. We found that urban lizards were less wary on trees, likely due at least in part to habituation to humans. In contrast, lizards on cement walls showed greater wariness, which may reflect a behavioral modification when escaping because of poor locomotor performance on this substrate. In both habitats, lizards modulated escape responses in ways consistent with their performance abilities on the various substrates. Escape by jumping decreased when lizards used wider and more isolated perches, which are characteristic of urban sites. Urban lizards squirreled (i.e., moved to the opposite side of a structure) more on wider trees and metal posts, and sprinted more but never jumped from cement walls. These behavioral responses for predator escape are consistent with the structural habitat changes caused by urbanization. Urban habitats had larger diameter trees, sparser ground vegetation, and many artificial structures. We found that urban lizards showed behavioral modulations because of exposure to humans as well as the locomotor constraints of using some artificial structures, such as cement walls. The ability of urban lizards to alter their escape responses and adjust to novel features of the habitat may be important traits of species able to colonize and persist in urban areas.

Twenty-four farm ponds in Taoyuan City were selected and classified into five pond groups based on pond management practices. In total, 21 species, 17 genera, and 6 families of odonates were recorded for a total of 5701 individuals between June 2014 and July 2015. The abundance of Odonata was unrelated to pond size or distance to the nearest pond; however, odonate species richness was negatively and significantly correlated with pond size. Pond management practices considerably affected pond aquatic macrophytes and dike construction materials. Ecology park ponds under intense human management and undisturbed ponds without any human management had higher species richness than did the ponds in the other three fish farming groups. Species richness was highest in small and human-modified ponds. By contrast, species richness was lowest in two fish farming pond groups. These results suggest that pond management practices can increase or reduce odonate species richness depending on the alteration of pond microhabitat features. Our observations suggest that the enhanced habitat quality of small ponds provides an opportunity to protect freshwater biodiversity for local governmental civil servants in urbanized landscapes.

They may affect native species at a variety of scales, but a spatially explicit assessment of their effects is lacking. We studied the spatial pattern of native and invasive graminoids in Brazilian cerrado in southeastern Brazil and assessed the effects of vegetation type, elevation, and edges. We sampled native grasses, native sedges, and two invasive grass species (Urochloa decumbens and Melinis minutiflora) along three 301- to 1334-m-long transects encompassing grassland, forest, and savanna. We used wavelet transforms, generalized additive models, and null model simulations for analysis. Invasive grasses were mostly found in open vegetation. Neither native nor invasive species were consistently affected by elevation or edges. Much of the spatial variation could be explained by small-scale autocorrelation, but M. minutiflora had a more heterogeneous pattern than U. decumbens. Invasive grasses were negatively related to native ones at a variety of scales, from 1 to 66 m, and we observed both positive and negative relations between the two invasive species, with positive ones a finer scales. We hypothesize that spatial pattern characteristics of different invasive species may be related to their invasion potential.

Furthermore, we explored the relative contribution of species turnover and intraspecific variation to shifts in CWM values along the gradient. Forty sampling units (5x5m) were selected in a probabilistic way along a 1300m elevation gradient which crossed four thermotypes (thermometric belts). Leaf traits were measured in each sampling unit. ANOVA and a trend test for monotonic changes in variance were used to assess, respectively, CWM differences and variability in both the leaf traits across thermotypes. Variance decomposition of CWM values was used to identify the role of inter- and intraspecific variation. SLA and LA responded differently along the studied gradient in terms of abundance-weighted mean values and variability: CWM of SLA showed the lowest values in the driest thermotype, while LA in the more humid one; SLA variability showed a significant increasing trend with increased water availability, while LA variability did not show any pattern. The contribution of intraspecific trait variation was significant for both the leaf traits, but higher for SLA, where negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific variation was detected. We highlight the importance of simultaneously considering measurements of both leaf traits to understand the functional response of communities in Mediterranean environments. Moreover, neglecting intraspecific variation in leaf traits, even along steep gradients with relevant species compositional changes, can result in the underestimation of the amount of trait variation in response to environmental changes.

Liana cover in the canopies of rainforest trees is not predicted by local ground-based measures	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						canopy cover; liana biomass; lianas; liana-tree interactions; rainforest	TROPICAL FORESTS; LEAF-AREA; ABUNDANCE; DIVERSITY; BIOMASS; REGENERATION; ASSOCIATIONS; DYNAMICS; PROTOCOL; GAPS	Lianas (woody climbers) are structural parasites of trees that compete with them for light and below-ground resources. Most studies of liana-tree interactions are based on ground-level observations of liana stem density and size, with these assessments generally assumed to reflect the amount of liana canopy cover and overall burden to the tree. We tested this assumption in a 1-ha plot of lowland rainforest in tropical Australia. We recorded 1072 liana stems (>= 1 cm diameter at breast height {dbh}) ha(-1) across all trees (>= 10 cm dbh) on the plot and selected 58 trees for detailed study. We estimated liana canopy cover on selected trees that hosted 0-15 liana individuals, using a 47-m-tall canopy crane. Notably, we found no significant correlations between liana canopy cover and three commonly used ground-based measurements of liana abundance as follows: liana stem counts per tree, liana above-ground biomass per tree and liana basal area per tree. We also explored the role of tree size and liana infestation and found that larger trees (>= 20 cm dbh) were more likely to support lianas and to host more liana stems than smaller trees (<= 20 cm dbh). This pattern of liana stem density, however, did not correlate with greater liana coverage in the canopy. Tree family was also found to have a significant effect on likelihood of hosting lianas, with trees in some families 3-4 times more likely to host a liana than other families. We suggest that local ground-based measures of liana-tree infestation may not accurately reflect liana canopy cover for individual trees because they were frequently observed spreading through neighbouring trees at our site. We believe that future liana research will benefit from new technologies such as high-quality aerial photography taken from drones when the aim is to detect the relative burden of lianas on individual trees.

Hemiparasites drive heterogeneity in litter arthropods: Implications for woodland insectivorous birds	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						facilitation; insectivores; keystone resource; mistletoe; trophic cascade	PARASITIC PLANT; KEYSTONE RESOURCE; SEMIARID SAVANNA; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; MISTLETOE; COMMUNITIES; PRODUCTIVITY; DECOMPOSITION; DISPERSAL; DIVERSITY	Providing fruit, nectar, leaves and litter, mistletoes represent important resources for many organisms, linking above-ground patterns with below-ground processes. Here, we explore how mistletoe litter affects arthropod availability, especially those taxa preferentially consumed by ground-feeding insectivorous birds, a group that has undergone widespread declines. We estimated the influence of mistletoe on arthropod occurrence by sampling arthropod communities beneath infected and uninfected trees with pit-fall traps. Then, we experimentally isolated direct effects of mistletoe litter on arthropods with a litterbag study. Soil arthropod communities beneath infected trees had consistently greater abundance and biomass - total arthropods and the subset of arthropods preferentially consumed by ground-foraging insectivores - compared to otherwise comparable uninfected trees. Arthropods showed a weak response to litter addition, with maximum abundances recorded from bags with low mistletoe litter, significantly lower abundances associated with higher mistletoe fractions and pure tree litter (after 5 months). Our findings confirm that mistletoe occurrence has a significant positive impact on arthropod availability, especially on those preferred by ground-foraging bird insectivores. However, only a minor part of this impact is due to the direct, short-term effects of mistletoe litter, which suggests that additional mistletoe-mediated effects (e.g. local changes in structural or microclimatic factors, cumulative effects over multiple years) play significant roles. By altering arthropod assemblages within leaf litter and increasing the heterogeneity of resource availability on forest floors, mistletoe plays an important role in improving habitat quality for declining insectivores.

Therefore, understanding which processes shape how biodiversity is distributed along spatial and environmental gradients is a first step to guide conservation and management efforts. We aimed to determine the relative explanatory importance of biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial variables on assemblage dissimilarities and functional diversity of dung beetles along the Atlantic Forest-Pampa (i.e. forest-grassland) transition zone located in Southeast South America. We described each site according to their biogeographic position, environmental conditions, landscape features and spatial patterns. The compositional dissimilarity was partitioned into turnover and nestedness components of beta-diversity. Mantel tests and generalised dissimilarity models were used to relate beta-diversity and its components to biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial variables. Variation partitioning analysis was used to estimate the pure and shared variation in species composition and functional diversity explained by the four categories of predictors. Biome domain was the main factor causing dung beetle compositional dissimilarity, with a high species replacement between Atlantic Forest and Pampa. Biogeographic, environmental, landscape and spatial distances also affected the patterns of dung beetle dissimilarity and beta-diversity components. The shared effects of the four sets of predictors explained most of the variation in dung beetle composition. A similar response pattern was found for dung beetle functional diversity, which excluded biogeographic effects. Only the pure effects of environmental and spatial predictors were significant for species composition and functional diversity. Our results indicate that dung beetle species composition and functional diversity are jointly driven by environmental, landscape and spatial predictors with higher pure environmental and spatial effects. The forest-grassland transition zone promotes a strong species and trait replacement highly influenced both by environmental filtering and dispersal limitation.

Experimental warming alters the relative survival and emigration of two dung beetle species from an Australian dung pat community	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; dung beetle; ecosystem service; ecosystem service provider; global warming	ELEVATIONAL RANGE SHIFTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ECONOMIC VALUE; COLEOPTERA; SCARABAEIDAE; RESPONSES; INSECT	To preserve insect-mediated ecosystem services under ongoing climate change, it is necessary to first understand the impact that warming will have on the insects that provide or mediate these services. Furthermore, because responses of a species may be modified by interactions with competitors, it is informative to examine warming effects on organisms and service provision under competition. Dung beetles provide numerous services to agriculture by burying the manure of other animals. To understand the potential impacts of climate warming on ecosystem service provision, we exposed two dung beetle species (Sisyphus rubrus and Euoniticellus fulvus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)), occurring together in the same experimental pats, to warming and measured reproduction (dung ball production and burial, brood production, and egg laying), pat departure behaviour and survival of both species. These two species are likely competitors in pastures in northern New South Wales. To simulate climate warming, we used custom-built chambers to add offsets (+0, +2 or +4 degrees C) to field recorded, diurnally fluctuating baseline temperatures. There was no direct effect of increased temperature on any measured trait in either species. We did find however that the relative survival of the two species depended on temperature; S. rubrus had a higher probability (resulting in greater odds) of surviving than E. fulvus in the +0 and +4 degrees C offset chambers, but not in the +2 degrees C offset chambers. Likewise, the relative likelihood of the different species leaving a dung pat was temperature dependent; in the +2 degrees C offset chambers, E. fulvus were more likely to leave than S. rubrus, but not in the +0 and +4 degrees C offsets chambers. Our results highlight that it may be important for future studies to consider warming effects on relative survival and emigration because such effects could potentially lead to changes in dung beetle species composition.

Morphology can characterise the morphometric niche of species and can be represented as body shape points within a morphometric universe. This information can be to calculate the morphometric diversity of communities through hypervolume metrics, and the hole sizes that remain in the morphometric hypervolume, which are empty areas with no species. Such holes may be 'natural' or caused by a local extinction. In this study, we evaluate the ecological community of dung beetles through the lens of morphometric diversity. We evaluated 38 dung beetle species from 30 subtropical communities in southern Brazil sampled in the summer of 2015, including 15 forest remnant communities from the Atlantic Forest and 15 communities from adjacent maize cultivations. The shape of 495 dung beetle specimens was measured using geometric morphometric and hypervolume techniques to calculate the morphometric diversity and the hole size of each of the 30 communities. We found that the taxonomic diversity positively correlated with the morphometric diversity and negatively correlated with the size of the holes. We also found that forest communities had higher values of morphometric diversity and smaller holes in the hypervolume than the maize cultivation communities, suggesting that local extinction may reduce community body shape spaces.

Our aim was to relate lizard species distribution patterns in rainforest environments to variation in environmental gradients, and provide ecologically based metrics for establishing buffer zones around streams. Lizards were sampled three times in 41 standardised transects near Manaus, Brazil, only in dry season, with Time Limited Visual Search associated with raking through leaf litter. We recorded 20 species from 10 families and used non-metric multidimensional scaling to reduce the dimensionality of quantitative and qualitative compositions of species. Multiple linear regression models indicated that the environmental gradients distance to nearest stream, extent of canopy openness, vegetation density and slope did not significantly influence assemblage species distribution, with an indication of effect of litter depth. By means of piecewise linear regression, the use of riparian zone was estimated at similar to 190 m from quantitative species composition and similar to 211 m from qualitative species composition. Five species occurred only in the riparian zone. Our results suggest that conservation of the entire riparian lizard assemblage in Amazonian rainforest is likely to require protection of at least a 211 m buffer on either side of streams.

Reforestation is an important tool for sequestering carbon, so we sought to determine how replanted native trees responded to weather, soil conditions and planting characteristics. We measured girth growth of 13 tree species in 19 native mixed-species plantings and one remnant in south-eastern Australia, bimonthly from 2011 to 2016; replantings ranged between 6 and 46 years at the commencement of measurements. Band dendrometers (flexible bands that record changes in girth) were used to measure growth, with 34 measurements per tree taken over 5 years. We used outcomes from models with several plausible weather future scenarios (Dry, Wet, Wet-to-Dry and Average) for 25 and 50 years for tree girth, and 25 years for carbon accumulation, into the future. Woody species richness enhanced girth growth of all tree species. Higher maximum temperatures and reduced rainfall, which generally are predicted for the region over coming decades, retarded growth of nine tree species. Planting tree density had no discernible association with growth for the range of planting densities used. The most and least carbon were sequestered in Wet and Dry projections, respectively. Three Acacia spp. (N-fixers) grew slowest and would sequester least carbon, while four species of Eucalyptus grew fastest. These measurements of growth provide critical information for land managers to guide choice in replanting strategies for carbon storage.

Estimating site occupancy and detectability of the threatened partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii) using camera traps	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						decline; feral cats; fire; monitoring; partridge pigeon	KAKADU NATIONAL-PARK; NORTHERN-TERRITORY; SMALL MAMMALS; FERAL CATS; DECLINE; EXTINCTION; FAUNA; POPULATIONS; VEGETATION; AUSTRALIA	Since European settlement, many granivorous birds of northern Australia's savanna landscapes have declined. One such example, the partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii), has suffered a significant range contraction, disappearing from at least half of its pre-European range. Multiple factors have been implicated in this decline, including the loss of traditional Aboriginal burning practices, grazing by large exotic herbivores and predation by feral cats (Felis catus). While populations of partridge pigeon on the Tiwi Islands may be particularly important for the long-term persistence of this species, they too may be at risk of decline. However, as a reliable method to detect this species has not yet been developed and tested, we lack the ability to identify, at an early stage, the species' decline in a given location or region. This severely limits our capacity to make informed management decisions. Here, we demonstrate that the standard camera trapping approach for native mammal monitoring in northern Australia attained an overall probability of detecting partridge pigeon greater than 0.98. We thus provide a robust estimate of partridge pigeon site occupancy (0.30) on Melville Island, the larger of the two main Tiwi Islands. The information presented here for the partridge pigeon represents a critical first step towards the development of optimal monitoring programmes with which to gauge population trajectories, as well as the response to remedial management actions. In the face of ongoing biodiversity loss, such baseline information is vital for management agencies to make informed decisions and should therefore be sought for as many species as possible.

Climatic conditions and related variables, such as evapotranspiration, vary in response to topographical complexity. This complexity plays an important role in the provision of climate refugia. In 2008/2009, an island-wide dieback event of the keystone cushion plant Azorella macquariensis Orchard (Apiaceae) occurred on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. This signalled the start of a potential regime shift, suggested to be driven by increasing vapour pressure deficit. Eight years later, we quantified cover and dieback across the range of putative microclimates to which the species is exposed, with the aim of explaining dieback patterns. We test for the influence of evapotranspiration using a suite of topographic proxies and other variables as proposed drivers of change. We found higher cover and lower dieback towards the south of the island. The high spatial variation in A. macquariensis populations was best explained by latitude, likely a proxy for macroscale climate gradients and geology. Dieback was best explained by A. macquariensis cover and latitude, increasing with cover and towards the north of the island. The effect sizes of terrain variables that influence evapotranspiration rates were small. Island-wide dieback remains conspicuous. Comparison between a subset of sites and historical data revealed a reduction of cover in the north and central regions of the island, and a shift south in the most active areas of dieback. Dieback remained comparatively low in the south. The presence of seedlings was independent of dieback. This study provides an empirical baseline for spatial variation in the cover and condition of A. macquariensis, both key variables for monitoring condition and 'cover-debt' in this critically endangered endemic plant species. These findings have broader implications for understanding the responses of fellfield ecosystems and other Azorella species across the sub-Antarctic under future climates.

Environmental drivers of humpback whale foraging behavior in the remote Southern Ocean	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Foraging behavior; Habitat use; Migration; Telemetry; Whales	ANTARCTIC KRILL; SEA-ICE; EUPHAUSIA-SUPERBA; MOVEMENT ECOLOGY; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; DIEL VARIATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BALEEN WHALES; ARRIVAL DATE; ROSS SEA	Satellite telemetry and animal movement models advance our ability to remotely monitor the behavior of wideranging species. Understanding how different behaviors (e.g. foraging) are shaped by dynamic environmental features is fundamental to understanding ecological interactions and the impact of variability. In this study we deployed satellite-linked tags on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and used state-space models to estimate locations and to infer underlying behavioral states. We then modelled the association between whale behavior (e.g. foraging or transiting) and environmental variables using linear mixed-effect models, We identified the importance of two recently discovered Southern Ocean feeding areas for Oceania humpback whales as well as the key environmental drivers affecting whale behavior. We detected behavioral differences between whales utilizing the two adjacent feeding regions (similar to 2000 km apart), which were likely caused by animals trying to efficiently locate prey in relation to the dynamic environmental characteristics of each habitat. We observed a seasonal pattern in foraging behavior, with the peak occurring in the middle of summer. Whales also foraged more intensively with increasing proximity to areas from which the ice edge had recently retreated, suggesting heightened productivity in these areas. The relationship between the animals and the physical features of the seascape, as well as the behavioral plasticity observed, could have implications for the future recovery of these whales in a changing Southern Ocean.

Spatial and temporal diving behavior of non-breeding common murres during two summers of contrasting ocean conditions	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Seabirds; Tracking; Marine heatwave; Diving behavior; Uria aalge; Diel activity	THICK-BILLED MURRES; NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CURRENT; DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; HABITAT-USE; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MARINE BIRD; SEABIRD; PREY	Successful foraging of marine predators depends on environmental conditions, which also influence prey availability. Neutral or negative El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation ocean conditions during the summer of 2013 and strongly positive conditions during the summer of 2015 in the northern California Current System provided a case study to evaluate a marine predator's response to anomalously warm conditions. We used satellite transmitters with saltwater switches to track movements and estimate dive behavior among non-breeding common murres (Uria aalge) off Oregon prior to and during a marine heatwave. We quantified differences in space-use between years, applied linear mixed models to determine environmental influences (e.g. sea surface temperature, surface salinity, chlorophyll a, ocean depth, and calendar date) on dive frequency and dive duration, and contrasted dive activity between time of day, year, and sexes. The majority of birds dispersed away from capture locations, which were situated near the southern range limit of their population. In both years, murres used the Salish Sea and the Columbia River plume; however, murres spent more time foraging in the Columbia River plume and in continental slope habitat during the marine heatwave of 2015. During 2015, dive frequency was reduced, and dive durations were almost twice as long during daytime indicating deeper or more dispersed prey. Increased dive frequency was positively associated with temperature, chlorophyll a, and crepuscular periods. Cluster analysis of dive activity and the top-ranked predictive dive duration model revealed associations between longer-duration dives and decreased dive frequency, marine slope habitat, and cooler ocean temperatures. Murres were relatively inactive throughout the night and we found no sex differences in dive activity. Changes in common murre foraging tactics were associated with ocean warming and revealed selectivity in spatial and temporal use of foraging habitats. Productive marine features including the Columbia River plume provided refuge for murres during apparently poor ocean conditions associated with the marine heatwave. Identifying refuge areas used by highly mobile species experiencing varying ocean conditions is critical for adaptive marine spatial planning that can accommodate a changing ocean climate.

Chemical fingerprints suggest direct familiarisation rather than phenotype matching during olfactory recognition in Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Chemical communication; Mother-offspring recognition; Olfaction; Pinniped; Neophoca cinerea	KIN RECOGNITION; INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION; VOCAL RECOGNITION; MOTHER; COMMUNICATION; ODORS	Olfaction is one of the most commonly used senses for communication among animals and is of particular importance to mother-offspring recognition in mammals. The use of smell in offspring recognition has been well studied, however, we often lack information about the underlying mechanistic basis for olfactory recognition. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we examine chemical profiles of two different colonies of Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) and assess similarity of chemical fingerprints in mother-pup pairs. This analysis allows us to examine whether a chemical base for phenotype matching exists in this species. Our results showed no GC-detectible mother-offspring similarity in the overall chemical fingerprints, suggesting that direct familiarisation is a more likely mechanism used by Australian sea lion mothers for recognition of their young. Our analysis also demonstrates that colony differences are encoded within chemical fingerprints and appear to be highly influenced by environmental compounds. The study improves our understanding of how Australian sea lion females use odours for selective offspring recognition and the potential importance of environmentally acquired chemical compounds in the overall odour bouquet used in mother-pup interactions.

However, differences in building-specific properties (building location, size, construction material, etc.) pose a major challenge in development of generic policy on buildings. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between energy and resource management policies, and building-specific characteristics on environmental impacts of refurbished office buildings in New Zealand.MethodsLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed for 17 office buildings operating under seven representative climatic conditions found in New Zealand. Each building was assessed under fourpolicy scenarios: (i) business-as-usual, (ii) use of on-site photovoltaic (PV) panels, (iii) electricity supply from a renewable energy grid, and (iv) best practice construction activities adopted at site. The influence of 15 building-specific characteristics in combination with each scenario was evaluated. The study adopted regression analysis, more specifically Kruskal-Wallis and General Additive Modeling (GAM), to support interpretation of the LCA results.Results and discussionAll the chosen policies can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation as compared to business-as-usual. However, the Kruskal-Wallis results highlight policies on increasing renewable energy sources supplying national grid electricity can substantially reduce the impacts across most environmental impact categories. Better construction practices should be prioritized over PV installation as use of on-site PV significantly increases the environmental impacts related to use of resources. The GAM results show on-site PV could be installed in low-rise buildings in regions with long sunshine hours. The results also show the strong influence of facade elements and technical equipment in determining the environmental performance of small and large buildings, respectively. In large multi-storied buildings, efficient HVAC and smaller window area are beneficial features, while in small buildings the choice of facade materials with low embodied impacts should be prioritized.ConclusionsIn general, the study highlighted the importance of policies on increasing renewable energy supply from national grid electricity to substantially reduce most of the impacts related to buildings. In addition, the study also highlighted the importance of better construction practices and building-specific characteristics to reduce the impacts related to resource use. These findings can support policy makers to prioritize strategies to improve the environmental performance of existing buildings in New Zealand and in regions with similar building construction and climate.

Overlay images obtained using Quadcopter were used to generate two spatial three-dimensional (3D) cloud points in two different qualities. Point clouds were processed using R program in order to produce tree data using CHM. The sensitivity of CHM-based tree data was revealed using 318 tree measurements in 32 different sampling units. Estimation and measurement values were classified based on their structure from motion (SfM) quality and cover classes, and the statistical relationships among them were analyzed. Without any classification, R-2 was calculated for TC, THMean, and TCCA(Total) estimations and field measurements. R-2 values were calculated as 0.865, 0.778, and 0.869, respectively, for SfM(Highest) CHM, while they were calculated as 0.863, 0.736, and 0.843, respectively, for SfM(Medium) CHM. In addition, sensitivity and performance ranking in different groups were determined based on root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values. A significant difference was observed among groups in terms of quality and cover for TH, while no significant differences were observed for TCCA. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the properties of SfM CHM-based young coniferous stand. It was understood that tree density, crown shape, and branching influenced the accuracy of the present study. The developed UAV (Drone)-SfM is a promising technique for further small-scale forestry studies.

Overwintering strategies may embrace both behavioral and physiological adaptations and result in differential responses. To address the effects of low temperature and feeding treatments (feeding or starving) in two common invasive goby species of the River Rhine, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and the monkey goby (Neogobius fluviatilis) we monitored locomotor activity and measured oxygen consumption at 5 degrees C in monthly intervals for 90days. Under still warm water conditions at 15 degrees C as a baseline, locomotor activity did not differ between the two species, but N. melanostomus had a higher metabolic rate. During the course of the 5 degrees C cold overwintering period, the behavioral responses were strikingly different between the two species: N. melanostomus maintained higher activity levels regardless of the feeding treatment, while N. fluviatilis showed a lower activity with a strong response to the feeding treatment. After 90days of simulated winter condition, the starved groups of both species increased their locomotor activity. Oxygen consumption on the other hand showed no differences between fed and starved N. fluviatilis. In contrast, N. melanostomus had a stronger response to temperature per se and for starving individuals consistently lower metabolic rates. We conclude that the two locally most abundant fish species adopted two different overwintering strategies. N. fluviatilis applies a low energy expenditure strategy resulting in a high survival rate even under starvation. N. melanostomus applies a more risky high energy expenditure strategy with increased activity levels under extended periods of starvation.

This paper examines the effects spawner numbers, spawner timing, water temperature, flow rate, turbidity, habitat cover, gravel area, and food concentration on superimposition, temperature induced egg mortality, predation, stranding, poor condition mortality, age at out-migration, length at out-migration, number of out-migrants, and juvenile size distribution. Notable results included: flow's lack of effect on juvenile stranding and small effect on final out-migrant count, the degree to which flow affects superimposition risk, temperature having the largest effect on final juvenile out-migrant count, the interaction between predation and temperature induced egg mortality which produces a constantly decreasing out-migration count with temperature, and the level at which gravel additions would not have added benefits for superimposition mortality. While this method uses simulations, and thus will not have perfectly fidelity to the system, it is a cost-effective and quick method for gaining a mechanistically derived understanding of the complex relationships between numerous drivers and response variables.

We evaluated how intra and interspecific competition affects the degree of individual specialization in food resource use within sub-populations of Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus. To do so, we identified food items from fishes collected in the Pantanal wetland. We tested whether individual specialization was related to H. unitaeniatus density (a proxy of intraspecific competition) or to the density of a potential interspecific competitor (Hoplias malabaricus) using a multiple regression. Dietary variation was related to ontogeny. Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus density, instead of Hoplias malabaricus density, had an effect on the specialization of H. unitaeniatus individuals. A greater the density of H. unitaeniatus leads to a greater individual specialization. Our results point to a lack of specialization in H. unitaeniatus individuals. In addition, intra and not interspecific competition affected the use of food resources. Individuals of denser populations may consume secondary resources, reducing the effects of intraspecific competition and becoming more specialists.

Population genetic evidence for a unique resource of Nile tilapia in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Invasive species; Hybridization; Conservation genetics; Stock structure	OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS L.; DIVERSITY; FISH; DIFFERENTIATION; CONSERVATION; SOFTWARE; SERIES; SPP.	Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is one of the most important species in Tanzania for inland fisheries and aquaculture. Although indigenous to the country, it is only naturally distributed within the margins of Lake Tanganyika and peripheral water bodies. The widespread distribution across other parts of the country is a consequence of introductions that started in the 1950s. We investigated the population genetic structure of Nile tilapia across Tanzania using nuclear microsatellite markers, and compared the head and body morphology of populations using geometric morphometric analyses. We found the Lake Tanganyika population to be genetically distinct from the introduced populations. However, there were no clear morphological differences in head and body shape that distinguished the Lake Tanganyika population from the others. We conclude that the Lake Tanganyika population of Nile tilapia represents a unique genetic resource within the country. We suggest that Nile tilapia aquaculture within the Lake Tanganyika catchment should be restricted to the indigenous strain.

Comparative Analysis of Anuran Amphibian Skin Microbiomes Across Inland and Coastal Wetlands	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Microbiome; Anuran amphibian; Frog; Mutualism; Skin; Pathogen resistance; Bacteria; Secondary salinization	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS; SALINITY TOLERANCE; COMMUNITY; CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS; IMPACT; WATER; DIVERSITY; BACTERIA; ECOLOGY	Amphibians host a community of microbes on their skin that helps resist infectious disease via the dual influence of anti-pathogenic microbial species and emergent community dynamics. Many frogs rely on freshwater habitats, but salinization is rapidly increasing saltwater concentrations in wetlands around the globe, increasing the likelihood that frogs will come into contact with salt-contaminated habitats. Currently, we know little about how increased salt exposure will affect the symbiotic relationship between the skin microbes and frog hosts. To better understand how salt exposure in a natural context affects the frog skin microbiome, we use Hyla cinerea, a North American treefrog species that can inhabit brackish wetlands, to explore three questions. First, we determine the extent that microbial communities in the environment and on frog skin are similar across populations. Second, we assess the microbial species richness and relative abundance on frogs from habitats with different salinity levels to determine how salinity affects the microbiome. Third, we test whether the relative abundances of putatively pathogen-resistant bacterial species differ between frogs from inland and coastal environments. We found that the frog microbiome is more similar among frogs than to the microbial communities found in surface water and soil, but there is overlap between frog skin and the environmental samples. Skin microbial community richness did not differ among populations, but the relative abundances of microbes were different across populations and salinities. We found no differences in the relative abundances of the anti-fungal bacteria Janthinobacterium lividum, the genus Pseudomonas, and Serratia marcescens, suggesting that environmental exposure to saltwater has a limited influence on these putatively beneficial bacterial taxa.

Understanding the roles plant rhizosphere soil microbiome play during RKN infection is very important. The current study aims at investigating the impacts of soil microbiome on the activity of RKN. In this study, the 16S rRNA genes of the bacterial communities from nematode-infested and non-infested rhizosphere soils from four different plants were sequenced on the Illumina Hi-Seq platform. The soil microbiome effects on RKN infection were tested in a greenhouse assay. The non-infested soils had more microbial diversity than the infested soils from all plant rhizospheres, and both soil types had exclusive microbial communities. The inoculation of the microbiomes from eggplant and cucumber non-infested soils to tomato plants significantly alleviated the RKN infection, while the microbiome from infested soil showed increased the RKN infection. Furthermore, bacteria Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. were screened out from non-infested eggplant soil and exhibited biocontrol activity to RKN on tomato. Our findings suggest that microbes may regulate RKN infection in plants and are involved in biocontrol of RKN.

These pollinators encounter a diverse array of microbes when foraging for food and nest-building materials on various plants. To test the hypothesis that food and nest-building source affects the composition of the bee-nest microbiome, we exposed M. rotundata adults to treatments that varied both floral and foliar source in a 2x2 factorial design. We used 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing to capture the bacterial and fungal diversity of the bee nests. We found that nest microbial communities were significantly different between treatments, indicating that bee nests become inoculated with environmentally derived microbes. We did not find evidence of interactions between the fungi and bacteria within our samples. Furthermore, both the bacterial and fungal communities were quite diverse and contained numerous exact sequence variants (ESVs) of known plant and bee pathogens that differed based on treatment. Our research indicates that bees deposit plant-associated microbes into their nests, including multiple plant pathogens such as smut fungi and bacteria that cause blight and wilt. The presence of plant pathogens in larval pollen provisions highlights the potential for bee nests to act as disease reservoirs across seasons. We therefore suggest that future research should investigate the ability of bees to transmit pathogens from nest to host plant.

It is acquired during and after birth and involves both maternal and environmental factors as well as the genetic disposition of the offspring. However, it is unclear if the microbiome development is directly triggered by the mode of delivery and very early contact with the mother or mostly at later stages of initial development mainly by breast milk provided by the mother. To investigate to what extent the gut microbiome composition of the offspring is determined by the nursing mother, providing breast milk, compared to the birth mother during early development, a cross-fostering experiment involving two genetically different mouse lines was developed, being prone to be obese or lean, respectively. The microbiome of the colon was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, when the mice were 3weeks old. The nursing mother affected both alpha- and beta-diversity of the offspring's gut microbiome and shaped its composition. Especially bacterial families directly transferred by breast milk, like Streptococcaceae, or families which are strongly influenced by the quality of the breast milk like Rikenellaceae, showed a strong response. The core microbiome transferred from the obese nursing mother showed a higher robustness in comparison to the microbiome transferred from the lean nursing mother. Overall, the nursing mother impacts the gut microbial composition of the offspring during early development and might play an important role for health and disease of the animals at later stages of life.

Soil microbial communities contribute to soil fertility by the decomposition of the organic matter (OM), but little is known about the effect of whole-tree harvesting (WTH) in comparison to stem only harvesting (SOH) on soil microbial functional diversity in Eucalyptus plantations. We studied the effects of harvest residue management (branches, leaves, bark) of Eucalyptus grandis trees on soil enzymatic activities and community-level physiological profiles in a Brazilian plantation. We measured soil microbial enzymatic activities involved in OM decomposition and we compared the community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of the soil microbes in WTH and SOH plots. WTH decreased enzyme activities and catabolic potential of the soil microbial community. Furthermore, these negative effects on soil functional diversity were mainly observed below the 0-5cm layer (5-10 and 10-20cm), suggesting that WTH can be harmful to the soil health in these plantations.

Herbivory and inbreeding affect growth, reproduction, and resistance in the rhizomatous offshoots of Solanum carolinense (Solanaceae)	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Clonal plants; Herbivory; Inducible defenses; Inbreeding; Manduca sexta; Solanum carolinense	CLONAL PLANT; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY; ECOLOGICAL COSTS; DEFENSE; RESPONSES; HORSENETTLE; INTEGRATION; DEPRESSION; BENEFITS	Resource sharing within clonal plant networks can occur via the translocation of water, nutrients, and photoassimilates through rhizomes and stolons. Similar mechanisms may mediate the sharing of information (e.g., about herbivory or other environmental stressors) among ramets via molecular or biochemical signals. The storage of such information in belowground structures could facilitate the transmission of appropriate phenotypic responses across growing seasons in perennial species. However, few previous studies have explored the potential transfer of ecologically relevant information within such networks. This study addresses the effects of foliar herbivory and belowground overwintering on the growth and flowering, physical defenses, and herbivore resistance in the clonally spreading species Solanum carolinense L. (Solanaceae). We used rhizomes from inbred and outbred plants that were repeatedly exposed to feeding damage by Manduca sexta L. (Sphingidae) caterpillars and rhizomes from undamaged control plants. These rhizomes were either planted immediately or exposed to overwintering conditions and allowed to produce new ramets (rhizomatous offshoots). We then assessed offshoot emergence, flowering, physical defense traits, and herbivore performance. Relative to controls, offshoots of herbivore-damaged plants exhibited greater spine and trichome densities, and reduced performance of M. sexta larvae. However, they also emerged and flowered significantly later, and produced fewer flowers than offshoots of undamaged plants. Inbreeding also negatively affected offshoot emergence, flowering, trichome production, and herbivore resistance. These effects of parental herbivory were more pronounced in outbred offshoots, indicating that inbreeding may compromise the trans-seasonal induction of plant defenses. Finally, exposure to overwintering conditions increased trichome production and reduced caterpillar performance on offshoots. Together, these results show that induced defenses can be transmitted through rhizomes and affect offshoot growth, flowering, defensive traits, and herbivore resistance. They also document fitness-related costs associated with defense induction in offshoots and suggest that the transfer of defenses across seasons can be compromised by inbreeding.

Previous study has assumed that current morphological differences between adults from the donor and refuge lakes have arisen through phenotypic plasticity. The present study compared the morphologies of whitefish at three life stages: alevins and fry raised in a common garden, and wild-caught adults. Alevins were clearly distinguishable by their lake of origin. Loch Sloy alevins were distinguishable also by family, although this was not the case for Loch Lomond. Differential allometric trajectories facilitated the persistence of morphological differences associated with lake of origin through the fry stage into adulthood. Overall, the whitefish from Loch Lomond displayed morphologies associated with pelagic feeders, while the more robust heads and ventrally positioned snouts of the Loch Sloy whitefish conformed to expectations for more benthic feeding habits. That differences between populations were present not only in wild adults, but also in alevins and fry from a common garden setup, strongly suggests that the divergence between populations is due to inheritance mechanisms, rather than differential plastic responses, and questions the effectiveness of translocation as a conservation measure.

Selection on growth rates via a trade-off between survival to sexual maturity and longevity in the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Growth rates; Selection; Swordtail fishes; Alternative reproductive tactics; Growth-mortality optimization	AGE; MICROSTRUCTURE; MORTALITY; OTOLITHS; JUVENILE; BEHAVIOR	There is growing evidence across taxa for a mortality-growth rate tradeoff, however the extent to which individuals experience selection both for and against growing faster in the wild can be difficult to assess. We used otoliths to assess growth rates in the wild for Xiphophorus multilineatus, a species of swordtail fish with genetically influenced male alternative reproductive tactics. The ARTs are thought to be maintained due to a trade-off between a higher probability of reaching sexual maturity (smaller sneaker males) and maturing later as a large male with higher mating success (larger courter males). We show that the early juvenile growth rates of the subadult courter males were faster as compared to the other juveniles, potentially suggesting selection for growing faster to increase the probability of reaching sexual maturity. However, variance in the early juvenile growth rates of adult courter males was reduced (truncating high values) as compared to the subadult courter males and overall growth rates were faster in the subadult courter males than the adult courter males. These results support a cost of growing faster as juveniles: reduced longevity as an adult. We also detected a negative relationship between the early growth rates of females and their age, further supporting a longevity cost to growing faster. While both male ARTs are likely to experience stabilizing selection on growth rates, the differences between the morphs in how they optimize this tradeoff in relation to overall fitness (courters optimize growing faster to increase probability of reaching sexual maturity, sneakers optimize longevity as adults) has the potential to lead to disruptive selection between the ARTs on growth rates. We show that the data collected here is consistent with the growth-mortality optimization hypothesis and highlight some of the challenges that stabilizing selection presents for examining adaptive variation of growth rates in a natural environment.

Understanding these changes is of crucial importance to predict the future changes in distribution ranges, and the possible impacts of expanding species on the colonized environments. Both theoretical and empirical studies have provided some evidence for an increased dispersal at the range edge of expanding populations. Because this phenomenon has been documented on large spatial scales, it seems difficult to determine what proportion of the phenotypic variation is due to the expansion process (spatial sorting) versus spatial variation in the environment (local adaptation). The aim of our study is to determine whether, in a small and recent expanding population, the dispersal capacity is increased at the range edge compared to the range core despite a minimal role of local adaptation. We studied the modification of dispersal capacity at the range edge of an expanding population of the African clawed frog, Xenopuslaevis recently settled in Western France. To do so, we used experiments to compare movements of individuals depending on their location in the population, and capture-mark-recapture field surveys to estimate variation in traits related to dispersal across the invasive range. Both methods consistently showed significantly higher dispersal rates and distances, as well as in the relative length of the hind limb, at the range edge, for both sexes. This result is the first report suggesting that changes in allocation to dispersal, and not only traits associated with dispersal, can occur at a small geographical and temporal scale, where the role of local adaptation is likely minimal. This study fills a gap in an issue where it is currently crucial, for conservation purposes, to understand the mechanisms involved in range expansions.

Survival costs of reproduction are mediated by parasite infection in wild Soay sheep	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						costs of reproduction; fitness; immunity; infection; life history; peri-parturient rise; trade-offs	OVIS-ARIES L; TRADE-OFFS; POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS; NATURAL-SELECTION; IMMUNE FUNCTION; FITNESS COSTS; SEX; AGE; RESISTANCE; LACTATION	A trade-off between current and future fitness potentially explains variation in life-history strategies. A proposed mechanism behind this is parasite-mediated reproductive costs: individuals that allocate more resources to reproduction have fewer to allocate to defence against parasites, reducing future fitness. We examined how reproduction influenced faecal egg counts (FEC) of strongyle nematodes using data collected between 1989 and 2008 from a wild population of Soay sheep in the St. Kilda archipelago, Scotland (741 individuals). Increased reproduction was associated with increased FEC during the lambing season: females that gave birth, and particularly those that weaned a lamb, had higher FEC than females that failed to reproduce. Structural equation modelling revealed future reproductive costs: a positive effect of reproduction on spring FEC and a negative effect on summer body weight were negatively associated with overwinter survival. Overall, we provide evidence that parasite resistance and body weight are important mediators of survival costs of reproduction.

However, it remains unclear whether impacts of non-native species arise from their high abundance or whether each non-native individual has a disproportionate impact - that is, a higher per-capita effect - on co-occurring species compared to impacts by native species. Using a long-term study of wetlands, we asked how temporal variation in dominant native and non-native plants impacted the abundance and richness of other plants in the recipient community. Non-native plants reached higher abundances than natives and had greater per-capita effects. The abundance-impact relationship between plant abundance and richness was nonlinear. Compared with increasing native abundance, increasing non-native abundance was associated with steeper declines in richness because of greater per-capita effects and nonlinearities in the abundance-impact relationship. Our study supports eco-evolutionary novelty of non-natives as a driver of their outsized impacts on communities.

We hypothesised that the dominant and non-dominant species in a community are governed by different assembly mechanisms where environmental conditions influence dominant species more than non-dominant species. Further, dominant plants moderate the environment where non-dominant species thrive, diminishing the influence of environmental filtering and increasing the influence of limiting similarity for non-dominant species. We tested these hypotheses by removing two dominant species in five temperate meadows. We found that the composition of the non-dominants diverged while the new dominants converged over time. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that habitat filtering and limiting similarity drove the new dominant species simultaneously. Conversely, non-dominant community assembly appeared more unpredictable. These suggest that dominant species converged towards a predictable environmentally driven optimum, while non-dominant species thrive in a moderated habitat, which probably reduced non-dominant species predictability.

However, there is tremendous variation among species in phenological response to warming, and any phenological differences between native and non-native species may influence invasion outcomes under global warming. We simulated global warming in the field and found that non-native species flowered earlier and were more phenologically plastic to temperature than natives, which did not accelerate flowering in response to warming. Non-native species' flowering also became more synchronous with other community members under warming. Earlier flowering was associated with greater geographic spread of non-native species, implicating phenology as a potential trait associated with the successful establishment of non-native species across large geographic regions. Such phenological differences in both timing and plasticity between native and non-natives are hypothesised to promote invasion success and population persistence, potentially benefiting non-native over native species under climate change.

While alien plants have been intensively studied, little is known about alien flower visitors, and especially, how they integrate into natural communities. Here, we focus on mutualistic networks from five Galapagos islands to quantify whether alien and native flower visitors differ consistently in their pairwise interactions. We find that (1) alien flower visitors have more interaction partners and larger species strengths (i.e. plants are more connected to alien insects), (2) native insects tend to have higher partner fidelity as they deviate more from random partner utilisation, and iii) the difference between native and alien flower visitors in network integration intensifies with island degradation. Thus, native and alien flower visitors are not interchangeable, and alien establishment might have yet unforeseen consequences for the pairwise dynamics between plants and flower visitors on the Galapagos - especially on the heavily disturbed islands.

Here, we determine the relative importance of plant evolutionary history, traits, and environmental factors for coexistence through PSF using a meta-analysis of 1038 pairwise PSF measures. Consistent with eco-evolutionary predictions, feedback is more likely to mediate coexistence for pairs of plant species (1) associating with similar guilds of mycorrhizal fungi, (2) of increasing phylogenetic distance, and (3) interacting with native microbes. We also found evidence for a primary role of pathogens in feedback-mediated coexistence. By combining results over several independent studies, our results confirm that PSF may play a key role in plant species coexistence, species invasion, and the phylogenetic diversification of plant communities.

The invasion of Varroa destructor, an ectoparasitic viral vector in Western honeybees, provides a unique opportunity to examine how a novel vector affects disease epidemiology in a host community. This specialist honeybee mite vectors deformed wing virus (DWV), an important re-emerging honeybee pathogen that also infects wild bumblebees. Comparing island honeybee and wild bumblebee populations with and without V. destructor, we show that V. destructor drives DWV prevalence and titre in honeybees and sympatric bumblebees. Viral genotypes are shared across hosts, with the potentially more virulent DWV-B overtaking DWV-A in prevalence in a current epidemic. This demonstrates disease emergence across a host community driven by the acquisition of a specialist novel transmission route in one host, with dramatic community level knock-on effects.

Structural equation modeling of a winnowed soil microbiome identifies how invasive plants re-structure microbial networks	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; SPECIES RICHNESS; BACTERIAL; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ASSOCIATIONS; COMMUNITIES; SEQUENCES; BEHAVIOR; PRIMERS	The development of microbial networks is central to ecosystem functioning and is the hallmark of complex natural systems. Characterizing network development over time and across environmental gradients is hindered by the millions of potential interactions among community members, limiting interpretations of network evolution. We developed a feature selection approach using data winnowing that identifies the most ecologically influential microorganisms within a network undergoing change. Using a combination of graph theory, leave-one-out analysis, and statistical inference, complex microbial communities are winnowed to identify the core organisms responding to external gradients or functionality, and then network development is evaluated against these externalities. In a plant invasion case study, the winnowed microbial network became more influential as the plant invasion progressed as a result of direct plant-microbe links rather than the expected indirect plant-soil-microbe links. This represents the first use of structural equation modeling to predict microbial network evolution, which requires identification of keystone taxa and quantification of the ecological processes underpinning community structure and function patterns.

Temperature and soil moisture control microbial community composition in an arctic-alpine ecosystem along elevational and micro-topographic gradients	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; VARIABLE IMPORTANCE; PLANT DIVERSITY; WARMING ALTERS; REGRESSION; TUNDRA; SELECTION; PATTERNS; VARIABILITY	Microbial communities in arctic-alpine soils show biogeographic patterns related to elevation, but the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity and possibly related temperature and soil moisture regimes remains unclear. We collected soil samples from different micro-topographic positions and elevational levels in two mountain regions of the Scandes, Central Norway. Microbial community composition was characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and was dependent on microtopography and elevation. Underlying environmental drivers were identified by integration of microbial community data with a comprehensive set of site-specific long-term recorded temperature and soil moisture data. Partial least square regression analysis allowed the description of ecological response patterns and the identification of the important environmental drivers for each taxonomic group. This demonstrated for the first time that taxa responding to elevation were indeed most strongly defined by temperature, rather than by other environmental factors. Micro-topography affected taxa were primarily controlled by temperature and soil moisture. In general, 5-year datasets had higher explanatory power than 1-year datasets, indicating that the microbial community composition is dependent on long-term developments of near-ground temperature and soil moisture regimes and possesses a certain resilience, which is in agreement with an often observed delayed response in global warming studies in arctic-alpine regions.

Spatial vs. temporal controls over soil fungal community similarity at continental and global scales	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; DIVERSITY; BACTERIAL; LAND; BIOGEOGRAPHY; VARIABILITY; RESILIENCE; LIMITATION; MAGNITUDE	Large-scale environmental sequencing efforts have transformed our understanding of the spatial controls over soil microbial community composition and turnover. Yet, our knowledge of temporal controls is comparatively limited. This is a major uncertainty in microbial ecology, as there is increasing evidence that microbial community composition is important for predicting microbial community function in the future. Here, we use continental- and global-scale soil fungal community surveys, focused within northern temperate latitudes, to estimate the relative contribution of time and space to soil fungal community turnover. We detected large intra-annual temporal differences in soil fungal community similarity, where fungal communities differed most among seasons, equivalent to the community turnover observed over thousands of kilometers in space. inter-annual community turnover was comparatively smaller than intra-annual turnover. Certain environmental covariates, particularly climate covariates, explained some spatial-temporal effects, though it is unlikely the same mechanisms drive spatial vs. temporal turnover. However, these commonly measured environmental covariates could not fully explain relationships between space, time and community composition. These baseline estimates of fungal community turnover in time provide a starting point to estimate the potential duration of legacies in microbial community composition and function.

For biparental care species, the behavior of both parents can impact reproductive success. Behavioral similarity within pairs has been shown to provide selective advantages for many species. In this study, we tested for behavioral similarity in 129 pairs of nesting Canada geese (Branta canadensis) with respect to nest defense behavior, an individually consistent trait. We used a bivariate mixed model to provide unbiased estimates of correlations between partners' traits. We also tested for the effect of behavioral similarity between mates on reproductive success and predicted greater success for positively assorted pairs. We found that over four consecutive years, pairs of Canada geese were formed of individuals showing similar nest defense intensities. Assortment between mates may result both from personality-dependent non-random mate choice and from behavioral adjustments after pairing that are maintained in the long term. However, behavioral adjustment to a shared environment, among and within breeding seasons, had negligible effects on the covariation between partners' traits. We also found that similarity in nest defense intensity did not result in higher reproductive success. The factors at the origin of the evolution of long-term behavioral similarity based on nest defense in Canada geese pairs remain to be identified.Significance statementIndividual consistency in behavioral traits has been demonstrated for many animal species, and its importance in ecology and evolution is now accepted. The maintenance of personality traits in a population may in fact be explained by non-random mate choice like assortative mating, where paired individuals show similar phenotypes. We studied the nest defense behavior, a highly repeatable trait, of 129 Canada goose pairs during four consecutive years and found that paired individuals had similar personalities, suggesting personality-dependent mate choice or post-pairing adjustments maintained in the long term. Our findings also show that the phenotypic similarity between mated individuals is not always related to reproductive success and can possibly result from non-adaptive mechanisms.

Phylogenetic niche conservatism may also influence species richness-climate relationships of different lineages. Here, we tested whether regional effects also exist for temperate lineages using the genus Quercus. Location Northern Hemisphere. Time period Present day. Major taxa studied Quercus (Fagaceae). Methods We used a dated phylogeny and distribution data for Quercus to evaluate its global species richness patterns and phylogenetic niche conservatism. To evaluate the consistency in species richness-climate relationships across continents of the genus Quercus as a whole and the temperate subgenus Quercus, we conducted analyses of covariance with continent as the categorical variable and climate variables as the covariate. We calibrated four widely used models using the global data or data from each continent separately and evaluated the predictive power of each model for different continents using the root mean squared error. Results The relationships between species richness and climate were not significantly different among continents for both the genus Quercus as a whole and the subgenus Quercus. Unlike the models based on European data, those based on North American and eastern Asian data predicted both the global species richness and the richness in other continents. The species richness of a subtropical subgenus Cyclobalanopsis was most influenced by water availability, while that of a temperate subgenus Quercus was most influenced by environmental temperature. Main conclusions In contrast to the subtropical subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, our results showed a consistent richness-climate relationship and absence of regional effects on species richness across continents for the temperate subgenus Quercus, likely suggesting that the species richness of temperate lineages, for example subgenus Quercus, may have reached equilibrium with the contemporary climate in the Northern Hemisphere.

Here, we quantify rates of change in mean cold tolerances, and contributions of colonization and local extinction to those rates, recorded in plant macrofossil assemblages from North American hot deserts over the last 30,000 years. Location Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Time period 30-0 thousand years before present (kybp). Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods Colonization and local extinction dates for 269 plant species were approximated from macrofossils in 15 packrat (Neotoma) midden series. Cold tolerances estimated from contemporary climate were used to quantify assemblage-mean cold tolerances through time. Rates of colonization and local extinction, and their effects on rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances, were estimated for 30-20 kybp (Late Pleistocene, no directional warming), 20-10 kybp (deglaciation, rapid warming) and 10-0 kybp (Holocene, no directional warming). Results Rates of change in all metrics were negligible during the Late Pleistocene. Rates of change in assemblage-mean cold tolerances (mean 1.0 degrees C x 10(-4)/yr) lagged behind warming during deglaciation, and continued at similar rates (1.2 degrees C x 10(-4)/yr) throughout the Holocene. Colonization and local extinction contributed equally to delayed responses to warming, but their dynamics differed through time: Colonization by warm-adapted species predominated during deglaciation, while the most heat-adapted species exhibited long delays in colonization. Only the most cold-adapted species went locally extinct during deglaciation, followed by slow repayment of the extinction debt of cool-adapted species during the Holocene. Main conclusions Responses to rapid warming can persist for millennia, even after cessation of warming. Consistent patterns from different midden series across the region support a metacommunity model in which dispersal interacts with environmental filters and buffers against local extinction to drive community-climate disequilibrium during and after periods of warming.

Here, we investigated fungal abundance-occupancy relationships to determine whether fungi that are common at a local scale tend to be more widely distributed. Location UK and Switzerland. Time period 1950-2014. Major taxa studied Fungi. Methods We used a local data set of fruiting records of 2,319 species in the UK, accumulated over 65 years, and one from Switzerland of 319 species, spanning 32 years. Using the number of records and occurrence as proxies for abundance, in each case we examined the form of species and rank abundance distributions and compared these with distributions of records in the national databases over the same time. We plotted relationships of the local number of records and regional occupancy and calculated multiscale indices of rarity for all fungal species. Results There was a remarkable congruence in the patterns found in the UK and Switzerland. Regional assemblages are characterized by many rare species, whereas few are common (fitting the lognormal distribution). However, at local scales, distributions best fitted a power law, suggesting that habitat availability or dispersal processes might play important roles. Fungi with a high number of local records are densely distributed nationally, but unlike other organisms, locally rare fungi may also be densely distributed at a wider scale. Main conclusions Fungal fruiting records can be used to infer patterns in fungal distributions. Abundances in local assemblages may be determined by the position of the assemblage in the overall geographical range of each species, dispersal ability and environmental filtering. We advocate the use of multiscale approaches to rarity in future fungal sampling programmes, to provide more reliable information for future conservation policy decisions and fungal biogeography.

Global distribution patterns of mycoheterotrophy	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhiza; cheaters; ectomycorrhiza; forest type; global distribution; mycoheterotrophic plants	PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; MYCORRHIZAL; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; FUNGI; DIVERSITY; PLANTS; PETROSAVIACEAE; SPECIFICITY	Aim Mycoheterotrophy is a mode of life where plants cheat the mycorrhizal symbiosis, receiving carbon via their fungal partners. Despite being widespread, mycoheterotrophic plants are locally rare, hampering the understanding of their global environmental drivers. Here, we explore global environmental preferences of mycoheterotrophy, and investigate environmental drivers of differential habitat preferences of mycoheterotrophic plants associated with arbuscular (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Mycoheterotrophic flowering plants. Methods We compiled the largest global dataset of epiparasitic mycoheterotrophic plant species occurrences and examined which environmental factors, including soil type, climate, vegetation type and distribution patterns of mycorrhizal autotrophic plants, relate to occurrence patterns of mycoheterotrophic plant species associated with AM and EM fungi. Results Mycoheterotrophic plant species avoid cold and highly seasonal climates and show a strong preference for forests. AM-associated mycoheterotrophs are predominantly found in broadleaved tropical evergreen forests whereas EM-associated mycoheterotrophs occur in temperate regions, mostly in broadleaved deciduous and evergreen needleleaved forests. The abundance of AM and EM autotrophic plants was a weaker predictor for mycoheterotrophs occurrences than forest type. Temperature and precipitation variables - but not edaphic factors - were the best predictors explaining the distribution patterns of mycoheterotrophs after accounting for the effects of forest type. For individual lineages, major differences in environmental preferences (often related to edaphic factors) occurred that were significantly associated with plant evolutionary relationships, indicating that these cheater plants have limited adaptive capabilities. Main conclusions The strong global geographical segregation of AM and EM mycoheterotrophs does not reflect the abundance of their potential autotrophic hosts, but seems to be driven by differential climate and habitat preferences. Our results highlight the non-trivial nature of mycorrhizal interactions, and indicate that identity of the partners is not enough to understand the underlying mechanisms promoting plant-fungal interactions in mycoheterotrophic plants.

GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						beta diversity; compositional differences; diversity partitioning; nestedness; turnover	SPECIES-DIVERSITY; INDEPENDENT ALPHA	Aims Quantifying beta-diversity (differences in the composition of communities) is central to many ecological studies. There are many beta-diversity metrics, falling mostly into two approaches: variance-based (e.g., the Sorensen index), or diversity partitioning (e.g., additive beta-diversity). The former cannot be used when species-sites matrices are unavailable (which is often the case in island biogeography in particular) and only species richness data are provided. Recently, efforts have been made to partition additive beta-diversity, a metric calculated using only alpha-diversity and gamma-diversity, into nestedness and turnover components (termed here "richness-only beta-diversity partitioning"). We set out to test whether this form of beta-diversity partitioning generates interpretable results, comparable with metrics based on species incidence beta-diversity partitioning. Location Global. Time period Present day. Major taxa studied Multiple taxa. Methods We first provide a brief review of beta-diversity partitioning methods, with a particular focus on the development of richness-only beta-diversity partitioning. Second, we use 254 empirical incidence matrices (provided with the paper) sourced from the literature to measure turnover and nestedness using incidence beta-diversity partitioning, comparing the resulting values with those calculated using richness-only beta-diversity. Results We provide an account of the emergence of beta-diversity partitioning, with particular reference to the analysis of richness-only datasets, and to the definition and usage of the relevant metrics. Analytically, we report weak correlations between turnover and nestedness calculated using the two different approaches. We show that this is because identical values of alpha-diversity and gamma-diversity can correspond to incidence matrices with a range of different structures. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that the use of richness-only beta-diversity partitioning to measure turnover and nestedness is problematic and can produce patterns unrelated to conventional measures of turnover and nestedness. We therefore recommend that more accurate definitions are adopted for these terms in future studies.	[Matthews, Thomas J.; Aspin, Thomas W.

Here, we jointly evaluate ecological and evolutionary hypotheses that might account for global interspecific patterns of range size in the most species-rich avian order: Passeriformes (perching birds). Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Order Passeriformes. Methods We used phylogenetic path analysis to test for the relationship between eight variables and range size. Our list of predictors included a set of niche-related variables (both Grinellian and Eltonian), species-specific morphological and life-history traits (body size, dispersal ability and fertility), extrinsic (human footprint) and evolutionary factors (time since divergence from the closest extant relative). Results We found that Grinellian (climatic) and Eltonian (trophic) niche breadth are crucial to account for the observed patterns, followed by reproductive effort (as measured by clutch size). We also found a negative relationship between native range size and human footprint. The significant and positive relationship between niche breadth, either Grinnellian or Eltonian, and range size was consistent across all species, irrespective of their migratory/resident status or taxonomic grouping (Passeri versus Tyranni). Main conclusions Globally, the range sizes of passerine species are associated with the Grinellian niche, meaning that species with broader environmental tolerances exhibit larger geographical ranges. These findings give further empirical support to the positive niche breadth-range size relationship as a general pattern in ecology.

The Arctic is undergoing rapid climatic, ecological, social, and economic changes and requires effective wildlife monitoring to meet diverse stakeholder needs. To identify stakeholder priorities concerning desired outcomes of arctic wildlife monitoring, we conducted in-depth interviews with 29 arctic scientists, policy and decision makers, and representatives of indigenous organizations and nongovernmental organizations. Using qualitative content analysis, we identified and defined desired outcomes and documented links between outcomes. Using network analysis, we investigated the structure of perceived links between desired outcomes. We identified 18 desired outcomes from monitoring and classified them as either driven by monitoring information, monitoring process, or a combination of both. Highly cited outcomes were make decisions, conserve, detect change, disseminate, and secure food. These reflect key foci of arctic monitoring. Infrequently cited outcomes (e.g., govern) were emerging themes. Three modules comprised our outcome network. The modularity highlighted the low strength of perceived links between outcomes that were primarily information driven or more derived (e.g., detect change, make decisions, conserve, or secure food) and outcomes that were primarily process driven or more derived (e.g., cooperate, learn, educate). The outcomes expand monitoring community and disseminate created connections between these modules. Key desired outcomes are widely applicable to social-ecological systems within and outside the Arctic, particularly those with wildlife subsistence economies. Attributes and motivations associated with outcomes can guide development of integrated monitoring goals for biodiversity conservation and human needs. Our results demonstrated the disconnect between information- and process-driven goals and how expansion of the monitoring community and improved integration of monitoring stakeholders will help connect information- and process-derived outcomes for effective ecosystem stewardship.

However, density estimation is usually difficult and resource demanding, so researchers often collect data at local scales. However, anthropogenic pressures most often have landscape-level effects, for example, through habitat loss and fragmentation. We applied hierarchical distance sampling (HDS) to transect count data to determine the effect of habitat and anthropogenic factors on the density of 3 arboreal primate species inhabiting 5 distinct tropical forests across a landscape of 19,000 km(2) in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. We developed a novel, multiregion extension of HDS that allowed us to model density and detectability jointly across forests without losing site-specific information. For all species, the effect of anthropogenic disturbance on density was overwhelmingly negative among metapopulations: -0.63 Angolan colobus (Colobus angolensis palliatus) (95% Bayesian CI -1.03 to -0.27), -0.54 Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) (-0.89 to -0.22), and -0.33 Sykes' monkey (Cercopithecus mitis monoides) (-0.63 to -0.07). Some responses to habitat factors were shared, notably the negative effect of elevation and the positive effect of climber coverage. These results are important for conservation science and practice because: the among-populations negative responses to anthropogenic disturbance provides a foundation for development of conservation plans that hold at the landscape scale, which is a comprehensive and cost-efficient approach; the among-species consistency in responses suggests conservation measures may be generalized at the guild level, which is especially relevant given the functional importance of primates in tropical rainforests; and the greater primate densities in areas at low elevation, which are closer to human settlements, point to specific management recommendations, such as the creation of buffer zones and prioritization of areas for protection.

Intriguingly however, some plants lack gbM, and thus it remains unclear whether gbM has a function. In animals, there is support for a role of gbM in reducing erroneous transcription and transcription noise, but so far most studies in plants have tested for an effect of gbM on expression level, not noise. Here, we therefore tested whether gbM was associated with reduced expression noise in Arabidopsis thaliana, using single-cell transcriptome sequencing data from root quiescent centre cells. We find that gbM genes have lower expression noise levels than unmethylated genes. However, an analysis of covariance revealed that, if other genomic features are taken into account, this association disappears. Nonetheless, gbM genes were more consistently expressed across single-cell samples, supporting previous inference that gbM genes are constitutively expressed. Finally, we observed that fewer RNAseq reads map to introns of gbM genes than to introns of unmethylated genes, which indicates that gbM might be involved in reducing erroneous transcription by reducing intron retention.

Slow recovery of depleted eastern oyster populations in the Chesapeake Bay, USA has prompted a hatchery-based restoration program focused in the Choptank River, Maryland consisting of the mass release of hatchery-produced juveniles from local, wild broodstock. To evaluate potential genetic effects of this program, we (1) examined changes in genetic diversity (allelic richness, heterozygosity) and the effective number of breeders (N-b) over the hatchery production cycle with microsatellite-based parentage of natural, mass-and controlled-spawned cohorts, and (2) compared genetic diversity and effective population size (N-e) of a restored reef to wild source populations. Mass-spawned cohorts showed high variance in reproductive contribution, particularly among males, leading to a 45% average reduction in N-b from spawning adult numbers and higher relatedness-lower magnitude reductions in heterozygosity and significant reductions in allelic richness were also observed. While controlled-spawns (single-male fertilizations of pooled eggs) reduced male variance, overall reproductive variance (V-k) remained high. Finally, oysters sampled from a restored reef displayed comparable N-e, genetic diversity, and relatedness to samples from wild populations, with no significant genetic differentiation among them. Overall, the hatchery-based results and initial field-based population genetic analyses suggest that despite reductions in diversity from parents to offspring owing to high V-k, enhancement with rotated, wild broodstock appears to have maintained genetic diversity in a restored reef population compared to proximal wild populations.

Inbreeding load and inbreeding depression estimated from lifetime reproductive success in a small, dispersal-limited population	HEREDITY			English	Article							TAILED KANGAROO RAT; DIPODOMYS-SPECTABILIS; KIN DISCRIMINATION; MATE-CHOICE; PARENTAGE; SURVIVAL; FITNESS; RECOGNITION; AVOIDANCE; HETEROZYGOSITY	The fitness consequences of inbreeding and the individual behaviors that prevent its detrimental effects can be challenging to document in wild populations. Here, we use field and molecular data from a 17-year study of banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) to quantify the relationship between inbreeding, mate kinship, and lifetime reproductive success. Using a pedigree that was reconstructed using genetic and field data within a Bayesian framework (median probability of parental assignment = 0.92, mean pedigree depth = 6 generations), we estimated both inbreeding coefficients and kinship between individuals that produced offspring (mean inbreeding coefficient = 0.07, mean mate kinship = 0.08). We also used the pedigree, in combination with census data, to generate a series of fitness estimates, ranging from survival to reproductive maturity to lifetime reproductive success. We found that the population's inbreeding load was low to moderate (0.98-4.66 haploid lethal equivalents) and increased with the time frame over which fitness was estimated (lowest for survival to maturity, highest for adult-to-adult reproductive success). Fitness decreased with increasing inbreeding coefficients. For example, lifetime reproductive success was reduced by 24% for individuals with inbreeding coefficients greater than twice the population mean. Within full sibling pairs, the sibling with less-related mates produced an average of 30% more offspring over its lifetime. These data further illustrate that inbreeding can have a negative effect on lifetime reproductive success.

Population type influences the rate of ageing This article has been corrected since Advance Online Publication and a correction is also printed in this issue	HEREDITY			English	Article							EFFECTIVE SIZE; AGE; SENESCENCE; GENE	Mutation accumulation is one of the major genetic theories of ageing and predicts that the frequencies of deleterious alleles that are neutral to selection until post-reproductive years are influenced by random genetic drift. The effective population size (N-e) determines the rate of drift and in age-structured populations is a function of generation time, the number of newborn individuals and reproductive value. We hypothesise that over the last 50,000 years, the human population survivorship curve has experienced a shift from one of constant mortality and no senescence (known as a Type-II population) to one of delayed, but strong senescence (known as a Type-I population). We simulate drift in age-structured populations to explore the sensitivity of different population 'types' to generation time and contrast our results with predictions based purely on estimates of N-e. We conclude that estimates of N-e do not always accurately predict the rates of drift between populations with different survivorship curves and that survivorship curves are useful predictors of the sensitivity of a population to generation time. We find that a shift from an ancestral Type-II to a modern Type-I population coincides with an increase in the rate of drift unless accompanied by an increase in generation time. Both population type and generation time are therefore relevant to the contribution mutation accumulation makes to the genetic underpinnings of senescence.	[Overall, Andrew D.

Changes in rainfall level and litter stoichiometry affect aquatic community and ecosystem processes in bromeliad phytotelmata	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						bromeliad food web; decomposition; detritus; N; P ratio; Naididae	N-P RATIOS; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; SOUTH-AMERICA; HABITAT SIZE; CLIMATE; GROWTH; STREAM; PREDATORS	Both N deposition and changes in precipitation amount are important components of global change and affect aquatic ecosystem functioning by altering the detrital quality and detrital processing rates by macroinvertebrates and microorganisms. Changes in precipitation pattern can also modify the physical structure of the ecosystem, determining habitat availability for aquatic organisms. Although these drivers can individually affect ecosystem structure and functioning, their interactive effects are poorly understood. To better understand the combined effects of detritus quality and precipitation regime on the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems we manipulated litter quality, by modifying N:P stoichiometry and rainfall amount on tropical natural aquatic microcosms (water-holding epiphytic bromeliads). We performed an orthogonal manipulation of litter N:P ratio (natural N:P and high N:P) and rainfall levels (current level and predicted 40% increase for south-eastern Brazil) Changes in litter quality affected the abundance of the aquatic organisms inhabiting bromeliads, including algae and bacteria. However, changes in litter quality combined with changes in precipitation levels affected only one group of macroinvertebrates, the Naididae worms (Oligochaeta) an important group of detritivores in the bromeliad systems. These combined drivers also affected the decomposition of organic matter by changing coloured organic matter concentrations, fine particulate matter biomass, and NH4+ concentrations in bromeliad tanks. The NH4+ concentration in bromeliad water was positively related with Naididae abundance, suggesting that these worms can act as ecosystem engineers by boosting N cycling. In both N:P treatments we observed a 50% decrease in N flux from litter to bromeliad leaves due to increases in nutrient leaching from the tanks caused by rainfall. The combined effects of litter quality and changes in precipitation regimes altered the decomposition process and nutrient cycling in tank bromeliads, probably through changes in the abundance of some keystone species (e.g. Naididae). Aquatic macroinvertebrate community structure remained similar after manipulating precipitation, despite changes in the abundance of some species. Although some microorganisms were washed out of the system, their abundance inside the bromeliads remained stable. We conclude that the abundance of individuals belonging to aquatic communities in bromeliad phytotelmata are generally stable and resistant to changes in rainfall levels, but are sensitive to changes in litter quality. This experiment showed that the interactive effects of increased precipitation and N concentrations differed from the effects of either factor alone. As responses to changes in these factors were complex rather than additive, caution is required in predicting the outcomes of changes in both factors in freshwater ecosystems.

Previous research has found that the presence of macrophytes in shallow water bodies can mitigate the effects of nutrient loading by promoting water clarity and inhibiting phytoplankton growth. However, there is still little known about how macrophyte abundance modifies the response of phytoplankton taxonomic assemblages, particularly their functional composition, to nutrient loading. We investigated how macrophyte abundance altered phytoplankton assemblages using experimental ponds that were treated with a nutrient press. Natural communities of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish were seeded in ponds with one of three levels of macrophyte abundance that received weekly nutrient additions. A total of nine ponds (each treatment in triplicate) were monitored for 76 days. Analyses of Shannon's diversity and functional dispersion revealed significant variation in phytoplankton assemblage composition among macrophyte treatments and through time. Phytoplankton biovolume, community metrics, and the dominant traits were generally more stable in the high macrophyte treatment ponds. Although nutrient loading did not induce a regime change to a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state, phytoplankton assemblages did shift to a dominance of larger, inedible taxa and metaphyton became more abundant in ponds with macrophytes and zooplankton assemblages shifted to smaller species. Our study demonstrates how functional traits and functional diversity metrics can provide richer insights into the dynamics and causes of shifts in shallow freshwater ecosystems. Macrophyte densities clearly played a significant role in shaping phytoplankton assemblages. Based on the functional traits of phytoplankton distinguished among treatments, we inferred that competition for light, grazing, and, probably, allelochemicals were mechanisms through which macrophytes mediated changes in phytoplankton assemblages.

Assessing isotopic data from different tissues of a single individual (multi-tissue approach) represents a common method to estimate individual trophic specialisation (ITS). However, a neglected problem with this approach is that isotopic values of two tissues from a single individual are not statistically independent, and hence, an underestimation of the within-individual component of variance should be theoretically expected. In this study, we evaluate this potential problem by comparing ITS estimations as currently calculated (uncorrected ITS) against ITS estimations based on a new method that considers the non-independence problem (corrected ITS). We used unpublished delta N-15 and delta C-13 data for nine fish species, together with previously published delta N-15 and delta C-13 data for eight other vertebrate species, to estimate (and compare) components of variance and ITS values, using uncorrected and corrected isotopic data. In addition, for each species, we used a Monte Carlo resampling routine to test the null hypothesis that all individuals sample equally from the population diet distribution. We found that the use of uncorrected delta N-15 values provided an average ITS estimation which is, depending on the overlap among tissues turnover rates, 14%-35% (fish dataset) and 17%-40% (all species dataset) lower than estimations based on corrected values. Similarly, the use of uncorrected delta C-13 values provided an average ITS estimation which is 12%-29% (fish dataset) and 21%-45% (all species dataset) lower than corrected estimations. The implications of these results in an ecological context are of great significance. For instance, the fish dataset showed that while uncorrected estimations indicate that three (delta C-13) or four (delta N-15) species are trophic specialists at the individual level, a moderate correction in isotopic values indicate that none (delta C-13) or only one (delta N-15) species is a trophic specialist at that level. Noticeably, this last result is much more congruent with dietary data obtained from stomach content analysis. Given the several pros of the multi-tissue approach, such as its reduced operative costs, we suggest not to abandon this method, but to cope with the non-independence problem by using the correction proposed here or, at least, by selecting body tissues with a minimal overlap in their turnover rates.

Understanding how multi-scale abiotic factors may influence local-scale biotic processes has proven challenging; however, the hierarchical nature of riverine flow regimes makes these environments an ideal setting to test how predator-prey relationships may vary with multi-scaled flow variation. We developed a series of Bayesian hierarchical models to explore how predator-prey relationships between barramundi Lates calcarifer and their prey may be influenced by multi-scaled flow variables in the Daly River, northern Australia. We found that spatio-temporal variation in barramundi abundance was strongly related to both antecedent flow and the abundance of prey fishes (predictive r(2) = 0.57), and that barramundi abundance is more likely to be influenced by bottom-up, rather than top-down predator-prey dynamics. We also found that the strength and direction of these relationships varied across the catchment and between seasons. We found stronger, positive relationships between barramundi abundance and prey abundance in the most downstream sites with higher mean annual flows, compared to upstream sites. These results indicate that the abundance of predatory fishes can be related to both recent abiotic (flow) conditions and the abundance of prey (biotic conditions), and provides strong support for the importance of bottom-up trophic dynamics. Management of iconic predators such as barramundi should therefore consider both flow management and other key factors such as habitat maintenance to support their prey.

However, current understanding of how eDNA is transported in streams and rivers remains imprecise, with uncertainty of how the unique transport properties of eDNA may influence the interpretation of a positive detection. To test the utility of eDNA sensing in flowing waters, we compared quantitative eDNA analyses to zebra mussel density surveys in a Danish river. Although flowing water complicates the relationships between eDNA production, transport, and removal, we found weak but positive relationships between eDNA concentration, zebra mussels, and biophysical parameters. For example, while zebra mussel densities were only moderately predicted by eDNA concentrations, eDNA was most strongly influenced by nutrient concentrations and water velocity. These results may be used to inform future sampling strategies, where hydrological variables could better constrain eDNA fate. We also modelled estimates for net eDNA transport, retention, and degradation to estimate the relative importance of these processes for removing eDNA from the water column. In our study system, physical retention accounted for c. 70% of removal when compared to degradation alone, making it an important process to consider when assessing downstream eDNA transport.

However, joint effects of predation risk and additional environmental factors on species interaction strengths in multitrophic systems remain largely unexplored, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of the links between local environmental characteristics and food web properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the effects of habitat complexity and predation risk by top predatory dragonfly larvae (Aeshna cyanea) on feeding rates and energetic efficiency (i.e. the ratio of acquired and expended energy) of the larvae of three intermediate predatory odonate species (Libellula quadrimaculata, Sympetrum sanguineum, and Ischnura elegans) preying on cladocerans. We hypothesised that predation risk would decrease the feeding rate, especially in the structurally simple habitat, and increase the metabolic rate of all intermediate predators. We also expected higher feeding rates of intermediate predators using aquatic vegetation as a perching site (i.e. Sympetrum and Ischnura) in the structurally complex habitat. Finally, we expected to observe habitat- and predation risk-dependent energetic efficiencies of the intermediate predators driven by changes in feeding and metabolic rates. The effect of predation risk on feeding rates was species specific and differed between the structurally simple and complex habitat. Habitat complexity increased feeding rates but only in the absence of predation risk. Moreover, predation risk signalled by chemical cues significantly increased Sympetrum vulgatum feeding rates but did not influence the feeding rates of the two other intermediate predators. Metabolic rates varied among the three intermediate predators but were not affected by predation risk. Estimated energetic efficiency decreased with intermediate predator body mass and depended, to a lesser extent, on the interactive effect of habitat complexity and predation risk. Our results imply that the effects of habitat complexity and predation risk on trophic interactions are likely to be determined by traits related to foraging and defence of the intermediate predators and their habitat domains, and that energetic efficiency is mainly determined by predator mass. Given that habitat complexity and predation risk can vary substantially across habitats, we conclude that it is important to consider habitat complexity and predation risk to better understand and predict the effects of environmentally driven variations on trophic interaction strength and metabolic rates that underlie the energetic efficiency of individual consumers. This has important implications for population and community dynamics as well as ecosystem functioning.

Whereas this has been previously mainly tested in terms of taxonomic dissimilarity, the role of ecological processes in determining the congruence of multiple diversity facets (i.e. alpha- and beta-diversity, taxonomic, and functional) remains poorly understood. We used a data set of observation records for 469 macrophyte and 543 fish taxa at the catchment-scale from the existing literature and data bases to test the existence of multi-faceted congruence patterns and investigate the variables driving them across 214 catchments covering the whole Chinese mainland. We found cross-taxon congruence of multiple diversity aspects between fish and macrophyte communities. The energy (i.e. diversity is limited by energy availability), area/environmental heterogeneity (i.e. diversity is higher in larger and more heterogeneous areas), and dispersal (i.e. diversity is driven by dispersal) hypotheses were all significantly attributed to the cross-taxon congruence, suggesting the existence of key repeated mechanisms underlying assemblage organisation. Our study provides new evidence that can further our understanding of the factors and underlying processes explaining cross-taxon congruence patterns at broad spatial scales in the freshwater realm, the studies of which significantly lag those in the marine and terrestrial realms. The present findings also provide important baseline information for freshwater conservation initiatives.

Modelling species distributions to predict areas at risk of invasion by the exotic aquatic New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray 1843)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; freshwater; invasive species; invertebrates; population	RAPID ASSESSMENT SURVEY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION; LIMNOPERNA-FORTUNEI; BIOCLIMATIC MODELS; BALLAST WATER; GLOBAL CHANGE; PARANA RIVER; GREAT-LAKES; SNAIL	The use of bioclimatic models to predict areas subject to invasion by exotic species has been important in the development of preventive conservation measures. The native New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum is an invasive mollusc, now with a worldwide distribution, that causes economic and ecological problems in invaded areas and has recently been designated as one of the 100 worst invasive species in Europe. In this study we sought to determine the potential distribution of and areas susceptible to invasion by P. antipodarum in South America and worldwide, in present and future scenarios (2070), using MaxEnt models. The models were developed using georeferenced occurrence data and bioclimate and hydroclimate variables to predict scenarios of the geographical distribution of P. antipodarum. Possible routes of invasion into South America were predicted. Present-day scenario of the worldwide distribution (all known occurrences) of P. antipodarum, based on the bioclimatic and hydroclimatic models, are highly accurate, with area under curve higher than of 0.87. The models indicated that environmentally suitable areas exist in South America and in other regions of the world where the species has not yet been recorded. The predicted susceptibility includes approximately 80 protected areas in the South American continent. Models projected in an optimistic and pessimistic future scenario, based on the worldwide distribution, show increased environmental suitability of regions outside the current species distribution, including Brazil (south-west), Uruguay (near Mirim Lagoon), Nigeria, Ethiopia (lakes Tana and Chomen), Tanzania, Cameroon (bordering lakes Bamendjing, Bankim, and Mbakaou), Equatorial Guinea, Congo, Rwanda, Burundi (Lake Tanganyika environs), Uganda, Tanzania (Naivasha), and South Africa (surrounding Gordon's Bay). The main vector for dispersal to South America would be ballast water coming from waterways and ports located in the predicted areas. Fish farming is also a possible route, since the mudsnail is resistant to the digestive tract of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Current records and predicted susceptible areas coincide with port areas and sites where this fish is farmed. Geographical distribution modelling proved to be helpful in identifying environmentally suitable areas for the invasion of P. antipodarum. The model also suggests a future expansion of the species distribution, possibly affected by climate change.

However, few studies have measured the effects of repeated annual winter drawdowns on freshwater mussel populations (Bivalvia: Unionida), and it is unknown whether drawdowns permanently constrain mussel populations to deeper depths or are resilient to the annual disturbance. We quantified mussel densities during normal water levels and their mortality after the initiation of drawdown in lakes with annual winter (December-March) water level drawdown regimes that have existed for several decades. We used systematic quadrat sampling and visual snorkel surveys to estimate the number of live mussels at the surface and buried, and shell length in six drawdown and three control lakes at exposed (0.5-m) and unexposed (1-m) depths during winter drawdown. We also estimated mortality of mussels along the exposed lakebed for nine drawdown lakes. Study lakes were dominated by Elliptio complanata and Pyganodon cataracta. During normal water levels, mussel densities were much lower in drawdown lakes than control lakes at 0.5-m depths. When mussels were present in drawdown lakes at 0.5-m depths, they were often burrowed in the substrate and smaller than buried mussels in control lakes. At unexposed 1-m depths, mussel densities were primarily explained by geographic region (western versus central Massachusetts), and found higher densities in drawdown lakes compared to control lakes. Mussel mortality after a single drawdown event in nine drawdown lakes was not correlated with drawdown magnitude or rate. Concordance of shell length-frequency distributions between dead and buried living mussels in drawdown lakes suggests annual mortality of colonising individuals, which are typically small and presumably of young cohorts. Annual winter drawdowns still limit densities of E. complanata and P. cataracta in shallow-water habitats in the following autumn (September-October) after 4-5 months of potential recovery, and hence constrain their distribution in lakes exposed to drawdowns. The development of sustainable water level management practices will be essential to minimise impacts to native mussel populations.

Freshwater anglers exploiting large-bodied cypriniform fishes use high quantities of pelletised marine fishmeal baits that can contribute substantially to fish diets. This marine-derived energy pathway also potentially provides a marine prey resource for freshwater piscivores. However, large-bodied cypriniform fishes are often in a size refuge against predation due to their large sizes. Stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analysis assessed how novel marine prey resources influenced the diet of a freshwater apex predator, northern pike Esox lucius, in an impounded river basin (lower River Severn, western England). Up to three groups of prey resources were present: anadromous European shad (Alosa spp.), cypriniform fishes with dietary specialisms based on marine fishmeal baits, and freshwater prey. The availability of these prey resources to E. lucius varied according to river connectivity and levels of angling exploitation in different river reaches. Where the three prey groups were present, E. lucius were more enriched in delta C-13 values (range: -24.74 to -16.34 parts per thousand) compared to river reaches where aspects of the marine prey groups were absent (range: -28.30 to -21.47). In all reaches, delta C-13 increased as E. lucius length increased. In the reach where all prey groups were present, the isotopic niches of three E. lucius size categories were strongly partitioned; this was not apparent in reaches where the marine pathways were unavailable. Stable isotope mixing models suggested that freshwater prey were the most important prey item, contributing between 42% and 96% to the diet of individual E. lucius. However, where present, anadromous fishes and cypriniform fishes specialising on marine fishmeal baits were also important prey items, contributing substantially to the diet of larger E. lucius (length > 650 mm). The total dietary contributions of the marine resources varied considerably among the individual larger fish (22-58% of total diet). The presence of two marine resource pathways in a lowland river thus strongly influenced the diet of an apex predator, but with contributions being a function of their spatial availability, E. lucius body size and individual trophic specialisations. These results emphasise how the anthropogenic activities of river engineering and human subsidies can affect the trophic dynamics of apex predators.

Distribution of benthic testate amoeba assemblages along a water depth gradient in freshwater lakes of the Meshchera Lowlands, Russia, and utility of the microfossils for inferring past lake water level	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Community composition; Depth; Microbenthos; Protists; Species number; Testacea	MIDDLE VOLGA REGION; LOBOSE AMEBAS; PROTOZOA; MICROCRUSTACEANS; EUTROPHICATION; THECAMOEBIANS; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEMS; INDICATORS; DIVERSITY	Testate amoebae are important components of benthic communities in freshwater lakes, where they play an essential role in decomposer food webs. They are used widely in paleoecological investigations because of their high taxonomic diversity, well-defined ecological preferences and decay-resistant tests. Studies of testate amoeba assemblages in lake surface sediments are necessary to better understand lake ecosystem function and improve the use of these organisms as bio-indicators in paleoecology. This study explored the use of testate amoebae as proxies for inferring past water level in freshwater lakes, and expanded upon the limited body of research into lake testate amoebae in Russia. Our results indicate that species composition of testate amoeba assemblages in the lakes was typical for such biotopes, with most of the species belonging to the genera Difflugia, Centropyxis, Arcella and Euglypha. Analysis of variation of testate amoebae along a water-depth gradient showed that three assemblage types could be distinguished: shallow-water (0-4.5m), intermediate-water-depth (4.5-20.5) and deep-water (20.5-33m). Deep-water assemblages did not contain any unique taxa and were dominated by eurybiotic and planktonic species. Species diversity was highest in the intermediate-water-depth assemblages and lowest in deep-water ones. Although variations in testate amoeba assemblages across water depth in freshwater lakes are complex and context-dependent, there are clear patterns in species composition and diversity, which can be used to infer past lake water levels. Future studies on the effect of water depth on testate amoeba assemblages in diverse types of freshwater lakes should increase the utility of the method.

Human activity and climate change as determinants of spatial prioritization for the conservation of globally threatened birds in the southern Neotropic (Santa Fe, Argentina)	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Climate warming; Human pressure; Environmentally suitable areas; Conservation area network; Bioregions	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS; PROTECTED AREAS; ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY; GRASSLAND BIRDS; LAND-USE; BIODIVERSITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; DIVERSITY; PERFORMANCE	Conservation area networks (CAN) must overlap spatial patterns of conservation priorities in order to ensure their persistence. Threatened species are among the least controversial biodiversity features taken into account to guide conservation policies. Due to growing human pressure and climate change worldwide, chances of planning an effective CAN may be reduced. Santa Fe province is located in the center-east of Argentina and encompasses four bioregions highly threatened of the subtropical temperate South America. Intensive agriculture, livestock and hunting have led to the loss and degradation of its natural habitats and the current CAN fails on the coverage of bioregions. Our aim was to find out areas that enhance the persistence of threatened bird species in the Santa Fe province. We defined spatial conservation priorities that overlap environmentally suitable areas of species over time and overcome the likely impacts of human activity. Conservation priorities (top 20%) belonged mainly to Dry Chaco and Atlantic bioregions and will remain the same in the province. The current CAN mismatches spatial patterns of environmental suitability of threatened species. Sporophila hypochroma, Asthenes hudsoni and Spartonoica maluroides may lose more than half of their current environmentally suitable area in the future. Human activity will lead to a CAN which will require a great number of patches and a large perimeter. Searching for the most environmentally suitable areas of species over time while minimizing conflicts with human activities is a useful conservation strategy regardless the biogeographical context considered.

We performed a floristic and structural survey of an Atlantic Forest located at the bottom of an escarpment, in the southern region of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A total of 19 plots of 400m(2) were allocated, totaling 0.76ha of sampled area. All arboreal individuals with a diameter at breast height equal to or greater than 5cm were sampled. We also collected surface soil samples for analysis. In order to evaluate the influence of edaphic factors and scarp on the tree community, a canonical correspondence analysis was performed. In order to analyze whether the studied forest is similar to or distinct from the rest of the region, a detrended correspondence analysis was carried out with 15 Atlantic Forest surveys located in the surroundings of the study area. The high floristic diversity and the structural variations found in the studied forest were attributed to the environmental heterogeneity due to the influences of the escarpment and the variations in the soil conditions, resulting in a forest with its own floristic composition and structure. The study suggested that important biological data are being lost in biodiversity surveys, even in well-sampled areas, due to neglected areas of difficult access.

In these ecosystems, the brevity of optimal breeding conditions means species must efficiently track spatiotemporal variations in resources in order to synchronise their reproductive effort with peaks in food availability. Understanding the details of prey-habitat associations and their seasonality in such ecosystems is thus key for deciphering species' ecological niches and developing sound conservation action. However, the ecological requirements of high-alpine avifauna remain poorly documented. Furthermore, mountain ranges in the Old World are affected not only by profound alterations of climate, but also by changes in land-use, the interaction of which hampers both proper forecasting of species' resilience to environmental change and delivery of evidence-based conservation guidance. Here, we investigate the prey-habitat associations of a high-alpine passerine, the White-winged Snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), by radio-tracking breeding adults in the Swiss Alps. In late spring and early summer, Snowfinches foraged preferentially next to invertebrate-rich, melting snow patches where Tipulidae larvae abound. Later, in mid-summer, they favoured flower-rich alpine meadows. When foraging, they always preferred short ground vegetation while avoiding rock and scree. Their pattern of foraging habitat selection reflects trade-offs between food abundance and accessibility, i.e. prey availability. The reliance of this passerine on a habitat mosaic where snow plays a major role questions its ability to cope with climate change due to future habitat loss and potential phenological mismatches. Targeted grazing could possibly help in habitat management by aiming at maintaining invertebrate-rich meadows with short vegetation. Yet, it remains an open question whether habitat management would suffice to compensate for the potentially detrimental effects of the progressive retreat of snow fields to higher elevations.

While ample research has been conducted on the genetics of parasite burden in livestock, relatively little has been done in free-living populations. Here, we investigate the sources of (co)variation in strongyle nematode faecal egg count (FEC) and body condition in Sable Island horses, a feral population in which parasite burden has previously been shown to negatively correlate with body condition. We used the quantitative genetic "animal model" to understand the sources of (co)variation in these traits, and tested for impacts of an important spatial gradient in habitat quality on the parameter estimates. Although FEC is significantly heritable (h(2) = 0.43 +/- 0.11), there was no evidence for significant additive genetic variation in body condition (h(2) = 0.04 +/- 0.07), and therefore there was also no significant genetic covariance between the two traits. The negative phenotypic covariance between these traits therefore does not derive principally from additive genetic effects. We also found that both FEC and body condition increase from east to west across the island, which indicates that the longitudinal environmental gradient is not responsible for the negative phenotypic association observed between these traits. There was also little evidence to suggest that quantitative genetic parameters were biased when an individual's location along the islands environmental gradient was not incorporated into the analysis. This research provides new and important insights into the genetic basis and adaptive potential of parasite resistance in free-living animals, and highlights the importance of environmental heterogeneity in modulating host-parasite interactions in wild vertebrate systems.

Helminths in common eiders (Somateria mollissima): Sex, age, and migration have differential effects on parasite loads	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE			English	Article						Arctic parasitology; Body size; Gastrointestinal parasites; Migration; Seabird	PROFILICOLLIS-BOTULUS ACANTHOCEPHALA; SPECIES RICHNESS; INTERMEDIATE HOST; LIFE-CYCLES; INFECTIONS; MARINE; BIRDS; DUCK; INEQUALITIES; PROPENSITY	In birds, parasites cause detrimental effects to the individual host, including reduced survival and reproductive output. The level of parasitic infection can vary with a range of factors, including migratory status, body size, sex, and age of hosts, or season. Understanding this baseline variation is important in order to identify the effects of external changes such as climate change on the parasitic load and potential impacts to individuals and populations. In this study, we compared the infection level (prevalence, intensity, and abundance) of gastrointestinal parasites in a total of 457 common eiders (Somateria mollissima) from four different sampling locations (Belcher Islands, Cape Dorset, West Greenland and Newfoundland), and explored the effects of migration, sex and age on levels of parasitism. Across all samples, eiders were infected with one nematode genus, two acanthocephalan genera, three genera of cestodes, and three trematode genera. Migratory phase and status alone did not explain the observed variation in infection levels; the expectation that post-migratory eiders would be more parasitized than pre-migratory eiders, due to the energetic cost of migration, did not fit our results. No effect of age was detected, whereas effects of sex and body size were only detected for certain parasitic taxa and was inconsistent with location. Since gastrointestinal helminths are trophically-transmitted, future studies of the regional and temporal variation in the diet of eiders and the associated variation and infestation level of intermediate hosts might further explain the observed variation of the parasitic load in eiders in different regions.

Their presence in a particular area depends on the presence of suitable tick-vector and host species as well as competent reservoirs such as roe deer, one of the most abundant wild cervids in Spain. Spleen samples from 174 roe deer hunted in Spain were analysed to determine the prevalence of Babesia and Theileria species. DNA of both piroplasms was firstly detected using a commercial qPCR. Then, positive samples were molecularly characterized at the 18S rRNA and ITS1 genes of Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. The possible influence of some factors such as ecological area, age and sex was also assessed. Overall, 89.7% of roe deer were positive to any of the two piroplasms. Theileria spp. was more prevalent (60.9%) than Babesia spp. (19.0%); species identification could not be achieved in 17.3% of positive samples. Babesia prevalence was significantly higher in young animals and in roe deer from Oceanic regions, in contrast to Theileria spp. Five species were identified: Theileria sp. OT3 (60.3%), Babesia capreoli (15.5%), Babesia venatorum (2.9%), Theileria sp. 3185/02 (0.6%) and Babesia bigemina (0.6%). The coinfection B. capreoli/T. sp. OT3 was the most common (4.6%) followed by B. venatorum/T. sp. OT3 (0.6%) and B. bigemina/T. sp. OT3 (0.6%). Our results reveal that Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. are prevalent piroplasms in roe deer from Spain. These cervids can act as reservoirs for several Babesia and Theileria species, including the zoonotic B. venatorum. This study represents the first description of B. venatorum and B. bigemina in roe deer from Spain.

Parasites are not only dependent on their host but also on suitable environmental conditions for infestation. Abiotic environmental factors have an important regulating role on parasites in mammals. It is estimated that the elevation range of parasites is likely to shift in response to alternate host movement and changes in climate. Here we assess the parasitic infestation in the Alpine mountain hare by analysing the parasites in faeces and comparing the parasite infestation at different elevation ranges and at varied weather conditions for two years in the Austrian Alps. Almost half of the faecal samples were free of parasites (46.2%, n = 52). Most frequent was the infection by Coccidia (46.2%), whereas stomach intestine strongylids, Trichuris spp, and Cestoda were only found in 9.6% of all faeces. Hence, only Coccidia may be prevalent enough to regulate Alpine mountain hare populations in the Austrian Alps. Elevation had a significant positive effect on the infection of animals by Trichuris spp, whereas temperature had a significant negative effect on the infection by any parasite traceable in faeces and, when looking at the parasite groups individually, on Coccidia.

These birds were commonly submitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit, Kasetsart University, Thailand and were examined using PCR-based methods for the presence of haemosporidian infections of by the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. Blood samples from 167 individual owls belonging to 12 species common in Thailand were collected between September 2012 and February 2018. The overall prevalence of haemosporidians was 34.1%, with Haemoproteus infections (25.1%) being more prevalent than Plasmodium infections (9.0%). The prevalence of both Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites was similar in all seasons of the year. Molecular characterization revealed 17 new haemosporidian parasite lineages (11 Haemoproteus and six Plasmodium), with genetic variation among partial cytochrome b sequences ranging from 0.0% to 3.6% in Haemoproteus lineages and 0.2%-8.8% in Plasmodium lineages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all Haemoproteus lineages detected in owls appeared in one well-supported Glade together with other parasites belonging to the Parahaemoproteus subgenus, indicating their close evolutionary relationship and common transmission modality by Culicoides biting midges. This study showes the existence of prominent non-described haemosporidian parasite diversity in Thai owls and provides baseline molecular information for further research on the genetic diversity of owl haemosporidian parasites. New DNA sequence information can be used for the diagnosis of owl infections, which have been often reported during rehabilitation planning.

Its threat to marine organisms has been demonstrated under laboratory conditions, yet studies on wild populations still face methodological difficulties. We reviewed the methods used to separate MP from soft animal tissues and highlighted a lack of standardised methodologies, particularly critical for synthetic microfibres. We further compared enzymatic and a potassium hydroxide (KOH)-based alkaline digestion protocols on wild crabs (Carcinus aestuarii) collected from three coastal lagoons in the north Adriatic Sea and on laboratory prepared synthetic polyester (PES) of different colour and polypropylene (PP). We compared the cost-effectiveness of the two methods, together with the potential for adverse quantitative or qualitative effects on MP that could alter the capability of the polymers to be recognised via microscopic or spectroscopic techniques. Only 5.5% of the 180 examined crabs contained MP in their gastrointestinal tracts, with a notably high quantitative variability between individuals (from 1 to 117 particles per individual). All MP found was exclusively microfibres, mainly PES, with a mean length (+/- SE) of 0.5 +/- 0.03 mm. The two digestion methods provided comparable estimates on wild crabs and did not cause any visible physical or chemical alterations on laboratory-prepared microfibres treated for up to 4 days. KOH solution was faster and cheaper compared to the enzymatic extraction, involving fewer procedural steps and therefore reducing the risk of airborne contamination. With digestion times longer than 4 days, KOH caused morphological alterations of some of the PES microfibres, which did not occur with the enzymatic digestion. This suggests that KOH is effective for the digestion of small marine invertebrates or biological samples for which shorter digestion time is required, while enzymatic extraction should be considered as alternative for larger organisms or sample sizes requiring longer digestion times.

Accumulation and toxicity of monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in early life stages of cod and haddock	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Dispersed crude oil; Monoaromatic compounds; Fish early life stages; Atlantic haddock; Atlantic cod	UNRESOLVED COMPLEX-MIXTURES; CRUDE-OIL; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; GADUS-MORHUA; FISH EMBRYOS; ATLANTIC COD; CARDIAC-FUNCTION; EXXON-VALDEZ; FATTY-ACIDS; SPILL	A multitude of recent studies have documented the detrimental effects of crude oil exposure on early life stages of fish, including larvae and embryos. While polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly alkyl PAHs, are often considered the main cause of observed toxic effects, other crude oil derived organic compounds are usually overlooked. In the current study, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was applied to investigate the body burden of a wide range of petrogenic compounds in Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and cod (Gadus morhua) embryos that had been exposed to sublethal doses of dispersed crude oil. Several groups of alkylated monoaromatic compounds (e.g. alkyl tetralins, indanes and alkyl benzenes), as well as highly alkylated PAHs, were found to accumulate in the fish embryos upon crude oil exposure. To investigate the toxicity of the monoaromatic compounds, two models (1-isopropyl-4-methyltetralin and 1-isopropyl-4-methylindane) were synthesized and shown to bioaccumulate and cause delayed hatching in developing embryos. Minor developmental effects, including craniofacial and jaw deformations and pericardial edemas, were also observed at the highest studied concentrations of the alkylindane. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Tropical climate effect on the toxic heavy metal pollutant course of road-deposited sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Rainfall; Road-deposited sediment; Toxic heavy metals; Principal component analysis; Natal	URBAN-ENVIRONMENT; DUSTS; CD; STREET; ZN; PB; CU; FRACTIONATION; CHEMOMETRICS; MANCHESTER	In modern society, the intense vehicle traffic and the lack of effective mitigating strategies may adversely impact freshwater systems. Road-deposited sediments (RDS) accumulate a variety of toxic substances which are transported into nature during hydrologic events, mainly affecting water bodies through stormwater runoff. The aim of this study was to evaluate the RDS metal enrichment ratio between the end of wet season and the middle of the dry season for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in samples from Natal, Brazil. Twenty RDS, drainage system and river sediment samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons using a stainless-steel pan, brush and spatula. In the laboratory, the samples were submitted to acid digestion and heavy metal concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). A consistent RDS enrichment by heavy metals in dry season samples was followed by an increase in the finest particle size fraction (D <63 mu m). Maximum concentrations were 5, ND, 108, 23810, 83, ND, 77 and 150 mg kg(-1) for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively. The RDS enrichment ratio was Cr(1.3 x ), Cu(2.6 x ), Fe(3.3 x ), Mn(1.5 x ), Pb(1.5 x ) and Zn(2.1 x ). The Geo-accumulation Index values showed that RDS were moderately polluted for Cu and slighted polluted for Zn and Pb. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the accumulation of toxic heavy metals decreased according to water flow. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[dos Santos, Paula R.

Genotoxic effects of 4-nonylphenol and Cyproterone Acetate on Rana catesbeiana (anura) tadpoles and juveniles	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						Micronuclei; Nuclear abnormalities; EDCs; Biomarkers; Bioindicator	DNA-DAMAGE; BLOOD; FISH; MICRONUCLEI; BIOMARKERS; DECLINES; RIVER	Genotoxic analyses are commonly used in ecotoxicological studies as early biomarkers to investigate the potential effects of environmental contaminants on biological models. Several pollutants can induce DNA damage and, therefore, counting micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities are efficient tools to evaluate genotoxicity. Some pollutants such as 4-nonylphenol (NP), a detergent used mainly in industries, and Cyproterone Acetate (CPA), an antiandrogenic medicine, have already shown genotoxic effects on some vertebrates. However, although amphibians are considered bioindicators of environmental quality and their populations are declining worldwide, the effects of these compounds on anurans are not yet known and, therefore, we believe that it is important to investigate such effects on anurans. Since water contamination is one of the ultimate causes of amphibian decline, ecotoxicological studies are important to discuss the appropriate solutions to avoid species extinction. Thus, this study investigates the genotoxic effects on Rana catesbeiana tadpoles and juveniles after being exposed to 1,10 and 100 mu g/L NP and 0.025, 0.25 and 2.5 ng/L CPA, by counting the nuclear abnormalities after exposure. The laboratory experiments lasted 28 days. The experimental conditions were the same except for the water volume since tadpoles and juveniles exhibit different habits at different developmental stages. Compared to juveniles, tadpoles were more susceptible to both compounds as indicated by the increased nuclear abnormalities observed in the highest NP concentration and all tested CPA concentrations. The juveniles, on the other hand, responded only to the two highest CPA concentrations. We concluded that CPA, even at very low concentrations, is extremely harmful to both anuran developmental stages and, particularly, to tadpoles. The significant effects observed on tadpoles is an important outcome of this study since 100 mu g/L or higher NP concentrations are frequently detected in the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Being popular or freak: how alien plants integrate into native plant-frugivore networks	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Fruit traits; Invasive species; Darwin's naturalization hypothesis; Similarity hypothesis; Seed dispersal mutualism; Subtropical Andean forests	DARWINS NATURALIZATION CONUNDRUM; VERTEBRATE-DISPERSED FRUITS; SECONDARY METABOLITES; BIRDS; FORESTS; TRAITS; NUTRIENTS; INVASIONS; INSIGHTS; INCREASE	The generalist diet of most frugivores opens a window of opportunity to the invasion of alien plants whit fleshy-fruits. The outcome of the new relationships between alien plants and native frugivores depends both on traits of the invaders and of the mutualist partners in the recipient community. Two contrasting hypotheses attempt to explain the integration of alien species in native communities. Darwin's naturalization hypothesis proposes that alien species more different from native species are more likely to integrate in the community. The similarity hypothesis proposes the opposite, that alien species more similar to native species are more likely to integrate the native community. By comparing chemical and morphological traits of 12 alien and 48 native fleshy-fruited species, we tested both hypothesis as assembly rules of alien species in subtropical Andean forests. We did not find differences in most chemical or morphological traits between alien and native fruit species. The multidimensional variation of alien fruit traits was nested within that of native species. However, alien fruits tended to score high in the range of variation of native chemical traits. Accordingly, we propose the fraction similarity hypothesis as a main force that drive the assembly of alien species in mutualistic networks, i.e. alien species benefit from existing mutualistic interactions that involve fruit species with traits selected by the frugivores to invade native communities. The striking similarity in fruit traits between alien and native species highlights the potential role of seed dispersers as ecological filters to the invasion of alien plants. In turn, this similarity suggests that alien fruits can be functionally equivalent to native ones in terms of their interaction with fruit-eating birds.

Relationships between the distribution and abundance of the invasive faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata) and environmental factors in Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Bithynia tentaculata; Faucet snail; Coastal wetland; Great Lakes; Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program	INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; GREEN BAY; DESICCATION; RESISTANCE; DISPERSAL; SELECTION; BIOLOGY; SPREAD; DUCKS; MODEL	The faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata) was introduced to the Great Lakes region in the late 1800s. Faucet snails alter native community dynamics and are an intermediate host for multiple trematode parasites that can be lethal to waterfowl when the snails are consumed. Although faucet snails have been established in the Great Lakes for over a century, their populations appear to have remained small for most of this period and their known distribution was limited to the lower Great Lakes, though basin-wide surveys were lacking until recently, so snails may have gone undetected. We compiled data from a five-year coastal wetland monitoring program spanning all of the Great Lakes, providing a basin-wide inventory of faucet snail populations and confirming the snail's presence in every Great Lake. Further, we identified potential drivers of faucet snail occurrence and abundance (individuals per sampling replicate) across the basin and within individual lakes to identify factors that could lead to elevated risk of range expansion. Across the basin and within individual lakes, faucet snail occurrence was related to human recreational transport (proximity to a boat launch) and eutrophication (anthropogenic land-use, elevated nutrient concentrations). In addition, at sites where faucet snails occurred, they were most abundant at wetlands with surrounding forest cover, suggesting that the species can thrive in a range of environmental conditions. Our results suggest that limiting passive transport of faucet snails is vital to minimizing their spread to remote wetlands where the snails may thrive once established.

Parasitism declines with distance from the site of introduction for the kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (F.), and depends on host density at different spatial scales	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Parasitism; Population spread; Invasion; Clutch size; Enemy release hypothesis; Encounter-dilution	PLATASPIDAE; STRATEGIES; ANIMALS; COMPLEX; MODELS; SLOW; SIZE	Individuals at the frontlines of expanding populations tend to experience less parasitism than those in the core of their range. This reduction in parasitism may contribute to the rapid spread of invasive species because parasites could otherwise reduce host population growth. To better understand patterns of parasitism in the invasive population of the kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (F.), we examined how both the proportion of eggs parasitized and the incidence of parasitism-presence or absence of parasitism within a clutch of eggs-varied with distance from the kudzu bug's site of introduction and with their density at two different spatial scales: at the level of sites (10-20m(2)) and the level of the egg clutch (number of eggs in a clutch). Egg clutches were collected from populations along an east-west and a south-north transect of the U.S. invasion. We found that both metrics of parasitism declined with increasing host-density at the site level, which may be a general trend for the wind-dispersed parasites of invasive species. We also found that both metrics of parasitism declined with increasing distance from the site of introduction. However, since kudzu bug density tended to decrease across their invasion gradient and parasitism rates increased with decreasing kudzu bug density, the reductions in parasitism with increasing distance from site of introduction were not discernible if the effect of site-level density was not accounted for; leaving site-level density out of our models made it seem as though there was no distance effect. This finding complicates models that exhibit a honeymoon phase, where vanguard populations of the host suffer from little or no parasitism. In addition, we observed a small effect of clutch size on the incidence of parasitism, but no interaction among the spatial scales of density investigated. Our results underscore the importance of considering host density at different scales when seeking to understand trends in parasitism across a host's invasive range.

Landscape analysis provides a powerful toolset for assessing invasive species invasions over time and for planning control measures. We applied a combination of aerial mapping and landscape analysis to assess the invasion of the legume, Lupinus polyphyllus, in the Rhon UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The Biosphere Reserve contains different types of large and well-connected grasslands threatened by lupine invasion. We assessed the changes in lupine distribution between 1998 and 2016 in a strictly protected part of the Biosphere Reserve by means of landscape structure analysis. The area invaded by L. polyphyllus doubled from 1998 to 2016. While the number of lupine stands decreased by 25%, stand size on average increased by 300%; stands also became less compact during that period. Furthermore, the degree of invasion of different grassland types changed. In 1998, all investigated grassland types were invaded to equal extents, whereas in 2016, large and well-connected mesic grasslands located close to roads were more heavily invaded than small and remote wet grasslands. Our results show that landscape composition plays an important role for the spread of lupine. Specifically, invasive stand characteristics, such as stand size, form, and connectivity, are crucial for driving the invasion of lupine. Therefore, in addition to landscape composition, invasive stand characteristics should be included in the planning of conservation measures. Overall, aerial mapping combined with landscape analysis provides a cost-effective and practical tool for landscape managers to prioritize invasive control measures.

In tropical savannas, water and light availability are often spatially and temporally heterogeneous, so that non-native species capable of changing their phenology in response to these factors are more likely to succeed in these ecosystems. We compared flowering onset and flowering period among African and native grasses in a Brazilian Neotropical savanna and assessed if these traits and the production of flowering tillers differ between two consecutive years and respond to spatial heterogeneity in water table depth and canopy closure. Non-native species showed multiple flowering patterns; Urochloa decumbens flowered from the mid-rainy season to the mid-dry season, Melinis minutiflora flowered during the dry season and Mepens repens flowered throughout the year. In addition, they were responsive to annual and abiotic variation, as U. decumbens also showed longer flowering period and produced more flowering tillers in the second year, except over shallow groundwater and high canopy closure, whereas M. minutiflora produced fewer flowering tillers under high canopy closure and M. repens showed large reproductive decline in the second year. Native grasses flowered in the middle of the rainy season regardless of annual and abiotic variation, although in the second year one species produced more flowering tillers in seasonally flooded sites. The phenology of M. repens is consistent with a ruderal life-history, so that it is only likely to become dominant under repeated disturbances. By contrast, the ability of changing flowering period and reproductive output according to growing conditions showed by U. decumbens and the distinct flowering timing showed by M. minutiflora may favour these species over less plastic native grasses, suggesting that phenological attributes contribute to the dominance of African grasses in Neotropical savannas.

Metabolic fingerprints reveal how an insect metabolome is affected by different larval host plant species	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Metabolic fingerprinting; Metabolome; Host plant; Pieris rapae	PIERIS-RAPAE; VARIABILITY; ADAPTATION; MYROSINASE; EVOLUTION; RESPONSES; DEFENSE; MOTH	Oligophagous insects can consume a wide range of different host plant species, but how these host plants vary in their metabolite compositions and the extent to which this variation affects the biochemistry of the insect herbivores is largely unknown. An understanding of how defensive metabolites from plants are processed by insects may help us develop more effective pesticides. We studied the interactions between the oligophagous insect herbivore Pieris rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) and five species of its larval host plants (family Brassicaceae and Cleomaceae) by examining untargeted metabolic fingerprints of the plants and the larval herbivores feeding on them. Visualisation of the metabolic fingerprints of the different host plant species showed highly distinctive clusters in the PCA-X score plots. Larvae could also be distinguished based on the species of host plant they fed on but clusters overlapped to a greater extent. The fingerprints of larvae feeding on Cleome spinosa plants were most distinctive due to a large group of abundant metabolites also found in high abundance in C. spinosa, but not in the other host plants examined. We conclude that host plants influence the biochemistry of their larval herbivores, and that some metabolites are conserved from one trophic level to the next.	[Riach, A. C.; Hill, J.

Temporal distribution in a tri-trophic system associated with Piper amalago L. in a tropical seasonal forest	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS			English	Article						Tropical forest; Tri-trophic; Parasitoid; Lepidoptera; Piper; Caterpillar; Insect seasonality	INSECT ABUNDANCE; PHENOLOGY; COMMUNITY; DIVERSITY; HERBIVORY; DRY	Insect seasonality is a known pattern that has intrigued ecologists for over 30years. However, despite being well understood in general, for several taxa such as Lepidopteran caterpillars its underlying causes and mechanisms are still not fully understood. This is especially critical for Brazilian tropical forests where caterpillars have previously been shown to have a puzzling pattern of peaking in abundance only in the first months of the dry season; however, this pattern still lacks an explanation. Here, to advance our understanding of the factors underlying seasonal changes in caterpillar abundance in tropical forests, we addressed how the lepidopteran caterpillar community that feeds on Piper amalago L. plants, their host plants leaf numbers, the herbivory levels, and the parasitoid pressure all change throughout the dry and wet seasons in a Brazilian tropical semideciduous forest. We found that immature abundance and herbivory peak in the first 2months of the dry season and then rapidly decrease and remain low throughout the remaining of the dry season and the entire wet season at the study site. However, although the proportion of parasitized immatures increased alongside caterpillar abundance, it peaked in the month that followed a drastic decrease in caterpillar abundance. These results suggest that parasitoids play a major role in the observed caterpillar abundance pattern and thus, we propose the hypothesis that high parasitoid predation pressure causes early eclosion and emergence of caterpillars and primarily drives caterpillar abundance seasonality in Brazilian tropical forests.

This study attempts to introduce spatial dependence into the UQR within the framework of random effects eigenvector spatial filtering, resulting in the model that we term the spatially filtered UQR (SF-UQR). We then develop a computationally efficient approach for SF-UQR estimation. Finally, the performance of the SF-UQR is tested with a hedonic land price model for the Tokyo metropolitan area.

Heterogeneity in childhood body mass trajectories in relation to prenatal phthalate exposure	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Prenatal; Phthalate; Trajectory; Body mass index; Development	ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS; GROWTH; OBESITY; ASSOCIATION; PREGNANCY; MODELS; INDEX; AGE; METABOLITES; OVERWEIGHT	Phthalates, compounds commonly used in plastics and personal care products, have been associated with childhood obesity in cross-sectional and some longitudinal studies. Using advanced statistical methods, we characterized the heterogeneity in body mass development patterns over childhood (ages 2-14 years) and explored associations with maternal prenatal urinary concentrations of phthalates among 335 children in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort study. Height and weight were measured every one to two years in this cohort, which had a high prevalence of obesity and overweight. Building upon a previous analysis that showed a positive association between prenatal phthalate exposure and body mass index (BMI) in CHAMACOS children, we used three advanced statistical methods: generalized additive models, growth mixture models, and functional principal component analysis with tree-based methods to identify patterns of childhood BMI development and allow for non-linear relationships with the environmental exposures. Our results highlight the heterogeneity in childhood BMI development patterns and suggest a sex-specific non-linear association between prenatal monoethyl phthalate urinary concentrations and BMI level in children, confirmed across a variety of statistical methods. There is also evidence to suggest positive associations between DEHP metabolites and BMI stabilization during puberty for girls.

Contribution of sociodemographic, occupational, lifestyle and dietary characteristics to the oxidative stress microenvironment in adipose tissue	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Adipose tissue; Oxidative stress; Sociodemographic characteristics; Diet; Lifestyle; Occupation	FREE-RADICALS; SUPEROXIDE-DISMUTASE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; REDOX HOMEOSTASIS; MECHANISMS; EXPOSURE; BIOMARKERS; POLLUTION; GENDER; RISK	The present study was conceived on the basis of the few previous reports suggesting a potential relevance of the oxidative stress microenvironment in the adipose tissue, a biological matrix which is closely related to the development of several chronic pathologies. Thus, our aim was to describe the levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and markers of oxidative damage in adipose tissue samples from a Spanish cohort, as well as their main sociodemographic, lifestyle, and dietary predictors. The study was conducted in a subsample (n = 271 adults) of GraMo cohort, recruited in Granada (Southern Spain). A face-to-face questionnaire was used to gather data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, dietary habits, health status, and perceived exposure to chemicals. We analyzed adipose tissue levels of lipid peroxidation (TBARS), total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity, and glutathione cycle biomarkers. Potential predictors of oxidative stress markers were assessed using stepwise multivariable linear regression analyses. SOD and TBARS levels were mainly related to sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, while the components of the glutathione cycle and HO-1 were predominantly associated with dietary habits. Men showed significantly lower levels of oxidative stress levels than women. In the regression models including only women, the use of oral contraceptive and hormonal therapy was associated with lower levels of oxidative stress, while the number of children was positively associated with increased oxidative biomarkers. Our results suggest that adipose tissue is potentially important matrix for the assessment of oxidative stress, which can be affected by specific environmental factors. These findings might be relevant for public health.

The impact of contemporary changes in climate and land use/cover on tendencies in water flow, suspended sediment yield and erosion intensity in the northeastern part of the Don River basin, SW European Russia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Soil erosion; Small catchment; Sedimentation; Caesium-137; Soil freezing; Snowmelt runoff; Flood; East European Plain	SOIL-EROSION; FOREST-STEPPE; COVER CHANGES; RAINFALL EROSIVITY; LOESS PLATEAU; FALLOUT RADIONUCLIDES; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CHANNEL INCISION; GULLY EROSION; SOUTHERN HALF	The basin of the Don River (the fifth longest river in Europe), located mainly in the forest-steppe and steppe landscape zones, is one of the most populated and agriculturally developed regions of the East European (Russian) Plain. Sheet, rill and gully erosion occurring chiefly in snowmelt period (March-April) and also in moderate-to-heavy-rainfalls season (chiefly May-to-September) is the main factor of present-day soil degradation within cultivated lands of this basin. Using monitoring hydrological data, it is shown, by the examples of the Khopyor River and the Medveditsa River flowing in the northeastern part of the Don River basin (SW European Russia), that suspended sediment yield of the rivers, as an objective and sufficiently accurate indicator of total erosion intensity in river basins, was reduced by 3.6-3.8 times between the 1960s-1970s and 2008-2015. This conclusion is consistent with change in sedimentation rates (using Cs-137 as a chronomarker) within one of the small catchments located in the basin of the upper reaches of the Medveditsa River. The noted dynamics in erosion intensity and suspended sediment yields took place against the background of a well-marked tendency (since the 1940s-1960s) of reduction in intra-annual unevenness of river water flow caused by a decrease in spring (snowmelt-induced, March-April) flood water flow, and by a more significant increase in water discharges during low-water-flow periods of year (winter (December-to-February) and river-ice-free period (mid-April-to-November)). These changes were accompanied by an increase in duration of spring (snowmelt-induced) flood flow with a reduction in its intensity, year-to-year anomalousness and contribution to total annual water flow of the rivers. The main reasons for all the changes noted over the last decades were climate change (a decrease in depth of soil freezing during snowmelt period caused by an increase in air temperature mainly in winter and spring months; an increase in winter thaws frequency) and human activity changes (mainly a reduction in cultivated land area, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s).

We added N, P or N + P to a Norway spruce forest in this region, to push the system to N or P limitation. Tree growth and needle nutrient concentrations indicated that the trees are P limited. EMF biomass was reduced only by N + P additions. Soil EMF communities responded more strongly to P than to N. Addition of apatite to ingrowth meshbags altered EMF community composition and enhanced the abundance of Imleria badia in the control and N plots, but not when P was added. The ecological significance of this species is discussed. Effects on tree growth, needle chemistry, and EMF communities indicate a dynamic interaction between EMF fungi and the nutrient status of trees and soils.

Fungal communities were assayed with sand-filled ingrowth meshbags incubated in the soil for 5 months. Meshbags amended with compost made from maize leaves (a C4 plant enriched in C-13) were incubated for 5 or 12 months and used to estimate C sequestration by the fungal community. Despite increases in tree growth, moderate warming only slightly reduced or had no effect on mycelial growth and had no effect on fungal carbon sequestration or overall ectomycorrhizal community composition. Warming was associated with increased abundance of ascomycetes, particularly pyronemataceous ectomycorrhizal fungi, and altered saprotrophic community composition. Increased nitrate availability and root turnover may explain the lack of a positive ectomycorrhizal growth response to increased tree growth and observed shifts in community composition with warming.

This study examines the relative importance of two global change drivers - atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and annual grass invasion - on structuring fungal communities in a California chaparral ecosystem, with emphasis on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We used molecular markers, functional groupings, generalized linear statistics and joint distribution modeling, to examine how environmental variables structure taxonomic and functional composition of fungal communities. Invasive grasses had a lower richness and relative abundance of symbiotic fungi (both AMF and other fungi) compared to native shrubs. We found a higher richness and abundance of rhizophilic (e.g. Glomeraceae) and edaphophilic (e.g. Gigasporaceae) AMF with increasing soil NO3. Our findings suggest that invasive persistence may decrease the presence of multiple soil symbionts that native species depend on for pathogen protection and increased access to soil resources.

The main goal of this work was to determine the effects of environmental and temporal factors on AMF living in sand dunes (Gulf of Valencia, Spain). Soil samples were collected seasonally at 6 sites, during 2 yrs, from three habitats and four plant species and the frequency and relative abundance of AMF was examined. AMF were more frequent in mobile than in embryonic dunes, in spring and in sites with old vegetation. Ten AMF species were identified, their distribution depending mainly on the anthropogenic disturbance of the site. Gigasporaceae Cetraspora sp. and Dentiscutata sp. preferred undisturbed soil whereas Diversisporaceae, Glomeraceae and other Gigasporaceae were associated with recently restored soils. All AMF species were found in all plant species although Corymbiglomus corymbiforme was mainly associated with Echinophora spinosa. Our results might be of help for Mediterranean sand dune restoration. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

A total of 22 species belonging to ten genera and five families were recorded. Glomus macrocarpum and Rhizoglomus microaggregatum had large biomass and frequencies of glomerospores at both sites. Glomerospore abundance was higher in the dry season in dunes and in the rainy season in restinga. Redundancy analysis revealed significant relationships between AMF-physical and chemical soil parameters. Shannon's index and Pielou's evenness indicated greater AMF diversity in dunes than restinga, despite the lower number of glomerospores in dunes. These results highlight the importance of knowing the AMF communities in different coastal ecosystems, especially in dunes, which due to the low vegetation cover are most frequently impacted by anthropic actions.

The aim of this study is comparing the performance of an artificial neural network (ANN) model, wavelet-based artificial neural network (WANN) model and GR4J lumped daily conceptual model for rainfall-runoff modelling of two rivers in the USA. It was obtained that the performance of the data-driven models (ANN, WANN) is better than the GR4J model especially when streamflow data the preceding day (Q(t-1)) and streamflow data the preceding two days (Q(t-2)) are used as input data in the ANN and WANN models for the simulation of low and high flows, in particular. On the other hand, when only precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data are used as input variables, the GR4J model performs better than the data-driven models.

A survey was conducted in five farming systems in Uganda to isolate entomopathogens associated with X. compactus. Four fungal isolates were screened for virulence against X. compactus in the laboratory at 1 x 10(7) conidia ml(-1) where an atoxigenic L-strain of A. flavus killed 70%-100% of all stages of X. compactus compared with other unidentified isolates which caused 20%-70% mortalities. The time taken by A. flavus to kill 50% of X. compactus eggs, larvae, pupae and adults in the laboratory was 2-3 days; whereas the other unidentified fungal isolates took 4-7 days. The concentrations of A. flavus that killed 50% of different stages of X. compactus were 5 x 10(5), 12 x 10(5), 17 x 10(5) and 30 x 10(5) conidia ml(-1) for larvae, eggs, pupae and adults respectively. A formulation of A. flavus in oil caused higher mortalities of X. compactus larvae, pupae and adults in the field (71%-79%) than its formulation in water (33%-47%). The atoxigenic strain of A. flavus could therefore be developed into a safe biopesticide against X. compactus.

Sigma PAH concentrations (0.65-175ng/g) in Edremit Bay sediments indicated low pollution. Sigma PAH levels were decreased in the order of inner (81.1 +/- 47.0ng/g), northern (48.4 +/- 15.9ng/g), and southern (19.0 +/- 15.8ng/g) bays. p,p'-DDE was the only organochlorine pesticide detected in Edremit Bay sediments and found between nd to 1.16ng/g dw. According to sediment quality guidelines, PAHs and p,p'-DDE levels in Edremit Bay were below the threshold effect level, effect range low, and threshold effect concentration limits and the sediments have no potential ecological risks. Two- to 3-ring PAHs were found at higher levels than 4- to 5-ring PAHs. Molecular PAHs ratios and Principal Component Analysis-Multiple Linear Regression analyses indicated combustion of wood-coal and vehicle emissions might have contributed to PAH levels in the bay.

Badgers exhibit an unusual reproductive physiology in that females may maintain fertilised eggs and dormant blastocysts at any time of year and delay their implantation until the winter. It is thus necessary to evaluate the consequences of delayed implantation and timing of vaccination on the effectiveness of GonaCon for fertility control of female badgers. We found that vaccination in June had an immediate effect on the fertility indicators monitored and inhibited subsequent cub production in the following year, while vaccination in November had no effect. Further results suggest that the optimal vaccination window in badgers could be as narrow as between June and August. The longer-term effectiveness of GonaCon vaccination in female badgers appears to reflect maintenance of anti-GnRH antibody titres at or above a putative threshold titre of 1:128,000, a threshold higher than that reported for other species (1:64,000). While it is possible that using a larger dose (>1mL) might lead to longer lasting effects, this study shows that vaccination would need to be repeated at least every 2years in order to maintain levels of female infertility predicted to have demographic impacts on badger populations. Overall, no negative welfare consequences were observed in vaccinated badgers indicating that GonaCon is a potential tool for the management of conflicts involving badgers.

The influence of the lunar cycle on amphibian roadkills	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Lunar effects; Migration; Moonlight; Roads; Weather conditions	ROAD MORTALITY; BREEDING PHENOLOGY; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; COMMON TOAD; BUFO; ORIENTATION; KILLS; INFRASTRUCTURE; CONSEQUENCES; HERPETOFAUNA	Annually, roads, and their associated users, are responsible for millions of roadkills worldwide. Mortality affects multiple taxonomic groups, but amphibians are particularly vulnerable, due to their size and underreporting. In fact, very high mortality frequencies can occur, mostly during short periods of time, when individuals migrate to and from reproduction areas (e.g., ponds). In this study, we assess the influence of the lunar cycle on amphibian roadkills, while accounting for weather conditions. As expected, the main environmental effects explaining roadkill numbers were weather related, with increases in minimum air temperature, average relative air humidity, and cumulative rainfall during the previous 24h having a positive effect on roadkill numbers for all studied species. However, the lunar cycle also affected roadkills for two of the studied species. Darker nights had higher numbers of roadkills of Pleurodeles waltl, while moonlit nights had higher numbers of Salamandra salamandra. As such, these moon effects are species specific. Animals that are more active in moonlight may be at an advantage if their visual acuity is better than that of their predators. We hypothesize that differences between species in the response to moonlight may be due to differences perceived in predation risk. This information should be considered when designing mitigation measures. Volunteer actions, for instance, can be planned and coordinated keeping in mind the most appropriate weather conditions for the general amphibian community and specific phases of the lunar cycle for particular species.

For the purpose of this study, nine sections were delimited, each with four points of collecting groundwater. In the groundwater samples, there were measured NH4+, NO3-, and NO2-. Due to the small number of samples, the analysis was limited to deterministic interpolation methods. The following methods were compared using leave-one-out cross-validation procedure: triangulation, inverse distance weighting, radial base function, and modified Shepard's method. The methods which proved to be optimal were used to create spatial variability maps of the analysed parameters. Spatial interpolation and visualization of the results were performed in Surfer ver.16, and other calculations were conducted using R software.

Given the current threats to freshwater biodiversity, it is of fundamental importance to address scale effects on the performance of niche-based SDMs of freshwater species' distributions. The scale effects are addressed here in the context of hierarchical catchment ordering, considered as counterpart to coarsening grain-size by increasing grid-cell size. We combine fish occurrence data from the Danube River Basin, the hierarchical catchment ordering and multiple environmental factors representing topographic, climatic and anthropogenic effects to model fish occurrence probability across multiple scales. We focus on 1st to 5th order catchments. The spatial scale (hierarchical catchment order) only marginally influences the mean performance of SDMs, however the uncertainty of the estimates increases with scale. Key predictors and their relative importance are scale and species dependent. Our findings have useful implications for choosing proper species dependent spatial scales for river rehabilitation measures, and for conservation planning in areas where fine grain species data are unavailable.

Methods The field experiment occurred in the San Jose Hills of Southern California on the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona campus. Plots were established within three different slope locations (shallow, moderate and steep) within four separate canyons. Three nitrogen treatments (ambient, addition and removal) were replicated within each slope location for all four canyons, and five S. pulchra plants were planted in each plot. Soil nitrogen accumulation and soil moisture, as well as other abiotic variables, were measured across the varied slope locations and nitrogen treatments. We measured the cover, stress, and reproduction of S. pulchra plants for 2 years and used a mesocosm experiment to determine how S. pulchra responds to varying water and nitrogen availability. Important Findings Stipa pulchra had a strong positive response to the wettest watering treatment and a weak response to nitrogen addition in the mesocosm experiment. In the field experiment, S. pulchra responded positively in moderate slope locations and did not respond to nitrogen treatments, possibly due to drought. Field patterns of soil moisture were driven by slope, soil compaction and solar radiation. Soil nitrogen accumulation did not vary among slope locations. For restoration of S. pulchra, priority should be placed on managing soil moisture availability and determining suitable edaphic factors.

However, few studies have directly examined the ecological significance of clonal integration in the ability of clonal plants to tolerate biotic stress such as herbivory. Methods We grew clonal fragments of an invasive clonal plant Alternanthera philoxeroides, each consisting of an apical part (relatively young) and a basal part (relatively old), at two levels (low and high) of soil nitrogen (N). For each fragment, the apical part was subjected to either no herbivory or herbivory for 2 weeks by a specialist insect, Agasicles hygrophila, and was either connected with or disconnected from the basal part not subjected to herbivory. Important Findings Herbivory in the apical part severely reduced leaf growth (leaf mass, leaf number or leaf area) and ramet production of both apical and basal parts, and increased root to shoot ratio of the apical part. Irrespective of herbivory and soil N, stem connection between the apical and the basal part decreased root to shoot ratio of the apical part, but did not change its growth measures. Meanwhile, connection increased stem N concentration of the apical part growing under high-N supply and decreased stem carbon (C) concentration of the apical part under low-N supply. By contrast, connection increased root to shoot ratio of the basal part, but reduced its leaf and ramet production. Connection also increased leaf and stem C concentrations of the basal part under low-N supply. Thus, clonal integration can be beneficial for the early development of young A. philoxeroides ramets, but not for their local adaptation to herbivory damage by A. hygrophila.

However, plant-herbivore interactions are also driven by resource availability, such as soil nutrient content, and it remains unclear whether broad-scale variation in soil factors is reflected in herbivore consumption rates across species' ranges. Additionally, we know little of how intraspecific variation in tissue quality associates with edaphic and climatic factors, and how this variation controls herbivore consumption. The resource availability hypothesis (RAH) predicts that plant individuals growing in lowresource environments will have lower leaf nutritional quality and more constitutive defenses, which will result in lower rates of leaf consumption. Methods We collected leaves from the old-field dominant species, Solidago altissima L., from 20 sites across 10 degrees of latitude in the Eastern USA to determine the percentage leaf area consumed by insect folivores. We obtained soil and climate data for each site, as well as plant functional and defensive traits, including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf carbon: nitrogen (C:N), and trichome density. Important Findings Although we found no significant latitudinal trend of leaf consumption rate, there was strong evidence that leaf herbivory decreased with leaf C: N and trichome density, which themselves decreased with soil N, supporting our hypothesis that the RAH applies for intraspecific variation across spatial gradients. Additionally, high precipitation seasonality and soil nitrogen predicted decreased herbivory. The results suggest that spatial variation in herbivory can be driven by factors other than herbivore communities and climatic gradients, and that bottom-up processes, where plant traits and soil fertility control leaf consumption, must be incorporated into spatial predictions of herbivory.

Evaluation of the relative contribution of each factor is important not only for the further understanding of invasion processes but also for the better management of invasion risk, particularly in protected areas of high conservation priority. Here, we quantified the relative importance of species biological traits and association with a human activity, i.e. agriculture, in explaining the invasion success of alien plants across the entire region and in protected areas in Hokkaido, Japan. Methods As a quantitative measure of invasion success, the distribution extent of naturalized populations across the entire prefecture and in protected areas was calculated for 63 alien species with equal residence time based on species occurrence records at a spatial resolution of 5-km mesh grid units. For each species, we identified seven biological traits (seed mass, dispersal mode, maximum plant height, capability of vegetative reproduction, flowering start time and period and life span) and two human-associated factors (introduction purpose and cultivation frequency for agricultural use). Cultivation frequency was determined based on the frequency of seed-sowing in pastures: (1) not sown, (2) accidentally sown as a seed contaminant and (3) intentionally sown for commercial cultivation. The importance of biological traits and human-associated factors in explaining the distribution extent was determined using an information-theoretic approach. Important Findings In explaining the distribution extent across the entire prefecture, species biological traits and human-associated factors showed comparable importance; cultivation frequency exhibited the highest importance value closely followed by seed mass, maximum height and flowering period. In contrast, when focusing on protected areas, human association was more important than biological traits, as indicated by the greatest importance of cultivation frequency and much lower values for most biological traits. The results demonstrated that species biological traits and human association almost equally contributed to invasion success across the entire region, while invasions into protected areas were more attributable to human association than to biological traits. We highlight that the control of propagule pressure associated with artificial cultivation may be key to preventing further invasions into protected areas.

Here, we investigated how community composition altered the community herbivory in natural ecosystems and compared the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of nitrogen addition on community herbivory. Methods We conducted a 7-year nitrogen addition experiment in an alpine meadow to evaluate the effects of fertilization on both herbivory frequency and severity, and we divided plants into four functional groups to investigate how changes in plant community functional composition affect community herbivory frequency. To separate the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of fertilization on community herbivory frequency, we build a serious of generalized models to select variables and used SEM methods to estimate relative contributions of the direct and indirect effects. Important findings We found that nitrogen addition increased community herbivory frequency, but not community herbivory severity in our 7-year nitrogen addition experiment. Although the most parsimonious model for explaining the variation in community herbivory frequency included fixed average of herbivory frequency and nitrogen addition, community fixed average of herbivory was the best single predictor for community herbivory frequency in our study. Changes in fixed average of herbivory frequency mediated by plant community composition (indirect effect) outperformed changes in species-specific herbivory frequency (direct effect) under fertilization in driving community herbivory frequency. Our research suggested that indirect effects caused by changes in plant community composition played a more important role in invertebrate herbivory under the condition of anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment.

Here, we asked whether coastal heath vegetation established in stressful habitats could be assembled by quasi-neutral mechanisms based on functional trait distribution. Communities are organized through quasi-neutral dynamics if abiotic gradients and/or species interactions impose sorting on functional traits and species performances, but not on species phylogenetic relatedness and occurrence. Methods The study was conducted in a coastal area containing tall dunes near the sea, and relatively flat areas punctuated by short palaeodunes further inland, Northeastern South America. We evaluated 10 traits of the 21 most abundant species, as well as eight abiotic variables in 70 plots (25 m(2)) established in dune tops, valleys, flat and steep microenvironments. The effect of environmental filter was tested by linear mixed models (LMM) between each community-weighted mean (CWM) trait and the abiotic variables, and by two indices of environmental filtering based on intra-and interspecific-trait variability relative to null models. To evaluate the effect of species interactions, we used an index of niche overlap relative to null models, and LMMs between this index and the species richness of plots. Important Findings The environmental filtering index did not deviate from null expectations for any trait. Models that included individual variability performed similarly to models that used species mean traits. However, the explicit consideration of environmental gradients by CWM analyses revealed functional patterns that would remain undetected if trait distribution was analyzed only. In addition, intraspecific variation in the stem length was an important driver of species diversity as suggested by the relationship between species richness and the niche overlap index. Based on the occurrence and phylogenetic relatedness of species, previous work in the same system found neutral community assembly. We concluded that to ignore functional traits may lead to underestimations of niche-based processes, and that analyses of species occurrence and phylogenetic relatedness should be complemented with functional traits to reinforce our interpretation of processes underpinning community assembly. In this regard, the study heath vegetation is influenced by quasi-neutral effects on functional trait distribution.

Fraying around the edges: negative effects of the invasive Tradescantia zebrina Hort. ex Bosse (Commelinaceae) on tree regeneration in the Atlantic Forest under different competitive and environmental conditions	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						plant invasion; competition; forest edge; plant recruitment; Tradescantia zebrina; inch plant; removal treatment	PLANT INVASION; LANDSCAPE; IMPACTS; CONSEQUENCES; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEM; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; CLIMATE; LAND	Aims Invasive plants modify the structure and functioning of natural environments and threat native plant communities. Invasive species are often favored by human interference such as the creation of artificial forest edges. Field removal experiments may clarify if invasive plants are detrimental to native plant regeneration and how this is related to other local factors. We assessed the joint effect of environment and competition with the invasive Tradescantia zebrina on tree species recruitment in an Atlantic Forest fragment. Methods We carried out the experimental study in the Iguacu National Park, located in southern Brazil, using 30 plots distributed across five invaded sites during 6 months. We counted T. zebrina leaves and recorded the abundance and height of tree recruits over time under contrasting environmental (forest edge vs. forest interior) and removal (all aboveground biomass, only T. zebrina removal, and control) treatments. We analyzed the effects of environment and removal treatment using generalized linear mixed models. Important Findings The invasive species performed better at the forest edge than in the interior. The higher competitive pressure of T. zebrina led to higher mortality and lower height of tree recruits. Invader removal favored tree recruitment, especially in the forest interior. Our study shows that T. zebrina hampers woody species regeneration in tropical Atlantic Forests, especially at the forest edge.	[Chiba de Castro, Wagner A.; Garrido, Federico H.

Determinants of earthquake damage liability assignment in Oklahoma: A Bayesian Tobit censored approach	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Wastewater injection; Induced earthquakes; Bayesian tobit censored approach; Earthquake damage liability; Oklahoma	WASTE-WATER INJECTION; INDUCED SEISMICITY; FRACKING; RECOVERY	Scientific evidence suggests earthquakes occurring in Oklahoma since 2009 are not "acts of God", but very likely triggered by wastewater injection in disposal wells by oil and gas (O&G) companies. While sustaining the O&G industry's contribution to the economy is generally important, achieving environmental and public protection may in part rely on how earthquake inducers are held liable for damage. We use a Bayesian Tobit censored model, estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to determine factors that influence public preferences for how much liability O&G companies should assume for induced earthquake-related damage. Data are from a survey of Oklahomans collected in 2017 by Survey Sampling International (SSI). Results suggest people would, on average, hold O&G companies liable for 75% of the earthquake damage. We find socio-demographic, earthquake, locational, and O&G industry-related factors as the main drivers of earthquake damage liability. However, their effects on damage liability vary between respondents that have had their property damaged by earthquakes and those that in some way benefit from O&G companies through jobs and gas-leases. We provide insights by which individuals might lobby representatives to impose new liability or regulatory mechanisms on O&G companies to avoid or compensate for earthquake damage.

A statewide urban tree canopy mapping method	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban tree canopy; Object-based classification/segmentation; NAIP aerial imagery	IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; LAND-COVER; ACCURACY; LANDSCAPE; AIRBORNE; PIXEL; CITY	Maps of urban tree canopy are essential to estimate the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem services, and to determine who benefits from them. Our objective was to develop a repeatable method to map urban tree canopy cover for the state of Wisconsin. We compared two types of imagery (pan-sharpened 1.5 m SPOT-6 and 1 m NAIP aerial photography), three classification algorithms, seven segment sizes ranging from single pixels to 105 m(2), three levels of compactness for each segment size, and sixteen subsets of features. NAIP outperformed SPOT. On average across classification algorithms there were no significant differences in map agreement. Pixel-based maps with convolution features performed as well as the best segment-based maps. The best segment size tested was 60 m(2) on average, but there was also a local maximum around 15 m(2), which suggests a large range of possible segment sizes must be tested to find the best. The model chosen for application to the whole state was a pixel-level Random Forest classifier with 160 features, and the final state-wide map has five classes: tree/woody vegetation, grass/herbaceous vegetation, impervious surfaces/bare soil, water, and non-forested wetland. Overall accuracy for our state-wide map at the pixel-scale was 79.3% (95% CI: 77.5-81%). Errors occurred due to meter-scale heterogeneity in the urban environment which increases the errors due to spatial misregistration and the number of difficult-to-classify mixed and edge pixels. At larger management level scales, mean absolute error (MAE) decreases to about 10% at the Landsat pixel scale and about 6% at the scale of a city block. Our work is comparable to past efforts to map urban tree canopy, and the open source software and use of imagery that is freely available for all cities in the contiguous US make it broadly applicable.

Techniques that use coagulants and clays to remove particulates and dissolved phosphorus from the water column have received great. In this study, bench-scale "flock & sink" assays were carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the coagulants aluminium sulphate (SUL), polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and chitosan (CHI), alone and combined with natural bentonite clays (BEN) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB), to remove of phosphorus from a eutrophic reservoir in a semi-arid region of Brazil. In addition, the study seeks to assess the effects on the cyanobacteria density and the intra- and extracellular concentrations of cyanotoxins after the application of these geoengineering materials. The SUL and PAC coagulants effectively reduced the total phosphorus (TP), reactive soluble phosphorus (SRP), turbidity, chlorophyll-a, cyanobacteria density and intracellular microcystin, whereas CHI showed a low removal efficiency. lanthanum-modified bentonite proved to be more effective than BEN; however, the application of the coagulants only was sufficient to successfully remove phosphorus and cyanobacteria from the water column. In addition, the efficiency of the "flock & sink" technique in cell removal varied among the cyanobacteria species. Small colonial species such as Aphanocapsa delicatissima, Merismopedia glauca and Merismopedia tenuissima were removed regardless of the treatment used, including those with CHI and BEN. As for the filamentous cyanobacteria, Cylin-drospermopsis raciborskii, Geitlerinema amphibium, Planktothrbc agardhii and Pseudanabaena catenata, removal was achieved only using PAC, SUL and LMB alone or when combined. The intracellular concentrations of saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin and the extracellular fraction of these cyanotoxins and of microcystin were not influenced by the application of coagulants and clays. This indicates that cell lysis did not occur with the addition of the geoengineering materials. These results demonstrate that the "flock & sink" technique could be used for restoration of eutrophic waters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, they can prove inefficient in case of scansorial animals such as martens and raccoons, which can touch the electric fence without being grounded, thus not experiencing the electric shock. To overcome this limitation, we developed a twin-lead type electric wire fence comprising two parallel conductor wires spaced by a polyethylene ribbon containing two wire lines: one connected to the power source and the other connected to the earth. We then investigated whether the twin-lead type electric wire fence could effectively deter scansorial animals using two species: the Japanese marten and raccoon. A feeder was installed on the top of a pole at a height of 1.5m above the ground. Three test plots were set up: (1) the twin-lead wire wound around the pole: an electric wire fence plot (EF plot), (2) a commercially available barbed iron plate plot (BP plot), and (3) no countermeasures against scansorial animals: control, unfenced plot (CT plot). The behavior of the scansorial animals attracted to each feeder was recorded using remote video cameras. Variable voltage appliances were attached to the electric fence and the deterring effect of scansorial animals was compared among test plots. The experiment comprised six experimental stages, which differed by the use of electric voltage in the twin-lead fence. We observed that the Japanese marten experienced an electrical shock from the fence at a voltage of approximately 2kV and avoided the EF plot in further experimental stages with higher voltages. The raccoon began experiencing an electric shock at a voltage of approximately 0.5kV and avoided EF plots in experimental stages at >2.8kV voltages. Conversely, the effects of the barbed iron plate could not be confirmed against both the species. These results show that the twin-lead type electric wire fence can effectively deter scansorial animals from climbing, when energized with voltages >2.8kV.

Investigating the use of microdialysis and SEC-UV-ICP-MS to assess iodine interactions in soil solution	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Iodine; Soil; Microdialysis; Speciation; SEC; UV; ICP-MS	HUMIC SUBSTANCES; ORGANIC-MATTER; NITROGEN-COMPOUNDS; RADIOIODINE I-129; SORPTION; IODATE; FLOW; SPECIATION; FRACTIONATION; GEOCHEMISTRY	Element cycling in the terrestrial environment is heavily reliant upon processes that occur in soil solution. Here we present the first application of microdialysis to sample iodine from soil solution. In comparison to conventional soil solution extraction methods such as Rhizon (TM) samplers, centrifugation, and high-pressure squeezing, microdialysis can passively sample dissolved compounds from soil solution without altering the in-situ speciation of trace elements at realistic soil moisture conditions. In order to assess the suitability of microdialysis for sampling iodine, the permeability factors and effect of perfusion flowrate on I- and IO3- recovery was examined in stirred solutions. Furthermore, microdialysis was used to sample native soluble iodine at a range of water contents and iodine-enriched soils to investigate iodine soil dynamics. Total iodine concentrations were measured using ICP-MS. Inorganic species and the molecular weight distribution of organically bound iodine were determined by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to an ICP-MS, respectively. The most effective recovery rates in stirred solution were observed with the slowest perfusion flowrate yielding 66.2 +/- 7.1 and 70.5 +/- 7.1% for I- and IO3-, respectively. Microdialysis was proven to be capable of sampling dissolved iodine from the soil solution, which accounted for <2.5% of the total soil iodine and speciation followed the sequence: organic-I > I- > IO3-. The use of SEC coupled to (i) UV and (ii) ICP-MS analysis provided detail regarding the molecular weight distribution of dissolved org-I compounds. Dissolved org-I was detected with approximate molecular weights between 0.1 and 4.5 kDa. The results in this study show that microdialysis is a suitable technique for sampling dissolved iodine species from soils maintained at realistic moisture contents. In addition, inorganic iodine added to soils was predominately bound with relatively low molecular weight (<4.5 kDa) soluble organic matter. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to assess how metal(loid)s soluble at high pH, such as arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), and vanadium (V) are removed in constructed wetlands and how they accumulate in the sediments and the plants (Phragmites australis, common reed). The results show that reedbeds were very effective at removing calcium (98%), aluminium (81%), barium (98%), chromium (90%), gallium (80%), nickel (98%), and zinc (98%), and lowering pH and alkalinity. No statistical difference was found for As and V between leachate influent and wetland samples, showing that these metal(loid)s were not efficiently removed. As, Cr, and V were significantly higher in the reedbed sediments than in a reference site. However, sediment concentrations are not at levels that would pose a concern regarding reuse for agricultural purposes (average values of 39 +/- 26 mg kg(-1) for As, 108 +/- 15 mg kg(-1) for Cr, and 231 +/- 34 mg kg(-1) for V). Also, there is no significant uptake of metals by the aboveground portions of the reeds compared to reference conditions. Results show statistically significant enrichment in metal(loid)s in rhizomes and also a seasonal effect on the Cr concentrations. The data suggest minimal risk of oxyanion-forming element uptake and cycling in wetlands receiving alkaline steel slag.

The study used fish collected in the Amambai River, Upper Parana River, Brazil. The LIBS technique detected the presence of Fe in S. brasiliensis scales and Fe and Pb in P. lineatus scales on different regions. Using atomic absorption spectrometry, we verified a significant difference in Fe concentration in scales between the species analyzed, with a higher concentration in S. brasiliensis than in P. lineatus (p = 0.0004). Pb was not detected using atomic absorption spectrometry in either species because the concentration of this element was below the limit of detection of this technique. The LIBS technique was efficient in detecting Fe and Pb in scales of the two species analyzed, proving to be a promising tool for environmental monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pyrolysis biochar has negligible effects on soil greenhouse gas production, microbial communities, plant germination, and initial seedling growth	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Nitrous oxide; Agricultural soils; Biochar; Corn; Microorganisms	TEMPERATURE; OXIDATION; GREENGENES; STABILITY; BACTERIA; IMPACT; WATER; CROP	Biochar has been promoted as a soil amendment that enhances soil quality and agronomic productivity and reduces greenhouse gas production. However, these benefits are not always realized. A major hurdle to the beneficial use of biochar is our limited knowledge regarding the mechanisms directing its effects on soil systems. This project aimed to eliminate some of this uncertainty by examining the biological responses (plant productivity, greenhouse gas production, soil microbial community structure) of a suite of soils (10) to the addition of biochars produced by different processes (pyrolysis, gasification, burning) from a range of feedstocks (corn stalks, hardwood, grass). Results indicated that these three responses were not significantly impacted by the addition of pyrolysis biochars from different feedstocks at 1 and 5% (w/w) addition levels. On the other hand, both an open-air burned corn stalk (5%) and raw corn stalks (1 and 5%) additions did alter the measured soil functionality. For example, the 5% burnt corn stalks addition reduced total above ground plant biomass (-30%), increased observed N2O production by an order of magnitude, and altered soil bacterial community structure. The bacterial groups that increased in relative abundance in the burnt corn stalks-amended soils included families associated with cellulose decomposition (Chitinophagaceae), plant pathogens (Xanthomonadaceae), and biochar/charcoal-amended media (Gemmatimonadetes). In contrast, the abundance of these bacterial groups was not impacted by the pyrolysis biochars. Therefore, this research suggests that pyrolysis biochar represents a stabilized form of carbon that is resistant to microbial mineralization and has negligible effects on soil biological responses.

Russian olive habitat along an arid river supports fewer bird species, functional groups and a different species composition relative to mixed vegetation habitats	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Russian olive; Elaeagnus angustifolia; Native birds; Non-native; Riparian corridors	SALTCEDAR TAMARIX-CHINENSIS; RIO-GRANDE VALLEY; COLORADO RIVER; RIPARIAN; ESTABLISHMENT; COMMUNITIES; POPULATIONS; RESOURCES; RESPONSES; IMPACTS	The establishment and naturalization of non-native Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) in southwestern US riparian habitats is hypothesized to have negative implications for native flora and fauna. Despite the potential for Russian olive establishment in new riparian habitats, much of its ecology remains unclear. Arid river systems are important stopover sites and breeding grounds for birds, including some endangered species, and understanding how birds use Russian olive habitats has important implications for effective non-native species management. We compared native bird use of sites that varied in the amount of Russian olive and mixed native/non-native vegetation along the San Juan River, UT, USA. From presence/absence surveys conducted in 2016 during the breeding season, we found 1) fewer bird species and functional groups used Russian olive habitats and 2) the composition of species within Russian olive habitats was different from the composition of species in mixed native/non-native habitats. Our results suggest Russian olive may support different bird compositions during the breeding season and as Russian olive continues to naturalize, bird communities may change. Finally, we highlight the paucity of research surrounding Russian olive ecology and stress the need for rigorous studies to improve our understanding of Russian olive ecology.

Surely you don't eat parsnip skins? Categorising the edibility of food waste	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Food waste; Edibility; Food behaviour; Questionnaire study; Behaviour and perception survey; Household behaviour	INTERVENTIONS; MANAGEMENT; DRIVERS; DESIGN	Food that is either wasted or lost, rather than being eaten, accounts for around a third of global food production and is linked to several environmental, economic and social issues. The reliable quantification of this wasted food is essential to monitor progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, which covers food loss and waste. Currently quantification of food waste is made difficult by many differing definitions, some of which require categorisation of food items into those parts considered edible and those considered inedible. Edibility is difficult to define as it is affected by cultural and social influences. This study presents a novel, easily-replicable, questionnaire-based methodology to categorise 'borderline' food items thrown away from households, e.g. parsnip skin, apple cores. The methodology captures self-reported information on what people eat (self-reported consumption) and their perceptions of edibility. Our results for the United Kingdom indicate that, for a given food 'part', there is divergence between individuals' responses to the survey questions: e.g. many people would 'never' eat carrot skins, whilst many others would 'always' eat them. Furthermore, there is a systematic difference between people's self-reported consumption and their perceptions of edibility. We suggest that both need to be considered to create a balanced categorisation of edible and inedible parts; we propose a method for incorporating both elements. Within this method, a threshold needs to be applied and the resultant classification, especially of those items close to this threshold, will inevitably be contentious. Despite this, the categorisation of what is considered edible using this methodology reflects the views of the majority of the population, facilitating the quantification of food waste. In addition, we envisage this methodology can be used to compare geographical differences and track changes over time with regard to edibility.

Samples collected in a pristine site were exposed for 6 weeks at 3 sites characterized by different pollution, e.g. elemental and PAH depositions (site RU, close to wood-burning house chimneys; site UI, close to cast-ironworks; site CK, in a semi-natural context). Afterwards, samples were transferred to controlled fumigation chambers, where they were either O-3-treated for 2 weeks (250 ppb O-3 for 5 h day(-1), O-3(+) samples) or not (0 ppb O-3, O-3(-) samples). Three physiological markers (F-v/F-m, maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry; MDA, malondialdehyde content; potassium leakage) as well as elemental and PAH concentrations were measured in matched sets of sample replicates at each experimental step. Data were explored by multivariate techniques and the effects of field exposure and fumigation were tested by generalized linear models (GLM). Detrimental effects on MDA and F-v/F-m were observed limited to samples exposed in RU and UI sites. Physiological parameters in O-3-treated samples showed heterogeneous variation patterns with respect to field-exposed ones. A recovery of F-v/F-m was observed in RU- and UI-exposed samples, whereas a significant increase of MDA was highlighted limited to CKO3+ and CK O-3(-) samples, possibly related to a "chamber effect". Overall, the impairment caused by ozonation was limited, proving the strong Or tolerance of our test species. Interestingly, the content of the most abundant 4-ring PAHs in RU O-3(+) samples, which underwent the highest field enrichment of PAHs, was significantly lower than that of matched RU O-3(-) samples. This suggested a possible role of ozone in degrading PAHs at thallus level, with interesting interpretative repercussions in the context of transplant-based surveys aimed at evaluating PAH depositions when O-3 ground levels are high.

Evaluation of reclamation success in an open-pit coal mine using integrated soil physical, chemical and biological quality indicators	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Soil quality indices; Dry tropical forest; Soil macroinvertebrates; Vegetation cover; Technosols	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; INERTIA ANALYSIS; ORGANIC-MATTER; RESTORATION; FORESTS; PEDOGENESIS; EARTHWORMS; AREAS; FAUNA; INDEX	The evaluation and success of ecological reclamation can be assessed by measuring soil physical, chemical and biological variables, either in isolation or combined into composite indicators. In this study we tested the suitability of biological, chemical and physical quality indicators-and their combination in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ)-to monitor soil quality in restored areas of an open cast coal mine. These composite indicators were computed with principal component analyses (PCA) and co-inertia multivariate analyses (CoIA). Our biological indicator showed a significant recovery of soil invertebrate communities along the chronosequence. Taxonomic richness increased from 7 taxa the 1st year to 13-17 taxa in 6-20-y sites, far less than in forests (19-20). Soil pH, bulk density and proportion of physical and macro aggregates were highest in the 1-y site, while soil organic matter (SOM), total N and proportion of biogenic aggregates were highest in older sites. In general, the three sub-indicators and the GISQ yielded the lowest values in the 1-y site (from 0.1 to 0.3 on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0), intermediate in the 16- and 20-y sites, (0.4-0.7) and reached highest values in the two forests (0.4-1.0). The GISQ methodology proved efficient in assessing progress in the reclamation process which should not be achieved only by monitoring vegetation cover changes.

Some of these indices focus on the species diversity in a community by studying frequency and temporal variations in acoustic signals. We explored the possibility of using acoustic indices to estimate the population size of a specific species. More precisely, the objective was to estimate the size of grey wolf packs by testing six acoustic indices: H, Hf, Ht, M, AR, and ACI. The relationship between the averaged values of the indices and the number of howling wolves was studied based on artificial solos and choruses created from howls extracted from wolf choruses recorded in captivity. Then, 16 real choruses were used to test the size predictions based on index values calculated previously and considered as references. Finally, we explored three biases that might influence the acoustic index values and thus the chorus size estimates. All of the acoustic indices were positively correlated with chorus size, although large standard deviations were observed. Moreover, H, Hf, and Ht reached a plateau at 7-8 wolves. The size predictions based on real choruses were overestimated or underestimated. However, ACI was the most accurate with chorus size predictions close to the actual value. M and AR also had good predictive power, especially for choruses made by a relatively small number of howling wolves. The overestimates may be explained by several sources of bias related to the natural composition of real choruses. Indeed, the acoustic indices were influenced by the audio file duration, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and temporal overlap of the wolf howls, but not in the same manner for each index. In particular, H, Ht, and M were significantly influenced by the audio file duration and their values decreased as the duration increased. Excluding AR, all of the indices were affected by adding background noise. The H and Hf values decreased as the SNR decreased, but the opposite trend occurred for ACI. Only Hf and AR were not influenced by the temporal overlap of howls and the values of the four other indices decreased to a greater extent when more wolf howls overlapped. The most promising indices were ACI, AR, and Hf, and they may provide an innovative census tool for estimating wolf pack size. Our results are encouraging although further research is needed to obtain a more effective and accurate tool. Several recommendations and directions for further studies are discussed.

In the same study, age-0 muskellunge were found in 16 coastal marshes surveyed in northern Georgian Bay (NGB), even though these sites had been subjected to the same water-level conditions. We hypothesize that hydrogeomorphic features of NGB sites made them resilient to effects of sustained low lake levels that made the SEGB sites unsuitable for age-0 muskellunge. Compared to their SEGB counterparts, the NGB nursery sites were significantly steeper, deeper, and less sheltered under low water levels. We used these hydrogeomorphic features to develop a multi-scale Resilience Index (RI) for identifying coastal wetlands that are resilient to stable low lake levels. The RI correctly classified the NGB and SEGB nursery sites, with an area-under-the-curve score of 0.973. Coarser-scale variants of the RI provide a regional screening tool in the identification of resilient wetland habitat (e.g. potential muskellunge nursery habitat), and a basin-wide approach to identify vulnerable wetland habitats. This multi-scale index, in conjunction with targeted field surveys, should provide managers a useful tool in the face of uncertain water level forecasts.	[Weller, J.

Birds and plants as indicators of arthropod species richness in temperate farmland	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Biodiversity; Indicator species; Cross-taxa correlations; Monitoring; Host plant specialization; Hunting mode; Lepidoptera; Auchenorrhyncha; Araneae	AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; BIODIVERSITY INDICATORS; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; SURROGATE TAXA; CONSERVATION; BUTTERFLIES; PATTERNS; INSECTS; EUROPE; TRENDS	Agricultural intensification has led to severe declines in biodiversity. Arthropods in particular have suffered from agricultural intensification but are rarely incorporated in large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Instead, a few established indicator taxa such as birds or plants are often used as a cost-and time-efficient assessment of overall biodiversity. However, recent studies provide varying results regarding correlations between these indicators and other taxa. The strong variability in cross-taxa relationships has been attributed to the spatial scale of the analyses, the studied habitat types, and the trophic interactions between taxa. Here, we studied cross-taxa relationships of birds, spiders, butterflies and moths, leaf-and plant-hoppers, and plants across different spatial scales in 21 landscapes. We first compared species richness of birds with the species richness of different arthropod taxa and plants at the landscape scale. In addition, we compared the species richness of plants with the species richness of the different arthropod taxa at the landscape and the plot scale. Therefore, we distinguished between three different habitat types and between trophic interactions of varying degrees of specialization. Positive relationships between the studied taxa were scarce and depended on the spatial scale of the analysis. Spiders were the only taxon that was positively related to the species richness of birds. At the plot scale, the species richness of plants was positively related to all studied arthropod taxa across different habitat types. Relationships between adjacent trophic levels and those with a high degree of specialization were stronger compared to less specialized species, with some exceptions. Given the inconsistency of positive cross-taxa relationships, we suggest that the use of indicator taxa involves a high degree of uncertainty concerning predictions on the species richness of arthropods. We therefore encourage conservationists to incorporate multiple arthropod taxa in large-scale monitoring in order to achieve a more comprehensive and reliable measurement of biodiversity.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Land use change; Soil organic matter; Sustainability; Deforestation; Pampean Region; Chaco Region	CLIMATE; MATTER; ARGENTINA; CHACO; FRAMEWORK; NITROGEN; SEQUESTRATION; BIODIVERSITY; RELEVANCE; AMERICA	The basis and essence of life on earth depends on soil health, and its main indicator is the soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Hence, SOC stock is a key component for the supply of many ecosystem services (SOC-mediated ES), such as erosion protection, nutrient cycling, water regulation, and climate regulation. Land use changes from natural ecosystems into agricultural systems generally deplete SOC stocks. Therefore, agricultural production usually involves trade-off relations with SOC-mediated ES supply. This paper assessed the trade-offs between agricultural production and SOC-mediated ES supply in six sub-regions of Argentina: East Southern Pampa, West Southern Pampa, Flooding Pampa, Central Pampa, Rolling Pampa and Semiarid Chaco. In the Semiarid Chaco, overall SOC-mediated ES supply had the highest sensitivity to SOC changes, and the lowest sensitivity to natural cover removal. In East Southern Pampa, overall SOC-mediated ES supply had the lowest sensitivity to SOC changes and the highest to natural cover removal. The differences in sensitivity of overall SOC-mediated ES supply to the changes in SOC could be explained by soil texture, which is finer at East Southern Pampa. The differences in sensitivity of overall SOC-mediated ES supply to natural cover removal could be associated with the initial SOC stocks, which is lower in the Semiarid Chaco. The high sensitivity of SOC-mediated ES to SOC change and the low levels of SOC-mediated ES supply found in the Semiarid Chaco subregion suggests that it is a highly fragile environment. The agricultural expansion over natural areas led to trade-offs between production and SOC-mediated ES supply. However, increasing crop yields would lead to win-win situations, by positive effects on agricultural production and SOC-mediated ES supply. Hence, agricultural production should be increased by increasing crop yields rather than expanding cropland and/or pasture over natural areas.

Shifting N and P concentrations and stoichiometry during autumn litterfall: Implications for ecosystem monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Nutrient resorption; Litterfall nutrient flux; Uncertainty; N:P ratio; Leaf stoichiometry	NORTHERN HARDWOOD FOREST; NUTRIENT RESORPTION; FOLIAR RESORPTION; NITROGEN BUDGET; SENESCENCE; LEAVES; FALL; EFFICIENCY; PHENOLOGY; EVERGREEN	Leaf litterfall nutrient concentrations and their ratios are a common indicator of site nutrient status and a critical component of many ecosystem calculations. Concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in leaf litter are related to foliar concentrations, but they are reduced by nutrient resorption during senescence. Although nutrient resorption occurs gradually during the autumn in winter-deciduous species, no study to date has assessed how the timing of litter collection affects estimates of nutrient concentration. To quantify the importance of this effect we analyzed the nutrient concentrations of leaf litter collected weekly in two northern hardwood sites at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest for three dominant tree species: Acer saccharum, Betula alleghaniensis, and Fagus grandifolia. Both N and P concentrations declined significantly during the litterfall season in all species (p < 0.001). Because P concentrations declined proportionately more than N concentrations, leaf litter N:P ratios increased throughout the season (p < 0.001), likely reflecting the ordered breakdown of the different cellular constituents containing these nutrients. Our results suggest that sampling senesced leaf tissue at a single point in time leads to biased estimates of nutrient concentrations, stoichiometry, and litterfall and resorption fluxes. This bias is likely greater for P than for N.

Regional climate, primary productivity and fish biomass drive growth variation and population resilience in a small pelagic fish	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Environmental change; Eastern Boundary upwelling system; Trachurus trachurus; Otolith; Sclerochronology; Mixed-effects modelling	MACKEREL TRACHURUS-TRACHURUS; HORSE MACKEREL; MARINE FISH; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; REFERENCE POINTS; REGIME SHIFTS; ATLANTIC; FISHERIES; SIZE; VARIABILITY	Environmental change often combined with selective harvesting has profound and diverse impacts on marine fish populations. Unlocking the biological consequences of these effects on wild fish is notoriously challenging, especially in highly productive but naturally variable systems with uncertain futures such as Eastern Boundary current systems. Here, we developed otolith increment-based growth chronologies covering half a century (53 years) for a small pelagic fish (Atlantic horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus) in the northern limb of the Canary current upwelling system. We used increasingly complex mixed-effects models to partition individually resolved growth variation among intrinsic (Age and Age-at-capture) and extrinsic (biotic and abiotic factors) sources in four complementary data sets: a general population chronology, and three chronologies derived from age groups that reflect ontogenetic habitat shifts. First, we investigated the timing and scale of growth phase shifts and assessed the effects of extrinsic factors on inter-annual growth variation. Second, we quantified among and within cohort growth variability over time. Our results provided strong evidence for inter-annual SST and primary productivity variation impacting on Atlantic horse mackerel growth. We also identified phase shifts in growth that point to larger ecosystem-wide changes (regime shifts), potentially driven by large-scale climatic indices, such as North Atlantic Oscillation and East Atlantic pattern. Cohort-dependent growth effects likely reflect persistent environmental influences and density dependence. Further, we found evidence for carryover effects in growth whereby a poor start in life tended to persist despite compensatory growth being observed in some individuals. We show how population productivity can be impacted by multiple, interacting environmental and biotic factors leading to potential ecosystem regime shifts. Such information is key to understand recruitment dynamics and population persistence, and will have important implications for fisheries management and to those seeking to understand the effects of large-scale climate change on marine productivity.

Global thresholds in properties emerging from cumulative curves of marine ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Ecosystem indicators; Cumulative biomass; Trophic level; Ecosystem approach; Emergent properties; Ecosystem reference points	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; EMERGENT PROPERTIES; INDICATORS; LANDINGS	There are several emergent properties useful as indicators of marine ecosystem status. Some of these are based on the cumulative trophic theory, which posits that biomass and production accumulate in repeatable and predictable patterns across trophic levels. These patterns result in a suite of curve parameters that can delineate when a marine ecosystem is undergoing perturbation or recovery. When looking at this suite of curve parameters, and their trajectories over time, a clear sense of perturbation, recovery, or transition can be delineated. From a set of over 3700 observations we established empirical threshold levels for the curve parameters, i.e., Trophic Level inflection point, Biomass inflection point and Steepness at 3.38 +/- 0.05, 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.50 +/- 0.56, respectively. When the three parameters are examined collectively to determine whether a particular ecosystem datum was below or above each of these three thresholds, clear three-dimensional patterns emerged. First, some volumes in this 3-D space of parameters simply did not have data, and many volumes had very little. The majority of data (approximately 40%) occurred in situations with Steepness and Biomass inflection point higher than thresholds. Almost none of the ecosystems (< 1%) was below all three thresholds at any point in time, a quarter of the data resulted in critical conditions for at least a couple of indicators, a little less than half of the ecosystems (52%) at any point in time seem to be quite functional from this emergent property perspective, and finally, a moderate number of ecosystems, at any point in time (22%), seem to be in some type of transition state. We assert that these emergent properties have value for delineating ecosystem state, and at the very least when the Biomass inflection point is < 33% an ecosystem is understood to have been severely degraded. Using these three thresholds, and identifying whether data trajectories are crossing them or not, has strong potential to better indicate the status of marine ecosystems, trajectories thereof, and hence when management interventions are needed.

Recent and projected impacts of land use and land cover changes on carbon stocks and biodiversity in East Kalimantan, Indonesia	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Land use and land cover change; Modelling; Uncertainty; Scenarios; Impact assessment; Borneo	LOWLAND DIPTEROCARP FOREST; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; PATTERNS; UNCERTAINTY; RESILIENCE; CONVERSION; EXPANSION; EMISSIONS; MODELS; SYSTEM	Large-scale land use and land cover (LULC) changes can have strong impacts on natural ecosystems, such as losses of biodiversity and carbon. Future impacts, under one or multiple future scenarios, can be estimated with the use of LULC projections from land use change models. Our aim is to quantify LULC change impacts on carbon stocks and biodiversity in the West Kutai and Mahakam Ulu districts in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Hereto, we used LULC data from 1990 to 2009 and land use change model projections up to 2030 under four contrasting LULC change scenarios differing along two axes: land development (limited vs. unlimited) and zoning (restricted vs. unrestricted), explicitly considering the uncertainties in the land use change model. For the LULC change impact calculations, three quantitative indicators were evaluated: aboveground biomass (AGB) (for carbon stocks), closed-canopy forest patch size distribution and plant species richness (for biodiversity). Subsequently, we statistically assessed whether the motivation to opt for a specific scenario was conclusive given the uncertainty in the indicator values. We found that under the limited development scenarios the projected AGB decrease towards 2030 was insignificant, plant species richness was projected to decrease significantly by similar to 3%, and closed-canopy forest patches mainly of 100-1000 ha were projected to become fragmented. The effect of zoning was insignificant under these scenarios. The difference between the limited and unlimited development scenarios was significant, with the projected impacts under the unlimited development scenarios being much higher: AGB was projected to decrease 4-30%, plant species richness 10-40%, and the closed-canopy forest was projected to completely loose its typical patch size distribution. The effect of zoning on these scenarios was positive and significant. These results suggest that the most sustainable pathway for East Kalimantan, given our indicators, would be to limit land development, mainly large-scale cash-crop cultivation. If land development cannot be limited, the implementation of restricted development zones is advised. The methodologic novelty of our approach is that we propagate uncertainties from a land use change model to the impact assessment and test the significance of differences between future scenarios, in other words we test if a potential policy instrument has a significant (positive) effect on the studied indicators and may thus be worth implementing.

We studied the impact of sheep and goat grazing on 50 assemblages of ground spiders (Araneae: Gnaphosidae) in phryganic, maquis and forest habitats from zero to 2000 m elevation on Crete, Greece using pitfall traps for one year at each sampling site. In total, 58 gnaphosid species and 16,592 individuals were collected. Cretan endemic Gnaphosidae were negatively affected by intensive grazing and, contrary to findings on other taxa studied on the island, they were sparse and rare throughout the study area. The species composition of gnaphosid assemblages was primarily determined by elevation. Trachyzelotes lyonneti, Urozelotes rusticus, Zelotes scrutatus, Anagraphis pallens and Berinda amabilis proved to be significant indicators of overgrazing. The vast majority of spiders belonging to synanthropic and nationally red-listed species were found in overgrazed sites. Despite theoretical expectations, while the average activity density decreased, the number of species, evenness, rarity, taxonomic, temporal and functional diversity (FRic) indices increased with increasing grazing intensity. This was mainly due to the nature of disturbance itself, which probably allows equibalanced low abundances of indigenous or synanthropic species, rather than overdominance of few, thus partly refuting the opportunistic species hypothesis (OSH). Ground spider assemblages in overgrazed sites comprised sparse populations of mostly rare, opportunistic species with different combinations of life-history traits that partly replace other species more commonly found in the less degraded sites. Species of these assemblages shorten their phenologies to minimize temporal co-occurrence with each other due to resource limitation. These distinct community patterns highlight ground spiders as good indicators of grazing pressure on Crete, on species and assemblage level. To conserve the indigenous and potentially endangered invertebrate fauna, the spatiotemporal discontinuity of grazing including rested patches is important in order to maintain spatial variability and possibly lead to habitat restoration.

The goal of our study was to assess how the increase of urban land cover affects the assemblage and functional groups of dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) that inhabit forest fragments in a tropical city. We sampled dung beetles in nine fragments embedded in the metropolitan region of Joao Pessoa, Brazil. Increasing urbanization negatively affected the abundance of coprophagous species, as well as the species richness, abundance and biomass of roller beetles. Assemblages from the most urbanized forest fragments were significantly different from the other fragments. According to the decomposition of beta diversity, species turnover was the main process shaping the dung beetle assemblages in Joao Pessoa. In this study we provide evidence that specific functional groups of dung beetles are affected by urbanization. Furthermore, as each functional group has different strategies to occupy habitats and use resources, urbanization has contrasting effects for each group. Our results confirm that dung beetles are highly sensitive to urbanization and that protected areas within cities are fundamental to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Composite, multispecies biodiversity indices are increasingly used to report against international and national environmental commitments and targets, the Wild Bird Index being a prominent example in Europe, but methods to assess trends, error and species selection for such indices are poorly developed. 2. In this study, we compare methods to compute multispecies supranational indices and explore different approaches to trend and error estimation, the presentation of indices, and species selection. We do so using population trend data on forest and farmland birds from 28 European countries, 1980-2015. 3. We find relative stability in common European forest bird populations over this period, but a severe decline in farmland bird populations. Altering the benchmark year affects index characteristics and ease of interpretation. We show that using annual species' indices and their SEs to calculate confidence intervals delivers greater precision in index estimates than bootstrapping across species. The inclusion of individual species within indices has limited leverage on index characteristics, but subjective selection of species based on specialisation has the potential to generate bias. 4. Multispecies indices are valuable policy-relevant tools for describing biodiversity health. Their calculation and presentation need to be tailored to meet specific policy objectives, and they must be supported by clear interpretative information. We recommend methods for indicator analysis, forms of presentation, and the adoption of an objective species selection protocol to ensure indicators are representative and sensitive to environmental change.

However, the roles of spatial processes are often given insufficient attention in bioassessment practices, which may bias the assessments of ecological status based on biotic metrics. Here, we quantified the relative importance and the seasonal stability of spatial processes, natural conditions and human-induced factors in structuring variation in different bioassessment metrics based on macroinvertebrate communities. Our study systems were two extensively sampled large and shallow lakes with strong nutrient gradients related to human disturbance. The roles of different drivers were examined for three kinds of indicators: general diversity, trait-based and taxonomic distinctness metrics, and their performance in characterizing human disturbance was evaluated. Overall, human-induced and spatial factors were all important in explaining variation in the three types of bioassessment metrics. Contrary to our expectations, however, we found that the importance of spatial processes on bioassessment metrics can be comparable to the effects of local environmental conditions at the within-lake scale. Furthermore, the results showed substantial seasonal variability in the relative roles of different drivers, which might be linked to life-cycle seasonality of macroinvertebrates. As expected, trait-based metrics generally were best associated with human-induced variables in both lakes, whereas general diversity and taxonomic distinctness metrics performed poorly. The low effectiveness of taxonomic distinctness metrics might due to low species richness associated with high nutrient levels. To conclude, our results suggest that bioassessment cannot exclusively rely on the idea of environmental filtering even if we focus on fine spatial scales. We hence strongly urge that spatial processes, natural drivers and temporal variability should be better considered in combination in the development and application of bioassessment approaches. In addition, taxonomic distinctness measures should be used with caution, especially for the ecosystems and organism groups typically characterized by low species richness.

Monitoring the impacts of disturbance and the success of conservation projects is crucial, and to do this effectively it is important to identify suitable measures that are sensitive to ecosystem disturbance. Orchid bees (Euglossini) are a specialist group with mutualistic relationships with many plant species and can fly long distances, making them important pollinators of widely dispersed plant species. A loss of specialist pollinators such as these could have severe consequences for the plants that rely on their services. We therefore aimed to answer the following question: are orchid bees useful indicators of the impacts of human disturbance? If so, what measures of orchid bee diversity are most sensitive? And do orchid bees provide any indication of changes in pollination services along a disturbance gradient? Orchid bees were collected from 18 sites across a gradient of disturbance in a tropical forest region in southeast Peru. Alpha diversity across the gradient was compared using Hills numbers. Beta diversity was assessed using community composition, species contributions to beta diversity, beta diversity partitioning and novel measures of redundancy and representativeness. The potential pollination services available at each site were measured using artificial flowers and counts of pollinator visits. Alpha diversity of orchid bees showed low sensitivity to disturbance. Beta diversity measures were more informative, with disturbed sites found to be highly redundant in the ecosystem compared to the less disturbed sites. However, the most sensitive measure across the gradient was abundance - there was a significant decrease in the number of bees caught as disturbance increased, with likely consequences for pollination services. These results suggest that orchid bees may be useful indicators of the impacts of human disturbance, but alpha diversity is a poor metric for this purpose. In order to understand how human disturbance is affecting biodiversity, multiple diversity indices should be considered, and in the case of orchid bees, redundancy and abundance could be useful for detecting sensitive responses to forest disturbance.

In the Cerrado biodiversity hotspot of central Brazil, Eucalyptus plantations increasingly claim large tracts of native habitats thanks to favorable soils, climate and booming pulp firm profits. Yet, the highs and lows of the economy including government incentives over the years riddled the landscape with abandoned plantations, which are not subject to active restoration. Despite the well-documented pattern anthropogenic disturbances negatively affect Cerrado biodiversity, little is known about the processes driving species co-existence within these abandoned plantations. Herein, we use phylogenetic community structure indices to test if potential processes assembling lizard communities differ between undisturbed Cerrado habitats and disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus plantations; and if so, are these processes predictable. In addition, we explore the applicability of phylogenetic community structure indices as ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado biodiversity hotspot. We address these questions at a local scale, recording lizard species richness and abundance along transects of undisturbed Cerrado and adjacent disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus plantations. Morphological measurements were collected from captured lizards to test for trait conservatism. We investigated if phylogenetic community structure is altered in a predictable manner by comparing (i) phylogenetic species variability, (ii) phylogenetic species richness and (iii) phylogenetic species evenness. To test for significant differences between undisturbed and disturbed communities, we performed two-tailed paired t-tests for each phylogenetic community index. We also test for phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion to determine if potential processes assembling lizard communities differ between undisturbed and disturbed communities. Furthermore, we compare phylogenetic community structure indices to other commonly used diversity indices (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity) to evaluate their applicability as ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado. We demonstrated phylogenetic clustering in two out of three of the undisturbed Cerrado lizard communities supporting habitat filtering as the potential dominant assembly process; whereas 67% of the disturbed Eucalyptus communities showed phylogenetic overdispersion supporting competition as the potential predominate assembly process. This indicates anthropogenic disturbance, in the form of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations, may alter phylogenetic community structure in a predictable manner, leading to the loss of closely related species in the disturbed plantation forests. The highly endemic biota of the Cerrado is composed of closely related species that share similar traits for survival, most likely a consequence of frequent episodic fires during the dry season. Interestingly, phylogenetic community structure indices and diversity indices did not converge on the same disturbed site to prioritize for active restoration; thereby, providing a cautionary tale on the applicability of the indices as ecological indicators for the Cerrado biodiversity.

Immunomodulatory microbial diversity and 'Old Friends' are thought to be supplemented from biodiverse natural environments, yet deficient in anthropogenically disturbed or degraded environments. However, few studies have compared the microbiomes of natural vs. human-altered environments and there is little knowledge of which microbial taxa are representative of ecological restoration-i.e. the assisted recovery of degraded ecosystems typically towards a more natural, biodiverse state. Here we use novel bootstrap-style resampling of site-level soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene environmental DNA data to identify genus-level indicators of restoration from a 10-year grassy eucalypt woodland restoration chronosequence at Mt Bold, South Australia. We found two key indicator groups emerged: 'opportunistic taxa' that decreased in relative abundance with restoration and more stable and specialist, 'niche-adapted taxa' that increased. We validated these results, finding seven of the top ten opportunists and eight of the top ten niche-adapted taxa displayed consistent differential abundance patterns between human-altered vs. natural samples elsewhere across Australia. Extending this, we propose a two-dimensional mapping for ecosystem condition based on the proportions of these divergent indicator groups. We also show that restoring a more biodiverse ecosystem at Mt Bold has increased the potentially immune-boosting environmental microbial diversity. Furthermore, environmental opportunists including the pathogen-containing genera Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Legionella and Pseudomonas associated with disturbed ecosystems. Our approach is generalizable with potential to inform DNA-based methods for ecosystem assessment and help target environmental interventions that may promote microbiota-mediated human health gains.

Estimating exposure to atmospheric metals across large spatial areas remains challenging. Metal concentrations in mosses could constitute a useful proxy. Here, we linked moss biomonitoring and epidemiological data to investigate the associations between long-term exposure to metals and mortality. Methods: We modelled and mapped 13 atmospheric metals from a 20-year national moss biomonitoring program to derive exposure estimates across France. In the population-based Gazel cohort, we included 11,382 participants from low to intermediate population density areas and assigned modelled metals to their residential addresses. We distinguished between airborne metals that are primarily of natural origin and those primarily of anthropogenic origin. Associations were estimated between exposure to metals and mortality (natural-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory), using Cox models, with confounder adjustment at individual level. Findings: Between 1996 and 2017, there were 1313 deaths in the cohort (including 181 cardiovascular and 33 respiratory). Exposure to the anthropogenic metals was associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality (hazard ratio of 1.16 [1.08-1.24] per interquartile range of exposure), while metals from natural sources were not. Interpretation: Some atmospheric anthropogenic metals may be associated with excess mortality - even in areas with relatively low levels of exposure to air pollution. Consistent with the previous literature, our findings support the use of moss biomonitoring as a tool to assess health effects of air pollution exposure at individual level.

Although growing evidence suggests respiratory exacerbations from elevated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during wildfires, significantly less is known about the impacts on human health of ozone (O-3) that may also be increased due to wildfires. Using machine learning, we created daily surface concentration maps for PM2.5 and O-3 during an intense wildfire in California in 2008. We then linked these daily exposures to counts of respiratory hospitalizations and emergency department visits at the ZIP code level. We calculated relative risks of respiratory health outcomes using Poisson generalized estimating equations models for each exposure in separate and mutually-adjusted models, additionally adjusted for pertinent covariates. During the active fire periods, PM2.5 was significantly associated with exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and these effects remained after controlling for O-3. Effect estimates of O-3 during the fire period were non-significant for respiratory hospitalizations but were significant for ED visits for asthma (RR = 1.05 and 95% CI = (1.022, 1.078) for a 10 ppb increase in O-3). In mutually-adjusted models, the significant findings for PM2.5 remained whereas the associations with O-3 were confounded. Adjusted for O-3, the RR for asthma ED visits associated with a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was 1.112 and 95% CI = (1.087, 1.138). The significant findings for PM2.5 but not for O-3 in mutually-adjusted models is likely due to the fact that PM2.5 levels during these fires exceeded the 24-hour National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 35 mu g/m(3) for 4976 ZIP-code days and reached levels up to 6.073 times the NAAQS, whereas our estimated O-3 levels during the fire period only occasionally exceeded the NAAQS of 70 ppb with low exceedance levels. Future studies should continue to investigate the combined role of O-3 and PM2.5 during wildfires to get a more comprehensive assessment of the cumulative burden on health from wildfire smoke.

The effects of long-term PM2.5 exposure have been evaluated by risk assessment studies, which are based on an exposure-response function (ERF) derived from a specific epidemiological study or multiple studies. To explore whether generalization from the pre-established ERFs (including the integrated exposure-response [IER] model and the global exposure mortality model [GEMM]) introduces biases into risk assessment of a specific local population, we conducted the first census-based epidemiological study of PM2.5, aimed at the entire population of mainland China. Using a difference-in-difference analysis at the county level, we associated mortality changes from 2000 to 2010 to corresponding PM2.5 changes, with adjustments made for multiple socioeconomic factors. Based on the epidemiological linkage between PM2.5 and total mortality, we calculated the change in PM 25 -attributed deaths and compared this value with the results derived from the pre-established models (IER and GEMM). According to the epidemiological model, a 10-mu g/m(3) increment in PM2.5 was associated with a 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9%-6.7%) increment in total mortality, and the change in PM 25 -attributed deaths from 2000 to 2010 was estimated as 561,000 (95% CI: 539,000-581,000). The census-based estimation was in better agreement with the GEMM results (545,000-612,000) than was the IER result (354,000 [95% CI: 286,000-421,000]). In sensitivity analyses of the epidemiological model, the association between PM2.5 exposure and mortality was stronger among younger adults, consistent with the pre-established models. Due to the potential limitations of our findings, we cannot conclusively state that GEMM is more reliable than IER in China. Future studies are warranted to confirm or refute our findings.

Non-comprehensive models are problematic since missed interactions might introduce bias. We implement a robust modelling approach by (1) using a large data set with 1.4 million solar installations and (2) three different machine learning algorithms (deep neural networks, gradient boosting, random forests). Generalized linear models serve as baseline and comparison. A high prediction accuracy can be achieved on the county level with deep neural networks (adjusted R-2 = 0.86) and gradient boosting (adjusted R-2 = 0.87). The most important drivers are population per county, followed by type of urbanisation and social variables like unemployment, with varying degree of importance for the different machine-learning algorithms. Our approach points out both differences and agreements across methods and therefore a higher confidence in their interpretation.

In this study, data from 60 selected long-term field trials conducted in arable systems in France were used to evaluate a revised version of AMG model integrating a new mineralization submodel. The drivers of SOC evolution identified using Random Forest analysis were consistent with those considered in AMG. The model with its default parameterization simulated accurately the changes in SOC stocks over time, the relative model error (RRMSE = 5.3%) being comparable to the measurement error (CV = 4.3%). Model performance was little affected by the choice of plant C input estimation method, but was improved by a site specific optimization of SOC pool partitioning. AMG shows a good potential for predicting SOC evolution in scenarios varying in climate, soil properties and crop management.

The search for optimal land use allocations has to result in feasible solutions satisfying "real-world" constraints. We here introduce a generic and readily applicable tool to integrate user-specific spatial models (e.g. assessing different ecosystem services) for a Constrained Multi-objective Optimization of Land use Allocation (CoMOLA). The tool can handle basic land use conversion constraints by either a newly and specifically developed method to repair infeasible solutions or by penalizing constraint violation. CoMOLA was systematically tested for different levels of complexity using a virtual landscape and simple ecosystem service and biodiversity models. Our study shows that using repair mechanisms seems to be more effective in exploring the feasible solution space while penalizing constraint violation likely results in infeasible solutions.

Factors controlling the variability of Cs-137 concentrations in 5 coastal rivers around Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY			English	Article							RADIOCESIUM WASH-OFF; SEDIMENT CONNECTIVITY; HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY; CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT; STREAM WATER; NIIDA RIVER; ACCIDENT; CESIUM; SOIL; CATCHMENTS	The Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident led to the contamination by radiocesium (Cs-137) of large drained areas, Cesium-137 concentrations in rivers result from complex transfer processes, depending on multiple forcings. Better knowledge of the factors controlling these concentrations is therefore a prerequisite to improve predictions of Cs-137 transfers within river catchments. This study aimed at analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of Cs-137 concentrations in rivers and identifying the key factors controlling their variability. Published values of Cs-137 concentrations in rivers in the north of FDNPP were collected, characterizing 122 sampling sites from May 2011 to October 2014. It resulted in three datasets: dissolved concentrations C-W (Bq/L), concentrations in suspended sediment C-SS (Bq/kg) and total concentrations C-T (Bq/L). The resulting database reflected a large variety of catchments and hydrological conditions. Observed Cs-137 concentrations varied by 2-4 orders of magnitude and were poorly explained (R-2 = 0.13-0.38) by the average contamination density. Indices summarizing the complex spatial and temporal properties of the catchments were proposed as candidate explanatory variables of concentrations in rivers. They were selected by stepwise regression for each dataset (C-W, C-SS, C-T). For the three datasets, the selection and combination of 5-10 indices significantly better explained this variability (R-2 = 0.69-0.83). Deposit indices were identified as first drivers of concentrations in rivers. A deposit index was selected for each dataset, indicating no effect of the contamination distribution for C-W, whereas C-T and C-SS required considering the distribution of contamination and connectivity, as well as the presence of dams for C-SS. The others selected variables significantly contributed to explain the concentration variability. This meta-analysis emphasizes the importance of structural (e.g. slope, land-cover) and functional (e.g. delay, season, rainfall) properties in the dissimilarities of catchments responses, stressing that assessments could be improved by including more these properties in models.

A basin-wide field survey of surface water CO2 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was combined with laboratory incubations to examine how dams and urban tributaries delivering treated wastewater influence longitudinal patterns in DOM properties and CO2 along the impounded Han River traversing Seoul metropolitan area. Fluorescent DOM indices including parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) components were used to characterize DOM in relation to biodegradable DOC (BDOC). Compared with distinct downstream increases in DOC and CO2, BDOC concentration and its proportion in DOC (%BDOC) were highly variable along the mainstem and peaked at urban tributaries. Longitudinal increases in fluorescence index (n), biological index (BIX), and two PARAFAC components (C2 and C3) contrasted with general decreases in humification index (HIX) and C1, reflecting increasing downstream inputs of anthropogenic DOM. During a 5-day incubation employing continuous CO2 measurements, the cumulative production of CO2 in the mainstem water mixed with urban tributary water was significantly higher than the level expected for conservative mixing of the two samples, indicating a synergistic enhancement of DOM biodegradation. Molecular formulas identified by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) revealed more consumed molecules in the mainstem water and more newly produced molecules in the tributary water over the 5-day incubation, implying abundant labile components in the mainstem water discharged from the upstream dam and highly processed tributary DOM limited in immediately biodegradable organic materials. Downstream increases in CO(2 )and DOC along the Han River, combined with the synergistic effect observed in the mixed water, suggest that mixing wastewater-DOM with labile autochthonous DOM can enhance CO(2 )production in the river system perturbed by impoundment and wastewater.

Here, we studied a model collembolan (Folsomia candida) and found that diet (bacteria, plant litters, yeast, mixed food) is a critical factor in regulating the microbial diversity and community composition of this important soil organism. Collembolans fed with litter exhibited the lowest bacterial diversity and were dominated by Ochrobactrum. Conversely. collembolans fed with mixed diets resulted in the highest bacterial diversity. Our findings further suggest that microbial communities associated with different diets are linked to different levels of collembolan fitness. For example, the relative abundance of the genera of unclassified Thermogemmatisporaceae, Brevibacillus, and Novosphingobium were positively correlated with growth of the collembolans. Together, our work provides evidence that diet is a major force controlling the gut microbiome of collembolans, and is a good environmental predictor for collembolan growth, with implications for ecosystem functioning in terrestrial environments.

Yet the mechanisms of how afforestation could simultaneously alter both the soil fungal and bacterial communities and its implications for ecosystem management are poorly understood, especially in nitrogen-limited ecosystems. Using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS rRNA genes, the present study investigated the changes in soil properties and soil microorganisms after afforestation of natural grasslands with Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) on the Loess Plateau in China. Results showed that soil bacterial diversity had no significant differences among the grassland (GL), forest-grassland transition zone (TZ), and forestland (FL), while soil fungal diversity in the GL was significantly higher than that in the FL and TZ (P< 0.05). The proportion of shared OTUs in the soil bacterial community was higher than that in the soil fungal community among the three land use types. The dominant bacterial phylum shifted from Proteobacteria to Actinobacteria, while the dominant fungal phylum shifted from Ascomycota to Basidiomycota after the GL conversion to the FL. The functional groups of ECM fungi increased significantly while biotrophic fungi decreased significantly after grassland afforestation. Both the soil bacterial and fungal communities in the TZ showed great similarity with those in the FL In addition, among all examined soil properties, soil nitrogen (N) showed a more significant effect on the soil microbial communities. The reduction of soil N after grassland afforestation resulted in both the structure and function changes in soil microbial communities. Our results demonstrated simultaneously differential changes in the composition and diversity of both soil bacterial and fungal communities after afforestation from grasslands to planted forests.

Effectiveness of straw bale check dams at reducing post-fire sediment yields from steep ephemeral channels	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Straw bale; Check darn; Trap efficiency; Erosion; Silt fence; Rainfall intensity	FOREST-FIRES; EROSION; RUNOFF; CATCHMENT; WILDFIRE	Post-fire flooding and elevated sediment loads in channels can pose hazards to people and structures within the wildland-urban interface. Mitigation of these hazards is essential to protect downstream resources. Straw bale check dams are one treatment designed to reduce sediment yields in small ephemeral catchments (<2 ha). This study investigated their effectiveness in five paired catchments burned at high severity during the 2010 Twitchell Canyon Fire in Utah. Rainfall, ground cover and hillslope erosion rates were also measured during the two-year study. Adjacent paired catchments were physically similar and ranged in size from 0.2 to 1.6 ha across pairs. Within pairs, one catchment was an untreated control and the other treated at a rate of four straw bale check dams ha(-1). High intensity rainfall, erodible soils and slow regrowth contributed to the observed high hillslope sediment yields (> 60 Mg ha(-1)). 1- and 2-yr I-30 return period rain events early in the study quickly filled the straw bale check dams indicating the treatment did not statistically reduce annual sediment yields. First year annual sediment yields across all catchments were 19.6 to 25.7 Mg ha(-1). Once the check dams were full, they had limited storage capacity during the second post-fire year, allowing 3.8 to 13.1 Mg ha(-1) of sediment to pass over the check dams. The mean mass of sediment trapped by individual straw bale check dams was 13 Mg, which allowed them to trap a mean of 5.9 Mg ha(-1) of sediment at the given treatment rate. Straw bale check dams trapped <50% of the total mass delivered from catchments with efficiency decreasing over time. Increasing straw bale check dam treatment rate in stable channels may improve trap efficiency. Application of this treatment in areas with lower expected rainfall intensities and less erodible soils may be justifiable. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Machine-learned modeling of PM2.5 exposures in rural Lao PDR	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Air quality; Cookstoves; Prediction; Environmental health; Biostatistics'	INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; PARTICULATE MATTER; PERSONAL EXPOSURES; CARBON-MONOXIDE; GLOBAL BURDEN; HOUSEHOLD; COMBUSTION; CHILDREN; WOMEN	This study presents a machine-learning-enhanced method of modeling PM2.5 personal exposures in a data-scarce, rural, solid fuel use context. Data collected during a cookstove (Africa Clean Energy (ACE)-1 solar-battery-powered stove) intervention program in rural Lao PDR are presented and leveraged to explore advanced techniques for predicting personal exposures to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). Mean 48-h PM2.5 exposure concentrations for female cooks were measured for the pre- and post-intervention periods (the "Before" and "After" periods, respectively) as 123 mu g/m(3) and 81 mu g/m(3). Mean 48-h PM(2.5 )kitchen air pollution ("KAP") concentrations were measured at 462 mu g/m(3) Before and 124 mu g/m(3) After. Application of machine learning and ensemble modeling demonstrated cross-validated personal exposure predictions that were modest at the individual level but reasonably strong at the group level, with the best models producing an observed vs. predicted r(2) between 0.26 and 0.31 (r(2) = 0.49 when using a smaller, un-imputed dataset) and mean Before estimates of 119-120 pg/m(3) and After estimates of 86-88 mu g/m(3). This offered improvement over one typical method of predicting exposure - using a kitchen exposure factor (the ratio of exposure to KAP)-which demonstrated an r(2) similar to 0.03 and poorly estimated group average values. The results of these analyses highlight areas of methodological improvement for future exposure assessments of household air pollution and provide evidence for researchers to explore the advantages of further incorporating machine learning methods into similar research across wider geographic and cultural contexts.

For decades, the functionality of riparian zones has been altered, with detrimental consequences on biodiversity. Recently, riparian zone restoration has become a major issue. When channel mobility cannot be restored and when erosion control is of primary concern, soil bioengineering techniques are often viewed as a compromise solution. We studied 37 riverbanks, from civil engineering to soil bioengineering, plus natural willow stands, in the foothills of the Alps and Jura Mountains. Using a principal component analysis, we first studied whether terrestrial and aquatic habitat variables varied among riverbank stabilization structures and bank stabilization age and built a synthetic index of riparian habitat quality reflecting the multivariate similarity of riverbank sites. Then, using a modelling approach, we tested whether multi-taxonomic diversity responded to changes in habitat quality and to broadscale environmental variables (i.e., climate, hydrology and land cover). Soil bioengineering techniques, especially willow fascines and to lower extend vegetated crib wall, enhanced riparian habitat quality by allowing for a greater richness and density of pioneer tree species but also for a larger cover of high quality aquatic micro-habitats. This increase in riparian habitat quality induced an increase in both terrestrial and aquatic species diversity, highlighting the added-value of soil bioengineering techniques to restore riparian biodiversity. This may confirm that stabilization structures made of willow fascines are better suited than stabilization structures made of artificial substrata to support riparian species. Also, beyond the positive effect of soil bioengineering techniques for riparian biodiversity, we found that climatic, hydrological and land cover variables strongly influenced diversity patterns. Thus, multi-taxonomic diversity decreased along larger rivers and in landscapes dominated by urban areas. This may indicate that the full added value of soil bioengineering techniques for biodiversity will only become apparent if more attention is paid to mitigating the negative impact of human activities in the vicinity of riparian zones and if larger scale environmental parameters are taken into account as early as possible in restoration project. Therefore, we strongly recommend that riverbank restoration projects, based on the active introduction of native pioneer tree species, should be planned at the catchment scale.

Despite widely accepted benefits of fuel management and ecological outcomes, mined land managers are generally reluctant to incorporate fire regimes on rehabilitated lands. We applied an experimental fire to 117 ha of 19- to 21-year-old coal mine rehabilitation in subtropical, semi-arid Central Queensland, Australia, and assessed the vegetation changes in five successive assessments for the two years following the burn. Vegetation metrics all showed trajectories towards pre-fire levels, or recovered to surpass pre-fire levels. Within two years of the burn, native species richness was significantly higher than pre-fire levels for both grassland and open woodland areas and vegetation cover had returned to pre-fire levels. Woody plant density ( < 2 m) increased from an average of 425-3,255 stems ha(-1) in open woodland areas reaching values higher than those recorded at unburnt historical transects (n = 145); while stems greater than 2 m in height declined from 585 to 220 ha(-1) due to the death of mature Acacia spp. The vegetative response following two wet seasons demonstrates short-term recovery following a range of fire impacts and demonstrates the potential to enhance the quality of the rehabilitation and increase the possibility of early relinquishment by reducing ecological, financial and reputational risks.

For this purpose, laboratory and field assays using bioacaricide concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 mg L-1 of oxymatrine were performed during the years from 2015 to 2016. Laboratory results showed that the oxymatrine-based commercial formulation does not cause deleterious effects on B. yothersi eggs; however, it causes high larval mortality. For adult females, the bioacaricide caused high acute toxicity and residual effect for at least 5 days after application. In the field, the bioacaricide exhibited high acaricidal activity against B. yothersi, with efficacy levels similar to that of synthetic acaricide spirodiclofen (48 mg L-1) until 49 days after the application. The application of the bioacaricide did not negatively affect the population levels of phytoseiid predatory mites. Therefore, our results suggest that the oxymatrine-based commercial formulation is an important tool for management of the citrus leprosis mite in citrus groves.

We collected published and unpublished data spanning the last similar to 130 years and performed the first comprehensive assessment of alien aquatic vascular plants in Slovakia with the following aims: (i) to prepare a national inventory, (ii) to assess the effects of climate and landscape on species diversity and (iii) to evaluate the habitat preferences of the species. The historical overview showed a strongly increasing trend in the number of alien species related to an increased amount of intensive research of aquatic vegetation over the last 30 years. Altogether, 20 neophyte alien aquatic plant taxa were recorded from 479 sampling sites. However, the species inventory seems to be far from complete and approximately 14 species are expected to remain undetected. Elodea canadensis and E. nuttallii are the most frequently occurring alien aquatic plants, while eight other species have been found at a single site only. The majority of alien plants were deliberately introduced as aquarium ornamentals or released through pond waste. The fragmented information on local habitat conditions did not allow us to draw firm conclusions about the habitat preferences of alien aquatic plants. However, artificial water bodies are more frequently colonised by alien species than natural habitats (95% of aliens were found in artificial water bodies and 60% of them were recorded exclusively in these habitats) and many species have broad environmental tolerances (ability to colonise both standing and running waters, tolerances to a wide range of temperatures and water chemistry). Our results reaffirm the major role of increased temperatures and landscape modification in the distribution of alien aquatic plants and we can expect enhanced invasiveness and spreading of alien species into new habitats driven by climate change and land use intensification. Filling a main gap in the recognition of alien aquatic plant environmental preferences is a challenge for future research with the ultimate goal of maintaining natural aquatic plant diversity and ecosystem functioning.

The potential evolutionary impact of invasive balloon vines on native soapberry bugs in South Africa	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						Balloon vine; Cardiospermum; invasive species; Kruger National Park; Leptocoris; rapid evolution; soapberry bug	HOST RACE RADIATION; JADERA-HAEMATOLOMA; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; CARDIOSPERMUM; SAPINDACEAE; HEMIPTERA; ECOLOGY; HISTORY; ADAPTATION; PLASTICITY	Following their establishment in new communities, invasive species may cause evolutionary changes in resident native species. This is clearly true for phytophagous insects, which may adapt rapidly when utilising abundant and widespread introduced hosts. The balloon vines Cardiospermum halicacabum and C. grandiflorum were introduced to South Africa approximately 100 years ago and are classified as minor and major weeds, respectively. Here we assess the potential evolutionary impact of these vines on native Leptocoris soapberry bug populations in Kruger National Park (KNP), using phylogenetic and morphometric analyses. We found that soapberry bugs associated with C. halicacabum are genetically and morphologically distinct from those associated with C. grandiflorum. This suggests that native soapberry bugs in KNP exhibit some degree of host preference, indicating that these vines may have had significant evolutionary consequences for these insects. The proboscis length of soapberry bugs feeding on C. halicacabum closely matched fruit size, often being longer than fruit size at the population level. These soapberry bugs are therefore well-suited to feeding on this introduced plant species.

Even obligate symbioses show signs of ecological contingency: Impacts of symbiosis for an invasive stinkbug are mediated by host plant context	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						invasive species; kudzu bug; mutualism; plataspid; symbiont	CRIBRARIA HEMIPTERA PLATASPIDAE; MEGACOPTA-CRIBRARIA; HETEROPTERA PLATASPIDAE; CONDITIONAL OUTCOMES; FUNGAL SYMBIOSIS; EVOLUTION; RANGE; PINE; BACTERIUM; BIOLOGY	Many species interactions are dependent on environmental context, yet the benefits of obligate, mutualistic microbial symbioses to their hosts are typically assumed to be universal across environments. We directly tested this assumption, focusing on the symbiosis between the sap-feeding insect Megacopta cribraria and its primary bacterial symbiont Candidatus Ishikawaella capsulata. We assessed host development time, survival, and body size in the presence and absence of the symbiont on two alternative host plants and in the insects' new invasive range. We found that association with the symbiont was critical for host survival to adulthood when reared on either host plant, with few individuals surviving in the absence of symbiosis. Developmental differences between hosts with and without microbial symbionts, however, were mediated by the host plants on which the insects were reared. Our results support the hypothesis that benefits associated with this host-microbe interaction are environmentally contingent, though given that few individuals survive to adulthood without their symbionts, this may have minimal impact on ecological dynamics and current evolutionary trajectories of these partners.

We performed transcriptomic surveys of two wingless insect species, the silverfish Lepisma saccharina and Tricholepidion gertschi, and identified multiple Or gene family members in both species. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that the silverfish Ors do not fall into the clade comprised of more derived flying insect ligand-binding Ors, but, along with bristletail, firebrat and some mayfly Ors, are consistently resolved as a distinct set of genes that may constitute an evolutionary intermediate between gustatory receptors and the more derived Ors of flying insects. We propose to consider these "primitive Ors" separately from higher insect Ors until their cellular expression patterns and function are resolved and suggest a multistep evolutionary scenario ultimately leading to the highly sensitive, rapidly evolving and physiologically diverse Or gene family observed in higher insects.

Along Mediterranean shallow rocky reefs, brown macroalgae belonging to the Cystoseira genus (e.g. Cystoseira amentacea and Cystoseira compressa) are ecosystem engineers, locally creating a continuous fringe in the midlittoral zone, supporting high biodiversity and productivity and providing ecosystem services. A growing interest in the quantification of ecosystem relevance through their economic value aims at raising public awareness and supporting policy-makers in the process of creating new legal instruments supporting the preservation of biodiversity. In this framework, a methodology for ecological and monetary evaluation of natural capital, based on biophysical accounting and on emergy theory, is applied to the habitats of the upper midlittoral zone located above continuous and non-continuous Cystoseira fringe. The proposed approach is a quantitative measure able to analyse the overall functioning of the system and its efficiency in exploiting available resources. The mean economic value of the habitats in the midlittoral zone assessed through the present study is 1.28 emE/m(2). Higher values, but associated with a larger variability, were observed in presence of continuous C. compressa fringe. Conversely, in the presence of a continuous C. amentacea fringe, a noticeable habitat-forming species, lower natural capital values were recorded possibly due to the attractive potential of this species in its understorey rather than in the above habitats, concurrently with a lower variability of the natural capital values (lower scatter), suggesting a deterministic homogeneity effect on the above midlittoral habitats. From this study, emergy analysis is confirmed to represent an effective and operative tool to provide a synthetic monetary assessment of natural capital making complex information easily accessible to different stakeholders, from general public to territorial managers.

Selecting ecological models using multi-objective optimization	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Competing models; Decision theory; Model selection; Multiple objectives; Pareto frontier; Optimal solution	CRITERIA; CHOICE; GUIDE	Choices in ecological research and natural resource management require balancing multiple, often competing objectives. Examples include maximizing species persistence in a wildlife conservation context, while minimizing cost, or balancing opposing stakeholder objectives when managing wildlife populations. Multiple-objective optimization (MOO) provides a unifying framework for solving multiple objective problems. Model selection is a critical component of ecological inference and prediction and requires balancing the competing objectives of model fit and model complexity. The tradeoff between model fit and model complexity provides a basis for describing the model-selection problem within the MOO framework. We discuss MOO and two strategies for solving the MOO problem; modeling preferences pre-optimization and post-optimization. Most conventional model selection methods can be formulated as solutions of MOO problems via specification of pre-optimization preferences. We reconcile model selection within the MOO framework. We also consider model selection using post-optimization specification of preferences. That is, by first identifying Pareto optimal solutions, and then selecting among them. We demonstrate concepts with an ecological application of model selection using avian species richness data in the continental United States.

However, a comprehensive MSE framework advising management is still absent for the severely depleted Gulf of Maine (GoM) cod (Gadus morhua). In the present study, we developed a conceptual MSE framework and conditioned on this stock utilizing stock-specific parameterization. We highlighted the simulation of a few key processes with semi-independent sub-models and accounted for uncertainties from multiple sources. The simulated population dynamics was calibrated and validated against the historical trend in hindcasting. Forecasting simulations were also conducted and validated to examine the effectiveness in the context of uncertainty. Hindcasting results suggested that the calibrated MSE framework could capture the stock dynamics assuming different recruitment dynamics indicated by residuals lower than 5%. Forecasting stochastic runs demonstrated a minor disparity between management effects of fishing-mortality-based and catch-based HCRs when the segregated stock recruitment relationship was adopted with a difference in simulated spawning stock biomass lower than 10%. Additionally, the results were comparable to assessment and projections made in the stock assessment, indicating the robustness of the framework. The framework can potentially help disentangle complex issues related to the mixed fishery, decision-making, and performance evaluation of a monitoring system.

Improved knowledge about the homogeneity and amplitude of the phenological response of phytoplankton to climate change is essential for an assessment of ecological consequences on the marine ecosystem. We analyzed phenological variability of 21 phytoplankton species monitored work-daily at Helgoland Roads from 1962-2015. We used a function of "Weibull"-type to estimate phenological dates of species-specific abundance peaks. The combination of derived dates and peak abundances formed the basis for the analyses of long-term changes in phenological time slots and associated environmental conditions. Species-specific preferences in combination with seasonally varying environmental trends resulted in a complex pattern of phenological long-term response. Phenological trends showed both constant occurrence and shifts to an earlier or later occurrence. Co-occurring phytoplankton species were shown to exhibit different phenological trends even within identical time slots. Differences in species-specific trends in timing also reflected the seasonally varying shifts in water temperature ranges due to warming. In spring and summer, the main patterns of common variability in timing were associated with different abiotic and biotic drivers. The majority of species showed more narrow time slots related to the occurrence of higher peaks. Considering the variation of species occurrence in their "typical" time window provided insight in terms of assigning the effect of environmental drivers on inter-annual phenological variation. Phytoplankton species with similar long-term trends in timing (days) showed different trends in biomass, i.e. the phenological changes resulted from different ecological responses to environmental change. The local character of environmental trends at Helgoland underpins the limits for comparison of findings between different measuring sites or wider areas, such as the North Sea. The study emphasizes the benefit and necessity of a highly resolved phytoplankton record for a true understanding of long-term ecological changes in a highly dynamic marine environment such as the North Sea.

The direction of the effect of these hormones on above-mentioned traits, and the potential feedback between hormones are in general unclear; in addition, knowledge on how age and sex can affect T and Cort concentrations is still inconsistent. Our study used a novel method to analyze testosterone and corticosterone in feathers (T-f, Cort(f)) based on the precolumn chemical derivatization of hormones before liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Unlike previously used methods (RIA, EIA), our analytical procedure allows simultaneous analysis of both hormones from small amounts of feathers (4-25 mg) and, thus, overcomes the problem of insufficient detection limits. We applied this method to reveal associations between T-f and Cort(f) hormone concentrations and feather growth, age, and sex in feathers grown during the postbreeding (flanks) and prebreeding (tails) periods in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica). There was neither a correlation between prebreeding and postbreeding T-f, nor between prebreeding and postbreeding Cort(f). Tail Cort(f) concentrations were negatively associated with tail feather growth rates. Feather hormone concentrations were correlated in the prebreeding period, negatively in males but positively in females. Both Cort(f) and T-f were higher in young birds compared to older ones, indicating either an age-related decrease in hormone concentrations within individuals, or the selective disappearance of individuals with high steroid concentrations. Males and females did not differ in Cort(f), but T-f concentrations were higher in males than females, particularly during the prebreeding period. In this study, we provide an effective method for analyzing hormones in feathers in an ecological context, especially in situations when the total amount of feathers available for the analysis is limited.

The aim was to understand genetic population structure and connectivity of T. hemprichii in relation to hydrodynamic features. We genotyped 205 individual seagrass shoots from 11 sites across the WIO, spanning over a distance of similar to 2,700 km, with twelve microsatellite markers. Seagrass shoots were sampled in Kenya, Tanzania (mainland and Zanzibar), Mozambique, and Madagascar: 4-26 degrees S and 33-48 degrees E. We assessed clonality and visualized genetic diversity and genetic population differentiation. We used Bayesian clustering approaches (TESS) to trace spatial ancestry of populations and used directional migration rates (DivMigrate) to identify sources of gene flow. We identified four genetically differentiated groups: (a) samples from the Zanzibar channel; (b) Mozambique; (c) Madagascar; and (d) the east coast of Zanzibar and Kenya. Significant pairwise population genetic differentiation was found among many sites. Isolation by distance was detected for the estimated magnitude of divergence (D-EST), but the three predominant ocean current systems (i.e., East African Coastal Current, North East Madagascar Current, and the South Equatorial Current) also determine genetic connectivity and genetic structure. Directional migration rates indicate that Madagascar acts as an important source population. Overall, clonality was moderate to high with large differences among sampling sites, indicating relatively low, but spatially variable sexual reproduction rates. The strongest genetic break was identified for three sites in the Zanzibar channel. Although isolation by distance is present, this study suggests that the three regionally predominant ocean current systems (i.e., East African Coastal Current, North East Madagascar Current, and the South Equatorial Current) rather than distance determine genetic connectivity and structure of T. hemprichii in the WIO. If the goal is to maintain genetic connectivity of T. hemprichii within the WIO, conservation planning and implementation of marine protection should be considered at the regional scale-across national borders.

Cope's Rule in a modular organism: Directional evolution without an overarching macroevolutionary trend	EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						Bergmann's Rule; cheilostome bryozoans; fossils; macroevolution; module size	BODY-SIZE EVOLUTION; SELECTION; GROWTH; LIFE; DYNAMICS; TEMPERATURE; SYSTEMATICS; COMPETITION; DEPENDENCE; BRYOZOANS	Cope's Rule describes increasing body size in evolutionary lineages through geological time. This pattern has been documented in unitary organisms but does it also apply to module size in colonial organisms? We address this question using 1169 cheilostome bryozoans ranging through the entire 150 million years of their evolutionary history. The temporal pattern evident in cheilostomes as a whole shows no overall change in zooid (module) size. However, individual subclades show size increases: within a genus, younger species often have larger zooids than older species. Analyses of (paleo)latitudinal shifts show that this pattern cannot be explained by latitudinal effects (Bergmann's Rule) coupled with younger species occupying higher latitudes than older species (an "out of the tropics" hypothesis). While it is plausible that size increase was linked to the advantages of large zooids in feeding, competition for trophic resources and living space, other proposed mechanisms for Cope's Rule in unitary organisms are either inapplicable to cheilostome zooid size or cannot be evaluated. Patterns and mechanisms in colonial organisms cannot and should not be extrapolated from the better-studied unitary organisms. And even if macroevolution simply comprises repeated rounds of microevolution, evolutionary processes occurring within lineages are not always detectable from macroevolutionary patterns.

Shade tolerance and mycorrhizal type may influence sapling susceptibility to conspecific negative density dependence	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Janzen-Connell hypothesis; life-history traits; plant traits; plant-soil feedbacks; soil pathogens; temperate forests; tree recruitment	TROPICAL TREE; TEMPERATE FOREST; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; LIFE STAGES; SOIL; MORTALITY; PATHOGENS; SURVIVAL; ASSOCIATIONS; INFORMATION	The maintenance of tree diversity has been explained by multiple mechanisms. One of the most thoroughly studied is conspecific negative density dependence, in which specialist plant enemies reduce survivorship of seeds, seedlings or saplings located near adult conspecifics. Although there is much support that conspecific negative density dependence occurs in temperate forests, only a subset of the species investigated thus far exhibit this recruitment pattern. It remains unclear what drives differential susceptibility to conspecifics among tree species. Previous investigators have considered shade tolerance and mycorrhizal type (arbuscular mycorrhizal vs. ectomycorrhizal association) as two traits that might explain differential susceptibility to conspecific negative density dependence. Here, we test whether these two plant traits predict susceptibility of tree saplings to conspecific negative density dependence in a temperate hardwood forest using three responses: spatial point patterns of saplings, sapling growth and sapling survival. Spatial patterns of saplings indicate that shade tolerant species are less sensitive to conspecifics than shade intolerant species, but show no differences based on mycorrhizal type. Conversely, shade tolerant saplings exhibit reduced growth, but not survival, when located in areas with high conspecific density. We interpret this finding in light of the conservative functional strategies of shade tolerant species, which typically have low leaf nitrogen levels and slower growth to divert resources to tissue defence against enemies. We found an effect of mycorrhizal type interacting with adult conspecific density, where arbuscular mycorrhizal species show a greater reduction in growth than ectomycorrhizal species in areas dense with conspecifics. Synthesis. We conclude that the shade tolerance level and the mycorrhizal type of temperate forest saplings may influence how their growth and survival respond to the adult conspecific trees in their neighbourhoods.

Plant communities on nitrogen-rich soil are less sensitive to soil moisture than plant communities on nitrogen-poor soil	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						community assembly; environmental filtering; light; multiple resource limitation; nitrogen; plant strategies; soil moisture; trait-based ecology	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; ROOT-TISSUE DENSITY; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; CYPRESS HILLS; ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; UNDERSTORY VEGETATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CO-LIMITATION; LEAF; DIVERSITY	Plant species composition and diversity are known to change across local gradients of light, moisture and nutrients, but ecologists still have a relatively limited understanding of how communities respond to multiple limiting resources. We used a trait-based approach to investigate how the functional composition and diversity of forest understorey plant communities change along gradients in light, soil moisture and nitrogen availability. We used a total of seven leaf, root and whole-plant traits for 55-78 species, and estimated the effects of the three resources on the mean and dispersion of these traits in understorey plant communities across 50 forest sites. Soil moisture and nitrogen availability (C/N ratio) both influenced plant community traits, but light availability (canopy openness) did not. Generally, increases in moisture and nitrogen both resulted in shifts towards more acquisitive resource use strategies, including greater leaf area, specific leaf area and maximum plant height, and lower leaf dry matter content, root dry matter content and rooting depth. Functional diversity of most traits also increased with increasing soil moisture and nitrogen. Although most traits varied with soil moisture on nitrogen-poor sites, moisture did not influence of the distribution of any traits on nitrogen-rich sites. Synthesis. Independent co-limitation of soil moisture and nitrogen appeared to influence the functional composition and diversity of understorey vegetation in our study area. The co-occurrence of species with resource acquisitive and conservative strategies on nitrogen-rich sites may make plant communities relatively resistant to changes to soil moisture. These results suggest that altered precipitation regimes under climate change could lead to greater changes in the composition and diversity of plant communities on nutrient-poor soils than on nutrient-rich soils.

The diversity, distribution, and environmental functions of microorganisms inhabiting abyssal sediments are barely understood. To understand consequences of deep-sea mining, experimental in vitro systems needs to be established to test hypotheses on the environmental impact of mining. For this, 40 bacterial strains, belonging to proteobacteria, actinobacteria and firmicutes were isolated from deep-sea sediments and nodules sampled at depths of >= 4000 m. Phenotypic characterization revealed a strong inter-species and moderate intra-species variability. Determination of metal minimum inhibitory concentrations indicated the presence of acute manganese-resistant bacteria such as Rhodococcus erythropolis (228.9 mM), Loktanella cinnabarina (57.2 mM), and Dietzia maris (14.3 mM) that might be suitable systems for testing the effects of release of microbes from nodules and their interactions with sediment particles in plumes generated during mining. Comparative genomic analysis indicated the presence of manganese efflux systems relevant for future transcriptomics or proteomics approaches with environmental samples and might serve in paving the way to develop model systems including representative organisms which are currently not cultivable. Monitoring deep-sea mining activity at abyssal depth is a challenge that has to be tackled. We proposed the use of API strips as a fast on-board methodology for bacterial monitoring as an indicator for sediment plume dispersions within the water column.

This event was expected to have a devastating impact on populations of giant kelp, an important coastal foundation species found in cool, nutrient rich waters. To evaluate this expectation, we used a time series of satellite imagery to examine giant kelp canopy biomass before, during, and after this heatwave across more than 7 degrees of latitude in southern and Baja California. We examined spatial patterns in resistance, i.e., the initial response of kelp, and resilience, i.e., the abundance of kelp 2 years after the heatwave ended. The heatwave had a large and immediate negative impact on giant kelp near its southern range limit in Baja. In contrast, the impacts of the heatwave were delayed throughout much of the central portion of our study area, while the northern portions of our study area exhibited high levels of resistance and resilience to the warming, despite large positive temperature anomalies. Giant kelp resistance throughout the entire region was most strongly correlated with the mean temperature of the warmest month of the heatwave, indicating that the loss of canopy was more sensitive to exceeding an absolute temperature threshold than to the magnitude of relative changes in temperature. Resilience was spatially variable and not significantly related to SST metrics or to resistance, indicating that local scale environmental and biotic processes played a larger role in determining the recovery of kelp from this extreme warming event. Our results highlight the resilient nature of giant kelp, but also point to absolute temperature thresholds that are associated with rapid loss of kelp forests.

As the strength of this influence may change predictably in space, we test multiple hypotheses about spatial gradients in the effects of environmental drivers on bird population trends across the continent. Location Europe. Methods We used country-level population trends for 249 bird species in 32 European countries. For each species, we expressed values of 12 traits which mirror the influence of major environmental drivers: climate change, land-use change and change in environmental legislation. We related these traits to population trends using generalized additive mixed models and tested for the presence of spatial gradients by including the interaction of countries' geographic position with four of these traits for which we hypothesized spatial patterns in relationships to trends. Results Species listed for the longest time under Annex I of the EU's Birds Directive had increasingly positive trends towards the north-west, but an indication of the opposite pattern was found for shorter-listed species. Cold-adapted species had increasingly negative trends towards the North and especially the north-west, whereas the trends of the warm-adapted species were generally positive and increased in northern direction. Spatial gradients in trends were weaker for the habitat niche position with forest species having positive trends in North-Eastern Europe and open-habitat species having negative trends in the Westernmost edge of the continent. Main conclusions The influence of all major hypothesized drivers varies across Europe. Climate change impacts are probably most detrimental in North-Western Europe for the Arctic and upland birds, whereas the warm-adapted species may benefit from these changes at the same time. The differences in the enforcement of environmental legislation among countries are a likely driver of the spatial patterns for the Annex I species, whereas the unification of land-use intensity may be the cause of relatively weak patterns in the habitat niche effects.

To buffer against global change, an established adaptation strategy is designing protected areas to increase representation and complementarity of biodiversity features. Uncertainty regarding the scale and magnitude of landscape change complicates reserve planning and exposes decision makers to the risk of failing to meet conservation goals. Conservation planning tends to treat risk as an absolute measure, ignoring the context of the management problem and risk preferences of stakeholders. Application of risk management theory to conservation emphasizes the diversification of a portfolio of assets, with the goal of reducing the impact of system volatility on investment return. We use principles of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which quantifies risk as the variance and correlation among assets, to formalize diversification as an explicit strategy for managing risk in climate-driven reserve design. We extend MPT to specify a framework that evaluates multiple conservation objectives, allows decision makers to balance management benefits and risk when preferences are contested or unknown, and includes additional decision options such as parcel divestment when evaluating candidate reserve designs. We apply an efficient search algorithm that optimizes portfolio design for large conservation problems and a game theoretic approach to evaluate portfolio trade-offs that satisfy decision makers with divergent benefit and risk tolerances, or when a single decision maker cannot resolve their own preferences. Evaluating several risk profiles for a case study in South Carolina, our results suggest that a reserve design may be somewhat robust to differences in risk attitude but that budgets will likely be important determinants of conservation planning strategies, particularly when divestment is considered a viable alternative. We identify a possible fiscal threshold where adequate resources allow protecting a sufficiently diverse portfolio of habitats such that the risk of failing to achieve conservation objectives is considerably lower. For a range of sea-level rise projections, conversion of habitat to open water (14-180%) and wetland loss (1-7%) are unable to be compensated under the current protected network. In contrast, optimal reserve design outcomes are predicted to ameliorate expected losses relative to current and future habitat protected under the existing conservation estate.

Manipulating social information to promote frugivory by birds on a Hawaiian Island	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						conspecific attraction; fruit-eating bird; Hawaiian flora; playback experiment; seed dispersal; social information; Zosterops japonicas	SEED DISPERSAL; PUBLIC INFORMATION; PATTERNS; ATTRACTION; POPULATION; FOREST; CONSERVATION; EXTINCTIONS; DISTURBANCE; NETWORKS	Animals across a range of taxa use social information when foraging. Fruit-eating vertebrates are no exception and use social information to find fruit, which may ultimately affect plant populations via seed dispersal. In many systems, mutualistic relationships between fruiting plants and frugivores are critical to maintain ecosystem functioning, especially in the tropics. On the island of OModified Letter Turned Commaahu, Hawaii, USA, all native, fruit-eating birds are extinct and several plant species are experiencing reduced recruitment likely due to a lack of seed dispersal. Over the years, numerous bird species, many of which are frugivorous, have been introduced to the island. Yet, introduced birds may not recognize native fruits as a resource and social information may be needed for introduced frugivores to target and feed on native fruits. We investigated whether social information, in the form of broadcasted bird vocalizations, of introduced birds could increase visitations and more importantly frugivory on focal fruiting plants. We also tested whether the visitation rates of introduced bird species to focal plants were influenced by conspecific and/or heterospecific vocalizations. We conducted 80 playback experiments at native and introduced fruiting plants, and compared responses to silent control periods. Four times as many frugivores were detected and 10 times more frugivory events were recorded at plants with broadcasted vocalizations compared to control periods. The Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) exhibited the strongest response to both conspecific and heterospecific playbacks. White-eyes also consumed the most fruit from the widest array of plant species during trials. Introduced birds that use social information and readily identify novel resources may more effectively colonize new areas. We suggest that the White-eye's use of social information may help to support their robust population on OModified Letter Turned Commaahu. Ecosystems throughout the world are affected by the loss of mutualistic relationships, many of which provide valuable ecological services. As humans continue to modify environments, novel conservation approaches may be required to maintain important ecological functions. The use of social information to facilitate frugivory may not only be important in Hawaii, but in other tropical systems where key frugivorous species are lost or abundances have been reduced.

Urban meadows as an alternative to short mown grassland: effects of composition and height on biodiversity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						beetles; carbon; conservation planning; green infrastructure; insects; microbial diversity; nitrogen; overwintering; plant richness; urban ecology; urban parks	SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; INSECT CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; LAWN; RESTORATION; CITIES; PLANT; SPACE	There are increasing calls to provide greenspace in urban areas, yet the ecological quality, as well as quantity, of greenspace is important. Short mown grassland designed for recreational use is the dominant form of urban greenspace in temperate regions but requires considerable maintenance and typically provides limited habitat value for most taxa. Alternatives are increasingly proposed, but the biodiversity potential of these is not well understood. In a replicated experiment across six public urban greenspaces, we used nine different perennial meadow plantings to quantify the relative roles of floristic diversity and height of sown meadows on the richness and composition of three taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, and soil microbes. We found that all meadow treatments were colonized by plant species not sown in the plots, suggesting that establishing sown meadows does not preclude further locally determined grassland development if management is appropriate. Colonizing species were rarer in taller and more diverse plots, indicating competition may limit invasion rates. Urban meadow treatments contained invertebrate and microbial communities that differed from mown grassland. Invertebrate taxa responded to changes in both height and richness of meadow vegetation, but most orders were more abundant where vegetation height was longer than mown grassland. Order richness also increased in longer vegetation and Coleoptera family richness increased with plant diversity in summer. Microbial community composition seems sensitive to plant species composition at the soil surface (0-10 cm), but in deeper soils (11-20 cm) community variation was most responsive to plant height, with bacteria and fungi responding differently. In addition to improving local residents' site satisfaction, native perennial meadow plantings can produce biologically diverse grasslands that support richer and more abundant invertebrate communities, and restructured plant, invertebrate, and soil microbial communities compared with short mown grassland. Our results suggest that diversification of urban greenspace by planting urban meadows in place of some mown amenity grassland is likely to generate substantial biodiversity benefits, with a mosaic of meadow types likely to maximize such benefits.

Remote sensing indicators of spectral variability and greenness may predict the diversity of plant communities based on their optical diversity; however, most evidence is based on narrowband spectral data or terrestrial ecosystems. We investigate how spectral greenness and heterogeneity from publicly available broadband multi-spectral Landsat satellite imagery explain variation in vegetation diversity across different wetland types, ecoregions, and disturbance levels using 1,138 sites surveyed by U.S. EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. We found positive correlations of plant species richness and diversity with indicators of annual maximum spectral greenness and its spatial heterogeneity, explaining up to 43% variation within the global sample, 48% within wetland types or ecoregions, and up to 61% with abiotic covariates. The combined effect of spectral greenness and heterogeneity was stronger than the best-performing model using climatic, topographic, and edaphic factors alone. When compared among major U.S. watersheds and individual states, the fit of diversity-greenness models increased when more wetland types were included within the corresponding region's boundaries, up to 61% at the watershed and 77% at the state level, respectively, for diversity models and up to 73% and 80%, respectively, for richness models. Model outliers were characterized by a significantly greater diversity of nonnative species (P < 0.0001), suggesting that changes in model performance and greenness distributions could be used as indicators of shifts in plant community composition, particularly in tidal wetlands making the majority of outliers with significantly lower than predicted diversity. This study represents a first-time national-scale effort to use publicly available remote sensing, climatic, and topographic data to predict plant diversity in wetlands, which tend to be understudied compared to terrestrial ecosystems despite being among the most stressed ecosystems on Earth. Our study suggests that multi-temporal broadband satellite imagery could provide a low-cost assessment of regional and national wetland biodiversity for prioritization of conservation efforts and early detection of biodiversity loss.

Loss of functional connectivity in migration networks induces population decline in migratory birds	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						bird migration; habitat loss; life history; network robustness; population dynamics; species traits; wetland	HABITAT AVAILABILITY; STOPOVER SITES; WATERFOWL; CONSEQUENCES; DIVERSITY; PATCHES; TRAITS; THREAT; LIMITS; CHINA	Migratory birds rely on a habitat network along their migration routes by temporarily occupying stopover sites between breeding and non-breeding grounds. Removal or degradation of stopover sites in a network might impede movement and thereby reduce migration success and survival. The extent to which the breakdown of migration networks, due to changes in land use, impacts the population sizes of migratory birds is poorly understood. We measured the functional connectivity of migration networks of waterfowl species that migrate over the East Asian-Australasian Flyway from 1992 to 2015. We analysed the relationship between changes in non-breeding population sizes and changes in functional connectivity, while taking into account other commonly considered species traits, using a phylogenetic linear mixed model. We found that population sizes significantly declined with a reduction in the functional connectivity of migration networks; no other variables were important. We conclude that the current decrease in functional connectivity, due to habitat loss and degradation in migration networks, can negatively and crucially impact population sizes of migratory birds. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that affect population trends of migratory birds under environmental changes. Establishment of international agreements leading to the creation of systematic conservation networks associated with migratory species' distributions and stopover sites may safeguard migratory bird populations.

Climate outweighs native vs. nonnative range-effects for genetics and common garden performance of a cosmopolitan weed	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article; Early Access						among-population variation; biological invasions; climatic gradients; contemporary evolution; Conyza canadensis; functional connectivity; multiple introductions; native vs; nonnative comparisons; non-adaptive evolution; post-introduction evolutionary changes; propagule pressure; selfing	HORSEWEED CONYZA-CANADENSIS; EXOTIC PLANT INVASIONS; SELF-FERTILIZATION; INVADED RANGE; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; COLONIZATION ABILITIES; POPULATION-GENETICS; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; RAPID EVOLUTION; LONG-DISTANCE	Comparing genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and performance between native and nonnative populations has advanced our knowledge of contemporary evolution and its ecological consequences. However, such between-range comparisons can be complicated by high among-population variation within native and nonnative ranges. For example, native vs. nonnative comparisons between small and non-representative subsets of populations for species with very large distributions have the potential to mislead because they may not sufficiently account for within-range adaptation to climatic conditions, and demographic history that may lead to non-adaptive evolution. We used the cosmopolitan weed Conyza canadensis to study the interplay of adaptive and demographic processes across, to our knowledge, the broadest climatic gradient yet investigated in this context. To examine the distribution of genetic diversity, we genotyped 26 native and 26 nonnative populations at 12 microsatellite loci. Furthermore, we recorded performance traits for 12 native and 13 nonnative populations in the field and in the common garden. To analyze how performance was related to range and/or climate, we fit pedigree mixed-effects models. These models weighed the population random effect for co-ancestry to account for the influence of demographic history on phenotypic among-population differentiation. Genetic diversity was very low, selfing rates were very high, and both were comparable between native and nonnative ranges. Nonnative populations out-performed native populations in the field. However, our most salient result was that both neutral genetic differentiation and common garden performance were far more correlated with the climatic conditions from which populations originated than native vs. nonnative range affiliation. Including co-ancestry of our populations in our models greatly increased explained variance and our ability to detect significant main effects for among-population variation in performance. High propagule pressure and high selfing rates, in concert with the ability to adapt rapidly to climatic gradients, may have facilitated the global success of this weed. Neither native nor nonnative populations were homogeneous groups but responded comparably to similar environments in each range. We suggest that studies of contemporary evolution should consider widely distributed and genotyped populations to disentangle native vs. nonnative range effects from varying adaptive processes within ranges and from potentially confounding effects of demographic history.

Studies in candidate genes Clock and Adcyap1 have revealed that both of these loci can be significantly correlated with migratory behaviors in birds, though observed relationships appear to vary across species. We investigated geographic genetic structure of Clock and Adcyap1 in four populations of blackpoll warblers (Setophaga striata), a Neotropical-Nearctic migrant that exhibits geographic variation in migratory timing and duration across its boreal breeding distribution. Further, we used data on migratory timing and duration, obtained from light-level geolocator trackers to investigate candidate genotype-phenotype relationships at the individual level. While we found no geographic structure in either candidate gene, we did find evidence that candidate gene lengths are correlated with five of the six migratory traits. Maximum Clock allele length was significantly and negatively associated with spring arrival date. Minimum Adcyap1 allele length was significantly and negatively associated with spring departure date and positively associated with fall arrival date at the wintering grounds. Additionally, we found a significant interaction between Clock and Adcyap1 allele lengths on both spring and fall migratory duration. Adcyap1 heterozygotes also had significantly shorter migration duration in both spring and fall compared to homozygotes. Our results support the growing body of evidence that Clock and Adcyap1 allele lengths are correlated with migratory behaviors in birds.

Rapid, complete reproductive isolation in two closely related Zosterops White-eye bird species despite broadly overlapping ranges	EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						Reproductive isolation; secondary contact; speciation; Zosterops	AVIAN HYBRID ZONE; SEXUAL SELECTION; SPECIATION; DIVERSIFICATION; HYBRIDIZATION; INTROGRESSION; GENOME; COLOR; SONG; REINFORCEMENT	Examining what happens when two closely related species come into secondary contact provides insight into the later stages of the speciation process. The Zosteropidae family of birds is one of the most rapidly speciating vertebrate lineages. Members of this family are highly vagile and geographically widespread, raising the question of how divergence can occur if populations can easily come into secondary contact. On the small island of Kolombangara, two closely related nonsister species of white-eyes, Zosterops kulambangrae and Zosterops murphyi, are distributed along an elevational gradient and come into secondary contact at mid-elevations. We captured 134 individuals of both species along two elevational transects. Using genotyping-by-sequencing data and a mitochondrial marker, we found no evidence of past hybridization events and strong persistence of species boundaries, even though the species have only been diverging for approximately 2 million years. We explore potential reproductive barriers that allow the two species to coexist in sympatry, including premating isolation based on divergence in plumage and song. We also conducted a literature review to determine the time it takes to evolve complete reproductive isolation in congeneric avian species/subspecies in secondary contact (restricted to cases where congeneric taxa are parapatric or have a hybrid zone), finding our study is one of the youngest examples of complete reproductive isolation studied in a genomic context reported in birds.

Geographic scale and disturbance influence intraspecific trait variability in leaves and roots of North American understorey plants	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						functional biogeography; intraspecific trait variability; leaf trait; plant functional trait; root trait; specific leaf area; specific root length; tissue nutrient concentration	MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; COMMUNITY-LEVEL; LEAF; STRATEGIES; TEMPERATE; FRAMEWORK; HANDBOOK; FORESTS	Considering intraspecific trait variability (ITV) in ecological studies has improved our understanding of species persistence and coexistence. These advances are based on the growing number of leaf ITV studies over local gradients, but logistical constraints have prevented a solid examination of ITV in root traits or at scales reflecting species' geographic ranges. We compared the magnitude of ITV in above- and below-ground plant organs across three spatial scales (biophysical region, locality and plot). We focused on six understorey species (four herbs and two shrubs) that occur both in disturbed and undisturbed habitats across boreal and temperate Canadian forests. We aimed to document ITV structure over broad ecological and geographical scales by asking: (a) What is the breadth of ITV across species range-scale? (b) What proportion of ITV is captured at different spatial scales, particularly when local scale disturbances are considered? and (c) Is the variance structure consistent between analogous leaf and root traits, and between morphological and chemical traits? Following standardized methods, we sampled 818 populations across 79 forest plots simultaneously, including disturbed and undisturbed stands, spanning four biophysical regions (similar to 5,200 km). Traits measured included specific leaf area (SLA), specific root length (SRL) and leaf and root nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, Mg, Ca). We used variance decomposition techniques to characterize ITV structure across scales. Our results show that an important proportion of ITV occurred at the local scale when sampling included contrasting environmental conditions resulting from local disturbance. A certain proportion of the variability in both leaf and root traits remained unaccounted for by the three sampling scales included in the design (36% on average), with the largest amount for SRL (54%). Substantial differences in magnitude of ITV were found among the six species, and between analogous traits, suggesting that trait distribution was influenced by species strategy and reflects the extent of understorey environment heterogeneity. Even for species with broad geographical distributions, a large proportion of within-species trait variability can be captured by sampling locally across ecological gradients. This has practical implications for sampling design and trait selection for both local studies and continental-scale modelling. A plain language summary is available for this article.

Differing climate and landscape effects on regional dryland vegetation responses during wet periods allude to future patterns	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Chihuahuan Desert; climate change; extreme events; legacy effects; precipitation; regional processes; vegetation responses	DESERT GRASSLAND; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; VARIABILITY; SOIL; EVENTS	Dryland vegetation is influenced by biotic and abiotic land surface template (LST) conditions and precipitation (PPT), such that enhanced vegetation responses to periods of high PPT may be shaped by multiple factors. High PPT stochasticity in the Chihuahuan Desert suggests that enhanced responses across broad geographic areas are improbable. Yet, multiyear wet periods may homogenize PPT patterns, interact with favorable LST conditions, and in this way produce enhanced responses. In contrast, periods containing multiple extreme high PPT pulse events could overwhelm LST influences, suggesting a divergence in how climate change could influence vegetation by altering PPT periods. Using a suite of stacked remote sensing and LST datasets from the 1980s to the present, we evaluated PPT-LST-Vegetation relationships across this region and tested the hypothesis that enhanced vegetation responses would be initiated by high PPT, but that LST favorability would underlie response magnitude, producing geographic differences between wet periods. We focused on two multiyear wet periods; one of above average, regionally distributed PPT (1990-1993) and a second with locally distributed PPT that contained two extreme wet pulses (2006-2008). 1990-1993 had regional vegetation responses that were correlated with soil properties. 2006-2008 had higher vegetation responses over a smaller area that were correlated primarily with PPT and secondarily to soil properties. Within the overlapping PPT area of both periods, enhanced vegetation responses occurred in similar locations. Thus, LST favorability underlied the geographic pattern of vegetation responses, whereas PPT initiated the response and controlled response area and maximum response magnitude. Multiyear periods provide foresight on the differing impacts that directional changes in mean climate and changes in extreme PPT pulses could have in drylands. Our study shows that future vegetation responses during wet periods will be tied to LST favorability, yet will be shaped by the pattern and magnitude of multiyear PPT events.

However, the role of diaspore adaptations in a biogeographic context is being increasingly questioned, as evidence reveals that unspecialized plants have been successful colonizers by recurrent non-standard dispersal. We studied wind and oceanic currents as vectors for long-distance plant dispersal between the Americas and the Galapagos Islands with the focus on diaspore specializations to gain knowledge on the net contribution of standard and non-standard dispersal mechanisms. Location Eastern Pacific Ocean: the American continent and Galapagos. Major taxa studied Non-endemic angiosperms native to Galapagos and the American continent. Methods We used connectivity models for prevailing wind and ocean currents based on satellite data to explore the correspondence between connectivity and species distribution patterns. Using a randomization test to eliminate the effect of wind and current directionality, we evaluated whether the proportion of species that is more connected than randomly expected varies for the five diaspore specialization groups. Results We found that a large percentage of the plants are present in areas of the continent where ocean current connectivity with the archipelago is higher than expected by chance, while the percentage is small for areas with high wind connectivity. We did not find correspondence between species long-distance dispersal specialization and the connectivity provided by either of the two abiotic vectors. Main conclusions Our results of ocean current connectivity - over wind connectivity - lead us to hypothesize that rafting dispersal has been significant in connecting the biota of Central/South America and the Galapagos Islands. This result supports a more prominent role of non-standard dispersal mechanisms in a biogeographic context than accepted in traditional schemes.

Several solutions are currently available, such as downscaled or interpolated coarse-grained free-air temperatures, satellite-measured land surface temperatures (LST) or in-situ-measured soil temperatures. A comprehensive comparison of temperature data sources and their performance in SDMs is, however, currently lacking. Location Northern Scandinavia. Time period 1970-2017. Major taxa studied Higher plants. Methods We evaluated different sources of temperature data (WorldClim, CHELSA, MODIS, E-OBS, topoclimate and soil temperature from miniature data loggers), differing in spatial resolution (from 1 '' to 0.1 degrees), measurement focus (free-air, ground-surface or soil temperature) and temporal extent (year-long versus long-term averages), and used them to fit SDMs for 50 plant species with different growth forms in a high-latitudinal mountain region. Results Differences between these temperature data sources originating from measurement focus and temporal extent overshadow the effects of temporal climatic differences and spatio-temporal resolution, with elevational lapse rates ranging from -0.6 degrees C per 100 m for long-term free-air temperature data to -0.2 degrees C per 100 m for in-situ soil temperatures. Most importantly, we found that the performance of the temperature data in SDMs depended on the growth forms of species. The use of in-situ soil temperatures improved the explanatory power of our SDMs (R-2 on average +16%), especially for forbs and graminoids (R-2 +24 and +21% on average, respectively) compared with the other data sources. Main conclusions We suggest that future studies using SDMs should use the temperature dataset that best reflects the ecology of the species, rather than automatically using coarse-grained data from WorldClim or CHELSA.

Contact rates with nesting birds before and after invasive snake removal: estimating the effects of trap-based control	NEOBIOTA			English	Article						Avian recovery; biological invasions; brown treesnakes; control; Guam; restoration	BROWN TREE SNAKE; BOIGA-IRREGULARIS; PREDATORS; TREESNAKES; POPULATION; SURVIVAL; CONSERVATION; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; THREATS	Invasive predators are responsible for almost 60% of all vertebrate extinctions worldwide with the most vulnerable faunas occurring on islands. The brown treesnake (Boiga irregularis) is a notorious invasive predator that caused the extirpation or extinction of most native forest birds on Guam. The success of avian reintroduction efforts on Guam will depend on whether snake-control techniques sufficiently reduce contact rates between brown treesnakes and reintroduced birds. Mouse-lure traps can successfully reduce brown treesnake populations at local scales. Over a 22-week period both with and without active snake removal, we evaluated snake-trap contact rates for mouse- and bird-lure traps. Bird-lure traps served as a proxy for reintroduced nesting birds. Overall, mouse-lure traps caught more snakes per trap night than did bird-lure traps. However, cameras revealed that bird-lure traps had a snake contact rate almost 15 times greater than the number of successfully captured snakes. Snakes that entered bird-lure traps tended to be larger and in better body condition and were mostly captured in bird-lure traps, despite numerous adjacent mouse-lure traps. Traps placed along grid edges caught more snakes than interior traps, suggesting continuous immigration into the trapping grid within which bird-lure traps were located. Contact between snakes and bird-lure traps was equivalent before and after snake removal, suggesting mouse-lure traps did not adequately reduce the density of snakes that posed a risk to birds, at least at the timescale of this project. This study provides evidence that some snakes exhibit prey selectivity for live birds over live mouse lures. Reliance on a single control tool and lure may be inadequate for support of avian reintroductions and could lead to unintended harvest-driven trait changes of this invasive predator.	[Adam, Amy A.

Accounting for detectability and abundance in survey design for a declining species	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article; Early Access						abundance; conservation; detectability; endangered species; moon phase; seasonality; survey effort; threatened species; trap behaviour	PSEUDOMYS-NOVAEHOLLANDIAE WATERHOUSE; ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; SMALL MAMMALS; DETECTION PROBABILITIES; IMPERFECT DETECTION; HOLLAND MOUSE; EXTINCTION; POPULATIONS; SUCCESSION; IMPACTS	Aim As populations decline they become harder to detect simply because there are fewer animals to observe. In such cases, survey effort that was once reliable may become inadequate and the species incorrectly labelled locally extinct, causing management efforts to cease. For declining populations, then, we need to determine the survey effort necessary to detect the species, assuming only a single individual is present at a site. Detectability, however, often varies wildly with seasonal, behavioural and environmental variables. Thus, we need statistical analyses and survey design which can deal with highly variable detection rates and allow us to detect even very small populations. This is especially true in Australia, where many mammal species are experiencing serious decline. Here, we examine a threatened Australian rodent, the New Holland Mouse (Pseudomys novaehollandiae): we determine minimum survey requirements for reliable detection and show that historical survey effort is inadequate to assert local extinction. Location Victoria, Australia. Methods Using a 48-year live-trapping dataset, we estimated P. novaehollandiae abundance and detectability using N-mixture modelling in a Bayesian framework, testing the effects of seasonal fluctuations and environmental variables to determine ideal conditions for occupancy surveys. We used these findings to assess the adequacy of historical resurvey efforts in confirming local extinctions. Results We found that detectability followed seasonal fluctuations distinct from changes in abundance, was strongly reduced by brighter moon phases, and slightly increased over the course of a survey and when raining. When abundance was low, standard historical survey efforts were inadequate to assert the species' absence with appropriate statistical confidence, indicating that further surveys would be required to test purported local extinctions. Main conclusions Our results highlight the potential for considerable intra-species heterogeneity in detectability caused by shifting local abundances and survey conditions, as well as the importance of accounting for detectability when monitoring threatened and declining species.

Impacts of rainfall extremes predicted by climate-change models on major trophic groups in the leaf litter arthropod community	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						arthropod community; bottom-up control; climate change; leaf litter; mesocosm experiment; rainfall; soil food web; spatial heterogeneity; trophic groups	SOIL FAUNA; CHANGE ALTERS; DECOMPOSITION; DROUGHT; PREDATORS; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; INCREASE	Arthropods in the leaf litter layer of forest soils influence ecosystem processes such as decomposition. Climate-change models predict both increases and decreases in average rainfall. Increased drought may have greater impacts on the litter arthropod community. In addition to affecting survival or behaviour of desiccation-sensitive species, lower rainfall may indirectly lower abundances of consumers that graze drought-stressed fungi, with repercussions for higher trophic levels. We tested the hypothesis that trophic structure will differ between the two rainfall scenarios. In particular, we hypothesized that densities of several broadly defined trophic groupings of arthropods would be lower under reduced rainfall. To test this hypothesis, we used sprinklers to impose two rainfall treatments during three growing seasons in roofed, fenced 14-m(2) plots and documented changes in abundance from initial, pre-treatment densities of 39 arthropod taxa. Experimental plots were subjected to either LOW (fortnightly) or HIGH (weekly) average rainfall based upon climate models and the previous 100 years of regional weekly averages. Unroofed open plots, our reference treatment (REF), experienced higher than average rainfall during the experiment. The two rainfall extremes produced clear negative effects of lowered rainfall on major trophic groups. Broad categories of fungivores, detritivores and predators were more abundant in HIGH than LOW plots by the final year. Springtails (Collembola), which graze fungal hyphae, were 3x more abundant in the HIGH rainfall treatment. Taxa of larger-bodied fungivores and detritivores, spiders (Araneae), and non-spider predators were 2x more abundant under HIGH rainfall. Densities of mites (Acari), which include fungivores, detritivores and predators, were 1.5x greater in HIGH rainfall plots. Abundances and community structure of arthropods were similar in REF and experimental plots, showing that effects of rainfall uncovered in the experiment are applicable to nature. This pattern suggests that changes in rainfall will alter bottom-up control processes in a critical detritus-based food web of deciduous forests. Our results, in conjunction with other findings on the impact of desiccation on arthropods and fungal growth, suggest that drier conditions will depress densities of fungal consumers, causing declines in higher trophic levels, with possible impacts on soil processes and the larger forest food web.

Drivers affecting mammal community structure and functional diversity under varied conservation efforts in a tropical rainforest in Cameroon	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article; Early Access						biodiversity; Congo Basin; functional diversity; human activity; logging; mammals; rainforest; conservation effort	PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; REDUNDANCY; COMPONENTS; DISPERSAL; FRAMEWORK; RICHNESS; REVEALS; IMPACTS	As well as leading to a loss of biodiversity (i.e. species richness and abundance), human activities also affect ecosystem functioning. Documenting how the suite of ecological roles changes following disturbance provides a complementary source of information for conservation management. To this end, we measured mammal diversity in terms of community structure (i.e. abundance, composition and species richness) and functional diversity in three sites differing in conservation effort in a tropical rainforest in Cameroon. Results show that sites without primary or secondary conservation efforts had lower mammal abundances and an altered mammal composition but similar species richness compared to better-protected areas. In terms of functional diversity, we found more variation of traits (i.e. FDis) in the site with primary conservation and higher abundances of functionally unique species (i.e. FOri) in sites with either primary or secondary conservation efforts. We found no overall difference in the abundance of specialist and generalist species between sites (i.e. FSpe). We identified several drivers affecting abundance, species richness and functional diversity of mammal communities, although there did not appear to be a common driver affecting all mammal diversity measures in a similar way. Our results suggest that, in addition to preserving mammal abundance and community composition, conservation efforts (both primary and secondary) are able to contribute to maintaining higher levels of functional diversity compared to areas devoid of conservation. We demonstrate that functional diversity metrics can provide valuable additional information about the status of mammal communities that can be used to better inform conservation management.

Poor management in protected areas is associated with lowered tropical mammal diversity	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article; Early Access						camera trapping; bushmeat hunting; species richness; hierarchical modeling; community occupancy; Tanzania	EASTERN ARC MOUNTAINS; UDZUNGWA MOUNTAINS; FUNCTIONAL-APPROACH; SPECIES RICHNESS; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; FORESTS; TANZANIA; OCCUPANCY; WILDLIFE	Numerous protected areas (PAs) have been created worldwide to safeguard wildlife and other natural resources from anthropogenic threats such as habitat destruction and bushmeat hunting. However, conservation efforts in many tropical PAs are still inadequate, revealing deficiencies in management effectiveness. It is therefore important to quantify how different protection regimes impact wildlife within PAs. We investigated the differences between forest mammal communities in two ecologically comparable PAs in the Udzungwa Mountains (Tanzania) with contrasting management regimes. One is a well-protected national park with efficient law enforcement; the other has suffered decades of inadequate protection, mainly resulting in high levels of illegal hunting. Using camera-trapping data, we assessed the target communities in terms of species richness, functional composition (i.e. proportions of trophic guilds) and species-specific occurrences, all while accounting for imperfect detection. We found striking differences between the two mammal communities: lower species richness, alteration in the trophic structure and reduced occurrence probabilities for most species in the forest with high disturbance. The difference in occurrence probability between the two PAs tended to be highest for larger-bodied species. Our results show that strictly enforced legal protection is required to maintain diverse mammal communities in tropical forests under ever-increasing anthropogenic threats. While PAs are the cornerstone of efforts to conserve tropical biodiversity, the future of biodiversity within them is closely tied to the effectiveness of enforcement.

Evaluating the efficacy of independent versus simultaneous management strategies to address ecological and genetic threats to population viability	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						conservation management planning; Corvid; extinction probability; gene flow; inbreeding-environment interactions; population persistence; population reinforcement; supplementary feeding	SEVERE INBREEDING DEPRESSION; WILD POPULATION; EFFECTIVE TOOL; GROWTH RATE; EXTINCTION; RESCUE; PYRRHOCORAX; SURVIVAL; PATTERNS; STRESS	Small, declining populations can face simultaneous, interacting, ecological and genetic threats to viability. Conservation management strategies designed to tackle such threats independently may then prove ineffective. Population viability analyses that evaluate the efficacy of management strategies implemented independently versus simultaneously are then essential to the design of effective management plans, yet such quantitative evaluations are typically lacking. We used stochastic individual-based models, parameterised with high-quality multi-year demographic and genetic data, to evaluate the efficacy of independent or simultaneous ecological (supplementary feeding) and genetic (translocations to alleviate inbreeding) management strategies for a red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) population of major conservation concern. This population is experiencing ecological threats from food limitation and genetic threats from escalating inbreeding. Conservation managers therefore face a dilemma: supplementary feeding may be ineffective if inbreeding is limiting stochastic population growth rate (lambda(s)), while translocations may be ineffective if food is limiting. Model simulations suggested that the focal population will decline to extinction relatively rapidly with no conservation management (mean lambda(s) approximate to 0.86) and with genetic management alone (lambda(s) approximate to 0.90). Ecological management alone reduced, but did not halt the population decline (lambda(s) approximate to 0.93). However, simultaneous genetic and ecological management yielded population stability (lambda(s) approximate to 1), with genetic rescue lasting similar to 25 years. These outcomes arose because the capacity for translocations to alleviate inbreeding depression is limited by food availability, while supplementary feeding cannot achieve population viability in the presence of accumulating inbreeding. However, supplementary feeding improved environmental quality enough to allow expression of variance in fitness and thus inbreeding depression, meaning that reductions in inbreeding following translocations can increase lambda(s). Synthesis and applications. Our analyses suggest that simultaneous management of ecological and genetic threats will be critical to ensuring viability of Scotland's chough population; neither strategy independently is likely to achieve population persistence and may consequently waste conservation resources. Managers of other resource-limited, inbred populations should consider that the efficacy of strategies designed to alleviate ecological and genetic threats may be interdependent, such that holistic management is essential to ensure population viability.

DNA metabarcoding, in which multiple species are computationally identified in bulk samples, can help to overcome the logistical limitations involved in sampling plant communities belowground. However, a major limitation of this methodology is the quantification of species' abundances based on the percentage of sequences assigned to each taxon. Using root tissues of five dominant species in a semi-arid Mediterranean shrubland (Bupleurum fruticescens, Helianthemum cinereum, Linum suffruticosum, Stipa pennata and Thymus vulgaris), we built pairwise mixtures of relative abundance (20%, 50% and 80% biomass), and implemented two methods (linear model fits and correction indices) to improve estimates of root biomass. We validated both methods with multispecies mixtures that simulate field-collected samples. For all species, we found a positive and highly significant relationship between the percentage of sequences and biomass in the mixtures (R-2 = .44-.66), but the equations for each species (slope and intercept) differed among them, and two species were consistently over- and under-estimated. The correction indices greatly improved the estimates of biomass percentage for all five species in the multispecies mixtures, and reduced the overall error from 17% to 6%. Our results show that, through the use of post-sequencing quantification methods on mock communities, DNA metabarcoding can be effectively used to determine not only species' presence but also their relative abundance in field samples of root mixtures. Importantly, knowledge of these aspects will allow us to study key, yet poorly understood, belowground processes.

JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Climate change; Energy depletion; Energy management system; Country certification level	INDUSTRIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY; RENEWABLE ENERGY; SYSTEM; LEVEL; REGRESSION; ISO-14001; MODEL	Non-renewable fuels are the world's main source of energy. However, the decrease in supply, increased demand, higher product costs and adverse effects on the environment led to the need to create the ISO 50001: 2011 standard to implement the Energy Management System (EnMS) in order to increase energy efficiency and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). Thus, the objective of this work was to characterize the diffusion process of the ISO 50001 standard around the world and what are the main factors that determine the adoption of EnMS in the different regions of the planet. For this, multiple regression models were used for the data of certification number and environmental, social, economic indicators, climate change and energy mining. Thereby it was observed that Europe has the highest number of ISO 50001 certifications and Asia is the fastest growing region. Among the countries Germany and the United Kingdom are those with the greatest diffusion of ISO 50001, but China has been increasing its diffusion with each year. Thus, the concern with climate change is the main factor that determines the adoption of the EnMS by the companies in the most diverse countries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study assessed the changes in LULC and ecosystem service values (ESVs) in the Afar National Regional State, Ethiopia, which experiences a rapid invasion by the alien tree Prosopis juliflora (Swartz DC). Landsat satellite data of 1986, 2000 and 2017 were used in Random Forest algorithm to assess LULC changes in the last 31 years, to calculate net changes for different LULC types and the associated changes in ESVs. Kappa accuracies of 88% and higher were obtained for the three LULC classifications. Post-classification change analyses for the period between 1986 and 2017 revealed a positive net change for Prosopis invaded areas, cropland, salt flats, settlements and waterbodies. The rate of Prosopis invasion was estimated at 31,127 ha per year. Negative net changes were found for grassland, bareland, bush-shrub-woodland, and natural forests. According to the local community representatives, the four most important drivers of LULC dynamics were climate change, frequent droughts, invasive species and weak traditional law. Based on two different ESVs estimations, the ecosystem changes caused by LULC changes resulted in an average loss of ESVs in the study area of about US$ 602 million (range US$ 112 to 1091 million) over the last 31 years. With an increase in area by 965,000 ha, Prosopis-invaded land was the highest net change during the study period, followed by grassland (-599,000 ha), bareland (-329,000 ha) and bush-shrub-woodland (-327,000 ha). Our study provides evidence that LULC changes in the Afar Region have led to a significant loss in ESVs, with serious consequences for the livelihoods of the rural people. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Using permutational and multivariate statistics to understand inorganic well water chemistry and the occurrence of methane in groundwater, southeastern New Brunswick, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Geochemistry; Shale gas; Maritimes Basin; Principal component analysis (PCA); PERMANOVA; R	DISSOLVED METHANE; SHALLOW GROUNDWATER; GEOCHEMISTRY; AQUIFERS; ORIGIN; CONTAMINATION; EVOLUTION; MARCELLUS; SALINITY; ALBERTA	Concerns over possible impacts from the rapid expansion of unconventional oil and natural gas (ONG) resource development prompted a regional domestic well sampling program focusing on the Carboniferous Maritimes Basin bedrock in southeastern New Brunswick, Canada. This work applies recent developments in robust multivariate statistical methods to overcome issues with highly non-Gaussian data and support the development of a conceptual model for the regional groundwater chemistry and the occurrence of methane. Principal component analysis reveals that the redox-sensitive species, DO, NO3, Fe, Mn, methane, As and U are the most important parameters that differentiate the samples. Permutation-based MANOVA and ANOVA testing revealed that geology was more important than geographic location and topography in influencing groundwater composition. The statistical inferences are supported by chemistry trends observed in relation to road de-icing salt and other saline sources. However, source differentiation between Carboniferous brines, entrapped post-glacial marine water and modern seawater cannot be made. Furthermore, Cl:Br ratios lower than those of seawater or regional brines suggest an origin related to the diagenesis of organic-rich sediment and that the groundwater may be influenced by local low permeability units. Combined spatial, statistical and chemical analysis shows that, while trace or low levels of methane, <1 mg/L, are found ubiquitously throughout the Maritimes Basin, elevated concentrations, >1 mg/L, are associated with the Horton Group, consistent with it being the host and inferred source of ONG resources in the province. The highest methane concentrations (14-29 mg/L) were detected in the region with a complex history of cycles of uplift and erosion which, in some locations, resulted in the juxtaposition at the surface of the Horton Group with several other groups of the Maritimes Basin. It is thought that proximity to the Horton Group can lead to naturally high methane concentrations in non-ONG-bearing units. Copyright (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Biodegradable plastic is a promising alternative to conventional plastic. However, biodegradable plastics must be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that they undergo complete degradation and have no adverse impact on the environment. We evaluated the degradation of biodegradable plastics during 18-week full-scale composting, and determined whether additives from the plastics are released upon degradation. Two biodegradable plastic films-one containing polybutylene co-adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT) and the other containing polylactic acid/poly-hydroxy-alkanoate (PLA/PHA)-were placed into meshbags and buried in the compost. Degradation was assessed by image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, electrophoretic mobility, delta C-13 isotope analyses, and single particle mass spectrometry of mulch fragments. The results showed >99% macroscopic degradation of PLA/PHA and 97% for PBAT film. Polymers in the biodegradable films degraded; however, micro- and nanoparticles, most likely carbon black, were observed on the meshbags. Overall, biodegradable plastics hold promise, but the release of micro- and nanoparticles from biodegradable plastic upon degradation warrants additional investigation and calls for longer field testing to ensure that either complete biodegradation occurs or that no long-term harm to the environment is caused.

Using 15 regeneration areas (from 4 to 30 years) and nine areas of mature forest, we assessed how tree seedling assemblage responds to time of abandonment and forest cover in terms of species diversity and taxonomic composition. We found that species diversity of seedlings responded positively to time of abandonment, but was not influence by forest cover. Diversity of rare and common species (D-0 and D-1, respectively) but not dominant species (D-2) increased with time of abandonment, reaching reference values very quickly (ca. 20 years). However, species composition seemed to respond to both ageing of forest stand and landscape structure represented by forest cover. Our findings reinforce that in human-dominated landscapes, local processes related to recovery with time should be more important for plant community assembly than landscape structure, leading to a number of possibilities for multiple successional pathways. in Portuguese is available with online material.

Infection at an ecotone: cross-system foraging increases satellite parasites but decreases core parasites in raccoons	ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						beach; California; ecotone; parasite; Procyon lotor; species richness	PROCYON-LOTOR; HELMINTH-PARASITES; ACANTHOCEPHALA; BIODIVERSITY; TREMATODES; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; HOSTS; EDGE	Ecotones can increase free-living species richness, but little is known about how parasites respond to ecotones. Here, we use parasite communities in raccoons (Procyon lotor) to test the hypothesis that parasite communities can be divided into core and satellite species, each with fundamentally different responses to ecotones. We used published parasite surveys to classify parasites as common core or rare satellite species, and then surveyed raccoons in coastal California to examine how proximity to two aquatic ecotones altered parasite communities. Raccoons near ecotones had more satellite and fewer core parasite species. Specifically, the marine ecotone increased parasite diversity by adding satellite species to a persistent core community, whereas the freshwater ecotone shifted the community from core to satellite species without a net change in parasite richness. We hypothesize that increased parasite richness at the marine ecotone resulted from increased diet diversity, but that raccoons were sinks for some parasites. Increased exposure to rare parasites at ecotones has implications for wildlife health and provides insight into observed associations between ecotones and emerging disease.

Anthropogenic N deposition, fungal gene expression, and an increasing soil carbon sink in the Northern Hemisphere	ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						anthropogenic N deposition; biogeochemical feedback; fungal peroxidase; gene expression; microbial decay; soil C storage	ATMOSPHERIC NITRATE DEPOSITION; CHRONIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION; NO3-DEPOSITION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; LIGNIN PEROXIDASE; ORGANIC-MATTER; FERTILIZATION; RESPONSES; CO2; RESPIRATION	Terrestrial ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere are a globally important sink for anthropogenic CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, slowing its accumulation as well as the pace of climate warming. With the use of a long-term field experiment (ca. 20 yr), we show that the expression of fungal class II peroxidase genes, which encode enzymes mediating the rate-limiting step of organic matter decay, are significantly downregulated (-60 to -80%) because of increases in anthropogenic N deposition; this response was consistent with a decline in extracellular peroxidase enzyme activity in soil, the slowing of organic-matter decay, and greater soil C storage. The reduction in peroxidase expression we document here occurred in the absence of a compositional shift in metabolically active fungi, indicating that an overall reduction in peroxidase expression underlies the slowing of decay and increases in soil C storage. This molecular mechanism has global implications for soil C storage and should be represented in coupled climate-biogeochemical models simulating the influence of enhanced terrestrial C storage on atmospheric CO2 and the future climate of an N-enriched Earth.

Why do earlier-arriving migratory birds have better breeding success?	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						arrival dates; demography; laying dates; migration; phenology; productivity; reproductive success	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NEST PREDATION; SEASONAL DECLINES; PATTERNS; DATE; SURVIVAL; PERFORMANCE; PHENOLOGY; CLIMATE; AGE	In migratory birds, early arrival on breeding sites is typically associated with greater breeding success, but the mechanisms driving these benefits are rarely known. One mechanism through which greater breeding success among early arrivers can potentially be achieved is the increased time available for replacement clutches following nest loss. However, the contribution of replacement clutches to breeding success will depend on seasonal variation in nest survival rates, and the consequences for juvenile recruitment of hatching at different times in the season. In particular, lower recruitment rates of late-hatched chicks could offset the benefits to early arrivers of being able to lay replacement clutches, which would reduce the likelihood of replacement clutch opportunities influencing selection on migratory timings. Using a simulation model of time-constrained capacity for replacement clutches, paramaterized with empirically-derived estimates from avian migratory systems, we show that greater reproductive success among early-arriving individuals can arise solely through the greater time capacity for replacement clutches among early arrivers, even when later renesting attempts contribute fewer recruits to the population. However, these relationships vary depending on the seasonal pattern of nest survival. The benefits of early arrival are greatest when nest survival rates are constant or decline seasonally, and early arrival is least beneficial when nest success rates increase over the breeding season, although replacement clutches can mitigate this effect. The time benefits of early arrival facilitating replacement clutches following nest loss may therefore be an important but overlooked source of selection on migratory timings. Empirical measures of seasonal variation in nest survival, renesting, and juvenile recruitment rates are therefore needed in order to identify the costs and benefits associated with individual migration phenology, the selection pressures influencing migratory timings, and the implications for ongoing shifts in migration and breeding phenology.

Assessing the role of off-take and source-sink dynamics in the extinction of the amphidromous New Zealand grayling (Prototroctes oxyrhynchus)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						dispersal; freshwater fish; metapopulation; population dynamics	INFER SPECIES EXTINCTIONS; RAPID EXTINCTION; SIGHTING RECORDS; FISHES; BIODIVERSITY; FUTURE	Some extinctions have obvious drivers (e.g. over-harvesting), while others can be less obvious and arise from multiple interacting factors. The extinction of the New Zealand grayling (Prototroctes oxyrhynchus) has been blamed on over-fishing and predation by introduced trout, but these explanations fail to account for the species disappearance from isolated, uninvaded rivers. We investigated if source-sink dynamics, facilitated by P. oxyrhynchus's amphidromous dispersal habit, could account for the species' rapid extinction. We created a database of P. oxyrhynchus sightings by surveying newspapers dating back to 1839, along with a review of traditional scientific literature. We used this database to update P. oxyrhynchus's known distribution map and inform sighting models to predict P. oxyrhynchus's extinction date. Finally, we implemented a meta-population model to explore how source-sink dynamics could interact with off-take (over-fishing or predation) to drive extinction. Prototroctes oxyrhynchus was found across New Zealand, except the north of the North Island. Based on sightings methods, the earliest predicted extinction date was 1924, although the species may have persisted until 1972, later than previous estimates have suggested. In the absence of source-sink dynamics, relatively high levels of off-take were sustainable (up to 30% per generation). When the species was modelled as a panmictic meta-population including 5% sink habitats, the sustainable off-take rate was reduced to as low as 5% per generation. Prototroctes oxyrhynchus was a widespread, abundant species that underwent rapid declines and ultimately went extinct. Previous attempts to explain this extinction have failed to account for the species extinction from isolated, pristine rivers. Our modelling shows that treating the species as a panmictic metapopulation and including source-sink dynamics rapidly increases the probability of extinction. We suggest that source-sink dynamics may be an important aspect of the population dynamics of amphidromous species and should be considered when managing taxa with similar dispersal habits.

Stronger effects of litter origin on the processing of conifer than broadleaf leaves: A test of home-field advantage of stream litter breakdown	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						exotic litter; litter quality; microbes; resource specialisation; shredders	ORGANIC-MATTER INPUTS; LEAF-LITTER; HEADWATER STREAMS; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; PLANT LITTER; DECOMPOSITION; RIPARIAN; COMMUNITIES	Ecological shifts that enhance the efficiency of resource acquisition by consumers can affect the fate of resource subsidies in recipient ecosystems. To date, findings have been mixed about whether plant litter breakdown by stream decomposers is faster in locations where the litter originates from (i.e. home region) compared with other locations (away region). This phenomenon, known as home-field advantage (HFA), may be influenced by litter quality and particularly decomposer groups (shredders versus microbes), rather than being an inherent consequence of the breakdown of locally native litter. We studied the effects of HFA on litter breakdown and litter-associated communities in streams within mid- to late-successional forests. Two pairs of riparian broadleaf and one pair of conifer litter species with contrasting chemical quality were reciprocally incubated across two temperate regions (similar to 3,000 km apart). Species in each pair are congeneric and allopatric. The HFA was assessed using within-pair litter comparisons in home and away regions. Coarse- and fine-mesh litterbags were used to separate the contributions to litter breakdown by microbial decomposition and shredder feeding. Conifer litter species used in this study were more recalcitrant than broadleaf litter species. Consequently, there was a significant positive HFA for the microbial decomposition of conifer litter. In contrast, there was no HFA for either microbial or shredder-mediated breakdown of broadleaf litter, which might have been overridden by catchment-scale differences in biophysical variables affecting breakdown. The effects of HFA on shredder colonisation and feeding on broadleaf litter were more variable among streams. Numerically abundant shredder taxa tended to have higher rates of colonisation and consumption on higher-quality litter than on low-quality litter, irrespective of litter origin. Our results suggest that prior (evolutionary and/or contemporary) litter exposure could strongly influence the litter-processing capacity of microbial decomposers, but not shredders, at the community level. In particular, microbial decomposers specialised in degrading conifer litter probably had lower resource-use plasticity than those processing broadleaf litter. Inter-stream differences in riparian vegetation and habitat conditions could influence the HFA through altering the litter exposure history of decomposer communities. Our findings highlight the importance of prior litter-microbe interactions in determining the rates of microbial decomposition of native and exotic litter species.	[Yeung, Alex C.

Richness patterns of sub-groups within a taxon are usually assumed to be driven by similar processes. However, if richness of distinct ecological strategies respond differently to the same processes, inferences made for an entire taxon may be misleading. We deconstruct the global lizard assemblage into functional groups and examine the congruence among richness patterns between them. We further examine the species richness - functional richness relationship to elucidate the way functional diversity contributes to the overall species richness patterns. Location Global. Methods Using comprehensive biological trait databases we classified the global lizard assemblage into ecological strategies based on body size, diet, activity times and microhabitat preferences, using Archetypal Analysis. We then examined spatial gradients in the richness of each strategy at the one-degree grid cell, biome, and realm scales. Results We found that lizards can best be characterized by seven "ecological strategies": scansorial, terrestrial, nocturnal, herbivorous, fossorial, large, and semi-aquatic. There are large differences among the global richness patterns of these strategies. While the major richness hotspot for lizards in general is in Australia, several strategies exhibit highest richness in the Amazon Basin. Importantly, the global maximum in lizard species richness is achieved at intermediate values of functional diversity and increasing functional diversity further result in a slow decline of species richness. Main conclusions The deconstruction of the global lizard assemblage along multiple ecological axes offers a new way to conceive lizard diversity patterns. It suggests that local lizard richness mostly increases when species belonging to particular ecological strategies become hyper-diverse there, and not because more ecological types are present in the most species rich localities. Thus maximum richness and maximum ecological diversity do not overlap. These results shed light on the global richness pattern of lizards, and highlight previously unidentified spatial patterns in understudied functional groups.

However, sampling only the stem base is likely to result in underestimation of forest epiphyte diversity, because microclimate and physico-chemical site conditions, both of which vary with height above the ground, play important roles for poikilohydric organisms. We investigate variation in epiphyte diversity and composition along the vertical gradient in forests and discuss factors that may potentially account for height-dependent distribution patterns. Location Montane primeval beech forest Havesova in the Carpathians, eastern Slovakia. Methods Ten circular plots, each 500 m(2), were selected randomly in an area severely affected by windfall. Epiphytes were sampled along the stems of recently uprooted trees, from base to the canopy. Mean Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for light, moisture, acidity and nitrogen availability were used as surrogate variables for environmental interpretation of compositional patterns for sampling segments of 2 m along the stem. Results By sampling only the lowest 2 m, 10% of the total bryophyte and 48% of the lichen species would have been missed. We detected systematic patterns of compositional variation for both groups along the vertical gradient. While pleurocarpous mosses and liverworts were mostly restricted to the stem base, acrocarpous mosses and crustose lichens occurred along the stem almost to the top. Foliose and fruticose lichens were concentrated at intermediate heights and in the upper canopy. Patterns of variation in EIVs suggested that increasing light availability, decreasing moisture and increasing inputs of acidic and nitrous substances are responsible for the compositional shifts along the vertical gradient. Conclusions Sampling only the stem base implies severe underestimation of the epiphyte diversity in temperate broad-leaved forests. The middle and the upper parts of tree stems have distinctive compositions of epiphytic cryptogams, because microclimate and physico-chemical site factors vary with height above the ground.

The trait differences between invasives and non-invasives can inform on which traits confer invasibility. Here, we ask: (a) are invasive species functionally different or similar to native species? (b) which traits of invasives differ from traits of non-invasive aliens and thus confer invasibility? and (c) do results from the sub-Antarctic region, where this study was conducted, differ from findings from other regions? Location Sub-Antarctic Marion Island. Methods We measured 13 traits of all terrestrial native, invasive and non-invasive alien plant species. Using principal components analysis and phylogenetic generalized least-squares models, we tested for differences in traits between invasive (widespread alien species) and native species. Bivariate trait relationships between invasive and native species were compared using standardized major axis regressions to test for differences in trait trade-offs between the two groups. Second, using the same methods, we compared the traits of invasive species to non-invasive aliens (alien species that have not spread). Results Between invasive and native species, most traits differed, suggesting that the success of invasive species is mediated by being functionally different to native species. Additionally, most bivariate trait relationships differed either in terms of their y-intercept or their position on the axes, highlighting that plants are positioned differently along a spectrum of shared trait trade-offs. Compared to non-invasive aliens, invasive species had lower plant height, smaller leaf area, lower frost tolerance, and higher specific leaf area, suggesting that these traits are associated with invasiveness. The findings for the sub-Antarctic corresponded to those of other regions, except lower plant height which provides a competitive advantage to invaders in the windy sub-Antarctic context. Conclusion Our findings support the expectation that trait complexes of invasive species are predominantly different to those of coexisting native species, and that high resource acquisition and low defence investment are characteristic of invasive plant species.

HYMENOPTERA; VESPULA-VULGARIS; CONTROL REGION; COMMON WASPS; NATURAL-SELECTION; SIZE VARIATION; DNA; EVOLUTION; POPULATION; VESPIDAE	Despite the mitochondrion's long-recognized role in energy production, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation commonly found in natural populations was assumed to be effectively neutral. However, variation in mtDNA has now been increasingly linked to phenotypic variation in life history traits and fitness. We examined whether the relative fitness in native and invasive common wasp (Vespula vulgaris) populations in Belgium and New Zealand (NZ), respectively, can be linked to mtDNA variation. Social wasp colonies in NZ were smaller with comparatively fewer queen cells, indicating a reduced relative fitness in the invaded range. Interestingly, queen cells in this population were significantly larger leading to larger queen offspring. By sequencing 1,872 bp of the mitochondrial genome, we determined mitochondrial haplotypes and detected reduced genetic diversity in NZ. Three common haplotypes in NZ frequently produced many queens, whereas the four rare haplotypes produced significantly fewer or no queens. The entire mitochondrial genome for each of these haplotypes was sequenced to identify polymorphisms associated with fitness reduction. We found 16 variable sites; however, no nonsynonymous mutation that was clearly causing impaired mitochondrial function was detected. We discuss how detected variants may alter secondary structures, gene expression or mito-nuclear interactions, or could be associated with nuclear-encoded variation. Whatever the ultimate mechanism, we show reduced fitness and mtDNA variation in an invasive wasp population as well as specific mtDNA variants associated with fitness variation within this population. Ours is one of only a few studies that confirm fitness impacts of mtDNA variation in wild nonmodel populations.	[Dobelmann, Jana; Baty, James W.; Gruber, Monica A.

Moreover, shrimp populations in different watersheds are known to be connected in an island-wide metapopulation. However, low-head dams paired with water intakes on streams draining the El Yunque National Forest (EYNF) reduce streamflow. Here, we examine the cumulative effects of low-head dams on shrimp habitat connectivity over 37 years across seven EYNF watersheds. We calculate total and refugia habitat connectivity (where refugia habitat is defined as predator-free upstream reaches above waterfalls >5 m in height) at a monthly time step using a habitat-weighted index of longitudinal riverine connectivity, which incorporates location and operation of water intakes and streamflow variability. Findings indicate total and refugia habitat connectivity declined over 37 years (by 27% and 16%, respectively) as additional water intakes have been placed in lower reaches of watersheds. On a monthly time step, the proportion of streamflow withdrawn has the largest effect on habitat connectivity, with the result that connectivity is similar to 17% lower during drought years than in nondrought years and similar to 7% lower in dry compared with wet seasons. Our analysis of this long-term dataset highlights how cumulative effects of low-head dams paired with water intakes have reduced shrimp habitat connectivity. These results underscore the importance of reducing existing withdrawal rates in EYNF, and locating intakes where effects on connectivity are minimal, if conserving shrimp habitat is a management objective.

While multiple studies have focused on the calling activity patterns of prolonged breeding assemblages, species that concentrate their reproduction in short-time windows, explosive breeders, are still largely unknown, probably because of their ephemeral nature. In tropical regions, multiple species of explosive breeders may simultaneously aggregate leading to massive, mixed and dynamic choruses. To understand the environmental triggers, the phenology and composition of these choruses, we collected acoustic and environmental data at five ponds in French Guiana during a rainy season, assessing acoustic communities before and during explosive breeding events. Results: We detected in each pond two explosive breeding events, lasting between 24 and 70h. The rainfall during the previous 48h was the most important factor predicting the emergence of these events. During explosive breeding events, we identified a temporal factor that clearly distinguished pre- and mid-explosive communities. A common pool of explosive breeders co-occurred in most of the events, namely Chiasmocleis shudikarensis, Trachycephalus coriaceus and Ceratophrys cornuta. Nevertheless, the species composition was remarkably variable between ponds and for each pond between the first and the second events. The acoustic structure of explosive breeding communities had outlying levels of amplitude and unexpected low acoustic diversity, significantly lower than the communities preceding explosive breeding events. Conclusions: Explosive breeding communities were tightly linked with specific rainfall patterns. With climate change increasing rainfall variability in tropical regions, such communities may experience significant shifts in their timing, distribution and composition. In structurally similar habitats, located in the same region without obvious barriers, our results highlight the variation in composition across explosive breeding events. The characteristic acoustic structure of explosive breeding events stands out from the circadian acoustic environment being easily detected at long distance, probably reflecting behavioural singularities and conveying heterospecific information announcing the availability of short-lived breeding sites. Our data provides a baseline against which future changes, possibly linked to climate change, can be measured, contributing to a better understanding on the causes, patterns and consequences of these unique assemblages.

Multi-scale habitat modelling identifies spatial conservation priorities for mainland clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa)	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article; Early Access						clouded leopard; conservation planning; deforestation; multi-scale modelling; Neofelis diardi; Neofelis nebulosa; spatial conservation prioritization; threatened and endangered species	CAMERA-TRAP; FOREST; SELECTION; SCALE; ECOLOGY; RANGE; CAT; CONNECTIVITY; LANDSCAPE; DENSITY	Aim Deforestation is rapidly altering Southeast Asian landscapes, resulting in some of the highest rates of habitat loss worldwide. Among the many species facing declines in this region, clouded leopards rank notably for their ambassadorial potential and capacity to act as powerful levers for broader forest conservation programmes. Thus, identifying core habitat and conservation opportunities are critical for curbing further Neofelis declines and extending umbrella protection for diverse forest biota similarly threatened by widespread habitat loss. Furthermore, a recent comprehensive habitat assessment of Sunda clouded leopards (N. diardi) highlights the lack of such information for the mainland species (N. nebulosa) and facilitates a comparative assessment. Location Southeast Asia. Methods Species-habitat relationships are scale-dependent, yet <5% of all recent habitat modelling papers apply robust approaches to optimize multivariate scale relationships. Using one of the largest camera trap datasets ever collected, we developed scale-optimized species distribution models for two con-generic carnivores, and quantitatively compared their habitat niches. Results We identified core habitat, connectivity corridors, and ranked remaining habitat patches for conservation prioritization. Closed-canopy forest was the strongest predictor, with similar to 25% lower Neofelis detections when forest cover declined from 100 to 65%. A strong, positive association with increasing precipitation suggests ongoing climate change as a growing threat along drier edges of the species' range. While deforestation and land use conversion were deleterious for both species, N. nebulosa was uniquely associated with shrublands and grasslands. We identified 800 km(2) as a minimum patch size for supporting clouded leopard conservation. Main conclusions We illustrate the utility of multi-scale modelling for identifying key habitat requirements, optimal scales of use and critical targets for guiding conservation prioritization. Curbing deforestation and development within remaining core habitat and dispersal corridors, particularly in Myanmar, Laos and Malaysia, is critical for supporting evolutionary potential of clouded leopards and conservation of associated forest biodiversity.

Land-use change increases climatic vulnerability of migratory birds: Insights from integrated population modelling	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						band-recovery data; climate change; habitat loss; integrative modelling; mortality; reproduction; wetland habitat	DUCK NEST SUCCESS; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; HABITAT LOSS; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; IMPACT; CONSEQUENCES; PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY	Knowledge of land-use patterns that could affect animal population resiliency or vulnerability to environmental threats such as climate change is essential, yet the interactive effects of land use and climate on demography across space and time can be difficult to study. This is particularly true for migratory species, which rely on different landscapes throughout the year. Unlike most North American migratory waterfowl, populations of northern pintails (Anas acuta; hereafter pintails) have not recovered since the 1980s despite extended periods of abundant flooded wetlands (i.e. ponds). The mechanisms and drivers involved in this discrepancy remain poorly understood. While pintails are similar to other ducks in their dependence on ponds throughout their annual cycle, their extensive use of croplands for nesting differentiates them and makes them particularly vulnerable to changes in agricultural land use on prairie breeding grounds. Our intent was to quantify how changes in land use and ponds on breeding grounds have influenced pintail population dynamics by developing an integrated population model to analyse over five decades (1961-2014) of band-recovery, breeding population survey, land-use and pond count data. We focused especially on the interactive effects of pond counts and land use on pintail productivity, while accounting for density-dependent processes. Pintail populations responded more strongly to annual variation in productivity than survival. Productivity was positively correlated with pond count and negatively correlated with agricultural intensification. Further, a positive interaction between pond count and agricultural intensification was insufficient to overcome the strong negative effect of agricultural intensification on pintail productivity across nearly all pond counts. The interaction also indicated that pintail populations were more negatively impacted by the decrease in ponds associated with climate change under higher agricultural intensification. Our results indicate that pintail populations have become more vulnerable to climate change under intensified land use, which suggests that future conservation strategies must adapt to these altered relationships. The interactive effects of land use and climate on demography should be considered more frequently in animal ecology, and integrated population models provide an adaptable framework to understand vital rates and their drivers simultaneously.

Drought-Induced, Punctuated Loss of Freshwater Mussels Alters Ecosystem Function Across Temporal Scales	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						mass mortality event; resource pulse; die-off; bivalve; freshwater mussel; drought; nutrient cycling	FLUMINEA DIE-OFFS; FLINT RIVER-BASIN; MASS MORTALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COASTAL-PLAIN; DECAY-RATES; UNIONIDAE; RESPONSES; BIVALVES; CONSERVATION	Punctuated, mass mortality events are increasing for many animal taxa and are often related to climatic extremes such as drought. Freshwater mussels are experiencing increased mass mortality events linked to hydrologic drought. Because mussels play important functional roles in rivers it is important to understand the ecosystem effects of these die-offs. Here, we address how mass mortality events of mussels caused by drought may impact stream ecosystem function. We first present a conceptual model, based on the literature, of how mussel mass mortality should affect different ecosystem functions across various ecological time scales, from hours to decades. Next, we highlight two case studies of drought-linked, mussel-mass mortality events from rivers in the southern U.S. We then present the results of an experiment we performed quantifying the ecosystem effects of a punctuated mussel die-off. Finally, we combine our experimental results with field data from a recent mussel die-off to predict how mussel losses will in fluence ecosystem function. Based on the presented case studies, our mesocosm experiment, and our extrapolated nutrient pulse due to a mussel die-off, we conclude that streamecosystems are extensively altered following mussel mass mortality events. Mussel loss is governed by drought severity, location within the river network, and species-specific drought tolerances. In the short term, decomposing carrion from mussel die-offs releases a large pulse of nutrients into the water which stimulates food web productivity. In the long term, the overall loss of mussel biomass, and the loss of functional traits as more sensitive species decline, leads to decreases in ecosystem function which may take decades to recover. Drought and human demand for water will make mussel die-offs more likely in the future and it is unlikely that drought sensitive species will recover without changes in water management and restoration of populations through mussel propagation. Our research provides an example of how the loss of an abundant, long-lived organism has cascading, and long-term impacts on ecosystems.

Impacts of long-term elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						biodiversity; climate change; elevated CO2; long-term experiments; microbial diversity; next-generation sequencing	TEMPERATE C3 GRASSLANDS; PERMANENT GRASSLAND; SPECIES RICHNESS; N2O EMISSIONS; CARBON FLOW; SOIL; ENRICHMENT; DIVERSITY; ROOTS; RESPONSES	The ecological impacts of long-term elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)) levels on soil microbiota remain largely unknown. This is particularly true for the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which form mutualistic associations with over two-thirds of terrestrial plant species and are entirely dependent on their plant hosts for carbon. Here, we use high-resolution amplicon sequencing (Illumina, HiSeq) to quantify the response of AM fungal communities to the longest running (>15 years) free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment in the Northern Hemisphere (GiFACE); providing the first evaluation of these responses from old-growth (>100 years) semi-natural grasslands subjected to a 20% increase in atmospheric CO2. eCO(2) significantly increased AM fungal richness but had a less-pronounced impact on the composition of their communities. However, while broader changes in community composition were not observed, more subtle responses of specific AM fungal taxa were with populations both increasing and decreasing in abundance in response to eCO(2). Most population-level responses to eCO(2) were not consistent through time, with a significant interaction between sampling time and eCO(2) treatment being observed. This suggests that the temporal dynamics of AM fungal populations may be disturbed by anthropogenic stressors. As AM fungi are functionally differentiated, with different taxa providing different benefits to host plants, changes in population densities in response to eCO(2) may significantly impact terrestrial plant communities and their productivity. Thus, predictions regarding future terrestrial ecosystems must consider changes both aboveground and belowground, but avoid relying on broad-scale community-level responses of soil microbes observed on single occasions.

Most speciation models for this region have focused on vicariant events, whereas the need to assess the influence of demographic processes has been recognized only recently. We evaluate if the origin of Andean montane lineages of terciopelo pitvipers is explained by either of two historical processes that represent distinct phylogeographic mechanisms: differentiation by isolation within the highlands or different dispersal events from the lowlands. Location Western Ecuador. Taxon Terciopelo pitvipers (Bothrops asper species complex). Methods We use genomic data and genetic clustering analyses, evaluation of historical migration between genetic clusters and demographic model selection to investigate recent diversification events in South America using a vertebrate group rarely explored in phylogeographic studies: tropical Andean snakes. Specifically, the origin of two Ecuadorian montane lineages of terciopelo pitvipers was evaluated given ambiguous phylogenetic relationships with the presumably ancestral Pacific lowland lineage. Results Discrepancies of evolutionary relationships previously obtained with tree-like methods are resolved through the use of modelling approaches. We found strong support for the independent origin of montane lineages based on topologies inferred by maximum-likelihood trees and modelling approaches that take into account possible gene flow. This suggests dispersal rather than in-situ differentiation as the most likely mechanism by which the montane linages originated. Main conclusions Recent large-scale studies have found support for identifying dispersal events as important drivers of diversification in the Neotropical region. We contribute to these ideas by identifying a fine-scale case in a rarely studied group of animals -Andean snakes- in which river valleys acted as an entrance for the upward colonization of montane dry habitats and subsequent ecological diversification.

The study analyzed the relationship between the 95(th) percentile maximum concentrations estimated by AERMOD and the percentages of low wind speed (LWS, 0.5-2 m/s) in the meteorological data used for the modeling. Statistical analysis showed that they were positively correlated within various distances to different types of emission sources. In addition, the LWS percentages of 1-y data could be used to predict the LWS percentages of 5-y data for the same station. Based on these results, the selection procedure for meteorological data began with the evaluation of 1-y data quality and LWS percentages for all the available stations in California, USA, counties with high use of a pesticide of interest. Five-year meteorological data were then processed for the top 5 stations with the highest LWS percentages to perform AERMOD modeling. Finally, the air concentration estimates of the modeled meteorological data were compared to determine the worst-case scenario data. This procedure provided a strategic plan for selecting meteorological data for AERMOD modeling of pesticide applications in California. The procedure was applied to the modeling of residential structural fumigations and determined that the 5-y (2011-2015) data of the weather station WBAN 93134 (downtown Los Angeles, University of Southern California campus) was the worst-case scenario meteorological data for this modeling case.

Nitrate addition stimulates microbial decomposition of organic matter in salt marsh sediments	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						16S rRNA gene; anaerobic respiration; decomposition; flow-through reactor; microbes; nitrate; organic matter; salt marsh	INLET MASS-SPECTROMETER; SULFATE REDUCTION; NEW-ENGLAND; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; NITROGEN-CYCLE; CARBON; DENITRIFICATION; RESPONSES; OXIDATION; RATES	Salt marshes sequester carbon at rates more than an order of magnitude greater than their terrestrial counterparts, helping to mitigate climate change. As nitrogen loading to coastal waters continues, primarily in the form of nitrate, it is unclear what effect it will have on carbon storage capacity of these highly productive systems. This uncertainty is largely driven by the dual role nitrate can play in biological processes, where it can serve as a nutrient-stimulating primary production or a thermodynamically favorable electron acceptor fueling heterotrophic metabolism. Here, we used a controlled flow-through reactor experiment to test the role of nitrate as an electron acceptor, and its effect on organic matter decomposition and the associated microbial community in salt marsh sediments. Organic matter decomposition significantly increased in response to nitrate, even at sediment depths typically considered resistant to decomposition. The use of isotope tracers suggests that this pattern was largely driven by stimulated denitrification. Nitrate addition also significantly altered the microbial community and decreased alpha diversity, selecting for taxa belonging to groups known to reduce nitrate and oxidize more complex forms of organic matter. Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy further supported these results, suggesting that nitrate facilitated decomposition of complex organic matter compounds into more bioavailable forms. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of organic matter pools that only become accessible with nitrate and would otherwise remain stabilized in the sediment. The existence of such pools could have important implications for carbon storage, since greater decomposition rates as N loading increases may result in less overall burial of organic-rich sediment. Given the extent of nitrogen loading along our coastlines, it is imperative that we better understand the resilience of salt marsh systems to nutrient enrichment, especially if we hope to rely on salt marshes, and other blue carbon systems, for long-term carbon storage.

We assess the influence of prey availability on the foraging performance of breeding African penguins Spheniscus demersus using data from instrumented birds during 14 pelagic fish surveys carried out over 3 years around their two largest breeding colonies, St Croix and Bird islands in Algoa Bay. Characteristics of prey fields targeted by African penguins were identified by assessing the response of foraging birds to the acoustically determined distribution of small pelagic fish. Path- and dive-derived foraging performance metrics were modelled as a response to overall and targeted prey abundance estimates to assess potential nonlinear functional relationships between penguin foraging effort and prey availability. African penguins displayed marked spatial heterogeneity in their selection of foraging sites, but birds from both colonies invariably foraged on fish schools Generalized additive model fits improved for all foraging performance responses when using targeted prey abundance (i.e. only fish in areas frequented by penguins and at depths <40 m, as opposed to estimates using all prey). Models for trip duration (r(2) = 0.45) and foraging path length (r(2) = 0.44) showed a negative nonlinear form in their response to targeted prey abundance, with significant improvement in penguin foraging effort when prey abundance was greater than 45% of the maximum prey biomass recorded. Synthesis and applications. Functional relationships between seabird foraging performance and prey supplies have the potential to inform the sustainable management of fisheries that compete for the same prey. Our findings highlight the importance of quantifying prey that is available to seabirds when assessing critical thresholds in prey abundance below which seabird foraging performance is adversely affected. These findings can be integrated into dynamic ocean management strategies to mitigate resource competition around seabird colonies. A framework for flexible, colony-centred closures is proposed as a more dynamic alternative to time/area closures with the potential to respond to prevailing habitat conditions in near real-time.

However, the patterns and causes of geographical variation in body size within bat species, especially within widespread hibernating species, are little known. Here, we evaluated the possible causes of geographical size variation patterns in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), a bat species widely distributed across the Palearctic. Location Palearctic. Methods We collected body size data (body mass and forearm length) from 1,172 adult bats via direct measurements or from the literature. We used high-resolution environmental data for the sampled sites. We applied multiple linear regressions and an information-theoretic approach on separate female and male datasets to estimate the support for various hypotheses. Results Temperature and latitude failed to predict body mass in both females and males. The best model showed that populations with longer forearms in both sexes were associated with higher mean temperatures (in the warmest quarter) and lower mean temperatures (in the coldest quarter). The independent contribution of these temperature parameters to forearm length in both sexes was higher than that of all other variables. Main conclusion The observed relationship between temperature and body mass was not consistent with James's rule, and thus failed to support the heat conservation hypothesis. Our results are consistent with the predictions of Allen's rule and indicated that direct heat dissipation from the wing may be the most likely mechanism underlying geographical variation in forearm length. We suggest that the evaluation of the relative importance of multiple causal mechanisms may improve our understanding of patterns of geographical variation in endotherms.

Fruit bats have played a role in woodland dynamics via pollination and seed dispersal. We hypothesized that phylogeographic patterns of Rousettus on continental Africa and adjacent islands should show a signature of pluvial-drought cycles, involving demographic expansions and contractions. Location Afrotropical, Malagasy and Saharo-Arabian biogeographic realms. Taxon Genus Rousettus (Pteropodidae). Methods Phylogeographic and population genetic approaches using mitochondrial and microsatellite data were integrated with species distribution modelling of currently suitable habitats and those of the Last Glacial Maximum using climate simulations. Results Phylogenetic reconstruction yielded an Asian outgroup followed by pectinate branching of the Indian Ocean taxa and Rousettus aegyptiacus. While nuclear microsatellites were homogeneous across the African mainland, two mitochondrial haplogroups were found. Haplogroup I is widespread in regions with extensive tree cover, including tropical rain forests, and has close relationships to isolated lineages in the Middle East and islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Haplogroup II is sister to the rest of the R. aegyptiacus radiation and is found in eastern and southern Africa and the Sudanian savanna in habitats with semi-open land cover. Main Conclusion Palaeodistributional modelling ascertained that the Indian Ocean islands provided more extensive areas of suitable habitat in the past relative to conditions today, suggesting stepping stone connectivity between Asia and Africa during Pleistocene interpluvial sea-level lowstands. Inverse pluvial-drought demography was detected in lineages ancestral to recent haplogroups, providing evidence of past forest refugia and complex ecogeographic scenarios of haplogroup origins involving allopatry and parapatry connected with the eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot, and subsequent admixture of nuclear gene pools. The Middle Eastern lineage probably originated during pluvial green Sahara periods, possibly in co-evolution with ancestors of tree crop species domesticated later during the Neolithic revolution. The keystone role of rousettine bats for forest regeneration and their ability to pioneer dry and distant habitats emphasize their role in conservation biology and restoration ecology.

In few cases, however, has it been demonstrated that feeding nestlings by helpers, rather than some other behavior associated with helpers' presence, leads to greater reproductive success. One prediction of the hypothesis that feeding behavior per se is responsible for the fitness benefits conferred by helpers is that there should be close congruence between the patterns of helping-at-the-nest and the fitness effects of helpers. Here we look for such a relationship in the cooperatively breeding acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) in order to begin to identify the behaviors of helpers that drive the increased fitness benefits they confer. In terms of young fledged, a helper male confers approximately the same fitness benefits to a group as does a helper female; more dramatically, the effects of helpermales increases with increasing food supply, most importantly the prior year's acorn crop on which this species depends, whereas that of helper females does not. These patterns do not match the nest-feeding patterns of helpers, which are greater for females than males and do not increase with a larger acorn crop the prior autumn. In contrast, the proportion of time helpers spend tending acorn-storage facilities (granaries) and are present in or near their home territory is greater formales than females and, at least formales, positively related to the size of the acorn crop. These results fail to support the hypothesis that the primary benefit conferred by helpers is feeding young in the nest; rather, they suggest that behaviors such as territorial defense and predator detection are more important. Understanding exactly what those behaviors are in this, and most other cooperatively breeding systems, remain to be determined.

Through major ex situ conservation efforts, there are 158 whooping cranes managed in North American institutions and chicks are released annually into the wild. Current reintroduction goals for the whooping crane however, are impeded by poor reproduction within the ex situ population, in part because of low egg fertility. Development of improved management techniques to overcome low egg fertility requires a better understanding of factors that influence egg fertility. We collected data for eggs laid at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center from 2005-2014 (n = 438 eggs; n = 23 pairs). We constructed 5 sets of generalized linear mixed-models, with a Bernoulli-distributed response variable (fertile or infertile), to address the effects of egg-specific variables (month laid, sequence, and clutch order of the egg), life-history events of the male and female (age, rearing method, wing condition, age at first pairing, age at current pairing, and female age at first laying), pair-specific characteristics (kinship, years paired, chick-rearing experience, and previous pairings), and captive management decisions (inclusion in the artificial insemination program and pair experience chick-rearing) on the probability of egg fertility. Our results indicate that female-specific factors (especially age, age at current pairing, and wing status) and pair-specific factors of kinship, chick-rearing experience, copulation, and inclusion in the artificial insemination program influenced fertile egg production. Specifically, the younger a female is when paired with her current social mate, the higher probability that her eggs will be fertile. Furthermore, high kinship reduced fertility, whereas chick-rearing experience and artificial insemination of females with a donor male other than her social mate increased fertility. Further research on mate selection and reproductive mechanisms is needed to better understand egg laying and egg fertility in the whooping crane.

Here we compare long-term records of wet deposition loadings of total Hg (THg) in the open to dry deposition loadings of THg in throughfall and litterfall under four boreal mixedwood canopy types at the remote Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. We also present long-term records of atmospheric concentrations of gaseous elemental (GEM), gaseous oxidized (GOM), and particle bound (PBM) Hg measured at the ELA. We show that dry THg loadings in throughfall and litterfall are 2.7 to 6.1 times greater than wet THg loadings in the open. GEM concentrations showed distinct monthly and daily patterns, correlating positively in spring and summer with rates of gross ecosystem productivity and respiration. GOM and PBM concentrations were less variable throughout the year but were highest in the winter, when concentrations of anthropogenically sourced particles and gases were also high. Forest fires, Arctic air masses, and road salt also impacted GEM, GOM, and PBM concentrations at the ELA. A nested GEOS-Chem simulation for the ELA region produced a dry/wet deposition ratio of >5, suggesting that the importance of dry deposition in forested regions can be reasonably modeled by existing schemes for trace gases.

Suspect Screening of Hydrocarbon Surfactants in AFFFs and AFFF-Contaminated Groundwater by High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ALKYLPHENOL ETHOXYLATE METABOLITES; WASTE-WATER; NONIONIC SURFACTANTS; DEGRADATION-PRODUCTS; POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; ANAEROBIC BIODEGRADATION; ENVIRONMENTAL OCCURRENCE; EMERGING CONTAMINANTS; ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS	Aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) are proprietary mixtures containing hydrocarbon surfactants and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that are used to extinguish hydrocarbonbased fuel fires. There is limited information on hydrocarbon surfactants in AFFFs and AFFF-contaminated groundwater even though hydrocarbon surfactants are more abundant (5-10% w/w) than PFASs (0.9-1.5% w/w) in AFFFs. Eight commercial AFFFs manufactured between 1988 and 2012 and 10 AFFF-contaminated groundwaters collected from near source zones of fire-fighter training areas were analyzed for suspect hydrocarbon surfactants by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A suspect list and a homologous series detection computational tool, enviMass, were combined to screen for hydrocarbon surfactants. Nine classes of hydrocarbon surfactants were detected in AFFFs including octylphenol polyethoxylates, linear alcohol ethoxylates, ethoxylated cocoamines, alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl amido dipropionates, linear alkyl benzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and polyethylene glycols. Of those, six were also found in groundwater along with diethanolamines and alkyl amido betaines, which were not found in the eight archived AFFFs. This indicates that although aerobically biodegradable, hydrocarbon surfactants likely persist in groundwater due to anaerobic aquifer conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first screening for hydrocarbon surfactants in AFFFs and in AFFF-contaminated groundwater.

Traces of a Neonicotinoid Induce Precocious Foraging and Reduce Foraging Performance in Honey Bees	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MELLIFERA HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; CHRONIC EXPOSURE; BEHAVIORAL-DEVELOPMENT; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; PESTICIDE-RESIDUES; INSECTICIDES; FAILURE; MODEL; OCTOPAMINE; BEEHAVE	There is increasing worldwide concern about the impacts of pesticide residues on honey bees and bee colony survival, but how sublethal effects of pesticides on bees might cause colony failure remains highly controversial, with field data giving very mixed results. To explore how trace levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid impacted colony foraging performance, we equipped bees with RFID tags that allowed us to track their lifetime flight behavior. One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 mu g/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance. Our data suggest that neonicotinoids could impact colony function by imbalancing the normal age based division of labor in a colony and reducing foraging efficiency. Understanding this mechanism will help the development of interventions to safeguard bee colony health.

However, large-scale exposures are still very rare due to prohibitive costs, the availability of replicated habitats, and the potential for exposure to cause lasting damage to the environment. Here, we evaluated the viability of internal slow-release implants as an alternative method for manipulating CEC exposures in aquatic wildlife using two fat-based carriers (coconut oil and vegetable shortening). We treated roach (Rutilus rutilus) with implants containing a high (50 mu g/g), low (25 mu g/g), or control (0 mu g/g) concentration of the behavior-modifying pharmaceutical oxazepam. We then measured oxazepam uptake in four tissues (plasma, muscle, liver, and the brain) over 1 month. The two carriers released oxazepam differently: coconut oil was the superior implant type because it delivered a more consistent dose across time, while vegetable shortening released oxazepam rapidly at the start of the exposure period. For both carriers and treatments, the brain and liver contained the most oxazepam. Overall, the method is a promising technique for controlled manipulations of pharmaceuticals in fish, and we have provided some of the first data on the suitability and contaminant release kinetics from different implant types.

Importance of Species Sorting and Immigration on the Bacterial Assembly of Different-Sized Aggregates in a Full-Scale Aerobic Granular Sludge Plant	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; BACTERIOPLANKTON; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; RARE; QUANTIFICATION; BIOREACTORS	In aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems, different-sized microbial aggregates having different solids retention time (SRT) coexist in the same reactor compartment and are subjected to the same influent wastewater. Thus, the AGS system provides a unique ecosystem to study the importance of local (species sorting) and regional (immigration) processes in bacterial community assembly. The microbial communities of different-sized aggregates (flocs <0.2 mm, small granules (0.2-1.0 mm) and large granules >1.0 mm), influent wastewater, excess sludge and effluent of a full-scale AGS plant were characterized over a steady-state operation period of 6 months. Amplicon sequencing was integrated with mass balance to determine the SRT and net growth rate of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We found strong evidence of species sorting as opposed to immigration, which was significantly higher at short SRT (i.e., flocs and small granules) than that at long SRT (large granules). Rare OTUs in wastewater belonging to putative functional groups responsible for nitrogen and phosphorus removal were progressively enriched with an increase in microbial aggregates size. In contrast, fecal- and sewage infrastructure-derived microbes progressively decreased in relative abundance with increase in microbial aggregate size. These findings highlight the importance of AGS as a unique model ecosystem to study fundamental microbial ecology concepts.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been introduced as an appropriate tool in precision farming, due to their affordability and high-spatial resolution data. The potential of plant height and vegetation indices derived from UAV-based RGB imagery at 12-leaf growth stage (V12) is investigated for prediction of corn forage yield. Using the structure from motion techniques, the crop height model (CHM) was created by subtracting crop surface model from digital elevation model. Next, by evaluating the CHM using ground measurements of plant height, it was shown that UAV imagery provides high capability in modeling the plant height (R-2 = 0.85). Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) between variables showed that the plant height had the highest correlation with forage yield (R = 0.84). Furthermore, among the vegetation indices, visible atmospherically resistant index with R = 0.77, normalized difference index with R = 0.75, and excess red with R = 0.74 were better than other indices. Finally, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model was constructed using plant height and vegetation indices to predict forage yield. The beta regression coefficients of the PLSR model were used to identify the most relevant predictors, and the final PLSR model was rebuilt with relevant predictors. The PLSR analysis confirmed that the plant height was the most important predictor, although integrating the vegetation indices in the PLSR model has slightly improved the prediction model (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.316 kg/m(2), and relative RMSE = 12.39%), compared to the model that used only plant height (R-2 = 0.702, RMSE = 0.339 kg/m(2), and relative RMSE = 13.29%). Overall, these results indicate that the UAV-based images are efficient and cost-effective data to predict corn forage yield as well as plant height modeling.

This relationship is an important aspect in soil functioning, with soil fungi acting as primary agents in decomposition processes. Being one of the most abundant groups among soil fauna, springtails can play a leading role in this context. Despite several previous studies on their epigeous fungal grazing behavior, data regarding the relationship between springtails and truffles are scarce. This study aimed to investigate food preferences of the springtail Folsomia candida for grazing on 12 different species of truffles, 11 belonging to Tuber genus, and 1 to Balsamia genus. We also evaluated how strongly this diet influences survival and reproduction of F candida. In the first experiment, F candida were allowed to choose freely between a cereal mixture (choice test) and 12 different species of truffle. In the second experiment, they were fed on the truffles only (no-choice test) for 28 days. Twelve truffle species were analyzed for survival and reproduction of F candida. F candida's feeding preference evolved over 72 h, beginning with a strong preference for the control and finally a general preference for truffles. Moreover, Collembola that fed on some Tuber species had a lower survival rate and fewer juveniles per adult compared to the control. Compared to other species, Tuber aestivum and Tuber melanosporum, which are well-known for their ability to produce brules, had a positive impact on collembolan fitness, whereas their palatability was not particularly prominent. Hence there was a relationship between diet and fitness in F.candida, whilst hardly any relationship was observed between fitness and feeding preference.

Refinement of eDNA as an early monitoring tool at the landscape-level: study design considerations	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Asian carp; bighead carp; environmental DNA; experimental design; invasive species; occupancy; occurrence models; silver carp	CARP HYPOPHTHALMICHTHYS-NOBILIS; ENVIRONMENTAL DNA DETECTION; SEA-LAMPREY; LAND-USE; DEGRADATION; OCCUPANCY; TEMPERATURE	Natural resource managers use data on the spatial range of species to guide management decisions. These data come from survey or monitoring efforts that use a wide variety of tools. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a surveillance tool that uses genetic markers for detecting species and holds potential as a tool for large-scale monitoring programs. Two challenges of eDNA-based studies are uncertainties created by imperfect capture of eDNA in collection samples (e.g., water field samples) and imperfect detection of eDNA using molecular methods (e.g., quantitative PCR). Occurrence models can be used to address these challenges, thus we use an occurrence model to address two objectives: first, to determine how many samples were required to detect species using eDNA; second, to examine when and where to take samples. We collected water samples from three different habitat types in the Upper Mississippi River when both Bighead Carp and Silver Carp were known to be present based on telemetry detections. Each habitat type (backwater, tributary, and impoundment) was sampled during April, May, and November. Detections of eDNA for both species varied across sites and months, but were generally low, 0-19.3% of samples were positive for eDNA. Overall, we found that eDNA-based sampling holds promise to be a powerful monitoring tool for resource managers; however, limitations of eDNA-based sampling include different biological and ecological characteristics of target species such as seasonal habitat usage patterns as well as aspects of different physical environments that impact the implementation of these methods such as water temperature.

Understanding the temporal variations of NPP could provide new insights into the responses of communities to environmental factors. However, few studies based on long-term field biomass measurements have directly addressed this subject in the unique environment of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP). We examined the interannual variations of NPP during 2008-2015 by monitoring both aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and identified their relationships with environmental factors with the general linear model (GLM) and structural equation model (SEM). In addition, the interannual variation of root turnover and its controls were also investigated. The results show that the ANPP and BNPP increased by rates of 15.01 and 143.09 g/m(2) per year during 2008-2015, respectively. BNPP was mainly affected by growing season air temperature (GST) and growing season precipitation (GSP) rather than mean annual air temperature (MAT) or mean annual precipitation (MAP), while ANPP was only controlled by GST. In addition, available nitrogen (AN) was significantly positively associated with BNPP and ANPP. Root turnover rate averaged 30%/year, increased with soil depth, and was largely controlled by GST. Our results suggest that alpine Kobresia meadow was an N-limited ecosystem, and the NPP on the QTP might increase further in the future in the context of global warming and nitrogen deposition.

Persistent effects of fragmentation on tropical rainforest canopy structure after 20 yr of isolation	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						airborne laser scanner; Amazon; biological dynamics of forest fragments project; edge effects; forest degradation; forest dynamics; forest succession; land use change; leaf area density; lidar; vegetation structure	ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; AIRBORNE LIDAR; LEAF-AREA; DYNAMICS; MICROCLIMATE; DISTURBANCE; MORTALITY; GROWTH	Assessing the persistent impacts of fragmentation on aboveground structure of tropical forests is essential to understanding the consequences of land use change for carbon storage and other ecosystem functions. We investigated the influence of edge distance and fragment size on canopy structure, aboveground woody biomass (AGB), and AGB turnover in the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) in central Amazon, Brazil, after 22+ yr of fragment isolation, by combining canopy variables collected with portable canopy profiling lidar and airborne laser scanning surveys with long-term forest inventories. Forest height decreased by 30% at edges of large fragments (>10 ha) and interiors of small fragments (<3 ha). In larger fragments, canopy height was reduced up to 40 m from edges. Leaf area density profiles differed near edges: the density of understory vegetation was higher and midstory vegetation lower, consistent with canopy reorganization via increased regeneration of pioneers following post-fragmentation mortality of large trees. However, canopy openness and leaf area index remained similar to control plots throughout fragments, while canopy spatial heterogeneity was generally lower at edges. AGB stocks and fluxes were positively related to canopy height and negatively related to spatial heterogeneity. Other forest structure variables typically used to assess the ecological impacts of fragmentation (basal area, density of individuals, and density of pioneer trees) were also related to lidar-derived canopy surface variables. Canopy reorganization through the replacement of edge-sensitive species by disturbance-tolerant ones may have mitigated the biomass loss effects due to fragmentation observed in the earlier years of BDFFP. Lidar technology offered novel insights and observational scales for analysis of the ecological impacts of fragmentation on forest structure and function, specifically aboveground biomass storage.

A nonnative habitat-former mitigates native habitat loss for endemic reef fishes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						ecological trap; fitness; habitat quality; habitat selection; HIREC; invasion ecology; kelp canopy; urchin barrens; wakame	PORT PHILLIP BAY; UNDARIA-PINNATIFIDA; IMPACTS; MACROALGAE; PLANT; KELP; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS	Animals that select the best available habitats are most likely to succeed in degraded environments, but ecological change can create evolutionarily unfamiliar habitats that may be under- or over-utilized by native fauna. In temperate coastal waters, eutrophication and grazing have driven a global decline in native seaweeds and facilitated the establishment of nonnative seaweeds that provide novel macrophyte habitat. We tested whether a nonnative kelp canopy (wakame Undaria pinnatifida) functions as a viable habitat or ecological trap for several endemic reef fishes on urchin-grazed reefs in southern Australia. We assessed the willingness of fish to utilize native vs. wakame kelp canopy via a laboratory habitat choice experiment and by recording natural recruitment to specially constructed boulder reefs with manipulated kelp canopy. We also compared fish communities on natural reefs using a before-after-control-impact survey of wakame patches, and to assess the quality of wakame habitat for resident fish, compared fitness metrics for fish collected from habitats with native vs. wakame kelp canopy. Endemic fishes did not distinguish between the native or wakame canopy but preferred both to barren reef habitats. On urchin-grazed natural reefs, fish occurred in higher abundance and diversity where seasonal wakame canopy was present. Fitness metrics in fish collected from wakame patches were comparable to those in fish from adjacent native kelp patches. These findings indicate that the nonnative canopy provides a viable habitat for endemic fish and may play a role in sustaining native fauna populations in this degraded ecosystem. More broadly, we recommend that managers consider the role of nonnative habitats within the context of environmental change, as endemic fauna may benefit from nonnative habitat-formers in areas where their native counterparts cannot persist.

Land-use and climatic causes of environmental novelty in Wisconsin since 1890	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						agroecology; climate change; ecological management; environmental history; forest composition; land use; novel ecosystems; regional novelty; Wisconsin	UNITED-STATES; CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; LANDSCAPE; FORESTS; TRENDS; FUTURE; CLASSIFICATION	Multiple global change drivers are increasing the present and future novelty of environments and ecological communities. However, most assessments of environmental novelty have focused only on future climate and were conducted at scales too broad to be useful for land management or conservation. Here, using historical county-level data sets of agricultural land use, forest composition, and climate, we conduct a regional-scale assessment of environmental novelty for Wisconsin landscapes from ca. 1890 to 2012. Agricultural land-use data include six cropland types, livestock densities for four livestock species, and human populations. Forestry data comprise biomass-weighted relative abundances for 15 tree genera. Climate data comprise seasonal means for temperature and precipitation. We found that forestry and land use are the strongest cause of environmental novelty (Novelty(Forest) = 3.66, Novelty(Ag) = 2.83, Novelty(Climate) = 1.60, with Wisconsin's forests transformed by early 20th-century logging and its legacies and multiple waves of agricultural innovation and obsolescence. Climate change is the smallest contributor to contemporary novelty, with precipitation signals stronger than temperature. Magnitudes and causes of environmental novelty are strongly spatially patterned, with novelty in southern Wisconsin roughly twice that in northern Wisconsin. Forestry is the most important cause of novelty in the north, land use and climate change are jointly important in the southwestern Wisconsin, and land use and forest composition are most important in central and eastern Wisconsin. Areas of high regional novelty tend also to be areas of high local change, but local change has not pushed all counties beyond regional baselines. Seven counties serve as the best historical analogues for over one-half of contemporary Wisconsin counties (40/72), and so can offer useful historical counterparts for contemporary systems and help managers coordinate to tackle similar environmental challenges. Multi-dimensional environmental novelty analyses, like those presented here, can help identify the best historical analogues for contemporary ecosystems, places where new management rules and practices may be needed because novelty is already high, and the main causes of novelty. Separating regional novelty clearly from local change and measuring both across many dimensions and at multiple scales thus helps advance ecology and sustainability science alike.

However, due to the difficulty of assessing individual species' contributions and the lack of a metric allowing for a quantification of redundancy within communities, few attempts have been made to estimate redundancy for individual ecosystem processes. We present a new method linking interaction metrics with metabolic theory that allows for a quantification of redundancy at the level of ecosystem processes. Using this approach, redundancy in the predation on aphids and other prey by natural enemies across a landscape heterogeneity gradient was estimated. Functional redundancy of predators was high in heterogeneous landscapes, low in homogeneous landscapes and scaled with predator specialisation. Our approach allows quantifying functional redundancy within communities and can be used to assess the role of functional redundancy across a wide variety of ecosystem processes and environmental factors.

Despite this promise, scaling sample acquisition to the spatial and temporal scales needed for effective monitoring would require prohibitively large investments in time and human resources. To address this challenge, we evaluated the efficacy of an autonomous eDNA sampling system and compare results obtained to traditional eDNA sampling methods. The autonomous sampling instrument consisted of the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) coupled to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We tested equivalency between the ESP and traditional eDNA sampling techniques by comparing the quantification of eDNA across a broad range of taxa, from microbes (SAR11), phytoplankton (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), and invertebrates (krill: Euphausia pacifica) to vertebrates (anchovy: Engraulis mordax). No significant differences in eDNA densities were observed between the two sample collection and filtration methods. eDNA filters collected by the ESP were preserved and stable for 21 days, the typical deployment length of the instrumentation. Finally, we demonstrated the unique capabilities of an autonomous, mobile ESP during a deployment near Monterey Bay, CA, by remotely and repeatedly sampling a water mass over 12 h. The development of a mobile ESP demonstrates the promise of utilizing eDNA measurements to observe complex biological processes in the ocean absent a human presence.

These heterogeneous ecosystems harbour high biodiversity associated with the dynamic turnover of taxa. Despite flow permanence being widely recognised as an important environmental control, few studies have characterised biotic responses to long-term hydrological variability in temporary streams. We examined taxonomic and functional macroinvertebrate communities of perennial and nonperennial river reaches over a 26-year period. Flow permanence resulted in spatial variation in taxonomic and functional macroinvertebrate communities. Nonperennial river reaches, which were characterised by dynamic habitat provision (lotic, lentic, and dry states) over the study period, supported more heterogeneous communities than perennial river reaches. Hydrological variables, in particular wetted width, water depth, and zero-flow states, were instrumental in structuring taxonomic and functional communities, although the importance of substrate conditions increased in autumn. Hydrological conditions resulted in separation of perennial and nonperennial taxonomic communities regardless of season, whereas functional communities differed only in spring. Our results emphasise that understanding of community responses to hydrological variability is enhanced by analyses that concurrently explore taxonomic and functional responses to long-term intraannual and interannual hydrological variability. Moreover, functional responses represent a robust method to test ecological responses to hydrological drivers. Further research that builds on our work is needed to inform the protection of both perennial and nonperennial streams as they adapt to ongoing environmental change.

Recent declines in aspen populations have occurred, especially along drought-sensitive margins of its range and where fire exclusion and herbivory have promoted community transition. However, aspen also forms stable stands, and examination of the mechanisms that influence persistence can offer conservation insights, especially where populations are vulnerable to changing climate or altered disturbance dynamics. We sampled tree age and stand characteristics of isolated aspen forests in the arid Great Basin (USA) to determine if (1) aspen communities are more fire-dependent and seral or fire-independent and stable; (2) ungulate browsing inhibits aspen stability; and (3) temporal patterns of vegetative reproduction (i.e., ramet establishment or "suckering") are correlated with climate. Aspen size and age class densities strongly fit negative exponential distributions, whether grouped geographically or by functional type, suggesting landscape-scale persistence. Continuous age distributions and high proportions of recruitment-sized to overstory trees suggest stability at stand scales, with exceptions including stands with higher browsing pressure. Few stands had evidence of fire, and relationships between dead tree size and variability in live tree size suggest a lack of fire dependency. Several 5-yr averaged climate variables and one sea surface temperature index were correlated with aspen ramet establishment densities over time, with strongest relationships occurring similar to 5 yr prior to establishment year, often followed by inverse relationships similar to 1 yr after. Indeed, aspen establishment density for a recent 41-yr period was reliably reconstructed using antecedent climate conditions derived from a single drought index. Temporally synchronized aspen ramet establishment across the study region may be due to climate-driven storage of nonstructural carbohydrate reserves in clonal root systems later used for regeneration. Complex regeneration dynamics of these self-sustaining aspen stands, especially sensitivity to climate variability, suggest they may serve as harbingers of ecological change in the arid Great Basin and in other aspen populations near their range margin.

Spatially explicit power analysis for detecting occupancy trends for multiple species	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Kakadu; occupancy; optimal monitoring; population declines; simulation; spatially explicit power analysis; species distribution modeling; statistical power	KAKADU-NATIONAL-PARK; STATISTICAL POWER; IMPERFECT DETECTION; CONSERVATION; DESIGN; MAMMALS; BIRDS	Assessing the statistical power to detect changes in wildlife populations is a crucial yet often overlooked step when designing and evaluating monitoring programs. Here, we developed a simulation framework to perform spatially explicit statistical power analysis of biological monitoring programs for detecting temporal trends in occupancy for multiple species. Using raster layers representing the spatial variation in current occupancy and species-level detectability for one or multiple observation methods, our framework simulates changes in occupancy over space and time, with the capacity to explicitly model stochastic disturbances at monitoring sites (i.e., dynamic landscapes). Once users specify the number and location of sites, the frequency and duration of surveys, and the type of detection method(s) for each species, our framework estimates power to detect occupancy trends, both across the landscape and/or within nested management units. As a case study, we evaluated the power of a long-term monitoring program to detect trends in occupancy for 136 species (83 birds, 33 reptiles, and 20 mammals) across and within Kakadu, Litchfield, and Nitmiluk National Parks in northern Australia. We assumed continuation of an original monitoring design implemented since 1996, with the addition of camera trapping. As expected, power to detect trends was sensitive to the direction and magnitude of the change in occupancy, detectability, initial occupancy levels, and the rarity of species. Our simulations suggest that monitoring has at least an 80% chance at detecting a 50% decline in occupancy for 22% of the modeled species across the three parks over the next 15 yr. Monitoring is more likely to detect increasing occupancy trends, with at least an 80% chance at detecting a 50% increase in 87% of species. The addition of camera-trapping increased average power to detect a 50% decline in mammals compared with using only live trapping by 63%. We provide a flexible tool that can help decision-makers design and evaluate monitoring programs for hundreds of species at a time in a range of ecological settings, while explicitly considering the distribution of species and alternative sampling methods.

This can be investigated using phylogeographic analyses of genetic units. In this work, the genetic structure of five asteroid genera with contrasting reproductive strategies (brooding: Diplasterias, Notasterias and Lysasterias versus broadcasting: Psilaster and Bathybiaster) was investigated in the Southern Ocean. Over 1,400 mtDNA cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences were analysed using five species delineation methods (ABGD, ASAP, mPTP, sGMYC and mGMYC), two phylogenetic reconstructions (ML and BA), and molecular clock calibrations, in order to examine the weight of reproductive strategy in the observed differences among phylogeographic patterns. We hypothesised that brooding species would show higher levels of genetic diversity and species richness along with a clearer geographic structuring than broadcasting species. In contrast, genetic diversity and species richness were not found to be significantly different between brooders and broadcasters, but broadcasters are less spatially structured than brooders supporting our initial hypothesis and suggesting more complex evolutionary histories associated to this reproductive strategy. Broadcasters' phylogeography can be explained by different scenarios including deep-sea colonisation routes, bipolarity or cosmopolitanism, and sub-Antarctic emergence for the genus Bathybiaster; Antarctic- New Zealand faunal exchanges across the Polar Front for the genus Psilaster. Brooders' phylogeography could support the previously formulated hypothesis of a past trans-Antarctic seaway established between the Ross and the Weddell seas during the Plio-Pleistocene. Our results also show, for the first time, that the Weddell Sea is populated by a mixed asteroid fauna originating from both the East and West Antarctic.

Soil microbes, namely mycorrhizal fungi, partly underlie successional trajectories of plant communities, yet their role in restoration is often overlooked. Here, we tested the relative importance of common management tools used in restoration-species planted and soil placement-on the recovery of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities over 4 years. Importantly, we further compared the community assembly of fungi on reclaimed landscapes to that in reference ecosystems disturbed to different degrees. This latter test addresses whether disturbance intensity is more important than common management interventions to restore fungal communities in these ecosystems. Three main findings emerged. (1) The effect of tree species planted and soil placement on ectomycorrhizal fungal communities establishing on reclaimed landscapes was dynamic through time. (2) Disturbances that remove or disrupt the organic layer of soils substantially affect the composition of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. (3) Shifts in the community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi were driven to a greater extent by disturbance severity than either tree species planted or soil placement.

Enzymatic hydrolysates showed a different chemical composition compared with fermented hydrolysates and OK. It had a higher protein concentration as well as C, P and K. The proteins of OK were converted into peptides with a lower molecular weight, the fermented hydrolysates being those with the lowest molecular weight profile. The influences of hydrolysates and OK were tested in soil, finding that beta-glucosidase, phosphatase and dehydrogenase activities were stimulated by every treatment. However, it was observed that EH produced a greater stimulation of dehydrogenase and phosphatase than both OK and fermented BS. The bacterial and fungal phospholipid fatty acids were also higher in soils amended with BS than those of the control and soils with OK. It has also been found that beta-glucosidase, phosphatase and microbial biomass were dose-dependent in every treatment, but dehydrogenase only was dose-dependent in EH and OK treatments.

From plant fungi to bee parasites: mycorrhizae and soil nutrients shape floral chemistry and bee pathogens	ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						alkaloid; bee decline; bee parasites; Bombus impatiens; Crithidia; floral chemistry; multitrophic effects; mycorrhizae; soil; trypanosome	DISEASE; POLLINATORS; LIMITATION; INCREASE; IMPACTS; REWARDS; DEFENSE; REVEAL	Bee populations have experienced declines in recent years, due in part to increased disease incidence. Multiple factors influence bee-pathogen interactions, including nectar and pollen quality and secondary metabolites. However, we lack an understanding of how plant interactions with their environment shape bee diet quality. We examined how plant interactions with the belowground environment alter floral rewards and, in turn, bee-pathogen interactions. Soil-dwelling mycorrhizal fungi are considered plant mutualists, although the outcome of the relationship depends on environmental conditions such as nutrients. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, we asked whether mycorrhizal fungi and nutrients affect concentrations of nectar and pollen alkaloids (anabasine and nicotine) previously shown to reduce infection by the gut pathogen Crithidia in the native bumble bee Bombus impatiens. To ask how plant interactions affect this common bee pathogen, we fed pollen and nectar from our treatment plants, and from a wildflower pollen control with artificial nectar, to bees infected with Crithidia. Mycorrhizal fungi and fertilizer both influenced flowering phenology and floral chemistry. While we found no anabasine or nicotine in nectar, high fertilizer increased anabasine and nicotine in pollen. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) decreased nicotine concentrations, but the reduction due to AMF was stronger in high than low-nutrient conditions. AMF and nutrients also had interactive effects on bee pathogens via changes in nectar and pollen. High fertilizer reduced Crithidia cell counts relative to low fertilizer in AMF plants, but increased Crithidia in non-AMF plants. These results did not correspond with effects of fertilizer and AMF on pollen alkaloid concentrations, suggesting that other components of pollen or nectar were affected by treatments and shaped pathogen counts. Our results indicate that soil biotic and abiotic environment can alter bee-pathogen interactions via changes in floral rewards, and underscore the importance of integrative studies to predict disease dynamics and ecological outcomes.

In turn, processes occurring at larger scales determine the local biotic and abiotic environment of each host that may affect the diversity and composition of the microbiome community. Here, we examine variation in the diversity and composition of the foliar fungal microbiome in the grass host, Andropogon gerardii, across four mesic prairies in the central United States. Composition of fungal endophyte communities differed among sites and among individuals within a site, but was not consistently affected by experimental manipulation of nutrient supply to hosts (A. gerardii) or herbivore reduction via fencing. In contrast, mean fungal diversity was similar among sites but was limited by total plant biomass at the plot scale. Our work demonstrates that distributed experiments motivated by ecological theory are a powerful tool to unravel the multiscale processes governing microbial community composition and diversity.

Gene expression correlates of facultative predation in the blow fly Chrysomya rufifacies (Diptera: Calliphoridae)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						decomposition ecology; facultative predation; insects; intraguild predation; invasive species; transcriptomics	INTRAGUILD PREDATION; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-D; PROTEIN SECRETION; FLIES DIPTERA; DROSOPHILA; COEXISTENCE; COMPETITION; STRATEGIES; GENOMICS	Effects of intraguild predation (IGP) on omnivores and detritivores are relatively understudied when compared to work on predator guilds. Functional genetic work in IGP is even more limited, but its application can help answer a range of questions related to ultimate and proximate causes of this behavior. Here, we integrate behavioral assays and transcriptomic analysis of facultative predation in a blow fly (Diptera: Calliphoridae) to evaluate the prevalence, effect, and correlated gene expression of facultative predation by the invasive species Chrysomya rufifacies. Field work observing donated human cadavers indicated facultative predation by C. rufifacies on the native blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria was rare under undisturbed conditions, owing in part to spatial segregation between species. Laboratory assays under conditions of starvation showed predation had a direct fitness benefit (i.e., survival) to the predator. As a genome is not available for C. rufifacies, a de novo transcriptome was developed and annotated using sequence similarity to Drosophila melanogaster. Under a variety of assembly parameters, several genes were identified as being differentially expressed between predators and nonpredators of this species, including genes involved in cell-to-cell signaling, osmotic regulation, starvation responses, and dopamine regulation. Results of this work were integrated to develop a model of the processes and genetic regulation controlling facultative predation.

The effectiveness of aquatic plants as surrogates for wider biodiversity in standing fresh waters	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						lake; macroinvertebrates; macrophyte morpho-group; pond; structural equation modelling	CROSS-TAXON CONGRUENCE; SHALLOW LAKES; SPECIES RICHNESS; MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; POTENTIAL SURROGATES; BEETLE ASSEMBLAGES; CONSERVATION VALUE; INDICATOR TAXA; R-PACKAGE; HABITAT	Freshwaters are among the most globally threatened habitats and their biodiversity is declining at an unparalleled rate. In an attempt to slow this decline, multiple approaches have been used to conserve, restore or enhance waterbodies. However, evaluating their effectiveness is time-consuming and expensive. Identifying species or assemblages across a range of ecological conditions that can provide a surrogate for wider freshwater biodiversity is therefore of significant value for conservation management and planning. For lakes and ponds in three contrasting landscapes of Britain (lowland agricultural, eastern England; upland, north-west England; urban, central Scotland) we examined the link between macrophyte species, macrophyte morpho-group diversity (an indicator of structural diversity) and the richness of three widespread aquatic macroinvertebrate groups (molluscs, beetles, and odonates) using structural equation modelling. We hypothesised that increased macrophyte richness and, hence, increased vegetation structural complexity, would increase macroinvertebrate richness after accounting for local and landscape conditions. We found that macrophyte richness, via macrophyte morpho-group diversity, was an effective surrogate for mollusc, beetle, and odonate richness in ponds after accounting for variation caused by physical variables, water chemistry, and surrounding land use. However, only mollusc richness could be predicted by macrophyte morpho-group diversity in lakes, with no significant predicted effect on beetles or odonates. Our results indicate that macrophyte morpho-group diversity can be viewed as a suitable surrogate of macroinvertebrate biodiversity across diverse landscapes, particularly in ponds and to a lesser extent in lakes. This has important implications for the restoration, conservation, and creation of standing water habitats and for assessing their effectiveness in addressing the decline of global freshwater biodiversity. Management actions prioritising the development of species-rich and structurally diverse macrophyte assemblages will be likely to benefit wider freshwater biodiversity.

Inter-specific differences in invader and native fish functional responses illustrate neutral effects on prey but superior invader competitive ability	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						competition; fish; gut content; multi-predator effects; predator-prey dynamics	MOSQUITOFISH GAMBUSIA-AFFINIS; FRESH-WATER FISH; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; MULTIPLE PREDATORS; INVASION; BIOLOGY; IMPACT; TEMPERATURE; SELECTION; RISK	Inter-specific interactions are key factors in the structuring and functioning of ecological communities. Therefore, it is necessary to assess species interactions, such as predator-prey dynamics and competitive exclusion, within the context of continuing global species introductions. The aim of the present study was to assess ecological impacts and competitive exclusion dynamics involving co-occurring introduced and native fish species, using the multiple predator functional response (FR) approach. We use comparative FR analysis (resource uptake as a function of resource density) to assess inter-specific interactions between the invasive western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis and the native freshwater river goby Glossogobius callidus towards chironomid larvae. The FR was derived for each fish species as individuals and when in heterospecific pairings. Data from single individuals were used to predict the expected FR of individuals when in heterospecific multiple predator combinations. Expected FRs were then compared to the observed FRs of each predator in combination trials, enumerated using prey items in their gut contents. Both fish species displayed Type II FRs, however, in single fish trials, invasive mosquitofish had significantly higher FRs (curve asymptotes; i.e. shorter handling times and higher maximum feeding rates) than native river gobies. Heterospecific mosquitofish-river goby combinations revealed that the FR of the river goby was reduced (i.e. longer handling times and lower maximum feeding rates) by the presence of mosquitofish, whereas this combination greatly enhanced mosquitofish FR magnitudes (i.e. shorter handling times and higher maximum feeding rates). The heterospecific treatments resulted in neutral impacts on prey and there were clear inter-species interference in favour of the non-native mosquitofish. This study demonstrates how multiple predators can alter the shape of individual FRs, with neutral effects on prey but superior invader competitive ability. This has implications for predicting the naturalisation success of invasive predators, as predatory and competitive interactions with native predators and prey may facilitate rather than impede establishment.

However, the mechanism underlying the effect on soil fungal communities and the relationship between these effects and cropping systems have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we comparatively investigated the abundance, diversity, and structures of fungal communities in the bulk and rhizospheric soils of soybean grown in two cropping systems, that is, continuous cropping (CC) of soybean and cropping rotation (CR) with maize using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing methods. The results showed that the rhizospheric soil fungal abundance was significantly higher in CC than in CR, but the opposite trend was observed in bulk soils. CC decreased the fungal alpha diversity in both bulk and rhizospheric soils compared with CR. The fungal community compositions were distinctly different between CC and CR in both bulk and rhizospheric soils, and the composition and diversity in bulk soils were predominantly affected by the soil carbon to nitrigen (C/N) ratio. The soil fungal functional groups varied between the two cropping systems; CC increased the relative abundances of the potentially pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Lectera longa and beneficial fungi Mortierella sp. and Paecilomyces lilacinus. In contrast, CR increased the relative abundance of Ustilago maydis, which is a pathogen that causes corn smut. Our findings showed that CC increased the abundances of plant pathogens, which is harmful to soybean growth; in contrast, the abundances of some beneficial fungi also increased, which suggested that suppressive soils might be developed after long-term CC.

Transcriptional remodelling upon light removal in a model cnidarian: Losses and gains in gene expression	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						circadian; gene expression; Nematostella; photoperiod; transcriptomics	CIRCADIAN CLOCK; PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; CORAL; EVOLUTION; COMPONENTS; BEHAVIOR; EYE; PHOTOTRANSDUCTION; PHOTORECEPTORS; CRYPTOCHROMES	Organismal responses to light:dark cycles can result from two general processes: (a) direct response to light or (b) a free-running rhythm (i.e., a circadian clock). Previous research in cnidarians has shown that candidate circadian clock genes have rhythmic expression in the presence of diel lighting, but these oscillations appear to be lost quickly after removal of the light cue. Here, we measure whole-organism gene expression changes in 136 transcriptomes of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, entrained to a light:dark environment and immediately following light cue removal to distinguish two broadly defined responses in cnidarians: light entrainment and circadian regulation. Direct light exposure resulted in significant differences in expression for hundreds of genes, including more than 200 genes with rhythmic, 24-hr periodicity. Removal of the lighting cue resulted in the loss of significant expression for 80% of these genes after 1 day, including most of the hypothesized cnidarian circadian genes. Further, 70% of these candidate genes were phase-shifted. Most surprisingly, thousands of genes, some of which are involved in oxidative stress, DNA damage response and chromatin modification, had significant differences in expression in the 24 hr following light removal, suggesting that loss of the entraining cue may induce a cellular stress response. Together, our findings suggest that a majority of genes with significant differences in expression for anemones cultured under diel lighting are largely driven by the primary photoresponse rather than a circadian clock when measured at the whole animal level. These results provide context for the evolution of cnidarian circadian biology and help to disassociate two commonly confounded factors driving oscillating phenotypes.

Among the 408 Chinese amphibians, 174 species are considered threatened according to the China Biodiversity Red List in 2015. However, to date, which species traits or extrinsic factors are correlated with extinction risk in Chinese amphibians is rarely examined. The aims of this study were thus to identify the patterns and correlates of extinction risk in Chinese amphibians and to determine whether patterns and processes are similar between species with either small or large geographic distributions. Location China. Methods We obtained twelve species traits and four extrinsic factors that have been commonly linked to the extinction risk of amphibians. After phylogenetic correction, these factors were tested separately and in combination to identify their correlations with extinction risk in all Chinese amphibians, and in small-ranged and large-ranged species. Results Geographic range size and elevational range were the most important predictors of extinction risk in all Chinese amphibians. Although extinction risk in small-ranged amphibians was predominantly determined by small elevational range, in large-ranged amphibians it was driven by geographic and elevational ranges, body size, human exploitation index and adult microhabitat. Small-ranged amphibians had a higher percentage of threatened species than large-ranged species. However, the body size distributions were not statistically different between these two amphibian subgroups. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that conservation priority should be given to species with small geographic and elevational ranges. Small-ranged and large-ranged amphibians should be conserved with different strategies because the factors influencing extinction risk differ between these two groups. In specific, the reduction of habitat loss should be a primary focus of management efforts because species with small geographic and elevational ranges are particually vulnerable to habitat loss. Conservation efforts should also focus on protecting large-bodied species and preventing human overexploitation for the effective conservation of large-ranged amphibians.

If carried over to the next generation, such fitness effects could have important implications for population dynamics and the evolution of ageing, but these remain poorly understood. While many laboratory studies have investigated maternal age effects, relatively few studies have been conducted in natural populations, and they usually only present a "snapshot" of an offspring's lifetime. In the present study, we focus on how maternal age influences offspring life-history trajectories and performance in a long-lived mammal. We use a multigenerational demographic dataset of semi-captive Asian elephants to investigate maternal age effects on several offspring life-history traits: condition, reproductive success and overall survival. We show that offspring born to older mothers display reduced overall survival but higher reproductive success, and reduced survival of their own progeny. Our results show evidence of a persistent effect of maternal age on fitness across generations in a long-lived mammal. By highlighting transgenerational effects on the fitness of the next generation associated with maternal age, the present study helps increase our understanding of factors contributing to individual variation in ageing rates and fitness.

However, the mixed effects of leaf litter decomposition in desert ecosystems remain unclear. To reveal the mixed effects and the influence of litter quality on leaf litter decomposition in desert ecosystems, a 5-year long-term study was conducted to compare the observed and expected leaf litter mass loss in single-species and mixed (equal proportions and natural proportions) litters of two typical perennial gramineous plants (Stipa klemenzii and Achnatherum splendens) in a desert steppe in Northern China. The relationship between litter mass loss and litter qualities was also analysed. The results showed that (a) after 5 years of decomposition, the mass losses of mixed litter in natural proportions and S. klemenzii litter were significantly higher than those of mixed litter in equal proportions and A. splendens litter; (b) the mixed effects of two litters in different ratios varied with time, and the synergistic effect only appeared in the second year when an easily decomposed litter (S. klemenzii) was mixed with a slowly decomposing litter (A. splendens); and (c) litter mass loss was not correlated with the initial carbon or nitrogen content but was negatively correlated with the initial lignin content, and the initial lignin content also had a significant effect on litter mixed effects of these two perennial gramineous plant litters. These results can suggest that the initial lignin content is an indicator of predicting decomposition and mixed effects of litter with low nitrogen content.

This study presents the results of a 15-year investigation into how IAS occur within natural forest reserves (NFR): unmanaged forest ecosystems within Austria, concluding that unmanaged forests are not resistant to plant invasions. The study comprised ground vegetation, regeneration, and stand structure surveys. The presence or absence of IAS in different forest types was assessed and the influencing variables for their presence or absence were determined. In addition, the study analysed whether the abundance of IAS has increased at the site level within the past decade. Significant differences in the probability of IAS presences between forest types (photosociological alliances) were found. The results of the study show that natural riparian and floodplain forests are among the forest types most vulnerable to biological invasions, which is reflected in elevation and soil type being determined as the main factors influencing the spread of IAS in unmanaged forests. The results of this study may be useful for persons responsible for sustainable forest management programmes or for managing forested areas within national parks. They provide a case study on non-intervention forest management policy in order to mitigate the impacts of IAS in protected areas. Forest areas, where IAS begin to spread can be identified, which in turn leads to measures in the early stages of invasion, and to optimise monitoring and control measures for relevant species in Central European forest types.

Although the ecological impacts of roads are now well recognised, there remains a lack of certainty regarding how roads in general and roads with different widths affect vital ecosystem services such as above-ground biomass (AGB) in tropics. Using a non-destructive sampling method, we investigated disturbance effects of roads on AGB and related attributes in Xishuangbanna, China. We surveyed woody plants in natural forests, rubber plantations, and tea plantations up to 100 m from the edge of three different road widths and estimated AGB using allometric equations at 10 m intervals. Two sample t-test results confirmed that natural forests stored more AGB than rubber and tea plantations, and less AGB at edges of wider road than at edges of narrower road. Linear mixed effects models revealed that land use, road width, and distance from edge significantly explained 68% (both fixed and random factors) variation in AGB. We observed two results that indicated wider roads altered more AGB than narrower road types in natural forests. First, AGB declined at road edges; second, the disturbance effects on AGB by wider road types went deeper than narrower roads did in natural forests. Our results suggest that both widening the existing roads and construction of new roads will degrade ecosystem productivity. We recommend that impacts assessments of roads on AGB should be considered and taken serious while planning and designing roads to avoid serious damages to many ecosystem services that AGB provides.

Results are from a network around Christchurch, New Zealand, with an objective to forecast the occurrence of short-term peaks using a gradient boosted machine with a binary classifier as the response (1 = peak, 0 = no peak). Results are successful, with 80-90% accurate forecasting of whether a peak in PM2.5 would occur within the next 60-min period. Elevated and variable nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and lower temperatures and wind gusts are found to be important precursors to the occurrence of PM2.5 peaks. The use of meteorological data from a network of personal weather stations across the monitored area and from the measurement instruments was able to identify local-scale peak differences in the network. Boosted models using hourly-averaged and daily-averaged peaks as the response are developed separately to showcase differences in precursors between short-term and long-term peaks, with recent wind gusts and nitrogen oxides linked to hourly-averaged peaks and aloft air temperatures and atmospheric pressure linked to daily-averaged peaks. Results could prove useful in exposure mitigation strategies (e.g. as a short-term warning system).

Split phosphorus fertiliser applications as a strategy to reduce incidental phosphorus losses in surface runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Frequency; Survey; Histosols; Timing; Half-live; Histic	SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; SOIL; MANAGEMENT; SORPTION; AMENDMENTS; CATCHMENTS; PASTURES; NITROGEN; IMPACT; CARBON	Organic soils have low sorption capacities for phosphorus (P), and may pose a risk of P loss to water if P applications to these soils coincide with runoff events. Little is known about the magnitude of exports of P in overland flow following application of P fertiliser onto these soils, or on the influence of the frequency on P losses and persistence. The number of P fertiliser applications was surveyed across 39 commercial farms to assess current practice and inform the design of a rainfall runoff experiment to evaluate the effect of frequency of P applications on losses and persistence across time. Superphosphate (16% P) was applied in single (equivalent to 30 and 55 kg P ha(-1) applied at day 0) and split (equivalent to 15 and 27.5 kg P ha(-1) applied in two doses at days 0 and 55) applications to an organic soil inclined at a slope of 6% in a rainfall simulator experiment. The surface runoff of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) was measured in controlled 30-min rainfall simulations conducted intermittently over an 85-day period. The DRP losses in surface runoff after the first rainfall event were 44.6 and 97.8 mg L-1 for single applications of 30 and 55 kg ha(-1), respectively, and 13.3 and 21.8 mg L-1 for the same rates split in two doses, indicating that single P applications had disproportionately bigger impacts on losses than split applications. This supports the idea that frequent, but smaller, P applications can minimise the impact of fertilisation on waters. Dissolved reactive P concentrations remained significantly higher than those from the control samples until the end the experiment for almost all the P treatments, highlighting the long-lasting effects of added P and the elevated risk of P losses on organic soils. For climates with frequent rainfall events, which are likely to coincide with fertiliser applications, smaller but more frequent P applications can reduce the risk of P transfer as opposed to one single application.

De Senerpont			Saving water for the future: Public awareness of water usage and water quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; CITIZEN SCIENCE; CRITICAL THINKING; EDUCATION; TOOL; PERCEPTIONS; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIORS; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES	Fresh water is a limited resource under anthropogenic threat. Europeans are using an average of 3550 L per capita per day and this amount is increasing steadily as incomes rise. Water saving options are being actively promoted, but these intensified measures do not yet come close to saving enough water to prevent water shortages that may seriously affect our way of life in the near future. With projected increases in demands for good quality fresh water, educating the public about sustainable personal water use and water quality threats becomes an absolute necessity. One way to achieve this is through engaging citizens in water issues, e.g. through citizen science projects. Using snowball convenience sampling, we distributed a questionnaire among 498 people in 23 countries to investigate whether people were aware of how much water they used, what they perceived as threats to water quality and whether they would like to help improve water quality. Our results showed that the amount of daily water use was greatly underestimated among respondents, especially indirect use of water for the production of goods and services. Furthermore, the effects of climate change and detrimental habits such as feeding ducks were underestimated, presumably because of environmental illiteracy. However, eighty-five percent (85%) of our participants indicated an interest in directly working together with scientists to understand and improve their local water quality. Involving citizens in improving local lake quality promotes both environmental and scientific literacy, and can therefore result in a reduction in daily personal water use. The next iteration of the Water Framework Directive legislation will be launched shortly, requiring water managers to include citizens in their monitoring schemes. Engaging citizens will not only help improve surface water quality, and educate about cause and effect chains in water quality, but will also reduce the personal fresh water usage.	[Seelen, Laura M.

Long-term vegetation responses to pinyon-juniper woodland reduction treatments in Nevada, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Long-term; Pinyon-juniper; Woodland reduction; Great Basin; Forbs; Seeding; Brooms tectorum; Thinopyrum intermedium	NATIVE PLANT ESTABLISHMENT; CRESTED WHEATGRASS; SAGEBRUSH-STEPPE; UNDERSTORY RESPONSES; COMMUNITY RESPONSES; EROSION RESPONSES; TREE DOMINANCE; DYNAMICS; WILDFIRE; RESTORATION	Expansion of native pinyon-juniper (Pinus monophylla-Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands can decrease shrub and herbaceous cover in the Intermountain West, U.S., affecting habitat quality and biodiversity. Removing pinyon-juniper woodlands in former sagebrush ecosystems to increase understory cover has a long management history, and short- and long-term monitoring reveal different understory plant community responses. We revisited a 500 mm average precipitation site in the sagebrush steppe of western Nevada, 32 years after three types of tree thinning treatments and seeding had occurred in a mature, closed-canopy woodland. We measured vegetation foliar cover and density within plots arranged in a 3-block randomized design. We found significantly lower cover of P. monophylla in treated plots (average of 2-8%), relative to controls (32%). However, P. monophylla seedlings (< 0.5 m tall) were detected throughout all plots (average of 86-160 trees/ha in treated plots, 111 in controls). Cover of perennial graminoids and shrubs was higher in all treatments (600-870% higher grass cover and 470-570% higher shrub cover) than controls. Cover of invasive annual species, primarily Bromus tectorum, was highly variable and not significantly different among plots, but B. tectorum had the highest cover of all species in two of the three woodland removal treatment types. Control plots contained significantly larger perennial canopy gaps compared to all treatments (average of 318 cm vs. 104-133 cm), and had significantly more woody litter cover than clear cut plots (average of 14% vs. 3%). These results suggest tree thinning and removal in tree dominated woodlands can increase shrub and perennial grass cover and reduce litter and canopy gaps, especially in conjunction with seeding, but that tree recolonization over the long-term is inevitable. Perennial forbs did not respond well to treatments (< 1% average foliar cover in all plots), and seeding or other treatments may be needed to improve their response. Further, if tree seedlings survive, these plots will likely return to tree dominance without additional treatments.

Influence of livelihood assets, experienced shocks and perceived risks on smallholder coffee farming practices in Peru<bold> </bold>	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Decision making; Sustainable livelihoods framework; Arabica coffee; Capitals; Shade management; Input management<bold>; </bold>	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISAPPEARING REFUGE; SHADE COFFEE; AGROFORESTRY; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; PERCEPTIONS; ADAPTATION; DIVERSIFICATION; SPECIALTY	Smallholder farmers might adopt different farming practices to cope with multiple stressors depending on their livelihood assets, and with varying environmental and economic outcomes. Ongoing global change is triggering stronger and different stressors that threaten conventional farming practices; however, this could be resolved if livelihood assets that drive decision making are actionable and thus can be modified. This study assessed the influence of farmers' livelihood assets, risk perception, and shocks on the choice of non-conventional farming practices for smallholder coffee farmers in San Martin, Peru. Using household survey data, we collected data on 162 coffee plantations along an elevation gradient. We operationalized the sustainable livelihoods framework for the adoption of shade and input coffee farming strategies and explored farmers' motives to change them. Despite associated high risks with pest and disease pressure, coffee price volatility and climate change, these risks did not explain the current shade and input farming strategies. While in the past five years, farmers adapted shade and input management in response to pest and disease and climate change pressures, these occurred in diverging directions: we found higher human and social assets associated with higher shade levels, and a trend for higher physical and financial assets associated with higher input use. These findings illustrate that two main factors affect decisions on farming practices related to shade and input management and they relate to different livelihood capitals. This suggests a potential for conflicting decision-making, push-and-pulling decisions in different directions. Further the disconnect between livelihood assets and perceptions suggests that perception of risk and shocks might not be sufficient to motivate decision making under changing conditions. Such insights in decision making typologies and drivers can inform the development of farming practices that enhance resilience and sustainability of smallholder coffee production in Peru and elsewhere in the tropics.<bold> </bold>	[Jezeer, Rosalien E.; Verweij, Pita A.; Junginger, Martin] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Energy & Resources Grp, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Jezeer, Rosalien E.; Boot, Rene G.

Organic matter	METHYL MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS; ESSENTIAL FATTY-ACIDS; AQUATIC FOOD WEBS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; CARBON-SOURCES; FRESH-WATER; NITROGEN; BIOACCUMULATION; SPECIATION; BACTERIAL	Increases in terrestrial organic matter (tOM) transport from catchments to boreal lakes can affect methylmercury (MeHg) accumulation in aquatic biota both directly by increasing concentrations of aqueous MeHg, and indirectly through effects on MeHg bioavailability and on energy pathways in the lower food web. We carried out a detailed seasonal study of water chemistry, zooplankton diet, and MeHg accumulation in zooplankton in two lakes with contrasting tOM concentrations. Between-lake differences explained 51% of the variability in our water chemistry data, with no observed effect of season or sampling depth, contrary to our expectations. Higher tOM was correlated with higher aqueous Hg concentrations, lower areal pelagic primary productivity, and an increased contribution of terrestrial particles to pelagic particulate organicmatter. Based on dietary marker analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15, and fatty acid [FA] composition), zooplankton diet was strongly linked to feeding mechanism, with dietary reliance on phytoplankton highest in the selective-feeding calanoid copepods, and lowest in filter feeding cladocerans. Zooplankton dietary reliance on phytoplankton and their concentrations of high-quality lipids, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, were higher in the clear-water lake than in the brown-water lake, where bacterial and terrestrial food sources were more prevalent. MeHg was highest in zooplankton from the brown-water lake, with highest concentrations in the 200-500 mu m zooplankton size fraction for both lakes. Contrary to our expectations, there was no effect of season on zooplankton dietary markers or MeHg. Our results suggest that, overall, higher tOM results in higher MeHg concentrations in water and zooplankton, and reduces zooplankton dietary reliance on phytoplankton. Increased tOM thus leads to a decrease in the nutritional quality of zooplankton (i.e. higher MeHg concentrations, and lower concentrations of essential fatty acids), which may cascade up the food web with negative implications for higher trophic levels.

Few, however, have explored the relative contributions of greenspace spatial composition and configuration to LST using comparisons between cities. In this study, the authors sought to identify the relative contributions of greenspace spatial composition and configuration to LST and the stability mechanisms linking LST to greenspace at multiple locations. We looked at four highly-urbanized Chinese cities in a comparative study. Landsat 5/8 images for summer and winter were used to estimate LST and greenspace data were extracted from 0.5-m resolution imagery. The complex relationship between LST and greenspace spatial patterns was quantified and compared using a novel method that combines stepwise regression with hierarchical partitioning analysis concerning statistical size variations. The results indicated that greenspace spatial composition and configuration both consistently affect LST. However, the magnitude and significance of these relationships were very different. The combined contributions of the greenspace landscape metrics played a more critical role in determining LST than their independent contributions, especially in summer. However, the relative importance of spatial composition and spatial configuration was largely dependent on specific variables such as season or selected statistical grid size. The urban heat island (UHI) effect can be reduced not only by increasing the amount of greenspace, but also by optimizing greenspace spatial configuration; the latter is more effective than the former. Although scale dependence continued to be evident in our study, we were not able to confirm a universal "best" scale for analysis.

Yet, little is known about exposure to heat within cities in developing countries, and even less about exposure within informal neighbourhoods in those countries. This paper presents an assessment of exposure to outdoor heat in the South Asian cities Delhi, Dhaka, and Faisalabad. The temporal evolution of exposure to heat is evaluated, as well as intra-urban differences, using meteorological measurements from mobile and stationary devices (April-September 2016). Exposure to heat is compared between low-income and other neighbourhoods in these cities. Results are expressed in terms of air temperature and in terms of the thermal indices Heat Index (HI), Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at walking level. Conditions classified as dangerous to very dangerous, and likely to impede productivity, are observed almost every day of the measurement period during daytime, even when air temperature drops after the onset of the monsoon. It is recommended to cast heat warnings in terms of thermal indices instead of just temperature. Our results nuance the idea that people living in informal neighbourhoods are consistently more exposed to heat than people living in more prosperous neighbourhoods. During night-time, exposure does tend to be enhanced in densely-built informal neighbourhoods, but not if the low-income neighbourhoods are more open, or if they are embedded in green/blue areas.

We present here a transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish embryos exposed to different concentrations of PFOS (0.03-1.0 mg/L) from 48 to 120 hpf. No major survival or morphological alterations (swimming bladder inflation, kyphosis, eye separation and size...) were observed below the 1.0 mg/L mark. Conversely, we observed significant increase in transcripts related to lipid transport and metabolism even at the lowest used concentration. In addition, we observed a general decrease on transcripts related to natural immunity and defense again infections, which adds to the recent concerns about PFOS as immunotoxicant, particularly in humans. Derived PoD (Point of Departure) values for transcriptional changes (0.011 mg/L) were about 200-fold lower than the corresponding PoD values for morphometric effects (2.53 mg/L), and close to levels observed in human blood serum or bird eggs. Our data suggest that currently applicable tolerable levels of PFOS in commercial goods should be re-evaluated, taking into account its potential effects on lipid metabolism and the immune system.

Short-term effects of prescribed burning in Mediterranean pine plantations on surface runoff, soil erosion and water quality of runoff	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Prescribed fire; Runoff; Water quality; Soil erosion; Pine plantations	FORESTED WATERSHEDS; FIRE SEVERITY; INFILTRATION; REPELLENCY; SHRUBLAND; NUTRIENTS; IMPACTS; LOSSES; MATTER; STREAM	Fires are a complex phenomenon that may generate a chain of responses and processes that affect each part of the ecosystem. Thus, it is important to understand the magnitude of the impacts of fire on soil properties and the response of plants to this disturbance. For the moment, few studies have examined the effects of prescribed fire on large plots in afforested pine plantations in Mediterranean ecosystems. To fill this gap, the effects of a prescribed fire on runoff, soil erosion, and water quality for approximately one year after burning have been evaluated in pine plantations in south-eastern Spain. We constructed six erosion plots in the control area and six erosion plots in the burned area that were 4 m long and 2 m wide, immediately after the prescribed fire. Runoff, soil erosion and runoff water quality were studied after each rainy event in all plots. Our results reveal that prescribed fire did not significantly affect runoff and soil erosion when low intensity precipitations occur at pine plantations. In relation to water quality, water turbidity, salinity, pH, organic matter content and ionic substances concentrations increased immediately after prescribed burn, nevertheless these changes disappeared over time. We can conclude that prescribed fire can be a useful tool for fuel reduction in Mediterranean pine plantations without wide and long-term impacts to soil losses, or water quality.

Acute and sub-chronic toxicity bioassays of Olive Mill Wastewater on the Eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Bioassays; Biomarkers; Acute toxicity; Enzyme activities; LC50	OXIDATIVE STRESS; RIVER-BASINS; DNA-DAMAGE; FISH; WASTEWATERS; POLLUTION; RESPONSES; HYPOXIA; PHENOL; VALORISATION	Olive oil production generates large volumes of wastewaters mostly in peri-Mediterranean countries with adverse impacts on the biota of the receiving aquatic systems. Few studies have however documented its toxicity on aquatic species, with an almost total lack of relative studies on fish. We assessed the acute and sub-chronic OMW toxicity, as well as the acute and sub-chronic behavioural, morphological and biochemical effects of OMW exposure on the mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki. LC(50 )values of the acute bioassays ranged from 7.31% (24 h) to 6.38% (96 h). Behavioural symptoms of toxicity included hypoactivity and a shift away from the water surface, coupled with a range of morphological alterations, such as skin damage, excessive mucus secretion, hemorrhages, fin rot and exophhalmia, with indications also of gill swelling and anemia. Biochemical assays showed that OMW toxicity resulted in induction of catalase (CAT) and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. The implications of our results at the level of environmental policy for the sustainable management of the olive mill industry, i.e. the effective restriction of untreated OMW disposal of in adjacent waterways, as well as the implementation of new technologies that reduce their impact (detoxification and/or revalorization of its residues) are discussed.

Many studies have focused on either transgenerational or multigenerational mechanisms but did neglect the comparative aspects. This study assessed whether the pyrethroid insecticide etofenprox (formulation Trebon (R) 30 EC) shows transgenerational and/or multigenerational effects on the survival and reproduction of Folsomia candida (Collembola). The activation of stress-related genes was studied to detect whether etofenprox modifies the expression of reproduction-associated genes in trans- and multigenerational treatments. A laboratory study was carried out for three generations with five insecticide concentrations in LUFA 2.2 soil. In the transgenerational treatment, only the parent generation (P) was exposed, but the subsequent generations were not. In the multigenerational treatment, all three generations were exposed to the insecticide in the same manner. Multigenerational exposure resulted in reduced reproduction effects over generations, suggesting that F. candida is capable of acclimating to enhanced concentration levels of etofenprox during prolonged exposure over multiple generations. In the transgenerational treatment, the heat shock protein 70 was up-regulated and cytochrome oxidase 6N4v1 expression down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in the F2 generation. This finding raises the possibility of the epigenetic inheritance of insecticide impacts on parents. Furthermore, CYP6N4v1 expression was oppositely regulated in the trans- and multigenerational treatments. Our results draw attention to the differences in molecular level responses of F. candida to trans- and multigenerational etofenprox exposure.

Assessment of specific antibodies as biological indicators of human chronic exposure to microcystins	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Lake; Cyanobacteria; Microcystins; Human exposure; Chronic toxicity; Human antibodies; Biomarker	PRIMARY LIVER-CANCER; DRINKING-WATER; CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS; CYANOTOXINS; HEALTH; SERUM; INTOXICATION; AUTOIMMUNE; ARGENTINA; RISK	Cyanobacteria can produce potent natural toxins known as cyanotoxins. Blooms of cyanobacteria, produced mainly as result of the pollution of water bodies with excessive amounts of phosphorus, represent a severe environmental problem; not only do they affect the normal equilibrium of the aquatic ecosystem but may also affect animal and human health. The occurrence of algal blooms have been increasing globally (it has been recently reported in at least 100 countries) and it has been considered by WHO as an emerging public health issue. The toxic effects of cyanotoxins have been thoroughly demonstrated in laboratory experiments, however, the effects on humans and the extent of these effects have been more difficult to assess. Epidemiological research is difficult as there are no specific symptoms or routine biomarkers to diagnose intoxication with cyanotoxins, in particular those cases associated with chronic exposure. The objectives of this study were to assess the exposure of a population settled near a lake with recurrent cyanobacteria blooms and to investigate the presence of biological markers of chronic exposure to cyanotoxins, in particular the microcystins (MCs). We first investigated the exposure of the population to cyanobacteria by using a questionnaire on how the population used the water and by analyzing water samples for the presence of cyanobacteria and total microcystins (TMCs). Secondly, we investigated the presence of biological indicators by analyzing the biochemical and immunological parameters in sera of the exposed population. The questionnaires and the water analyses revealed that the population under study (n = 47) is exposed to several exposure routes. The biochemical analyses of the sera showed the alteration of at least one hepatic enzyme in 25% of the exposed people, but this cannot be associated solely to MCs exposure. On the contrary, the immunological analyses, which included microcystin-LR specific antibodies IgE and IgG, showed significant differences between the exposed and non-exposed groups. The presence of MCs specific antibodies confirms the exposure to MCs. We propose the study of specific antibodies as a non-complex biomarker to detect chronic exposure to the toxin and to assist epidemiological studies.

Here, effects of the yearly application of two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and dinotefuran on aquatic insect communities of experimental rice fields were assessed during two years of monitoring. Both neonicotinoid-treated fields and controls were monitored biweekly throughout the 5-month experimental period until harvest (late October) in each year. Maximum concentrations of imidacloprid (157.5 mu g/l in 2014 and 138.0 mu g/l in 2015) and dinotefuran (10.54 mu g/l in 2014 and 54.05 mu g/l in 2015) in water were relatively similar in both years, but maximum residues of imidacloprid (245.45 mu g/kg) and dinotefuran (419.5 mu g/kg) in the sediment in the second-year were 18 and 175 times higher than in the first year, respectively, with great variability of concentrations among sampling dates. In addition, remaining soil residues of both neonicotinoids were approximately 1 mu g/kg (ppb) at the start of the second-year. A total of 6265 individuals of 18 aquatic species belonging to 7 orders were collected. No differences in the number of species between controls and the two neonicotinoids-treated paddies were found between years. However, clear differences in community structures of aquatic insects among the imidacloprid- and dinotefuran-treated mesocosms, and controls and between years were shown by PRC analysis. In particular, imidacloprid likely decreased Crocothemisia servilia mariannae nymphs, Chironominae spp. larvae, and Aedes albopictus larvae, whereas dinotefuran tended to decrease Guignotus japonicus, Orthetrwn albistylum speciosum nymphs, and Tubiificidae spp. In addition, long-living species of Coleoptera and Odonata were most sensitive to both neonicotinoids. Changes in composition of feeding functional groups (FFGs) of aquatic insects were more prominent in the first year and became subtler in the second year. One of the possibilities of this phenomenon may be functional redundancy in which species that had low sensitivity to imidacloprid and dinotefuran replaced the vacant niche caused by decreases of other species with high susceptibility within the same feeding functions, although further studies are needed to verify this explanation. Thus, feeding functional traits can be a good indicator for evaluation of changes in ecosystem processes under pesticides exposures. Consequently, the current study emphasized that more realistic prediction of community properties after the repeated application of agrochemicals in successive years should consider for 1) long-term population monitoring, 2) cumulative effects at least over the years, and 3) species' functional traits.

Does plant biomass partitioning reflect energetic investments in carbon and nutrient foraging?	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						energy partitioning; plant biomass partitioning; root and soil respiration; root mass fraction; root mutualist microbes; total below-ground carbon allocation	PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY-FIXED CARBON; LOLIUM-PERENNE; ELEVATED CO2; ROOT RESPIRATION; MYCORRHIZAL COLONIZATION; PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; ALLOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; SOIL RESPIRATION; FUNGAL SYMBIONT	Studies of plant resource-use strategies along environmental gradients often assume that dry matter partitioning represents an individual's energy investment in foraging for above- versus below-ground resources. However, ecosystem-level studies of total below-ground carbon allocation (TBCA) in forests do not support the equivalency of energy (carbon) and dry matter partitioning, in part because allocation of carbon to below-ground pools and fluxes that are not accounted for by root biomass (e.g., mycorrhizal hyphae, rhizodeposition; root and soil respiration) can be substantial. Here, we apply this reasoning to individual plants in controlled environments and ask whether dry matter partitioning below-ground (root mass fraction, RMF) accurately reflects TBCA in studies of optimal partitioning theory. We quantified the relationship between RMF and TBCA in individual plants, using 311 observations from 51 studies that simultaneously measured both allocation variables. Our analysis included tests of whether the RMF-TBCA relationship depended on mutualist soil microbes, plant growth form, age and study methodology including isotopic pulse-chase duration. We found that RMF was a poor proxy for below-ground energy investment. This disconnect of RMF and TBCA was driven in part by plants of low RMF (<0.4) exhibiting significantly higher rates of root and soil respiration per unit root mass than plants of high RMF. Root colonization by mutualist microbes, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, increased TBCA by 5%-7%, and TBCA was lower in grasses than other species by 9%-16%. These patterns were evident for relationships assessed both within and between species. We conclude that optimal partitioning studies of plants along environmental gradients are likely to underestimate plant energy allocation below-ground if the C costs of root and soil respiration are ignored, especially under conditions favouring low RMF. Because energy rather than biomass better reflects how assimilated C supports fitness, this omission of respired C suggests existing studies misrepresent the significance of below-ground processes to plant function.

However, few studies have moved beyond measuring biodiversity as species richness of a single group and/or focusing on a single ecosystem function. While there is a growing recognition that along environmental gradients, the compositional turnover of multiple trophic groups influences not only productivity but multiple ecosystem functions, we do not know yet which components of multi-trophic beta-diversity influence which ecosystem functions. Here, we captured the biodiversity found in soils using environmental DNA to study total soil multi-trophic beta-diversity (between all taxa regardless of their trophic group association), horizontal beta-diversities (beta-diversities within trophic groups) and vertical beta-diversity (beta-diversity across trophic groups) along a 1,000 m elevational gradient in the French Alps. Using path analyses, we quantified how these beta-diversity components mediate the effects of environmental turnover on the turnover of multiple ecosystem functions (i.e. productivity, N-cycling, N-leaching) and overall multifunctionality. While we found a strong direct effect of soil properties on the turnover of multiple ecosystem functions, we also found an indirect effect of climate and soil properties through multi-trophic beta-diversity. More specifically, only total multi-trophic beta-diversity and the horizontal beta-diversity of saprophytic fungi were strongly related to the turnover of multifunctionality and, to a lower extent, the turnover of productivity and N-cycling. Our results suggest that decomposition processes and resulting nutrient availability are key to understand how ecosystem functions change along soil properties and climatic gradients in alpine ecosystems. By demonstrating how saprophytic fungi and their associated trophic groups can offset the direct responses of multiple ecosystem functions to environmental change, our study highlights the paramount importance of multi-trophic diversity for better understanding ecosystem multifunctionality in a changing world.

However, the persistence of family groups has never been considered a viable mechanism of structure, nor has it been measured. We analyzed genetic similarity among 280 yellowfin tunas from seven population samples collected in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) using single nucleotide polymorphisms, and found population structure that was significantly explained by the presence of 96 individuals involved in 332 half or full sib dyads. We found significantly higher mean and median relatedness between individuals from the same sample groups, compared to individuals from different groups; and high relatedness between individuals caught at the same fish-aggregating device (FAD) than between those caught in the wider exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Alternatively, the EEZ of the Federated States of Micronesia may harbor exceptionally large numbers of close kin. We conclude that yellowfin directly school with related individuals through their first year, and at least demonstrate tightly overlapping regional fidelity as adults. These results may explain, to some extent, the patterns of population genetic structure recently observed in yellowfin tuna.

However, it is unclear to what extent the processes that shape the distribution of diversity in plants and animals also apply to micro-organisms. Major diversification events in multicellular organisms have often been attributed to long-term climatic and geological processes, but the impact of such processes on protist diversity has received much less attention as their distribution has often been believed to be largely cosmopolitan. Here, we quantified phylogeographical patterns in Hyalosphenia papilio, a large testate amoeba restricted to Holarctic Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, to test if the current distribution of its genetic diversity can be explained by historical factors or by the current distribution of suitable habitats. Phylogenetic diversity was higher in Western North America, corresponding to the inferred geographical origin of the H. papilio complex, and was lower in Eurasia despite extensive suitable habitats. These results suggest that patterns of phylogenetic diversity and distribution can be explained by the history of Holarctic Sphagnum peatland range expansions and contractions in response to Quaternary glaciations that promoted cladogenetic range evolution, rather than the contemporary distribution of suitable habitats. Species distributions were positively correlated with climatic niche breadth, suggesting that climatic tolerance is key to dispersal ability in H. papilio. This implies that, at least for large and specialized terrestrial micro-organisms, propagule dispersal is slow enough that historical processes may contribute to their diversification and phylogeographical patterns and may partly explain their very high overall diversity.

Nevertheless, the long-term evolution of these effects is unknown and of critical importance because biochar persists in soil for centuries. We selected nine charcoal kiln sites (CKS) from forests (four sites) and croplands (five sites) and determined the microbial properties of their topsoil, largely enriched with charcoal for > 150 years. Adjacent soils were used as references unaffected by charcoal production. Soils were incubated in controlled conditions and emissions of CO2 were measured for 138 days. At day 68, an aliquot was sampled from each soil to determine microbial abundance and community structure by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Before the extraction, one standard PLFA (C21:0 PC) was added to the soil to test the influence of charcoal on PLFAs recovery. The content of uncharred SOC and pH explained a main part of the variance of soil CO2 emissions, which supports the view that charcoal had a limited effect on soil respiration. The recovery of C21:0 PC was increased in presence of aged charcoal, which contrasts with the decreased recovery recorded shortly after biochar application. This underlines that properties of charcoal evolve dramatically over time, and that a long-term vision is critical in the perspective of amending soils with biochar. Land-use had an overriding control on the microbial community structure, surpassing the effect of a vast amount of charcoal present in the soil. In forests, 10 PLFAs from gram positive and general bacteria were significantly different between CKS and adjacent reference soils, whereas in croplands only four PLFAs from fungi, gram negative bacteria and actinomycetes were significantly affected. These results suggest that the long-term effect of charcoal on soil microbiota is overwritten by management practices. Biochar properties must therefore be regarded altogether with soil conditions to correctly design a successful soil amendment with biochar. Additionally, the absence of a relationship between individual PLFAs and charcoal-C supports the idea that the long-term effect of charcoal is related to a modification of soil ecological niche (e.g., nutrient availability, pH) rather than to an alteration of the source of organic C available to biota.

The last remnants of the European Pleistocene megafauna that survived into the Holocene were particularly vulnerable to changes in habitat. To track the response of habitat use and foraging of large herbivores to natural and anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions during the Holocene, we investigated carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope composition in bone collagen of moose (Alces alces), European bison (Bison bonasus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) in Central and Eastern Europe. We found strong variations in isotope compositions in the studied species throughout the Holocene and diverse responses to changing environmental conditions. All three species showed significant changes in their delta C-13 values reflecting a shift of foraging habitats from more open in the Early and pre-Neolithic Holocene to more forest during the Neolithic and Late Holocene. This shift was strongest in European bison, suggesting higher plasticity, more limited in moose, and the least in aurochs. Significant increases of delta N-15 values in European bison and moose are evidence of a diet change towards more grazing, but may also reflect increased nitrogen in soils following deglaciation and global temperature increases. Among the factors explaining the observed isotope variations were time (age of samples), longitude and elevation in European bison, and time, longitude and forest cover in aurochs. None of the analysed factors explained isotope variations in moose. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of natural (forest expansion) and anthropogenic (deforestation and human pressure) changes on the foraging ecology of large herbivores, with forests playing a major role as a refugial habitat since the Neolithic, particularly for European bison and aurochs.

Agronomic conservation strategies such as increasing plant diversity at field scale and minimizing soil disturbances such as tillage aim at fostering the presence of beneficial microbial communities to support intrinsic agroecosystem functions and reduce the reliance on agrochemicals and mechanical soil management. However, it remains poorly understood how these positive contributions are modulated by the pedological context. Moreover, only few studies have assessed the management-dependent responses of microbial communities in real-life farming systems. Here, in close association with the farmers and under realistic field conditions, we explored the response of bacterial and fungal community structure to conventional and conservation (using agroecological principles) management regimes across two pedological sites (loamy sand and sandy loam) in Belgium. Microbial diversity was assessed using a DNA metabarcoding approach of ribosomal markers with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Our results show that different management approaches select for distinct soil microbial communities and that these management-related effects were modulated by the pedological context. Therefore, designing new agricultural systems to foster the presence of beneficial organisms and reduce the level of pathogenic organisms should account for variability in the underlying pedological context.

Modeling current and potential distributions of mammal species using presence-only data: A case study on British deer	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						citizen science; deer; disease; risk assessment; species distribution modeling; wildlife management	CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA; WILD DEER; CONSERVATION; BIAS; PREDICTION; INFECTION; IMPACT	Aim Decisions on wildlife conservation, management, and epidemiological risk are best based on robust evidence. The continual improvement of species distributions, such that they can be relied upon in decision-making, is important. Here we seek to refine aspects of a generic modelling approach and improve the utility of species distribution maps. Location Great Britain (GB). Methods We applied a modeling framework based on hierarchical Bayesian species distribution models exploiting opportunistic occurrence records from citizen science datasets to predict both current and potential distributions for each of the six deer species known to be present in GB. Using the resulting maps, we performed a simple analysis of the overlap between species to illustrate possible contact, which we interpret as the relative risk of potential disease spread given an introduction. Results Predicted distribution maps showed good agreement with the broader scale occurrence reported by a recent national deer survey with an average True Skill Statistics and AUC of 0.69 and 0.89, respectively. Aggregation of the maps for all species highlighted regions of central and eastern England as well as parts of Scotland where extensive areas of range overlap could result in interspecific contact with consequences for risk assessments for diseases of deer. However, if populations are allowed to expand to their predicted potential, then areas of overlap, and therefore disease interspecific transmission risk, will become extensive and widespread across all of mainland Britain. Main conclusions The generic modeling approach outlined performed well across all of the deer species tested, offering a robust and reliable tool through which current and potential animal distributions can be estimated and presented. Our application, intended to inform quantitative risk assessments, demonstrates the practical use of such outputs to generate the valuable evidence required to inform policy decisions on issues such as management strategy.

Parasite infections in a social carnivore: Evidence of their fitness consequences and factors modulating infection load	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						fitness; gastrointestinal parasites; juvenile survival; resistance; Serengeti ecosystem; spotted hyena; tolerance	SERENGETI SPOTTED HYAENAS; HYENA CROCUTA-CROCUTA; COMMUTING SYSTEM; MIGRATORY PREY; PREDATOR COPES; TRADE-OFFS; INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; ANCYLOSTOMA-CANINUM; NEMATODE PARASITISM; SIBLING AGGRESSION	There are substantial individual differences in parasite composition and infection load in wildlife populations. Few studies have investigated the factors shaping this heterogeneity in large wild mammals or the impact of parasite infections on Darwinian fitness, particularly in juveniles. A host's parasite composition and infection load can be shaped by factors that determine contact with infective parasite stages and those that determine the host's resistance to infection, such as abiotic and social environmental factors, and age. Host-parasite interactions and synergies between coinfecting parasites may also be important. We test predictions derived from these different processes to investigate factors shaping infection loads (fecal egg/oocyte load) of two energetically costly gastrointestinal parasites: the hookworm Ancylostoma and the intracellular Cystoisospora, in juvenile spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti National Park, in Tanzania. We also assess whether parasite infections curtail survival to adulthood and longevity. Ancylostoma and Cystoisospora infection loads declined as the number of adult clan members increased, a result consistent with an encounter-reduction effect whereby adults reduced encounters between juveniles and infective larvae, but were not affected by the number of juveniles in a clan. Infection loads decreased with age, possibly because active immune responses to infection improved with age. Differences in parasite load between clans possibly indicate variation in abiotic environmental factors between clan den sites. The survival of juveniles (<365 days old) to adulthood decreased with Ancylostoma load, increased with age, and was modulated by maternal social status. High-ranking individuals with low Ancylostoma loads had a higher survivorship during the first 4 years of life than high-ranking individuals with high Ancylostoma loads. These findings suggest that high infection loads with energetically costly parasites such as hookworms during early life can have negative fitness consequences.

The semi-enclosed Gulf of Corinth, Greece, has been identified as an Important Marine Mammal Area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Marine Mammal Protected Areas Task Force, based on the regular occurrence of odontocete populations. A 7-year (2011-17) dataset of boat-based surveys was used to model and predict the distribution of striped dolphins, Stenella coeruleoalba, common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, and common bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, in the entire Gulf (2400 km(2)). Multiple geographic, bathymetric, oceanographic, and anthropogenic variables were incorporated in a combined generalized additive model and generalized estimation equation (GAM-GEE) framework to describe dolphin occurrence and produce distribution maps. Modelling indicated that striped and common dolphins prefer deep waters (>300 m) in the central and southern part of the Gulf, whereas bottlenose dolphins prefer shallow waters (<300 m) and areas close to fish farms along the northern-central shore. Model-based maps of the predicted distribution identified a preferred habitat encompassing most of the Gulf, also revealing: (i) hot spots of dolphin distribution covering about 40% of the Gulf's surface; (ii) an almost complete overlap of striped and common dolphin distribution, consistent with the hypothesis that common dolphins modified their habitat preferences to live in mixed species groups with striped dolphins; (iii) a clear partitioning of striped/common and bottlenose dolphin habitat; and (iv) the important role played by fish farms for bottlenose dolphins, consistent with studies conducted elsewhere in Greece. Evidence provided by this study calls for area-specific and species-specific management measures to mitigate anthropogenic impacts.

Wildfire alters the structure and seasonal dynamics of nocturnal pollen-transport networks	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						disturbance; ecological networks; fire; flowering plants; Lepidoptera; Mediterranean; moths; pollination	FLOWER VISITATION; BRITISH MOTHS; FIRE; LEPIDOPTERA; POLLINATION; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATION; VEGETATION; FREQUENCY	Wildfires drive global biodiversity patterns and affect plant-pollinator interactions, and are expected to become more frequent and severe under climate change. Post-fire plant communities often have increased floral abundance and diversity, but the effects of wildfires on the ecological process of pollination are poorly understood. Nocturnal moths are globally important pollinators, but no previous study has examined the effects of wildfire on nocturnal pollination interactions. We investigated the effects of wildfire on nocturnal pollen-transport networks. We analysed the abundance and species richness of moths and flowers, and the structure of these networks, at three burned and three unburned sites in Portugal for two years, starting eight months after a large fire. Nocturnal pollen-transport networks had lower complexity and robustness following the fire than at nearby unburned sites. Overall, 70% of individual moths carried pollen, and moths were found to be transporting pollen from 83% of the flower species present. Burned sites had significantly more abundant flowers, but less abundant and species-rich moths. Individual moths transported more pollen in summer at burned sites, but less in winter; however, total pollen transport by the moth assemblage at burned sites was just 20% of that at unburned sites. Interaction turnover between burned and unburned networks was high. Negative effects of fire upon moths will likely permeate to other taxa through loss of mutualisms. Therefore, if wildfires become more frequent under climate change, community resilience may be eroded. Understanding the responses of ecological networks to wildfire can inform management that promotes resilience and facilitates whole-ecosystem conservation.

Using an extensive dataset (1897-2017) in the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States, we examined changes in annual dry season length, total precipitation, and (since 1945) the seasonal distribution of thunder-days as a correlate of lightning activity. We found that across the entire region, the dry season has lengthened by as much as 156 days (130% over 120 years), both starting earlier and ending later with less total precipitation. Less rainfall over a longer dry season, with no change in seasonal thunderstorm patterns, likely increases both the potential for lightning-ignited wildfires and fire severity. Global climate change could be having a hitherto undetected influence on fire regimes by altering the synchrony of climatic seasonal parameters.

An understanding of wildlife population responses to pine beetle outbreaks is needed to inform habitat conservation strategies. We monitored 355 nests of 5 woodpecker species during 2 sampling periods, before (2003-2006) and after (2009-2014) the peak of a pine beetle outbreak in dry mixed conifer forest of Montana, USA. Three of 5 woodpecker species represented the beetle-foraging group: American three-toed (Picoides dorsalis), hairy (Dryobates villosus), and downy (D. pubescens) woodpeckers. The other 2 species studied were northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), a foraging and habitat generalist, and red-naped sapsucker (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), a sap forager and bark-gleaning insectivore. We analyzed daily survival rate of nests in relation to pine beetle outbreak (445,000 ha) severity and timing, along with covariates unrelated to the outbreak (temp, nest height, and nest tree diameter). Our results provided stronger evidence for relationships between woodpecker nest survival and the non-outbreak variables than those associated with outbreaks. Our results indicated limited support for nest survival relationships with beetle severity (annual and cumulative pine tree mortality at 0.81-ha and 314-ha scales). Nevertheless, we observed a significant increase in densities of hatched nests for beetle-foraging woodpeckers following the outbreak. Our results suggest that woodpeckers, particularly beetle foragers, respond numerically to pine beetle outbreaks through increased nesting densities more so than functionally via nest survival.

Here we evaluate the influence of temperature and landscape variables on genetic connectivity and signatures of local adaptation in Phaulacridium vittatum, a widespread agricultural pest grasshopper, endemic to Australia. With sampling across a 900-km latitudinal gradient, we genotyped 185 P. vittatum from 19 sites at 11,408 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using ddRAD sequencing. Despite high gene flow across sites (pairwise F-ST = 0.0003-0.08), landscape genetic resistance modelling identified a positive nonlinear effect of mean annual temperature on genetic connectivity. Urban areas and water bodies had a greater influence on genetic distance among sites than pasture, agricultural areas and forest. Together, F-ST outlier tests and environmental association analysis (EAA) detected 242 unique SNPs under putative selection, with the highest numbers associated with latitude, mean annual temperature and body size. A combination of landscape genetic connectivity analysis together with EAA identified mean annual temperature as a key driver of both neutral gene flow and environmental selection processes. Gene annotation of putatively adaptive SNPs matched with gene functions for olfaction, metabolic detoxification and ultraviolet light shielding. Our results imply that this widespread agricultural pest has the potential to spread and adapt under shifting temperature regimes and land cover change.

Yet there is a lack of research comparing carbon and macronutrient stocks in P. australis with resident plant communities, such as cattail and meadow marsh. We quantified the effect of P. australis invasion on carbon and macronutrient standing stocks in a freshwater coastal marsh by comparing the above- and belowground biomass, tissue nutrient concentrations, and annual nutrient standing stocks in marsh invaded by P. australis with cattail marsh (dominated by Typha spp.) and meadow marsh (dominated by Calamagrostis canadensis), which are being displaced by P. australis in Lake Erie coastal marsh. We conclude that the effect of P. australis invasion on carbon and macronutrient standing stocks is dependent on the plant community being replaced. The annual standing stock of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are consistent between cattail marsh and P. australis-invaded marsh, though cattail marsh contains more magnesium (112% mean increase) and calcium (364% mean increase). In contrast, when P. australis replaces meadow marsh, the standing stocks of all measured nutrients and carbon increase significantly (103-188% mean increase). Our study highlights that plant invasions may create trade-offs between ecosystem services. In our case, the increase in nutrient standing stocks when P. australis invades meadow marsh should be weighed against the documented reductions in biodiversity and habitat value.

On the Influence of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem Habitats on Peracarid Crustacean Assemblages in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation Regulatory Area	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						vulnerable marine ecosystem; Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation; porifera; coral; macrofauna; peracarida; species distribution modelling; deep sea	DEEP-WATER CORALS; HIGHER-TAXON RICHNESS; SEA SPONGE GROUNDS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; HEXACTINELLID SPONGE; SACKVILLE SPUR; FLEMISH PASS; GRAND-BANKS; BIODIVERSITY; PROTECTION	Vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) are considered hotspots of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the deep sea, but are also characterised by a high vulnerability to disturbance and a low recovery potential. Since 2006, a series of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions have been developed, attempting to ensure the protection of VMEs in international waters. In the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) Regulatory Area, large areas of seabed have been closed to bottom-contact fishing to protect VMEs. However, knowledge of the influence of VME-indicator taxa on macrofaunal assemblages, and the appropriateness of current fishery closures for protecting macrofaunal biodiversity in this area is limited. Here we investigate relationships between the prevalence of VME-indicator taxa [poriferans (sponges), gorgonian corals, and pennatulaceans (sea pens)] and an extensive suite of peracarid crustacean biodiversity metrics in the NAFO Regulatory Area. We also examine whether the current NAFO VME closures protect areas of significantly elevated peracarid diversity. Of the VME-indicator taxa analysed, poriferans were found to have by far the greatest influence over peracarid assemblages. Assemblage structure was altered, and peracarid abundance, biomass, richness, diversity, and variability were enhanced in areas of elevated poriferan biomass, whilst assemblage evenness was slightly depressed in these areas. These findings reaffirm the perception of poriferans as crucial components of VMEs. In contrast, gorgonian coral density had little influence over the faunal assemblages investigated, perhaps reflecting their relatively low prevalence in the study area. Similarly, pennatulaceans were found to influence peracarid assemblages only weakly. This too may reflect a moderately low density of Pennatulacea in the study area. Our results highlight that the application of taxon distribution model outputs to ecological investigations and management decisions in data-limited environments should be treated with caution. Finally, our results indicate that the current system of fishery closures in the NAFO Regulatory Area may not be optimal in terms of providing adequate protection to VMEs against the impacts of bottom trawling.

Here, two mixture methods were applied to natural chemical markers (delta O-18 and delta C-13) in otoliths (ear stones) to comprehensively investigate the nature and degree of transoceanic movement and mixing of eastern and western populations in several areas of the North Atlantic Ocean that potentially represent mixing hotspots. Areas investigated occurred on both sides of the 45 degrees W management boundary as well as waters off the coast of Africa (Morocco, Canary Islands) where both populations are known to occur. Projections of population composition (i.e., natal or nursery origin) from a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) classification method with different probability thresholds were generally in agreement with maximum likelihood estimates from the commonly used mixed-population program HISEA; however, predicted contributions for the less abundant population were occasionally higher for MLR estimates. Both MLR and HISEA clearly showed that mixing of Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Central North Atlantic Ocean was highly variable from year to year with expatriates of eastern or western origin commonly crossing into the other management area. Pronounced transoceanic movement and mixing of western migrants was also present off the coast of Africa, with the occurrence of western migrants in the Canary Islands and Morocco ranging from zero to the majority of the individuals assayed for the years examined. Results indicate highly variable rates of movement and population exchange for Atlantic bluefin tuna, highlighting the need for temporally resolved estimates of natal origin in mixing hotspots to improve population models used to evaluate the status of this threatened species.

Here, we examined the relationship between functional connectivity (gene flow) and structural connectivity (area and spatial configuration of habitats) in three co-occurring short-range plant taxa in an ancient terrestrial island system. Location Low-altitude mountain range south-western Australia. Methods We analysed spatial patterns of genetic differentiation at nuclear microsatellite loci using Bayesian clustering. Circuit theory modelling was used to generate all possible pathways that connect populations as resistance distance matrices based on two surfaces for each taxon. The first surface assumes a flat terrain and tests whether genetic similarity declines only with distance-isolation by distance (IBD). The second surface is habitat suitability based on species distribution modelling (SDM), which tests whether genetic similarity is a function of connected and suitable habitat. Multiple matrix regression with randomization was used to test the significance of the resistance distance matrices at predicting two metrics of genetic differentiation (F-ST and D-EST). Variance explained was partitioned using redundancy analysis. Results Genetic structure for the insect-pollinated taxa-Acacia adinophylla-and Tetratheca aphylla subsp. aphylla was at similar spatial scales. Unexpectedly, a higher level of genetic structure was found in the wind-pollinated Lepidosperma bungalbin. IBD best explained the gene flow of A. adinophylla (R-2 = 0.41-0.43) with partial support provided by habitat suitability (R-2 = 0.04-0.07). In contrast, connectivity by habitat suitability was highest for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla (R-2 = 0.56-0.59). Drivers of L. bungalbin connectivity were inconsistent between the two measures of genetic differentiation. Main conclusions Gene flow is facilitated by different factors for the three taxa. Habitat fragmentation would most strongly impede gene flow for T. aphylla subsp. aphylla. Geographical distance cannot be assumed as the sole or best determinant of gene flow among populations, nor can findings be generalized to coexisting taxa.

The unprecedented loss of Florida's reef-building corals and the emergence of a novel coral-reef assemblage	ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						coral reefs; coral restoration; ecosystem stability; Florida; Holocene; species composition; western Atlantic	ALTERNATIVE STATES; WESTERN ATLANTIC; STAGHORN CORAL; ST-CROIX; SHIFTS; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; ACCRETION; MORTALITY; CARBONATE	Over the last half century, climate change, coral disease, and other anthropogenic disturbances have restructured coral-reef ecosystems on a global scale. The disproportionate loss of once-dominant, reef-building taxa has facilitated relative increases in the abundance of "weedy" or stress-tolerant coral species. Although the recent transformation of coral-reef assemblages is unprecedented on ecological timescales, determining whether modern coral reefs have truly reached a novel ecosystem state requires evaluating the dynamics of reef composition over much longer periods of time. Here, we provide a geologic perspective on the shifting composition of Florida's reefs by reconstructing the millennial-scale spatial and temporal variability in reef assemblages using 59 Holocene reef cores collected throughout the Florida Keys Reef Tract (FKRT). We then compare the relative abundances of reef-building species in the Holocene reef framework to data from contemporary reef surveys to determine how much Florida's modern reef assemblages have diverged from long-term baselines. We show that the composition of Florida's reefs was, until recently, remarkably stable over the last 8000 yr. The same corals that have dominated shallow-water reefs throughout the western Atlantic for hundreds of thousands of years, Acropora palmata, Orbicella spp., and other massive coral taxa, accounted for nearly 90% of Florida's Holocene reef framework. In contrast, the species that now have the highest relative abundances on the FKRT, primarily Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea, were rare in the reef framework, suggesting that recent shifts in species assemblages are unprecedented over millennial timescales. Although it may not be possible to return coral reefs to pre-Anthropocene states, our results suggest that coral-reef management focused on the conservation and restoration of the reef-building species of the past, will optimize efforts to preserve coral reefs, and the valuable ecosystem services they provide into the future.

Sublethal effects of natural parasitism act through maternal, but not paternal; reproductive success in a wild population	ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						breeding success; endoparasites; fitness; life history; macroparasites; maternal; nematodes; parasitism; paternal; reproduction; sex differences; trade-off	TRADE-OFFS; RESPONSES; AGE; IMMUNOLOGY; SEABIRD; SHAPE	Parasites are a major component of all animal populations. Males and females often differ in their levels of parasite prevalence, potentially leading to sex differences in the impact of parasitism on fitness, with important implications for the evolution of parasite and host traits including resistance, tolerance, and virulence. However, quantitative measures of the impact of parasitism under free-living conditions are extremely rare, as they require detailed host demographic data with measures of parasite burden over time. Here, we use endoscopy for direct quantification of natural-parasite burdens and relate these to reproductive success over 7 yr in a wild population of seabirds. Contrary to predictions, only female burdens were associated with negative impacts of parasitism on breeding success, despite males having significantly higher burdens. Female reproductive success declined by 30% across the range of natural parasite burdens. These effects persisted when accounting for interannual population differences in breeding success. Our results provide quantitative estimates of profound sub-lethal effects of parasitism on the population. Importantly, they highlight how parasites act unpredictably to shape ecological and evolutionary processes in different components of the same population, with implications for demography and selection on host and parasite traits.

Independent lineages in a common environment: the roles of determinism and contingency in shaping the migration timing of even- versus odd-year pink salmon over broad spatial and temporal scales	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access						Contingency; convergent evolution; determinism; evolutionary history; migration timing; non-parallel evolution; parallel evolution; phenology; pink salmon; run timing	ONCORHYNCHUS-GORBUSCHA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; LIFE-HISTORY; UNIQUE FEATURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; BODY-SIZE; ADAPTATION; SELECTION	Studies of parallel evolution are seldom able to disentangle the influence of cryptic environmental variation from that of evolutionary history; whereas the unique life history of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) presents an opportunity to do so. All pink salmon mature at age two and die after breeding. Hence, pink salmon bred in even years are completely reproductively isolated from those bred in odd years, even if the two lineages bred in same location. We used time series (mean = 7 years, maximum = 74 years) of paired even- and odd-year populations from 36 rivers spanning over 2000 km to explore parallelism in migration timing, a trait with a strong genetic basis. Migration timing was highly parallel, being determined almost entirely by local environmental differences among rivers. Interestingly, interannual changes in migration timing different somewhat between lineages. Overall, our findings indicate very strong determinism, with only a minor contribution of contingency.

Individual niche trajectories drive fitness variation	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						body condition; individual specialization; Leptodactylus; parasites; reproductive investment; stable isotopes; trophic niche	TEMPORAL VARIATION; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; RESOURCE USE; HABITAT USE; DIET; SPECIALIZATION; PREY; MODELS; SIZE; LEPTODACTYLIDAE	Variation in fitness across individuals is central to population growth, species coexistence and evolution by natural selection. Fitness variation associated with resource use is hugely consequential, but how this variation is generated and maintained within natural populations remains unclear. In particular, individual fitness may depend on many cumulative foraging decisions over time, but this hypothesis remains untested. We used multi-tissue stable isotope analysis to determine isotopic niche trajectories within species, populations and sexes of thin-toed frogs and explored how this temporal dimension of diet affects individual reproductive investment, body condition and parasite load. We found that individual frogs shifted their diets less than expected under a null model, likely due to functional trade-offs that limit the incorporation of new prey types over time. However, within the observed range of diet shifts, individuals that modified their diet to a greater degree exhibited higher fitness, although this effect was sex-dependent. We suggest that these different relationships between isotopic niche trajectory length and fitness within thin-toed frogs are driven by variability in the resource environment, negative density dependence and allometric constraints. These strong fitness effects suggest that the temporal dimension of diet change is a potential target of natural selection and, therefore, could drive correlated evolution in phenotypic traits underlying diet flexibility. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the understanding of ecological and evolutionary consequences of niche variation by demonstrating that temporal variation in foraging consistency within populations leads to different fitness pay-offs.

However, the initial evolution and maintenance of aposematism are paradoxical because conspicuous prey are vulnerable to attack by naive predators. Consequently, the evolution of aposematic signal mimicry is also difficult to explain. The cost of conspicuousness can be reduced if predators learn about novel aposematic prey by observing another predator's response to that same prey. On the other hand, observing positive foraging events might also inform predators about the presence of undefended mimics, accelerating predation on both mimics and their defended models. It is currently unknown, however, how personal and social information combines to affect the fitness of aposematic prey. For example, does social information become more useful when predators have already ingested toxins and need to minimize further consumption? We investigated how toxin load influences great tits' (Parus major) likelihood to use social information about novel aposematic prey, and how it alters predation risk for undefended mimics. Birds were first provided with mealworms injected with bitter-tasting chloroquine (or a water-injected control), before information about a novel unpalatable prey phenotype was provided via video playback (either prey alone, or of a great tit tasting the noxious prey). An experimentally increased toxin load made great tits warier to attack prey, but only if they lacked social information about unpalatable prey. Socially educated birds consumed fewer aposematic prey relative to a cryptic phenotype, regardless of toxin load. In contrast, after personally experiencing aposematic prey, birds ignored social information about palatable mimics and were hesitant to sample them. Our results suggest that social information use by predators could be a powerful force in facilitating the evolution of aposematism as it reduces predation pressure on aposematic prey, regardless of a predator's toxin load. Nevertheless, observing foraging events of others is unlikely to alter frequency-dependent dynamics among models and mimics, although this may depend on predators having recent personal experience of the model's unpalatability.

This issue is particularly relevant for traits related to growth and anti-herbivore defence of plants, because both sets of traits are closely tied to fitness, and because being sessile organisms, plants tend to experience strong local selection. Despite widespread recognition that the abiotic environment imposes selection on plant traits, how temperature and water availability independently select for allocation to growth and defence against herbivores is not well-resolved, and even more so, when considering under-ground herbivory and tritrophic interactions involving plant herbivores and their predators. To address heritable, climate-driven variation in root traits mediating tritrophic interactions, we performed a common garden experiment with four populations of common red fescue (Festuca rubra) encompassing the four corners of a precipitation by temperature gradient matrix. We found that plants originating from wetter and warmer conditions, in addition to producing more biomass, also produced a blend of volatile organic compounds more attractive for predatory nematodes of root insect herbivores. Moreover, across populations, variation in nematode attraction was mediated by balancing the emissions of attractive and repulsive volatile compounds. Our work builds towards better understanding how plant adaptation to climate interacts with adaptations to herbivores and their predators. A plain language summary is available for this article.

A predator can facilitate its prey resource acquisition, through prey transport, or through modifications of nutrient cycling. Alternatively, a predator may defend its prey against other predators, or actively manage it, as in agriculture, which is found in numerous taxa such as humans, ants, beetles, fishes and microbes. Here, we investigate the ecological consequences of considering such positive effects in a simple two-resource-one-consumer module, in which the consumer has a positive effect on one of the resources. We consider several scenarios, in which the positive effect on the resource is either not costly, that is resulting from a by-product of the consumer phenotype such as nutrient cycling, or costly. The cost either decreases the exploitation of the cultivated resource or the opportunity to forage the alternative resource. We investigate how the intensity of niche construction impacts species coexistence, the distribution of biomass among the three species and the stability of the community. We show that by modifying the trophic interactions in the module, niche construction alters the apparent competition between the resources, thereby impacting their coexistence. When niche construction has little or no cost to the consumer, it leads to higher consumer and cultivated resource densities, while decreasing the alternative resource density. Alternatively, when niche construction has higher costs, the alternative resource can increase in density, niche construction thereby leading to the emergence of facilitative interactions among resource species.

Global agricultural productivity is threatened by increasing pollinator dependence without a parallel increase in crop diversification	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						agricultural expansion; biodiversity; crop diversity; pollination; pollination services; pollinator-dependent crops	SOYBEAN PRODUCTION; WILD POLLINATORS; EXPANSION; BEE; YIELD; DEFORESTATION; DIVERSITY; TRENDS; INTENSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY	The global increase in the proportion of land cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops implies increased reliance on pollination services. Yet agricultural practices themselves can profoundly affect pollinator supply and pollination. Extensive monocultures are associated with a limited pollinator supply and reduced pollination, whereas agricultural diversification can enhance both. Therefore, areas where agricultural diversity has increased, or at least been maintained, may better sustain high and more stable productivity of pollinator-dependent crops. Given that >80% of all crops depend, to varying extents, on insect pollination, a global increase in agricultural pollinator dependence over recent decades might have led to a concomitant increase in agricultural diversification. We evaluated whether an increase in the area of pollinator-dependent crops has indeed been associated with an increase in agricultural diversity, measured here as crop diversity, at the global, regional, and country scales for the period 1961-2016. Globally, results show a relatively weak and decelerating rise in agricultural diversity over time that was largely decoupled from the strong and continually increasing trend in agricultural dependency on pollinators. At regional and country levels, there was no consistent relationship between temporal changes in pollinator dependence and crop diversification. Instead, our results show heterogeneous responses in which increasing pollinator dependence for some countries and regions has been associated with either an increase or a decrease in agricultural diversity. Particularly worrisome is a rapid expansion of pollinator-dependent oilseed crops in several countries of the Americas and Asia that has resulted in a decrease in agricultural diversity. In these regions, reliance on pollinators is increasing, yet agricultural practices that undermine pollination services are expanding. Our analysis has thereby identified world regions of particular concern where environmentally damaging practices associated with large-scale, industrial agriculture threaten key ecosystem services that underlie productivity, in addition to other benefits provided by biodiversity.

A framework for linking competitor ecological differences to coexistence	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						coexistence; competition; diversity; Enallagma; interspecific effects; intraspecific effects; niche	INTRASPECIFIC DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; RISK TRADE-OFF; DAMSELFLY ASSEMBLAGES; ENALLAGMA DAMSELFLIES; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; SPECIES COEXISTENCE; LIFE-HISTORIES; MAINTENANCE; NICHE; INTERFERENCE	Not all ecological differences among competing species affect their ability to locally coexist. Rather, the differences that promote stable coexistence can be those which cause each species to experience stronger intraspecific than interspecific competition. Recent approaches have established how to detect the demographic signature of these competitive effects, but alone they cannot elucidate the ecological differences among species that yield these patterns. Here, we present a unifying experimental and observational framework that identifies potential ecological differences among species shaping their responses to intra- and interspecific competition. We first describe a conceptual model establishing why the strength of intra- and interspecific competitive interactions should vary along environmental gradients related to species ecological differences. We then show how to apply the framework using Enallagma damselflies, a diverse group of predatory aquatic insects. To determine how species responded to intra- and interspecific competition along environmental gradients, we experimentally manipulated the relative abundances of three species and replicated this across five lakes which varied in environmental conditions affecting larval damselfly per capita growth and mortality rates-key vital rates regulating their populations. Results suggest Enallagma are ecologically differentiated in ways that in some communities can result in intraspecific competition exceeding interspecific competition. However, in many cases the opposite was true, or the effects of intra- and interspecific competition were equivalent via growth and mortality responses. Moreover, these effects tended to be weak and asymmetrical among competitors, which suggests that differential responses of larval growth and mortality to intra- and interspecific competition may not contribute strongly to the maintenance of Enallagma diversity. Different environmental factors appear to shape these demographic responses to competition, providing insight into the ecological mechanisms regulating damselfly assemblages. This framework can be broadly applied to identify the ecological differences among species that may promote coexistence, advancing knowledge of the mechanisms underlying coexistence and overcoming some limitations of purely phenomenological approaches.

The underlying mechanisms and timing have remained unclear to date. The evolutionary history of Quercus section Ilex Loudon, a representative East Asian-Tethyan disjunct lineage with a rich and widespread fossil record, was investigated to understand the key drivers of this disjunction. Location Eurasia. Methods The phylogeny of Quercus section Ilex was reconstructed using RAD-seq. Divergence times were estimated based on three fossil calibrations. Ancestral range and niche were reconstructed on the calibrated tree to infer the timing of transitions in geographic distributions and niche. Convergence in ecological space was estimated by fitting alternative multiple-regime Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Leaf shape affinities among extant and fossil taxa of section Ilex were assessed using geometric morphometric approaches. Results Six clades were well resolved in section Ilex. Ancestral range reconstruction and divergence time dating suggest a wide distribution along the East Tethys seaway, with initial divergence at the mid-Eocene, and all six clades originating before the Miocene. The section dispersed from East Asia to the Mediterranean at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A shift toward higher elevations was detected in the Himalayan clade during the middle or late Miocene. European fossil lineages during the early Miocene differ in leaf morphology from later lineages, which we infer to be a consequence of adaptive differentiation or species turnover. Main conclusions Quercus section Ilex was widespread along the East Tethys seaway from the middle Eocene onward. The European holly oaks originated from an East Asian ancestral lineage that dispersed to Europe via the Tibet-Himalaya corridor in the Oligocene. Lowlands along the margins of the Himalayas and through an Oligocene Tibetan valley served as the dispersal route(s) for these species. Changing climates drove Miocene extinction and local adaptation of European lineages.

Diversification and range expansion relate to lineage-specific niche characters, but this link has seldom been quantified across multiple lineages and environments. This study explored the link between local dominance and soil niche in rain forest plants, and tested the hypothesis that local soil niche patterns can be used to predict the global diversity and occupancy of equal-aged plant lineages. Location The study was carried out in Brunei Darussalam (Borneo) and projected worldwide. Methods Our approach involved the subdivision of vascular plants into the lineages found 120 Mya, a time preceding the explosive radiation of the eudicots. We quantified the representation of the 120 Mya lineages in different forest types associated with dramatically different soils, but sharing the same climatic conditions. The forest types included primary and secondary lowland rain forest, flooded and nutrient-impoverished inland forests, and mangroves. Niche breadth and position, estimated from the soil types that a lineage occupied, were used to predict global diversity and occupancy patterns, after accounting for relatedness to the dominant eudicots. Results Despite marked differences in soil characteristics among the forest types, three eudicot lineages (Malvidae, Fabidae, Asteridae) were consistently dominant over the other 28 lineages present. A broad, intermediate soil niche, relatedness to eudicots, and the interaction between these factors were found to be strong predictors of global diversity and occupancy. Main conclusions We show that vegetation plot data from one of the world's most diverse regions (in terms of plant species richness and ancient lineage representation) can be used to successfully predict lineage diversity and occupancy on a global scale. However, because lineage dominance likely depends on the interaction between soil niche and above-ground factors, including above-ground niche features should improve the accuracy of predicting global distribution and diversity-particularly when explaining eudicot dominance.

Resulting forest loss can adversely affect biodiversity in many ways, including trajectories of community reassembly, community composition, forest structural profiles and taxonomic diversity. Yet, effects of forest loss on specific ecosystem functions remain limited. Processes closely linked with tree reproduction, such as pollination and seed dispersal are of paramount importance for many ecological functions in tropical forests. Disruption in these processes is known to delay or change forest regeneration, diversity and structural dynamics. To explore how reproductive and dispersal traits are being altered by landscape-scale deforestation, we surveyed and compiled trait data for tree communities in 20 tropical Atlantic rainforest remnants in northeastern Brazil, across a gradient of deforested landscapes, each retaining 3%-93% forest cover. The functional richness of reproductive plant attributes decreased as the amount of forest cover decreased, while divergence increased along the same gradient. Loss of forest cover disproportionately affected certain dispersal and reproductive attributes, with most heavily impacted functional attributes including: brief flowering duration, hermaphrodite sexual system, and zoochoric dispersal mode. We identified a clear threshold at 25-30% of forest cover, below which, reproductive attributes disappeared more quickly than expect from forest remnants. Synthesis. Deforestation may impair tree community functional diversity, particularly by decreasing the number of functions. Under scenarios of extensive deforestation, changes to reproductive and dispersal trait profile of forest communities suggest that profound modifications in the availability of floral and seed resources are likely to be substantial. Such extensive changes to food supply of pollinating and dispersing animals suggest carry-over effects to the fauna of these important forest systems.

However, social organization will also influence population genetic structure. For example, species that live and breed in cooperative groups may experience high levels of inbreeding and strong genetic drift. The western pebble-mound mouse (Pseudomys chapmani), which occupies a highly heterogeneous, semi-arid landscape in Australia, is an enigmatic social mammal that has the intriguing behaviour of working cooperatively in groups to build permanent pebble mounds above a subterranean burrow system. Here, we used both nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial (mtDNA) markers to analyse the range-wide population structure of western pebble-mound mice sourced from multiple social groups. We observed high levels of genetic diversity at the broad scale, very weak genetic differentiation at a finer scale and low levels of inbreeding. Our genetic analyses suggest that the western pebble-mound mouse population is both panmictic and highly viable. We conclude that high genetic connectivity across the complex landscape is a consequence of the species' ability to permeate their environment, which may be enhanced by "boom-bust" population dynamics driven by the semi-arid climate. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of sampling strategies to infer social structure and demonstrate that sociality is an important component of population genetic structure.

In contrast to predictions based on mainstream population genetic theory, some granite outcrop plants appear to have persisted as very small populations despite prolonged geographic and genetic isolation. Eucalyptus caesia Benth. is a long-lived lignotuberous tree endemic with a naturally fragmented distribution on granite outcrops in south-western Australia. To quantify population to landscape-level genetic structure, we employed microsatellite genotyping at 14 loci of all plants in 18 stands of E. caesia. Sampled stands were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity, small absolute population sizes, localized clonality and strong fine-scale genetic subdivision. There was no significant relationship between population size and levels of heterozygosity. At the landscape scale, high levels of population genetic differentiation were most pronounced among representatives of the two subspecies in E. caesia as originally circumscribed. Past genetic interconnection was evident between some geographic neighbours separated by up to 20 km. Paradoxically, other pairs of neighbouring stands as little as 7 km apart were genetically distinct. There was no consistent pattern of isolation by distance across the 280 km range of E. caesia. Low levels of gene flow, together with strong drift within stands, provide some explanation of the patterns of genetic differentiation we observed. Individual genet longevity via the ability to repeatedly resprout and expand from a lignotuber may enhance the persistence of some woody perennial endemic plants despite small population size, minimal genetic interconnection and low heterozygosity.

To tease apart the contribution of different processes, especially at intermediate spatial scales, it is useful to study simple ecosystems such as those on sub-Antarctic oceanic islands. In this study, we characterize spatial genetic patterns of two keystone plant species, Azorella selago on sub-Antarctic Marion Island and Azorella macquariensis on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. Although both islands experience a similar climate and have a similar vegetation structure, they differ significantly in topography and geological history. We genotyped six microsatellites for 1,149 individuals from 123 sites across Marion Island and 372 individuals from 42 sites across Macquarie Island. We tested for spatial patterns in genetic diversity, including correlation with elevation and vegetation type, and clines in different directional bearings. We also examined genetic differentiation within islands, isolation-by-distance with and without accounting for direction, and signals of demographic change. Marion Island was found to have a distinct northwest-southeast divide, with lower genetic diversity and more sites with a signal of population expansion in the northwest. We attribute this to asymmetric seed dispersal by the dominant northwesterly winds, and to population persistence in a southwestern refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum. No apparent spatial pattern, but greater genetic diversity and differentiation between sites, was found on Macquarie Island, which may be due to the narrow length of the island in the direction of the dominant winds and longer population persistence permitted by the lack of extensive glaciation on the island. Together, our results clearly illustrate the implications of island shape and geography, and the importance of direction-dependent drivers, in shaping spatial genetic structure.

This prediction has been tested extensively in experiments where condition has been manipulated through environmental quality. Condition-dependence as a function of genetic quality has, however, only rarely been addressed, despite its central importance in evolutionary theory. To address the effect of genetic quality on expression of sexual and non-sexual traits, we here compare gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster head tissue between flies with intact genomes (high condition) and flies carrying a major deleterious mutation (low condition). We find that sex-biased genes show heightened condition-dependent expression in both sexes, and that expression in low condition males and females regresses towards a more similar expression profile. As predicted, sex-biased expression was more sensitive to condition in males compared to females, but surprisingly female-biased, rather than male-biased, genes show higher sensitivity to condition in both sexes. Our results thus support the fundamental predictions of the theory of condition-dependence when condition is a function of genetic quality.

Multi-species comparisons of snakes identify coordinated signalling networks underlying post-feeding intestinal regeneration	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						NRF2; insulin signalling; proteomics; RNAseq; stress response; unfolded protein response	BURMESE PYTHON; DIGESTIVE PERFORMANCE; ADAPTIVE REGULATION; LIVER-REGENERATION; INSULIN-RECEPTOR; RESPONSES; PHYSIOLOGY; ZEBRAFISH; EVOLUTION; REPTILES	Several snake species that feed infrequently in nature have evolved the ability to massively upregulate intestinal form and function with each meal. While fasting, these snakes downregulate intestinal form and function, and upon feeding restore intestinal structure and function through major increases in cell growth and proliferation, metabolism and upregulation of digestive function. Previous studies have identified changes in gene expression that underlie this regenerative growth of the python intestine, but the unique features that differentiate this extreme regenerative growth from non-regenerative post-feeding responses exhibited by snakes that feed more frequently remain unclear. Here, we leveraged variation in regenerative capacity across three snake species-two distantly related lineages (Crotalus and Python) that experience regenerative growth, and one (Nerodia) that does not-to infer molecular mechanisms underlying intestinal regeneration using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Using a comparative approach, we identify a suite of growth, stress response and DNA damage response signalling pathways with inferred activity specifically in regenerating species, and propose a hypothesis model of interactivity between these pathways that may drive regenerative intestinal growth in snakes.

An increase in host nutrition could lead to more resources for hosts to expend on the immune system or for pathogens to exploit. In this paper, we report a meta-analysis of studies on host-pathogen systems across the tree of life, to examine the impact of host nutritional quality and quantity on pathogen virulence. We did not find broad support across studies for a one-way effect of nutrient availability on pathogen virulence. We thus discuss a hypothesis that there is a balance between the effect of host nutrition on the immune system and on pathogen resources, with the pivot point of the balance differing for vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Our results suggest that variation in nutrition, caused by natural or anthropogenic factors, can have diverse effects on infectious disease outcomes across species.

Sociality emerges from solitary behaviours and reproductive plasticity in the orchid bee Euglossa dilemma	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						eusociality; social evolution; phenotypic plasticity; Euglossa dilemma; orchid bees	BRAIN GENE-EXPRESSION; HONEY-BEES; EUSOCIALITY; VIRIDISSIMA; CASTE; HYMENOPTERA; EVOLUTION; NEST; PATTERNS; REVEALS	The evolution of eusociality and sterile worker castes represents a major transition in the history of life. Despite this, little is known about the mechanisms involved in the initial transition from solitary to social behaviour. It has been hypothesized that plasticity from ancestral solitary life cycles was coopted to create queen and worker castes in insect societies. Here, we tested this hypothesis by examining gene expression involved in the transition from solitary to social behaviour in the orchid bee Euglossa dilemma. To this end, we conducted observations that allowed us to classify bees into four distinct categories of solitary and social behaviour. Then, by sequencing brain and ovary transcriptomes from these behavioural phases, we identified gene expression changes overlapping with socially associated genes across multiple eusocial lineages. We find that genes involved in solitary E. dilemma ovarian plasticity overlap extensively with genes showing differential expression between fertile and sterile workers-or between queens and workers in other eusocial bees. We also find evidence that sociality in E. dilemma reflects gene expression patterns involved in solitary foraging and non-foraging nest care behaviours. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that eusociality emerges from plasticity found across solitary life cycles.

Elevated aggression is associated with uncertainty in a network of dog dominance interactions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						dominance hierarchy; social network; agonistic interaction; social stability; exponential random graph model	FREE-RANGING DOGS; GLUCOCORTICOID LEVELS; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; HIERARCHY; SEX; PATTERNS; BONOBOS; MODELS; RANK	Dominance hierarchies are widespread in animal societies and reduce the costs of within-group conflict over resources and reproduction. Variation in stability across a social hierarchy may result in asymmetries in the benefits obtained from hierarchy formation. However, variation in the stability and behavioural costs of dominance interactions with rank remain poorly understood. Previous theoretical models have predicted that the intensity of dominance interactions and aggression should increase with rank, but these models typically assume high reproductive skew, and so their generality remains untested. Here we show in a pack of free-living dogs with a sex-age-graded hierarchy that the central region of the hierarchy was dominated by more unstable social relationships and associated with elevated aggression. Our results reveal unavoidable costs of ascending a dominance hierarchy, run contrary to theoretical predictions for the relationship between aggression and social rank in high-skew societies, and widen our understanding of how heterogeneous benefits of hierarchy formation arise in animal societies.

Detecting Mosquito Communities in South-African Freshwater Ponds	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						eDNA; culicidae primer; mosquitoes; vector-borne diseases; biomonitoring; Kruger National Park; mosquito communities	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; SAMPLES; PRESERVATION; PERCEPTION; DIVERSITY; CULICIDAE; DIPTERA	Improved biomonitoring of mosquitoes requires an in-depth understanding on occurrences of both vector and non-vector species, in larval, and adult stages. Accurate descriptions of the ecological context in which mosquitoes thrive remain limited, particularly for larval stages. The aim of this study was to develop amixed-amplicon eDNA approach to assess (i) whether mosquito larval communities of stagnant fresh-water bodies can be detected using a Culicidae-specific primer and (ii) how these results compare to traditional trapping of adult mosquitoes. Results from 32 ponds inside and outside Kruger National Park, South Africa show that our primer detected mosquito eDNA. However, it yielded only a subset of the species found using adult trapping methods. Particularly the less frequent and container-breeding species were not found. Our approach provides the first steps toward an eDNA-based method to assess the entire community of larval-stage mosquitoes. It may thereby overcome current taxonomic hurdles presented by morphological identification of larvae. As such, it holds great promise for biomonitoring and ecological studies of mosquitoes.

Furthermore, recent studies have tended to focus on the topsoil and ignored a steep gradient of nutrient accumulation with soil depth. Here, we investigated changes in N functional genes (NFGs) involved in organic N decomposition (chiA), archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation (amoA-AOA and amoA-AOB), respectively, denitrification (nirK and nirS), and N fixation (nifH) in soil profiles from a chronosequence of grazing prohibition (0, 10, 15, 25, and 35 years) in the semiarid grasslands of the Loess Plateau, China. The abundance of all the investigated NFGs in grassland soils after 35 years' grazing prohibition was higher than in grazed grassland. This result suggests that microbial N turnover potential is facilitated by grazing prohibition, probably through enhanced biomass production via increases in nutrient input into the soil. The higher ratio of (chiA + nifH)/(amoA-AOA + amoA-AOB) and values of (nirK + nirS) in grazing-prohibited grasslands than in grazed grassland suggest that prohibition of grazing not only improved microbial N storage potential but also increased N gas emission potential. The abundances of NFGs varied along the soil profiles and responded differently to environmental factors. The chiA and nifH abundances decreased with soil depth and were associated with variation in aboveground biomass, NH4+-N, and organic carbon, while amoA-AOA, nirK, and nirS genes increased with depth and were more affected by soil organic carbon, moisture, and bulk density. Multivariate regression tree analysis demonstrated that aboveground biomass was the best explanatory variable for the changes in NFGs in grazed grassland, while soil organic carbon was the best in the grazing-prohibited grasslands. Our results provide new insight into the soil N cycling potential of degraded and restored semiarid grassland ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea is a problematic invasive species in aquatic ecosystems and can impair the survival of parasitic larvae (glochidia) of native freshwater mussels. However, this possible mechanism of threat remains speculative and to date very few studies addressed quantitatively this issue. In order to cover this gap, we have performed a series of manipulative laboratory studies to assess how distinct densities of C. fluminea can affect the survival of glochidia after 6, 12, 24 and 48 h of exposure, using larvae of the native freshwater mussel Anodonta anatina. Our results suggest an increase in mortality of A. anatina glochidia with an increase in density of C. fluminea. Two main mechanisms may possibly explain our results: 1) the high filtration capacity of C. fluminea that can contribute to the mortality of glochidia due to the mechanical damage of their fragile shells when passing by siphons and/or digestive tract of C. fluminea and 2) the high excretion capacity of C. fluminea that can lead to mortality of glochidia due to increase in ammonia concentration. Mortality of glochidia was also time dependent with higher values registered after 48 h. This work is one of the first showing the influence of C. fluminea density on the survival of glochidia, being filtration (and consequent passage in the digestive tract) and biodeposition the main potential mechanisms explaining overall mortality. These results also suggest that sites with high densities of C. fluminea may be highly detrimental for the conservation of freshwater mussels, potentially impairing the survival of glochidia and negatively affecting the recruitment of juveniles.

The role of surface charge and pH changes in tropical soils on sorption behaviour of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						PFOS; PFOA; Tropical soils; Weathered soils	PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE PFOS; PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC-MATTER; MECHANISMS; ADSORPTION; DEPENDENCE; MINERALS; ACIDS; CLAY	This study investigated the effect of surface charge on the sorption of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) onto 7 tropical soils as a function of pH. The net surface charge became less negative with decreasing pH (from 7.5 to 3.5) in all soils. The rate of change in net surface charge varied from -0.6 to -2.8 (cmol/kg)/pH unit. The effect on sorption behaviour of PFASs was variable among soils. For two soils, the average sorption increased 54- and 45-fold for PFOS, 33- and 9-fold for PFOA, and 39- and 400-fold for PFHxS, across the pH range 7.5 to 3.5. Sorption in another sandier soil showed negligible change with decreasing pH. Sorption in the other soils did not change significantly until the pH decreased to approximately 5.5. The soils with high contents of sesquioxides (Fe and Al oxides) showed the most marked increase in sorption with decreasing pH. This study demonstrated that in addition to hydrophobic interactions with OC and other processes, electrostatic interactions are also important in the sorption process for these chemicals in soils. In acidic, variably charged tropical soils there is the possibility that any PFOS, PFOA or PFHxS sorbed to the soils may become desorbed if management practices (e.g. liming) raised soil pH.

In heavily modified rivers, though, the response of aquatic invertebrates to mitigation measures and habitat mosaic changes is scarcely documented. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to explore the benthic community of leveed rivers in the agricultural lowlands of Northern Italy. The relevance of in-stream substrate microhabitat for the benthic community was assessed, together with the impact of mitigation measures. We proposed a straightforward approach to quantify similarity of microhabitat mosaic between sites testing its statistical significance based on Bayesian statistics. We hypothesised that changes of microhabitat mosaic would reflect the level of implementation of mitigation measures and benthic invertebrates would respond accordingly. Alpha, beta diversity and benthic metrics used to classify ecological status potential were considered and their variation tested against different levels of measure implementation. Lastly, ecological potential classification was paralleled to both the level of measure implementation and habitat attributes. The microhabitats found at sites where measures were fully implemented differed from those observed elsewhere and they clearly mirrored morphological alteration and mitigation measures. Moreover, alongside morphological alteration, microhabitat diversity and mosaic were the main factors for benthic community structure. While benthic beta diversity strictly reflected microhabitat diversity, alpha diversity and ecological status metrics copied the mosaic gradient. Microhabitat attributes and most benthic metrics showed significant changes following measure implementation and they were accompanied by a gradual shift in ecological potential classes. We demonstrated the importance of in-stream substrate microhabitats as a bridge between mitigation measures and the benthic community. Particularly when ecological classification is under focus, microhabitat mosaic should be evaluated for achieving a better understanding of biological responses. The huge amount of data available worldwide could support a straightforward use of river mosaic information for river management. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here we used high-throughput quantitative PCR to quantify 285 ARGs conferring resistance to most major classes of antibiotics, reveal their spatial and seasonal distribution patterns, and depict the underlying mechanisms in a subtropical riverine ecosystem under low and high human pressures, in Xiamen city, southeast China. Our results showed that spatial differences in ARG richness and abundance overwhelmed their seasonal variations, with only ARGs that confer resistance to sulfonamide and vancomycin being significantly different across seasons. Only a few abundant ARGs (19 ARGs) could contribute to >70% of the total ARGs abundance and were found in all seasons. The significantly higher number of ARGs in the summer rainy period than other seasons coincided with high number of significant edges in ARC co-occurrence networks. Summer rainfall had strong dilution effect on ARCS in upstream waters and enrichment effect in downstream waters. The variance partitioning analysis indicated that the environment explained larger variance of ARG profiles than mobile genetic elements (MGEs), spatial predictors and the rainfall. Nevertheless, strong and significant correlations between transposase gene absolute abundance and aminoglycoside, chloramphenicol, MIS, multi drug and tetracycline classes of resistance genes inferred the role of MGEs on ARG distribution. Overall, our results imply that the modelling and management of ARGs in highly dynamic ecosystems could be better implemented by considering priority genes that dominate at spatial and seasonal gradients.

According to fishing location the contamination rates suggested grouping the islands in four clusters; namely: {EI Hierro: HI; La Gomera: LG; La Palma: LP), {Gran Canaria: GC; Tenerife: TE1, {Fuerteventura: Fl.{} and {Lanzarote: L/1. For the amberjack species, the multivariate logistic regression showed the factors that maintained independent association with the outcome, which were the warm season (OR 3.617; 95% CI 1.249-10.474), the weight (per kg, 1.102; 95% CI 1.069-1.136) and the island of fish catching. A prediction score was obtained for the probability of contamination by CD( in amberjack fish samples. The area under de curve (AUC) obtained using the validation data was 0.747 (95%CI 0.662-0.833). Regarding grouper species, the island of fishing was the only factor that showed significant differences associated with the presence of CTX-like toxicity. We provide herein data for a better management and prediction of ciguatera in the Canary Islands, suggesting a review of the minimum limits of fish weight established by the Canary Government for the control program.

An integrated statistical and deterministic hydrologic model for analyzing trace organic contaminants in commercial and high-density residential stormwater runoff	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Trace organic contaminant; Stormwater; Land cover; WinSLAMM; Urban		Urbanization can dramatically alter stormwater, both the quantity and quality, by engendering larger peak flows and through the introduction of contaminants into runoff. The current study builds on previous research that developed relationships between a suite of nonpoint source contaminants, known as trace organic contaminants (TOrCs), and hydrologic measurements for a series of storms (one site had 15 storms and the other had 19 storms) in Madison, WI, by creating statistical and deterministic models. Correlations and regressions were calculated between TOrC loads and hydrologic measurements for a series of storms for both a commercial site and a high-density residential site. From the regressions, it became evident that loading responses to precipitation were not the same between the two land covers for some TOrCs, indicating varying load responses for TOrCs depending on land cover. The regressions were utilized in the Source Loading and Management Model for Windows (WinSLAMM), an event based hydrologic and water-quality model, to demonstrate that it can be used to model novel contaminants. The regressions were also used to estimate mean annual loads of TOrCs from all commercial and high-density residential areas in Madison, WI, for the watersheds to which Madison discharges its stormwater. The mean annual loads varied between grams per year to tens of thousands of grams per year depending on the TOrC and watershed. This work will ultimately allow managers to simulate the presence of', establish total maximum daily loads for, and mitigate the loads of TOrCs through stormwater best management practices.

This effect shifts the isotopic signal of terrestrial individuals towards too marine values. It is commonly agreed upon that sea spray influences sulphur stable isotopes. However, we were able to approximate a remarkable sea spray effect also in carbon and oxygen stable isotopes of bone carbonate previously. In the present study we could approximate a minimum sea spray effect of about 13.9% even present in oxygen isotope values of bone phosphate, which was validated by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering. This approximated value is by some magnitudes smaller than the minimum sea spray effect approximated for both delta C-13(carb) and delta O-18(carb), and quite close to the sea spray detected for delta S-34(coll) in a previous study. It may therefore be interpreted as purer minimum sea spray signal compared to the approximation in bone carbonate. Furthermore, detection of sea spray in delta O-180(phos) can serve as additional validation of the effect present in bone carbonate, which is more prone to diagenetic alteration compared to bone phosphate. Moreover, the presence of the sea spray effect in both delta O-180(carb) and delta O-180(phos) demonstrates that sea spray can be taken up by terrestrial mammals not only via food (delta O-80(carb)) but also via drinking water (delta O-80(phos)). Finally, this study once more confirmed that calculation of delta O-80(phos) from delta O-80(carb), values using a fixed oxygen isotope spacing (Delta delta O-18) can be highly misleading, especially in coastal environments affected by sea spray.

Yet, the abundance and distribution of most artificial barriers, excluding high-head dams, is poorly documented. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the distribution and typology of artificial barriers in Great Britain, and estimate for the first time the extent of river fragmentation. To this end, barrier data were compiled from existing databases and were ground-truthed by field surveys in England, Scotland and Wales to derive a correction factor for barrier density across Great Britain. Field surveys indicate that existing barrier databases underestimate barrier density by 68%, particularly in the case of low-head structures (<1 m) which are often missing from current records. Field-corrected barrier density estimates ranged from OAS barriers/km in Scotland to 0.63 barriers/km in Wales, and 075 banters/km in England. Corresponding estimates of stream fragmentation by weirs and dams only, measured as mean barrier-free length, were 12.30 km in Scotland, 6.68 km in Wales and 529 km in England, suggesting the extent of river modification differs between regions. Our study indicates that 97% of the river network in Great Britain is fragmented and <1% of the catchments are free of artificial barriers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tree community response is likely to be affected by major disturbances, such as fire and harvest. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of climate change and disturbances to temporal shifts in tree composition over the last decades and evaluate whether disturbances accelerate community thermophilization. Location Quebec, Canada. Time period 1970-2016. Taxa studied Trees. Methods Using 6,281 forest inventory plots, we quantified temporal changes in species composition between a historical (1970-1980) and a contemporary period (2000-2016) by measuring temporal beta-diversity, gains and losses. The effects of climate and disturbances on temporal beta-diversity were quantified using multiple regressions and variation partitioning. We compared how community indices of species temperature preference (CTI) and shade tolerance (CSI) changed for forests that experienced different levels of disturbance. We quantified the contribution of species gains and losses to change in CTI. Results Temporal beta-diversity was mainly driven by disturbances, with historical harvesting as the most important predictor. Despite the prevailing influence of disturbances, we revealed a significant thermophilization (Delta CTI = +.03 degrees C/decade) throughout forests in Quebec. However, this shift in community composition was weakly explained by climate change and considerably slower than the rate of warming (+.14 degrees C/decade). Importantly, thermophilization was amplified by moderate disturbances (+.044 degrees C/decade), almost a threefold increase compared with minor disturbances (+.015 degrees C/decade). The gains and losses of a few tree species contributed to this community-level shift. Conclusions Our study provides evidence that disturbances can strongly modify tree community responses to climate change. Moderate disturbances, such as harvesting, might reduce competition and facilitate gains of warm-adapted species, which then accelerate thermophilization of tree communities under climate change. Although accelerated by disturbances, community thermophilization was driven by the gains and losses of a small number of species, notably gains of maples.

An emerging consensus places the origin and global dispersal of M.tb within the past 6,000 years: identifying how the ancestral clone of M.tb spread and differentiated within this timeframe is important for identifying the ecological drivers of the current pandemic. We used Bayesian phylogeographic inference to reconstruct the migratory history of M.tb in Africa and Eurasia and to investigate lineage specific patterns of spread from a geographically diverse sample of 552 M.tb genomes. Applying evolutionary rates inferred with ancient M.tb genome calibration, we estimated the timing of major events in the migratory history of the pathogen. Inferred timings contextualize M.tb dispersal within historical phenomena that altered patterns of connectivity throughout Africa and Eurasia: trans-Indian Ocean trade in spices and other goods, the Silk Road and its predecessors, the expansion of the Roman Empire, and the European Age of Exploration. We found that Eastern Africa and Southeast Asia have been critical in the dispersal of M.tb. Our results further reveal that M.tb populations have grown through range expansion, as well as in situ, and delineate the independent evolutionary trajectories of bacterial subpopulations underlying the current pandemic.

Temporary wetlands, with their periodic wet and dry phases, are considered one of the most productive systems in the world and their invertebrate communities form a crucial diet component for higher trophic levels. The effect of fire on the hatching success of invertebrate propagules from temporary wetlands in the Cape Flats Sand Fynbos (Cape Town, South Africa) was investigated. Homogenised soil samples from these wetlands were either experimentally subjected to vegetation fires (treatment samples) or were left as is (control samples). The results revealed that fire had a significant negative impact on invertebrate hatching success, as revealed by analyses of the different diversity measures (e.g. taxon richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness) and community composition. Proper management of fire, especially in the Mediterranean-climate regions, which replicates the natural fire intervals typical of the area (10-15 years) and avoids unregulated or accidental fires, is essential to ensuring future protection of these critical biodiversity hotspots created by the temporary wetlands.

A test in temperate forest swamps	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						aboveground-belowground linkages; fine roots; forest swamps; functional traits; local scales; successional gradient	PLANT ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; DRY; DIVERGENCE; DIVERSITY; CLIMATE; SOIL	Examining the coordination of leaf and fine root traits not only aids a better understanding of plant ecological strategies from a whole-plant perspective, but also helps improve the prediction of belowground properties from aboveground traits. The relationships between leaf and fine root traits have been extensively explored at global and regional scales, but remain unclear at local scales. Here, we measured six pairs of analogous leaf and fine root traits related to resource economy and organ size for coexisting dominant and subordinate vascular plants at three successional stages of temperate forest swamps in Lingfeng National Nature Reserve in the Greater Hinggan Mountains, NE China. Leaf and fine root traits related to resource acquisition (e.g., specific leaf area [SLA], leaf N, leaf P, root water content, and root P) decreased with succession. Overall, we found strong linear relationships between leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and root water content, and between leaf and root C, N, and P concentrations, but only weak correlations were observed between leaf area and root diameter, and between SLA and specific root length (SRL). The strong relationships between LDMC and root water content and between leaf and root C, N, and P held at the early and late stages, but disappeared at the middle stage. Besides, C and P of leaves were significantly correlated with those of roots for woody plants, while strong linkages existed between LDMC and root water content and between leaf N and root N for herbaceous species. These results provided evidence for the existence of strong coordination between leaf and root traits at the local scale. Meanwhile, the leaf-root trait relationships could be modulated by successional stage and growth form, indicating the complexity of coordination of aboveground and belowground traits at the local scale.

Landscape-scale greater prairie-chicken-habitat relations and the conservation reserve program	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Conservation Reserve Program; grassland; greater prairie-chicken; landscape; Minnesota; Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus	LAND-USE; MODELS; LEKS	Both the abundance of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) and the area of grassland enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in northwestern Minnesota, USA, have recently declined. Although wildlife conservation is a stated objective of the CRP, the impact of the CRP on greater prairie-chicken populations has not been quantified. To address that information need, we evaluated the association between greater-prairie chicken lek density (leks/km(2)), the number of males at leks (males/lek), and CRP enrollments in the context of landscape structure and composition in northwestern Minnesota. Using data from standardized prairie-chicken surveys and land cover in 17 41-km(2) survey blocks during 2004-2016, we used a mixed-effect model and a layered approach in an information-theoretic framework at multiple spatial scales to identify covariates related to prairie-chicken abundance. At the landscape scale, lek density was best explained by the amount of CRP grassland and wetland, grassland and wetland with long-term conservation goals (state, federal, and The Nature Conservancy owned); other wetlands managed with variable or no continuity in conservation goals; the contiguity of grasslands; and the number of patches of grasslands and wetlands in each survey block each year. Increasing the amount of CRP grassland in 41-km(2) survey blocks by 1 km(2) (2.4%) resulted in a corresponding increase of 6% in lek density. At the lek scale, the number of males per lek was best explained by the amount of CRP grassland and other grassland, CRP wetland and other wetland, forests, developed areas, shrubland, and the contiguity of CRP grassland. Increasing the amount of CRP grassland in the 2-km breeding-cycle habitat radius around a lek by 25% (3 km(2)) corresponded to a 5% increase in males per lek. Our results suggest that both increasing the quantity of grassland CRP and wetland CRP enrollments and aggregating CRP grassland enrollments may increase greater prairie-chicken abundance.

Understanding how carbon exchange and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics are impacted after a wildfire is important, especially as boreal peatlands may be vulnerable to changes in wildfire regime under a rapidly changing climate. However, given this vulnerability, there is very little in the literature on the impact such fires have on methane (CH4) emissions. This study investigated the effect of wildfire on CH4 emissions at a boreal fen near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, that was partially burned by the Horse River Wildfire in 2016. We measured CH4 emissions and environmental variables (20172018) and CH4 production potential (2018) in two different microform types (hummocks and hollows) across a peat burn severity gradient (unburned (UB), moderately burned (MB), and severely burned (SB)). Results indicated a switch in the typical understanding of boreal peatland CH4 emissions. For example, emissions were significantly lower in the MB and SB hollows in both years compared to UB hollows. Interestingly, across the burned sites, hummocks had higher fluxes in 2017 than hollows at the MB and SB sites. We found typically higher emissions at the UB site where the water table was close to the surface. However, at the burned sites, no relationship was found between CH4 emissions and water table, even under similar hydrological conditions. There was also significantly higher CH4 production potential from the UB site than the burned sites. The reduction in CH4 emissions and production in the hollows at burned sites highlights the sensitivity of hollows to fire, removing labile organic material for potential methanogenesis. The previously demonstrated resistance of hummocks to fire also results in limited impact on CH4 emissions and likely faster recovery to pre-fire rates. Given the potential initial net cooling effect resulting from a reduction in CH4 emissions, it is important that the radiative effect of all GHGs following wildfire across peatlands is taken into account.

Consequently, little is currently known about deep-ocean biodiversity in the TER An enriched understanding of biogeographic patterns and the factors that influence them is crucial to the success of efforts to conserve deep-sea communities. The objectives of this research were to provide the first assessment of biodiversity and community composition of bathyal demersal (200 - 3,000 m) fauna across multiple ocean/island archipelagos in the TEP. To better understand biodiversity and its drivers in the region, we tested the hypotheses that biodiversity and faunal assemblage composition vary with location and environmental drivers (e.g., bathymetry, oxygen concentration). Using Deep-Ocean Dropcams, we collected video footage from Clipperton, Galapagos, Revillagigedo, and Malpelo oceanic islands, in depths ranging from 200 to 3,000 m. Taxa richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity were calculated for each location. In general, biodiversity values were high closer to the equator and closer to the continent, and low in the locations farther north and farther west. Fish family biodiversity was highest in the Galapagos, followed by Malpelo. In contrast, Clipperton had significantly lower fish family richness compared to all other locations. For invertebrate orders, Revillagigedo was significantly lower in biodiversity compared to the Galapagos and Malpelo. Broad-scale Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) and dissolved oxygen had a positive effect on fish diversity metrics. Both fish and invertebrate assemblages were significantly different among locations. Around each of the island groups are vastly different current patterns, which likely accounts for some of the variation we observed in biodiversity and community composition. Due to the longitudinal East Pacific Rise, which limits population connectivity by creating a spatial barrier to gene flow and dispersal among marine organisms, the TEP is largely isolated from the wider Pacific. The islands and archipelagos likely represent important stepping-stones and corridors for species connectivity across the TEP and the wider Pacific. Therefore, the preservation of these intact ecosystems is crucial for maintaining biodiversity both within the TEP as well as across the wider Pacific region.

Small VHF transmitters (<1.0g) paired with automated radio telemetry allowed us to track the movements of six small shorebird species and test hypotheses about migratory behavior in species with different migration distances. We predicted that during southbound migration, species with longer migration distances (>9,000 km; pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos, and white-rumped sandpiper, Calidris fuscicollis) would be more likely to migrate with characteristics of a time-minimizing migration strategy compared to species migrating intermediate distances (5,000-7,500 km; semipalmated sandpiper, Calidris pusilla; and lesser yellowlegs, Tringa flavipes) or shorter distances (5,000 km; least sandpiper, Calidris minutilla; semipalmated plover, Charadriussemipalmatus), which would migrate with more characteristics of an energy-minimizing strategy. Our results indicate that migration and stopover behaviors for adults matched this prediction; longer distance migrants had longer stopover lengths, departed with higher relative fuel loads, flew with faster ground and airspeeds, and had a lower probability of stopover in North America after departing the subarctic. The predicted relationship between migration distance and migratory strategy was not as clear for juveniles. Despite our prediction that longer distance migrants would be less wind selective at departure and fly into headwinds en route, all species and age classes departed and migrated with supportive winds. Birds with higher estimated fuel loads at departure were less likely to stop in North America after departing the subarctic, indicating that some birds attempted non-stop flights from the subarctic to the Caribbean or South America. Additionally, within species, adults with higher relative fuel loads at departure had a higher detection probability after departing the subarctic, which we interpret as evidence of higher survival compared to juveniles. This study shows that migratory behavior of shorebirds has predictable patterns based on migration distance that are moderated by body condition of individuals, with potential implications for fitness.

Hunters (n = 255) from two adjacent community hunting zones (CHZ) in southeast Cameroon were interviewed about the species composition of the animals killed using snare traps between 1952 and 2015-2016 and the drivers of change. The comparison of the perceived spatial and temporal trends in game composition to those from transect surveys and bushmeat records conducted in the area since the nineties evidenced the followings: (1) hunters are aware of the coarse changes in prey abundance, even for the species for which population density is difficult to estimate using more conventional survey methods; (2) in southeast Cameroon and in forests regions with similar fauna, the bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis) and the Peter's duiker (C. callipygus) are clearly more abundant than the white-bellied duiker (C. leucogaster) and black-fronted duiker (C. nigrifrons); (3) the two sites surveyed are at different stages of prey depletion, and (4) perception of prey composition is consistent with village-based bushmeat records and is likely to reflect more the species compositions in anthropogenic forest mosaics, where hunting is more frequent. Hunters' interviews constitute a valuable means to rapidly assess the status and trends in animal populations. However, the discrepancies between perceptions and prey composition in remote forest areas, combined with the assumption that shifting baseline syndrome is operating, highlight the need of caution when using local knowledge to generalize trends in fauna assemblages over large geographical and temporal scales.

Testing the Adaptive Potential of Yellowtail Kingfish to Ocean Warming and Acidification	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						climate change; adaptation; heritability; early life-history; morphology; the animal model; pelagic fish; Seriola lalandi	EARLY-LIFE HISTORY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HIGH CO2; CARBONIC-ACID; FISH; IMPACTS; ADAPTATION; FISHERIES; SOFTWARE; DISSOCIATION	Estimating the heritability and genotype by environment (GxE) interactions of performance-related traits (e.g., growth, survival, reproduction) under future ocean conditions is necessary for inferring the adaptive potential of marine species to climate change. To date, no studies have used quantitative genetics techniques to test the adaptive potential of large pelagic fishes to the combined effects of elevated water temperature and ocean acidification. We used an experimental approach to test for heritability and GxE interactions in morphological traits of juvenile yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi, under current-day and predicted future ocean conditions. We also tracked the fate of genetic diversity among treatments over the experimental period to test for selection favoring some genotypes over others under elevated temperature and CO2. Specifically, we reared kingfish to 21 days post hatching (dph) in a fully crossed 2 x 2 experimental design comprising current-day average summer temperature (21 degrees C) and seawater pCO(2) (500 mu atm CO2) and elevated temperature (25 degrees C) and seawater pCO(2) (1,000 mu atm CO2). We sampled larvae and juveniles at 1, 11, and 21 dph and identified family of origin of each fish (1,942 in total) by DNA parentage analysis. The animal model was used to estimate heritability of morphological traits and test for GxE interactions among the experimental treatments at 21 dph. Elevated temperature, but not elevated CO2 affected all morphological traits. Weight, length and other morphological traits in juvenile yellowtail kingfish exhibited low but significant heritability under current day and elevated temperature. However, there were no measurable GxE interactions in morphological traits between the two temperature treatments at 21 dph. Similarly, there was no detectable change in any of the measures of genetic diversity over the duration of the experiment. Nonetheless, one family exhibited differential survivorship between temperatures, declining in relative abundance between 1 and 21 dph at 21 degrees C, but increasing in relative abundance between 1 and 21 dph at 25 degrees C. This suggests that this family line could perform better under future warming than in current-day conditions. Our results provide the first preliminary evidence of the adaptive potential of a large pelagic fisheries species to future ocean conditions.	[Munday, Philip L.; Allan, Bridie J.

Despite the absence of recruitment failure and overfishing, pelagic fisheries have been in crisis for a decade in the Western Mediterranean Sea because of a marked decline in sardine size and condition. This situation most probably results from bottom-up control and changes in the plankton community toward smaller plankton. To understand such an unusual phenomenon, we developed an original and innovative experimental approach investigating the mechanisms induced by a reduction in the quantity and size of sardine prey. While experimentations offer the unique opportunity to integrate behavior and ecophysiology in understanding key demographic processes, they remain rarely used in fisheries science, even more so on small pelagics due to the notorious difficulty to handle them. The results revealed that food size (without any modification of its energy content) is as important as food quantity for body condition, growth and reserve lipids: sardines that fed on small particles had to consume twice as much as those feeding on large particles to achieve the same condition and growth. Such a strong impact of food size (based on 100 vs. 1200 mu m pellets) was unexpected and may reflect a different energy cost or gain of two feeding behaviors, filter-feeding vs. particulate-feeding, which would have to be tested in further study. As increasing temperature favors planktonic chains of smaller size, climate change might actually accelerate and amplify such phenomenon and thus strongly affect fisheries.

Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are caught by gillnets during their wintering in southern Brazil. However, current information is based only on a small number of sets observed during a single fishing trip. This study assesses bycatch rates of bottom and drift gillnets operating in southern Brazil, and describes the sex and age classes of individuals captured. In 80 bottom gillnet sets, 33 penguins were captured (85% adults), 14 were sexed of which 13 were females. In 41 drift gillnet sets, four penguins were captured, three of which were juveniles. The mean bycatch rates, measured as number of penguins km(-2) of net and number of penguins km(-2) h(-1), were significantly higher for the drift gillnets. Despite the lower bycatch rates, owing to the higher fishing effort in terms of number of boats, net length, net area, soak time and fishing season, the magnitude of penguin bycatch in the bottom gillnet fishery cannot be ignored. Despite based on small sample size, the predominance of adult and female Magellanic penguins as bycatch in gillnet fisheries in southern Brazil agrees with previous studies suggesting that females displace further north than males. In addition, such evidence contributes to the male-biased sex ratio in breeding grounds, and the long-term decline of major Patagonian colonies owing to higher female mortality during winter.

Characterized by discrete patches of high-elevation montane habitat, these "sky islands" serve as stepping stones across a "sea" of desert scrub/grassland. Over this coming century, the region is expected to shift towards a warmer and drier climate. We used species distribution modelling to predict how the spatial distribution of montane habitat will be affected by climate change. Location Madrean Sky Island Archipelago, south-west United States and north-west Mexico (latitude, 29-34 degrees N; longitude, 107-112 degrees W). Methods To approximate the current distribution of montane habitat, we built species distribution models for five high-elevation species (Ceanothus fendleri, Pinus strobiformis, Quercus gambelii, Sciurus aberti, and Synuchus dubius). The resulting models were projected under multiple climate change scenarios-four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for each of three climate models (CCSM4, MPI-ESM-LR, and NorESM1-M)-to generate predicted distributions for the years 2050 and 2070. We performed chi-squared tests to detect any future changes to total montane habitat area, and Conover-Iman tests to evaluate isolation among the discrete montane habitat patches. Results While the climate models differ with respect to their predictions as to how severe the effects of future climate change will be, they all agree that by as early as year 2050, there will be significant montane habitat loss and increased montane habitat patch isolation across the Madrean Archipelago region under a worst-case climate change scenario (RCP 8.5). Main conclusions Our results suggest that under 21st-century climate change, the Madrean Sky Islands will become increasingly isolated due to montane habitat loss. This may affect their ability to serve as stepping stones and have negative implications for the region's biodiversity.

Central components of the JC hypothesis are noncompetitive effects of distance and density dependence, two drivers that contribute independently to species coexistence, but are ultimately linked in the field. However, although numerous studies provide evidence for either distance- or density-dependent effects based on observational data, experimental testing of simultaneous and interactive effects of distance and density has rarely been conducted, especially in a comprehensive multispecies approach. Here, we make use of the forest Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning project (BEF) -China to estimate distance- and density-dependent effects in a reciprocal tree seedling transplant experiment of 11 tree species. We deployed 13,490 juveniles of all 11 species in their own (home) and in all foreign monocultures (away), as well as at three different levels of planting density, thereby testing for distance and density effects, respectively. In addition, to quantify the amount to which density effects were brought about by potential additional effects of intraspecific competition, we set up a common garden experiment with different levels of planting density, where an additional "shadow" treatment controlled for effects of canopy shading. Although the "away" and "high-density" treatments significantly impaired the performance and productivity of seedlings, leaf damage and survival was exclusively affected by either the home/away or the density treatment, respectively. Negative density-dependent effects on leaf damage were less pronounced in the "home" treatment, showing that the effects were not additive. In addition, results obtained in the Common Garden Experiment showed that negative effects of high density may be also brought about by intraspecific competition as an alternative density-responsive mechanism and less by true JC effects. Overall, our results provide strong support on a multispecies basis for the influence of host-specific effects already operating in early stages of a forest plantation. However, they also emphasize the need to account appropriately for potential additional density-responsive mechanisms such as intraspecific competition or microenvironmental conditions when addressing the role of JC effects for species coexistence.

So far, marine studies about diversity-ecosystem productivity-relationships have concentrated on small-scale, controlled experiments, with often limited relevance to natural ecosystems. Here, we provide a real-world study on the effects of microorganismal diversity (measured as the diversity of benthic diatom communities) on ecosystem productivity (using chlorophyll a concentration as a surrogate) in a heterogeneous marine coastal archipelago. We collected 78 sediment cores at 17 sites in the northern Baltic Sea and found exceptionally high diatom diversity (328 observed species). We used structural equation models and quantile regression to explore relationships between diatom diversity and productivity. Previous studies have found contradictory results in the relationship between microorganismal diversity and ecosystem productivity, but we showed a linear and positive basal relationship between diatom diversity and productivity, which indicates that diatom diversity most likely forms the lowest boundary for productivity. Thus, although productivity can be high even when diatom diversity is low, high diatom diversity supports high productivity. The trait composition was more effective than taxonomical composition in showing such a relationship, which could be due to niche complementarity. Our results also indicated that environmental heterogeneity leads to substantial patchiness in the diversity of benthic diatom communities, mainly induced by the variation in sediment organic matter content. Therefore, future changes in precipitation and river runoff and associated changes in the quality and quantity of organic matter in the sea, will also affect diatom communities and, hence, ecosystem productivity. Our study suggests that benthic microorganisms are vital for ecosystem productivity, and together with the substantial heterogeneity of coastal ecosystems, they should be considered when evaluating the potential productivity of coastal areas.

We hypothesize that this is caused by a lack of a large enough ecological contrast between AEM and non-treated control sites. The effectiveness of AEM may be moderated by landscape structure and land-use intensity. Here, we examined the influence of local ecological contrast, landscape structure and regional land-use intensity on AEM effectiveness in a meta-analysis of 62 European pollinator studies. We found that ecological contrast was most important in determining the effectiveness of AEM, but landscape structure and regional land-use intensity played also a role. In conclusion, the most successful way to enhance AEM effectiveness for pollinators is to implement measures that result in a large ecological improvement at a local scale, which exhibit a strong contrast to conventional practices in simple landscapes of intensive land-use regions.

While some short-lived migrants are known or believed to repeat the same migratory patterns throughout their lives, little is known on the time required for immature long-lived migrants to progressively acquire adult-like migratory behaviours, or which aspects take longer to refine during the maturation process. Here, we studied the ontogeny of long-distance migratory strategies and related patterns of spatial distribution in a long-lived seabird species during the annual cycle. To do so, we deployed light-level geolocators on 4- to 9-year-old immature Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) and on breeding adults. We revealed that migratory timings and destinations of young shearwaters progressively changed with age. The effect of ageing was remarkably evident on spring migratory performance and phenology. Birds gradually shortened the duration of the non-breeding period by advancing departure date and reducing travelling time, which resulted in a sequential arrival at the colony of the various age contingents. Ageing immatures gradually changed from a more exploratory strategy to a more conservative way of exploiting resources, reducing both their year-round spatial spread across oceanic domains and the total distance travelled. Immatures always performed a trans-equatorial migration to the Southern Hemisphere, contrasting with 17% of the adults which remained in the North Atlantic year-round. Finally, during the breeding season immatures were widely dispersed through the North Atlantic reducing their overlap with breeding adults. Our long-term study provides empirical support to the hypothesis that in long-lived species, the refinement of migratory behaviour and year-round spatial distribution is a progressive process mediated by age and experience, where life stage constraints and competition for resources may also play a role. The emerging pattern suggests that for some avian taxa, the ontogeny of migratory strategy is a prolonged, complex and dynamic process.

Climatic change only stimulated growth for trees under weak competition in central boreal forests	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						boreal forest; climate change; competition; drought; growth; rising atmospheric CO2; warming	RECENT INCREASE; MORTALITY; TRENDS; LONG; HEIGHT; FIRE; SIZE	Global change ecologists have often used trees under weak competition (e.g. dominant/codominant trees) to examine relationships between climatic change and tree growth. Scaling up these results to a forest relies on the assumption that the climatic change-tree growth relationship is not affected by tree-level competition. Using permanent sample plot data from the central Canadian boreal region where warming did not result in water deficit, we tested the above-mentioned assumption by looking at whether the relationship between climatic change and tree growth varied with tree-level competition, which was quantified using a modified Hegyi competition index. We found that tree growth increased over time for trees under weak competition, but decreased for those under strong competition. The divergent temporal trends among trees under different levels of competition led to a non-significant change in growth for our study plots. Growth increased with regional warming, atmospheric [CO2] and water availability for trees under weak competition, but not for those under strong competition. Synthesis. Our results suggest that upscaling the growth responses of dominant/codominant trees to climate change to a forest or a region can lead to biased estimates. Tree-level competition should be taken into account when expressing climatic change and tree growth relationships.	[Luo, Yong; Chen, Han Y.

Intensifying human land uses are leading to rapid changes in the fire regimes, with consequences for ecosystem functioning and composition. We undertake a novel analysis describing spatial patterns in the fire regime of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, document multidecadal temporal changes and investigate the factors underlying these patterns. We used MODIS active fire and burned area products from 2001 to 2014 to identify individual fires; summarizing four characteristics for each detected fire: size, ignition date, time since last fire and radiative power. Using satellite imagery, we estimated the rate of change in the density of livestock bomas as a proxy for livestock density. We used these metrics to model drivers of variation in the four fire characteristics, as well as total number of fires and total area burned. Fires in the Serengeti-Mara show high spatial variability-with number of fires and ignition date mirroring mean annual precipitation. The short-term effect of rainfall decreases fire size and intensity but cumulative rainfall over several years leads to increased standing grass biomass and fuel loads, and, therefore, in larger and hotter fires. Our study reveals dramatic changes over time, with a reduction in total number of fires and total area burned, to the point where some areas now experience virtually no fire. We suggest that increasing livestock numbers are driving this decline, presumably by inhibiting fire spread. These temporal patterns are part of a global decline in total area burned, especially in savannahs, and we caution that ecosystem functioning may have been compromised. Land managers and policy formulators need to factor in rapid fire regime modifications to achieve management objectives and maintain the ecological function of savannah ecosystems.

Managing these conflicts requires knowledge about the currently unknown relationship between population sizes and crop damage levels. We analysed unique data on reported, inspected and compensated crop damage caused by geese, swans and cranes together with data from population surveys in Sweden to investigate how bird abundance is related to damage levels at the national scale between 2000 and 2015. Over the study period, the annual number of damage reports, yield loss and costs for compensation increased. These crop damage levels were positively related to national population indices of common crane, barnacle and greylag goose. The shape of these relationships varied between species and encompassed considerable uncertainty. However, on a year-to-year basis (detrended data) we found no evident association between damage levels and bird numbers. Yield loss and compensation costs per reported damage did not increase with higher population indices of greylag goose, but they did so for barnacle goose. Synthesis and applications. We present a novel study of the relationships between different crop damage level indicators (damage reports, yield loss and compensation costs) and population numbers of large grazing birds. We identified a positive relationship with high uncertainty for all cases. We also identified the need to (a) better synchronize the monitoring of damages and bird numbers in time and space and (b) further study the relationships between damage levels and bird numbers at smaller (local and regional) and larger (flyway) spatial scales to reduce the uncertainty of the relationship and to gain a more holistic understanding of the system.

To restore degraded habitats under a facilitation framework, practitioners must correctly select both the benefactor (nurse) and the beneficiary (facilitated) species. Based on community assembly and species coexistence theory, we propose selecting plant species that largely differ in a suite of functional traits so that competition is minimized and facilitation maximized due to functional complementarity. To apply this guideline in a pilot restoration experiment performed in metalliferous mine tailings in South-Eastern Spain, we first built the plant-plant facilitative interaction network naturally occurring in a set of 12 tailings. After characterizing each species with 20 morphological and physiological traits, we verified that facilitative interactions were predominantly established between functionally distant species. Then, we designed a sowing experiment combining 50 nurse-facilitated species pairs separated by a wide range of functional distances. The success of seedling establishment significantly increased with the functional distance between the nurse and the facilitated plant species. Synthesis and applications. We encourage the use of ecological facilitation together with trait-based species selection to design restoration programmes based on the principle of increasing functional distance between target species. This method may not only promote the restoration of the plant cover but also impact paramount ecosystem functions, thus being an efficient low-cost restoration practice in abiotically stressful ecosystems.

In this work, we estimated the relative assimilation and seasonality of autochthonous versus allochthonous organic matter by macrofauna and fishes of a subtropical sandy beach. Sampling of consumers and autotrophic food sources (particulate organic matter in suspension-POM and in sediment-SOM) were obtained seasonally at the sandy beach for carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analysis. The range in isotopic values of POM was nearly two-fold higher in winter than in other seasons, which coincided with similar decrease in delta C-13 values of several consumers. Such decreasing patterns in delta C-13 were associated with high rainfall and freshwater discharge during winter, which exported C-13-depleted continental POM to the sandy beach. The continental allochthonous matter assimilated by marine organisms originated from the drainage of wetlands by innumerous coastal streams spread along the coast and by a larger estuarine system. Bayesian isotope mixing models revealed a slightly higher average assimilation of organic matter of the coastal streams (24%) than the estuary (18%). The assimilation of allochthonous matter was higher in filter feeders bivalves and detritivore fish and lower in carnivorous guilds (e.g. zoobenthivores, zooplanktivores, carnivorous and scavengers).

We test whether this applies to the fragmented Cape fynbos vegetation. Location Southern Africa, Cape Floristic Region (CFR). Taxon Angiosperms, Restionaceae (restios). Methods We used a large occurrence dataset and environmental layers to characterize an existing regionalization and the intervals between the regions ecologically and spatially. We extended the available phylogeny for restios and inferred their historical biogeography using models implemented in BioGeoBEARS. We then measured the relative contribution of immigration and in situ speciation to the species richness of each region within the CFR. We used standard statistical methods to test the predictions of the island biogeography theory. Results The area and environmental heterogeneity of the seven regions of the CFR are positively correlated with in situ speciation rate. Furthermore, more isolated areas, and areas colonized more recently, have proportionally higher immigration rates, and more central and older areas proportionally higher in situ speciation rates. Main conclusions The variation in immigration and diversification dynamics among the regions within the CFR is extensive and consistent with the archipelago model of island biography theory. This dynamic may contribute significantly to the diversity of the Cape flora. Such a model could be generally useful for understanding the generation and maintenance of diversity in biodiversity hotspots, and may even scale up to explain continental biodiversity.

Plants capable of regenerating from aerial shoots following high intensity fires, termed 'epicormic resprouters', are assumed to be resilient to changes in fire regimes. However, empirical tests of the response of epicormic resprouters to extreme fire regimes, such as repeated canopy fires at short intervals, are currently lacking. This study examined the effect of combinations of understorey fire and canopy fire across two successive wildfires (2007, 2013) on the resilience of eucalypts that resprout epicormically. The study took place in a temperate eucalypt forest in south eastern Australia. Measures used to infer community resilience included stem topkill and damage, and seedling recruitment. It was predicted that: (a) stems will exhibit lower resistance (i.e. increased topkill and damage) to canopy fire than understorey fire; (b) recruitment will be higher following canopy fire than understorey fire; (c) prior exposure to canopy fire will reduce stem resistance and recruitment in response to subsequent wildfires; and (d) stem resistance will vary depending on bark traits. Topkill of saplings and small stems (<30 cm diameter at breast height) was higher in sites that recently (i.e. 2013) experienced canopy fire as opposed to understorey fire. Recent fire severity had no effect on topkill of large trees. Tree species with dense bark on the main stem and larger branches were less prone to topkill or partial stem and branch mortality than species with fibrous bark or exposed branches. Seedling recruitment was greater following canopy fire than understorey fire. Exposure to past canopy fire (i.e. in 2007) did not decrease stem resistance or recruitment. Synthesis. The results of this study suggest that communities of eucalypts that can resprout epicormically following fire will experience demographic shifts following repeated canopy fires. However, given the high resistance of large trees and rapid post-fire recovery of the seedbank, ecosystem conversion appears unlikely. The findings support the presumption that forest communities of epicormic resprouters are highly resilient to shifts in fire regimes.

Identifying priority conservation areas for a recovering brown bear population in Greece using citizen science data	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article; Early Access						Greece; large carnivores; Poisson point process; presence-only data; Ursus arctos; citizen science; protected areas; population recovery	HABITAT SUITABILITY; ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH; LARGE CARNIVORE; MODELS; BIAS; TOOL	Understanding the processes related to wildlife recoveries is not only essential in solving human - wildlife conflicts, but also for identifying priority conservation areas and in turn, for effective conservation planning. We used data from a citizen science program to study spatial aspects of the demographic and genetic recovery of brown bears in Greece and to identify new areas for their conservation. We visually compared our data with an estimation of the past distribution of brown bears in Greece and used a point process approach to model habitat suitability. We then compared our results with the current distribution of brown bear records and with that of protected areas. Our results indicate that in the last 15 years bears may have increased their range by as much as 100%, by occupying mainly anthropogenic landscapes and areas with suitable habitat that are currently not legally protected, thus creating a new conservation reality for the species in Greece. This development dictates the re-evaluation of the national management and conservation priorities for brown bears in Greece by focusing in establishing new protected areas that will safeguard their recovery. Our conservation approach is a swift and cheap way of identifying priority conservation areas, while gaining important insights on spatial aspects of population recovery. It will help prioritize conservation actions for brown bears in Greece and may serve as a model conservation approach to countries facing similar financial and logistic constraints in the monitoring of local biodiversity or facing challenges in managing rapid population recoveries. Our conservation approach appeared to be particularly suited to identifying priority areas for conservation in areas with recovering wildlife populations and may therefore be used as an 'early-warning' conservation system.

Plants, position and pollination: Planting arrangement and pollination limitation in a revegetated eucalypt woodland	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION			English	Article; Early Access						aggregation; flowering; plant spatial pattern; restoration; revegetation design; seed production	POLLEN LIMITATION; POPULATION-SIZE; SEED PRODUCTION; DENSITY; FRAGMENTATION; REPRODUCTION; BEHAVIOR; CONSEQUENCES; DIVERSITY; SYSTEM	The spatial arrangement of plants is a key determinant of pollination services in natural ecosystems. Despite this, plant arrangements are rarely considered an important characteristic of revegetated communities and this may be limiting successful pollination dynamics in these re-created systems. We assessed if aggregated South Australian Blue Gum (Eucalyptus leucoxylon, F. Muell) had greater pollination success than more dispersed trees by measuring fruit set, seed production and germination in a revegetated eucalypt woodland. The proportion of buds that developed into fruit (fruit set) was similar between aggregated (five flowering Blue Gum within 30 m) and dispersed (no flowering Blue Gum within 30 m) trees (<14%). Aggregated and dispersed trees produced a similar number of seeds per fruit in 2015, when fewer trees flowered and those that flowered produced fewer flowers (ca 8 seeds/fruit). In 2016, when flowering was more abundant, aggregated trees produced more seeds per fruit than dispersed trees (12 seeds/fruit compared to 4 seeds/fruit). Despite differences in seed number, there was no difference in the quality of seed produced, indicating outcrossed pollen was received by both aggregated and dispersed trees. Although outcrossing was likely, this did not prevent pollination limitation, with the addition of outcrossed pollen increasing fruit and seed set for trees in both arrangements. Consequently, we propose that planting individuals of the same species (conspecifics) in clumps, rather than intermixing species, can increase seed set in revegetated eucalypts, particularly in good flowering years. However, aggregated plantings will be most effective if the needs and foraging behaviour of pollinators are also considered, to attract and sustain pollinators in revegetated systems, thereby minimizing the risk of pollination limitation.			kimberly.mccallum@adelaide.edu.au	Breed, Martin/G-5482-2011	Breed, Martin/0000-0001-7810-9696	Australian Wildlife Society; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; Nature Foundation of South Australia; Australian Research Council [DE150100542, DP150103414]; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship through University of Adelaide; Noel and Vivian Lothian Scholarship through University of Adelaide; BioR; Field Naturalists Society of South Australia	This research was supported by funding from the Australian Wildlife Society, BioR, Field Naturalists Society of South Australia, Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment and the Nature Foundation of South Australia awarded to KPM, and Australian Research Council funding to AJL and MFB (DE150100542; DP150103414).

There is also a broad consensus that blooms are increasing with global warming, but the impacts of other concomitant environmental changes, such as an increase in extreme rainfall events, may affect this response. One of the potential effects of high rainfall events on phytoplankton communities is greater loss of biomass through hydraulic flushing. Here we used a shallow lake mesocosm experiment to test the combined effects of: warming (ambient vs. +4 degrees C increase), high rainfall (flushing) events (no events vs. seasonal events) and nutrient loading (eutrophic vs. hypertrophic) on total phytoplankton chlorophyll-a and cyanobacterial abundance and composition. Our hypotheses were that: (a) total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial abundance would be higher in heated mesocosms; (b) the stimulatory effects of warming on cyanobacterial abundance would be enhanced in higher nutrient mesocosms, resulting in a synergistic interaction; (c) the recovery of biomass from flushing induced losses would be quicker in heated and nutrient-enriched treatments, and during the growing season. The results supported the first and, in part, the third hypotheses: total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial abundance increased in heated mesocosms with an increase in common bloom-forming taxa-Microcystis spp. and Dolichospermum spp. Recovery from flushing was slowest in the winter, but unaffected by warming or higher nutrient loading. Contrary to the second hypothesis, an antagonistic interaction between warming and nutrient enrichment was detected for both cyanobacteria and chlorophyll-a demonstrating that ecological surprises can occur, dependent on the environmental context. While this study highlights the clear need to mitigate against global warming, oversimplification of global change effects on cyanobacteria should be avoided; stressor gradients and seasonal effects should be considered as important factors shaping the response.

Decreasing available bobcat tags appear to have increased success, interest, and participation among hunters	HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE			English	Article						Bobcat; hunter participation; Lynx rufus; supply and demand; wildlife management	WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT	Management of wildlife populations has changed in the last century, coinciding with decreasing hunter populations and interest. Supply and demand suggest that reducing available harvest permits should increase the perceived value of permits, leading to an increase in hunter interest and motivation. We used annual harvest data and hunter surveys to study the effects of decreasing the supply of permits over two decades in Wisconsin. The number of permits issued was important in the top models for annual bobcat harvest and hunter participation. The decrease in the supply of permits was strongly correlated with increases in the number of applications for permits (R-2 = .82) and hunter participation (R-2 = .93), whereas increased hunter interest (applications and participation) was correlated with hunter success (percent of filled permits; R-applications(2) = .90, R-participation(2) = .93). This increasing trend in hunter populations and interest runs counter to general decreasing trends across North America and highlights the critical role of permit supply in wildlife management.

The environmental and genetic determinants of chick telomere length in Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article; Early Access						brood enlargement; heritability; stress; Tachycineta bicolor; telomere length; Tree Swallow	PATERNAL AGE; LONGER TELOMERES; TRADE-OFF; SURVIVAL; DYNAMICS; INHERITANCE; GROWTH; BIRDS; SEX; HERITABILITY	Conditions during early life can have dramatic effects on adult characteristics and fitness. However, we still know little about the mechanisms that mediate these relationships. Telomere shortening is one possibility. Telomeres are long sequences of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes. They shorten naturally throughout an individual's life, and individuals with short telomeres tend to have poorer health and reduced survival. Given this connection between telomere length (TL) and fitness, natural selection should favor individuals that are able to retain longer telomeres for a greater portion of their lives. However, the ability of natural selection to act on TL depends on the extent to which genetic and environmental factors influence TL. In this study, we experimentally enlarged broods of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to test the effects of demanding early-life conditions on TL, while simultaneously cross-fostering chicks to estimate heritable genetic influences on TL. In addition, we estimated the effects of parental age and chick sex on chick TL. We found that TL is highly heritable in Tree Swallow chicks, and that the maternal genetic basis for TL is stronger than is the paternal genetic basis. In contrast, the experimental manipulation of brood size had only a weak effect on chick TL, suggesting that the role of environmental factors in influencing TL early in life is limited. There was no effect of chick sex or parental age on chick TL. While these results are consistent with those reported in some studies, they are in conflict with others. These disparate conclusions might be attributable to the inherent complexity of telomere dynamics playing out differently in different populations or to study-specific variation in the age at which subjects were measured.

More recently, resource-based niche partitioning has been hypothesized to play a very limited role in the assembly of soil animal communities. To test this hypothesis, we applied a novel combination of stable isotopes and null models of species co-occurrence to quantify the extent of resource niche partitioning on a diverse oribatid mite community sampled from mature oak woodland. We asked whether species aggregate or segregate spatially and how these patterns correlated with the abundance of estimated trophic guilds. We also estimated the effects of environmental variables on community structure. All measured environmental variables accounted for 12% of variance in community structure, including 8% of pure spatial structure unrelated to measured environmental factors and 2% of pure environmental variance unrelated to spatial variation. Co-occurrence analysis revealed 10 pairs of species that aggregated and six pairs of species that were spatially segregated. Values of delta N-15 indicated that five out of the 10 pairs of aggregated species occupied the same trophic guild, while values of delta C-13 indicated that species in these five pairs consumed resources of different quality, supporting a significant role of resource-based niche partitioning. Also, one of the five pairs of segregated species occupied the same trophic guild but had overlapping delta C-13 values suggesting that these species do not co-occur locally and thus minimize competition for shared resources. Partitioning of resources plays an underestimated role in soil microarthropod communities and different local communities consisted of the same trophic guilds with species identity changing from place to place. The sum of resource partitioning, multi-trophic interactions, and microscale environmental variability in the environment is a viable solution to the enigma of soil animal diversity.

It is subject to influences from both the North Sea and major European rivers. Nutrient enrichment from these rivers since the 1950s has impacted the Wadden Sea ecology including loss of seagrass, increased phytoplankton blooms, and increased green macroalgae blooms. Rivers are the major source of nutrients causing Wadden Sea eutrophication. The nutrient input of the major rivers impacting the Wadden Sea reached a maximum during the 1980s and decreased at an average pace of about 2.5% per year for total Nitrogen (TN) and about 5% per year for total Phosphorus (TP), leading to decreasing nutrient levels but also increasing N/P ratios. During the past decade, the lowest nutrient inputs since 1977 were observed but these declining trends are leveling out for TP. Phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a) in the Wadden Sea has decreased since the 1980s and presently reached a comparatively low level. In tidal inlet stations with a long-term monitoring, summer phytoplankton levels correlate with riverine TN and TP loads but stations located closer to the coast behave in a more complex manner. Regional differences are observed, with highest chlorophyll a levels in the southern Wadden Sea and lowest levels in the northern Wadden Sea. Model data support the hypothesis that the higher eutrophication levels in the southern Wadden Sea are linked to a more intense coastward accumulation of organic matter produced in the North Sea.

This is particularly true for efforts to address illegal wildlife use, where pervasive-and sometimes simplistic-narratives often obscure complex realities. We used an indirect questioning approach, the unmatched count technique, to investigate the drivers and prevalence of wildlife crime in communities surrounding 2 national parks in Uganda and combined scenario interviews and a choice experiment to predict the performance of potential interventions designed to tackle these crimes. Although poverty is often assumed to be a key driver of wildlife crime, we found that better-off households and those subject to human-wildlife conflict and those that do not receive any benefits from the parks' tourism revenue sharing were more likely to be involved in certain types of wildlife crime, especially illegal hunting. The interventions predicted to have the greatest impact on reducing local participation in wildlife crime were those that directly addressed the drivers including, mitigating damage caused by wildlife and generating financial benefits for park-adjacent households. Our triangulated approach provided insights into complex and hard-to-access behaviors and highlighted the importance of going beyond single-driver narratives.	[Travers, Henry; Milner-Gulland, E.
