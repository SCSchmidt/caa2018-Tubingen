The conversion of natural grasslands (NG) into other land covers, and the consequent modifications of natural landscapes, highlights the need for better management strategies to maintain grasslands in good natural conditions. However, there are many factors that influence sustainability, and to understand the reality of each location and its needs to achieve a sustainable status are a challenge for public managers and for entrepreneurs. Therefore, it is important to evaluate where sustainable beef production is more indicated and which criteria demands more attention for a better sustainable scenario. Hence, this study proposed a composite index to evaluate areas of tension based on the concepts of sustainability and efficient beef cattle farming for NG in the Brazilian PB. The Sustainable Tension Index (STI) is a composite index of descriptor variables that represent the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. The selection of this variables was based on a literature review and governmental documents. For each variable a weight was calculated by a principal components analysis. Each standardized variable was multiplied by the value of its weight, and the results were summed for each municipality to obtain the STI. The STI was classified into intervals by dividing the amplitude of the values by five from very low to very high tensions. Municipalities with low tensions across the three dimensions were considered closer to sustainable development. To evaluate the differences among mesoregions, a PERMANOVA was applied in R software. The STI was able to describe the localities regarding sustainable beef production variables and identified the critical factors in each municipality. Most of Pampa's municipalities presented intermediaries STI, but only three presented low tension in all the dimension, emphasizing the complexity of this issue. The southwest and southeast mesoregions were more apt to sustainable beef production, and the metropolitan mesoregion was the least indicated for this activity. Variables associated to education, income and land use had higher weight for the index. The proposed STI is a tool for both farm managers and political representants to support important decisions and its application presented an optimistic reality regarding the Brazilian PB, which if well managed and supported, has a great potential for sustainable beef cattle farming.

Here, we hypothesized that species richness of perennial plants would increase species richness of annual plants but aboveground biomass of perennial plants would restrict the species richness and aboveground biomass of annual plants across plant functional types (i.e. shrubs, forbs and graminoids) in natural rangelands. We quantified the species richness of annual and perennial plants across plant functional types, and then measured aboveground biomass destructively in 735 quadrats of semi-steppe rangelands. We used linear path analysis model to test for the multivariate effects of perennial on annual plant species using species richness and aboveground biomass datasets, in addition to the influences of grazing disturbances and soil textural properties. Our results showed the species richness of perennial plants (forbs and graminoids) generally promoted the species richness of annual plants (forbs and graminoids). However, the aboveground biomass of perennial species (shrubs, forbs and graminoids) imposed negative or negligible (i.e. nonsignificant negative) influences on the species richness and aboveground biomass of annual species (forbs and graminoids). Hence, perennial species have probably restricted the aboveground biomass of annual plant species due to the resource acquisition, but protected annual plants from grazing and other anthropogenic disturbances. This study suggests that the relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass is positive in general, regardless of the confounding effects of perennial on annual species across plant functional types. This study highlights that simply by integrative modelling of perennial and annual plant species across plant functional types for the associations between species richness and aboveground biomass, better insights can be gained into ecological mechanisms playing a role in the biodiversity conservation of natural rangelands and other natural ecosystems in general.

We estimated BSD in two eutrophic bays located in central Japan, Tokyo Bay and Ise Bay. Estimates were based on monitoring data collected in the period 1981-2015. Reliable BSD estimates were obtained for 89-96% and 67-94% of the monitoring sites in Tokyo Bay and Ise Bay, respectively. Low BSD values were obtained in the innermost sectors of Tokyo Bay (around the Nakagawa, Arakawa and Sumidagawa estuaries) and Ise Bay (around the Shonaigawa, Kisogawa and Ibigawa estuaries). BSD was positively correlated with salinity in both bays, indicating that river-supplied substances, including tripton and/or colored dissolved organic matter, strongly influenced BSD values. Although the highest chlorophyll a concentrations were measured in the innermost sectors of both bays, the proportional contribution of phytoplankton to light attenuation was surprisingly low in comparison with other sectors of the two water bodies. In both bays, phytoplankton accounted for < 40% of light attenuation through the water column, indicating that background factors played a dominant role even in these highly eutrophic waters. Determinations of Secchi depth, BSD, and the proportional contributions of phytoplankton and background factors to light attenuation will improve understanding of the aquatic light environment, which in turn will inform the development of rational coastal management practices.

In recognition of the tremendous value of useful plants and of the increasing threats to their persistence, international agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture have created ambitious conservation targets which must be measured through quantitative indicators so as to facilitate the development and implementation of strategies aimed at safeguarding their genetic diversity. Gaps in the current list of functioning indicators for these targets suggest that the development of effective measurements of the state of conservation of the genetic diversity within useful plants is a major challenge. Here we present a gap analysis indicator methodology that provides a pragmatic estimate of the comprehensiveness of conservation of the genetic diversity within useful wild plants, both ex situ and in situ. The methodology compares the geographic and ecological variation evident from analyses of the 'site of collection' of samples of plant taxa that are safeguarded in genebanks and other living plant repositories, as well as the variation evident in the proportion of species' ranges inhabiting protected areas, against the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. The methodology enables a prioritization of species for immediate conservation action, and, when measured periodically, can quantify progress toward comprehensive conservation of these plants at global, regional, and national scales, including determining when that goal has been reached. Assessing almost 7000 taxa with the "Comprehensiveness of conservation of useful wild plants" indicator, we find that they are currently highly under-conserved, with less than three out of every- 100 taxa assessed as sufficiently conserved or of low priority for further conservation action (overall global indicator = 2.78). Indicator results at the national and regional scales as well as by species use type varied, although virtually all countries, regions, and use categories were found to require further conservation action, particularly with regard to ex situ conservation. The results as well as input data and method code are available for indicator reporting and for conservation prioritization setting.

To analyse local scale impacts of bottom trawling on food web structure we combined biological (species abundance and diets obtained from scientific bottom trawl surveys) and anthropogenic pressure (fishing effort obtained from Vessel Monitoring Systems, VMS) data. Using generalised additive models we explored the effect of bottom-trawling in nine community and trophic indicators across a gradient of fishing effort. We found an extensive effect of fishing on community indicators: with increasing fishing pressure, the biomass of seven out of fifteen functional groups declined, as well as that of the whole benthic-demersal community. Species richness was also significantly affected by bottom trawling, both at community and trophic level. We also showed a negative relationship between fishing effort and mean Trophic Level (mTL) of benthic and demersal communities at small-scale spatial resolution. Despite the apparent reduction of fishing effort observed in the study area in the last decade, we found a strong local influence of this anthropogenic pressure on the benthic-demersal food webs, demonstrating that small spatial resolution is crucial when investigating the effects of spatially heterogeneous pressures, such as fishing. Thus, we highlight the importance of analysing the effect of fishing on ecological indicators and trophic structure at local scales.

As a result, different patterns of multiple ES delivery can be characterized by sustainable or unsustainable trends over time, depending on the interactions occurring among ES. In this paper, a sustainability perspective was used for the identification of desirable and undesirable ES delivery patterns in the water bodies of the Venice lagoon (Italy). A set of 13 ES was quantitatively mapped for the lagoon's water bodies, and the trends of the ES provided by each water body have been explored through a modeling application. Two aggregated indicators, MED/DIR and PRESS/DIR, calculated based on the mapping outcomes, were found to be strongly associated with the modeled trends, and thus provide a synthetic indication of the potential (un)sustainability of the current ES provision. This sustainability-driven analysis paves the way for an operationalization of the ES concept in the context of the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Based on the analysis of the relationships between multiple ES and ecological status, we suggest that ES could play a role in the selection of the biological quality elements, by prioritizing the metrics that are positively associated with the sustainable ES patterns. Adopting a perspective focused on sustainability, the ES concept can be used to define management trajectories that aim to reach the WFD targets through the management of unsustainable ES patterns, in the context of climate change.

Reservoirs are artificial ecosystems that modify the structure of biological populations. Evaluating the spatial synchrony of populations and environmental variables in the development of reservoirs may reveal determinant factors and processes operating in these ecosystems. This may help understand the impacts, optimize monitoring systems and develop strategies to improve and maintain the ecological integrity (or stability) of these environments. In this study, we evaluated the spatial synchrony in zooplankton populations and limnological environmental variables during the implementation of a hydroelectric reservoir in the Amazon region, on the border of the states of Para and Amapa. Synchrony was determined by mean cross-correlation between the pairs of points for each variable, followed by Mantel test to investigate its influencing factors. We observed spatial synchronous values for both population and limnological environmental variables. However, we could not identify the mechanisms that are operating, indicating that more than one factor may be influencing the ecosystem dynamics. Population synchrony increased after impoundment. Population synchrony may be associated with some limnological variables, such as the ones related to the amounts of nutrients, whereas environmental synchrony can be related to extrinsic factors, such as climatic variation, not tested this study. In order to increase the understanding of the mechanisms operating over population and environmental dynamics, we suggest that, besides evaluating limnological environmental variables and spatial synchrony, analyses should include meteorological and landscape data.

Among these, the restoration of the natural flow regime (ecological flows) is considered indispensable for the achievement of the good ecological status, and yet the sensitivity of the current biological indicators to hydrologic parameters remains understudied. The Italian Star_ICMi well represents similar WFD indicators; it is a macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index officially adopted to assess the ecological status of running waters at the national level. Recent legislation has also included the Star_ICMi as one of the indicators used to assess and prescribe ecological flows in river reaches regulated by water abstraction. However, the relationship between river hydrology and the Star_ICMi index is so far virtually unknown. Using data from the Trentino Alto Adige Alpine region, we first assessed the relationship between the Star_ICMi and synthetic descriptors of the physico-chemical (LIMeco) and morphological (MQI) status of respectively 280 and 184 river reaches. Then, we examined the relation between the Star_ICMi and a set of ecologically-relevant hydrologic parameters derived from discharge time-series measured at 21 hydrometric stations, representing both natural and regulated river reaches. Although the Star_ICMi showed significant and linear relationships with the physico-chemical character and, slightly, with the morphological quality of the reaches, its response to flow parameters appeared weak or non-existent when examined with linear models. Mixed quantile regressions allowed the identification of flow parameters that represented limiting factors for macroinvertebrate communities and the associated Star ICMi scores. In particular, the index showed 'negative floors' where lower values were observed in reaches with large temporal variation in flow magnitude as well as frequent low and high flow events, The modelled quantiles also tracked the transition of the index from acceptable to unacceptable conditions. The results suggest that while the central tendency of the Star_ICMi index is not strongly influenced by river flow character, some key flow parameters represent limiting factors that allow the index to reach its lowest values, eventually 'pushing' the site towards unacceptable ecological conditions. The identification of limiting flow parameters can aid the setting of hydrologic thresholds over which ecological impairment is likely to occur, Overall, however, results imply caution is needed in using biological indicator like the Star_ICMi for the quantitative assessment and design of ecological flows.

Six of eight long-term sampling sites were located in forest ecosystems on sandy soils in northern and central Alberta, and two were situated in grasslands on sandy and fine-loamy soils in southern Alberta. Sampling was undertaken every four or five years, with 12 replicate samples taken from seven depth increments from 0-60 cm at each site. The statistical analysis of pH, exchangeable base saturation (BS) percentage, and solution base cation (BC) to aluminum (Al) ratio was conducted in the topmost soil layers (0-2, 2-5 and 5-10 cm). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear regression indicated decreasing trends in pH and BS percentage in some of the sites. Comparison of the initial and most recent monitoring data indicated decreases of up to 0.5 pH units in these layers at five of the forested sites. At two forested sites located in the vicinity of oil sands and heavy oil processing plants, decreasing BS was observed early in the monitoring period, but the trend showed more variability since 2000, even though pH has continued to decline since 1981. BC to Al ratio showed statistically significant variations within some sites over time, but except for a downward trend at one central Alberta site, there were no overall patterns evident at the other sites over time. Both grassland sites had much higher BC to Al ratio and exchangeable BS percentages than the forested sites, and acidification trends were not detected at either of these sites. ANOVA and linear modelling approaches showed significant differences even in instances where pH differed by 0.1-0.2 units, or where other parameters showed very small differences. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between statistically important and biologically important differences in this monitoring program, which is intended to continue for several more years.

Performance of wetland environmental quality assessment indicators at evaluating palustrine wetlands in northeastern New York State	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Wetland assessment; Index of Biotic Integrity; 1-2-3 framework; Ecological integrity	ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE; CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; LAND-USE; INDEX; LANDSCAPE; PREDICTOR; PATTERNS; EASTERN; ROADS	The United States Environmental Protection Agency delegates to States and Tribes primary responsibility for monitoring the condition of wetlands under their jurisdiction, and suggests that wetland assessment be performed in a buildable process deemed the 1-2-3 framework. Level One assessment uses remotely-sensed data, Level Two uses a checklist of site attributes during a single visit, and Level Three includes effortful field surveys of biotic and water quality indicators. We used 16 accepted wetland assessment metrics that varied in levels of effort to evaluate the ecological integrity of 71 palustrine wetlands in New York State, including wetlands with a broad range of disturbance histories. We detected significant correlations across multiple levels and within levels, which indicates that these metrics, regardless of effort, are measuring similar attributes of wetlands. Most metrics also successfully distinguished between three wetland disturbance groups: natural, restored, and Area of Concern. The implication of this finding is that the landscape setting (as assessed by Level One) is linked to the biotic wetland community (as assessed by Level Three), and can be used to predict the ecological condition of a wetland using less complex methods. The relationships did have limits, however, indicating that some metrics either cannot be substituted or may not be as effective as previously thought at evaluating ecological condition of palustrine wetlands. The positive associations among the Levels indicate that it is possible to efficiently and validly evaluate and monitor wetlands using the 1-2-3 framework with appropriately selected indicator metrics.

An evaluation of the efficiency of passive acoustic monitoring in detecting deer and primates in comparison with camera traps	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Cervus nippon; Ecoacoustic monitoring; Lag-phase management; Macaca fuscata; Passive acoustic monitoring	SIKA-DEER; JAPANESE MACAQUES; SOUND-TRANSMISSION; COO CALLS; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; VOCALIZATION; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; BEHAVIOR	In recent years, camera traps have rapidly become popular for the large-scale monitoring of wildlife distribution and population; however, we should not ignore the uncertainty regarding the reliability of camera-based monitoring by inexperienced data gatherers. This study introduces passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as an easier technique for monitoring terrestrial mammals that uses the sound cues that they produce. To validate the efficacy of PAM, we quantitatively compared the detection areas and rates between sound cues (from PAM) and visual cues (from camera traps) of two mammals the sika deer Cervus nippon and the Japanese macaque Macaca fuscata across seven study sites in eastern Japan with different population densities. To collect sound cues, we set up multiple autonomous recording units at the sites and continuously recorded ambient sounds, following a pre-determined schedule. The total recording time reached 9081 h for deer and 8235 h for macaques. We then built sound recognizers to automatically detect eight target call types from the recorded data. To collect visual cues, we also set multiple camera traps at the same sites and for the same observation periods. The key findings were as follows: (1) the fully automated procedures that only used the recognizers to detect sound cues produced numerous false positive detections when the call type possessed vocal plasticity and variations; (2) the semi automated procedures, which included an additional step to validate the automated detections by manual screening, exhibited a great improvement in the detectability and recall rates of the half of the target calls, reaching > 0.70; (3) when using the semi-automated procedures, the frequency of deer and macaque detections per trap-day derived from the sound cues were in most cases approximately dozens of times and several times, respectively, higher than that derived from the visual cues; (4) the main advantage of PAM may be its superior detection areas, which were 100-7000 times wider than those of camera traps; and (5) the current success of the recognition of different call types of each species could broaden the use of PAM, which is not possible for camera traps. PAM could provide socio-behavioral data (i.e., the frequencies and types of inter-individual vocal communications) that could help understand the status of population dynamics and the group compositions, in addition to information related to the presence or absence of species.

In the present study, principal component analysis combined with the outlying mean index was applied to 14 water quality time series (1993-2005) derived from three previously determined homogeneous sections of the Hungarian part of the River Tisza. As a result, the seasonal distribution of the ecological n-dimensional hypervolumes was determined for the different river sections. In the first upper section, the seasonal niches overlay each other, and no clear separation could be detected. In the middle- and lower reaches, however, a clear separation between the seasons was observed. The identification of these separate niches of the various seasons as the main indicators/drivers of certain ecological communities (e.g. phytoplankton) proved possible.

Online courses have the potential to contribute to this nuanced discipline by creating an environment in which learners from various backgrounds and locations can co-create knowledge. Unfortunately, online courses are often executed within the traditional educational paradigm of one-way knowledge transmission. In contrast, creating a community of inquiry invites learners to discuss ideas to generate meaning for themselves through collaborative and constructivist learning experiences. We tested techniques to create a community of inquiry in an online course in an ecological restoration program with the aim of shifting learners' interactions from the transmittal to constructivist model of knowledge construction. We changed three interdependent elements of communities of inquiry: the cognitive, social, and teaching presence. We measured participation and dialogue resulting from changes made to the 2014 and 2015 courses compared to the 2013 course, which served as the control. To quantify dialogue, we developed an index based on the different roles individuals take in a discussion. Results show that participation and dialogue increased, particularly in 2015 when the teaching presence followed a community of inquiry approach by showing curiosity, recognizing multiple perspectives and by illustrating that knowledge can be co-created. Variability in the results among groups suggested that some learners did not thrive in a community of inquiry. Nevertheless, many learners embraced collaborative knowledge construction, setting the stage for an enduring community of ecological restoration practitioners to emerge.

As part of our long-term research programme on the nonmodel teleost fish Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus), we aim to build one of the first catalogues of genomic variants (SNPs and indels, and deletions, duplications and inversions) in fishes and evaluate overlap of genomic variants with regions under putative selection (Tajima's D and pi), and coding sequences (genes). For this, we analysed six males and six females from three locations in New Zealand and generated a high-resolution genomic variation catalogue. We characterized 20,385 SVs and found they intersected with almost a third of all annotated genes. Together with small indels, SVs account for three times more variation in the genome in terms of bases affected compared to SNPs. We found that a sizeable portion of detected SVs was in the upper and lower genomic regions of Tajima's D and pi, indicating that some of these have an effect on the phenotype. Together, these results shed light on the often neglected genomic variation that is produced by SVs and highlights the need to go beyond the mere measure of SNPs when investigating evolutionary processes, such as species diversification and adaptation.

Several studies have shown that inversion polymorphisms can form clines or fluctuate predictably in frequency over seasonal time spans. These observations prompted the hypothesis that chromosomal rearrangements might be subject to spatially and/or temporally varying selection. Here, we review what has been learned about the adaptive significance of inversion polymorphisms in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, the species in which they were first discovered by Sturtevant in 1917. A large body of work provides compelling evidence that several inversions in this system are adaptive; however, the precise selective mechanisms that maintain them polymorphic in natural populations remain poorly understood. Recent advances in population genomics, modelling and functional genetics promise to greatly improve our understanding of this long-standing and fundamental problem in the near future.

Multiple chromosomal rearrangements in a hybrid zone between Littorina saxatilis ecotypes	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						balancing selection; Gastropoda; inversion; linkage disequilibrium; local adaptation; recombination suppression	REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; GENE FLOW; CROSSING-OVER; INVERSIONS; EVOLUTION; DIVERGENCE; RECOMBINATION; SELECTION; BARRIER	Both classical and recent studies suggest that chromosomal inversion polymorphisms are important in adaptation and speciation. However, biases in discovery and reporting of inversions make it difficult to assess their prevalence and biological importance. Here, we use an approach based on linkage disequilibrium among markers genotyped for samples collected across a transect between contrasting habitats to detect chromosomal rearrangements de novo. We report 17 polymorphic rearrangements in a single locality for the coastal marine snail, Littorina saxatilis. Patterns of diversity in the field and of recombination in controlled crosses provide strong evidence that at least the majority of these rearrangements are inversions. Most show clinal changes in frequency between habitats, suggestive of divergent selection, but only one appears to be fixed for different arrangements in the two habitats. Consistent with widespread evidence for balancing selection on inversion polymorphisms, we argue that a combination of heterosis and divergent selection can explain the observed patterns and should be considered in other systems spanning environmental gradients.

In sympatric populations, isolating mechanisms are thus needed to limit the homogenizing effects of gene flow to allow for adaptation and speciation. Chromosomal inversions act as an important mechanism maintaining isolating barriers, yet their role in sympatric populations and divergence with gene flow is not entirely understood. Here, we revisit the question of whether inversions play a role in the divergence of connected populations of the marine fish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), by exploring a unique data set combining whole-genome sequencing data and behavioural data obtained with acoustic telemetry. Within a confined fjord environment, we find three genetically differentiated Atlantic cod types belonging to the oceanic North Sea population, the western Baltic population and a local fjord-type cod. Continuous behavioural tracking over 4 year revealed temporally stable sympatry of these types within the fjord. Despite overall weak genetic differentiation consistent with high levels of gene flow, we detected significant frequency shifts of three previously identified inversions, indicating an adaptive barrier to gene flow. In addition, behavioural data indicated that North Sea cod and individuals homozygous for the LG12 inversion had lower fitness in the fjord environment. However, North Sea and fjord-type cod also occupy different depths, possibly contributing to prezygotic reproductive isolation and representing a behavioural barrier to gene flow. Our results provide the first insights into a complex interplay of genomic and behavioural isolating barriers in Atlantic cod and establish a new model system towards an understanding of the role of genomic structural variants in adaptation and diversification.

Retention of a chromosomal inversion from an anadromous ancestor provides the genetic basis for alternative freshwater ecotypes in rainbow trout	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						chromosomal inversion; ecotype; life history; migration; Oncorhynchus mykiss; rainbow trout	ADAPTIVE GENOMIC VARIATION; MIGRATION-RELATED TRAITS; BY-SEQUENCING DATA; PAIRWISE RELATEDNESS; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; LOCAL ADAPTATION; CANDIDATE GENES; R-PACKAGE; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; STATIONARY ECOTYPES	Migratory behaviour patterns in animals are controlled by a complex genetic architecture. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a salmonid fish that spawns in streams but exhibits three primary life history pathways: stream-resident (fluvial), lake-migrant (adfluvial) and ocean-migrant (anadromous). Previous studies examining fluvial and anadromous O. mykiss have identified several genes associated with life history divergence including the presence of an inversion complex within chromosome 5 (Omy05) that appears to maintain a suite of linked genes controlling migratory behaviour. However, adfluvial trout are migratory without being anadromous, and the genetic basis for this life history has not been investigated from evolutionary perspectives. We sampled wild, native nonanadromous rainbow trout occupying connected stream and lake habitats in a southwest Alaskan watershed to determine whether these fish exhibit genetic divergence between fluvial and adfluvial ecotypes, and whether that divergence parallels that documented in fluvial and anadromous O. mykiss. Data from restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing revealed an association between frequencies of both the Omy05 inversion complex and other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with habitat type (stream or lake), supporting the genetic divergence of fluvial and adfluvial individuals in sympatry. The presence of a genetic basis for migration into lakes, analogous to that documented for anadromy, indicates that the adfluvial ecotype must be recognized separately from the fluvial form of O. mykiss even though neither is anadromous. These results highlight the genetic architecture underlying migration and the importance of chromosomal inversions in promoting and sustaining intraspecific diversity.

Atlantic salmon are usually characterized by population structure at multiple spatial scales; however, this is not the case for tributaries of the Miramichi River in North America. To resolve genetic relationships between populations in this system and the potential for known chromosomal fusions to contribute to adaptation, we genotyped 728 juvenile salmon using a 50 K SNP array. Consistent with previous work, we report extremely weak overall population structuring (Global F-ST = 0.004) and failed to support hierarchical structure between the river's two main branches. We provide the first genomic characterization of a previously described polymorphic fusion between chromosomes 8 and 29. Fusion genomic characteristics included high LD, reduced heterozygosity in the fused homokaryotes, and strong divergence between the fused and the unfused rearrangement. Population structure based on fusion karyotype was five times stronger than neutral variation (F-ST = 0.019), and the frequency of the fusion was associated with summer precipitation supporting a hypothesis that this rearrangement may contribute local adaptation despite weak neutral differentiation. Additionally, both outlier variation among populations and a polygenic framework for characterizing adaptive variation in relation to climate identified a 250-Kb region of chromosome 9, including the gene six6 that has previously been linked to age-at-maturity and run-timing for this species. Overall, our results indicate that adaptive processes, independent of major river branching, are more important than neutral processes for structuring these populations.

While TEs have been investigated for several decades, only recently we have the opportunity to study their genome-wide population dynamics. Most of the studies so far have been restricted either to the analysis of the insertions annotated in the reference genome or to the analysis of a limited number of populations. Taking advantage of the European Drosophila population genomics consortium (DrosEU) sequencing data set, we have identified and measured the dynamics of TEs in a large sample of European Drosophila melanogaster natural populations. We showed that the mobilome landscape is population-specific and highly diverse depending on the TE family. In contrast with previous studies based on SNP variants, no geographical structure was observed for TE abundance or TE divergence in European populations. We further identified de novo individual insertions using two available programs and, as expected, most of the insertions were present at low frequencies. Nevertheless, we identified a subset of TEs present at high frequencies and located in genomic regions with a high recombination rate. These TEs are candidates for being the target of positive selection, although neutral processes should be discarded before reaching any conclusion on the type of selection acting on them. Finally, parallel patterns of association between the frequency of TE insertions and several geographical and temporal variables were found between European and North American populations, suggesting that TEs can be potentially implicated in the adaptation of populations across continents.

However, it is poorly known to what extent the enrichment of transposable elements (TEs) in recombinationally-inert regions reflects their inefficient removal by purifying selection and whether the presence of polymorphic TEs can modify the local recombination rate. In this study, we investigate how TEs and recombination interact at fine scale along chromosomes and possibly support linked selection in natural populations. Whole-genome sequencing data of 304 individuals from nearby alpine populations of Arabis alpina were used to show that the density of polymorphic TEs is specifically correlated with local LD along chromosomes. Consistent with TEs modifying recombination, the characterization of 28 such LD blocks of up to 5.5 Mb in length revealed strong evidence of selective sweeps at a few loci through either site frequency spectrum or haplotype structure. A majority of these blocks were enriched in genes related to ecologically relevant functions such as responses to cold, salt stress or photoperiodism. In particular, the S-locus (i.e., supergene responsible for strict outcrossing) was identified in a LD block with high levels of polymorphic TEs and evidence of selection. Another such LD block was enriched in cold-responding genes and presented evidence of adaptive loci related to photoperiodism and flowering being increasingly linked by polymorphic TEs. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TEs modify recombination landscapes and thus interact with selection in driving blocks of linked adaptive loci in natural populations.

However, the geomagnetic field can be altered by solar activity at relative unpredictable intervals. How birds cope with the temporal geomagnetic variations caused by solar storms during migration is still unclear. We addressed this question by reproducing the effect of a solar storm on the geomagnetic field and monitoring the activity of three songbird species during autumn migration. We found that only the European robin reduced nocturnal migratory restlessness in response to simulated solar storms. At the same time, robins increased activity during early morning. We suggest that robins reduced activity at night when the perception of magnetic information would be strongly disrupted by temporal variations of the magnetic field, to extend their migration during daytime when several visual cues become available for orientation. The other two species, chiff-chaff and dunnock, showing low or no nocturnal migratory activity, did not respond to the solar storm by changing activity.

Parasite - offspring competition for female resources can explain male-biased parasitism in plants	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						dioecy; gender; herbivory; reproduction; sexual dimorphism	ADAPTIVE ADVANTAGES; DIOECIOUS PLANTS; DIMORPHISM; SIZE	Male-biased susceptibility to parasites is common in dioecious plants. However, why males have higher parasite loads than females is unclear. Unlike males, females must subsidize post-fertilization costs of reproduction (e.g. seed and fruit development). As a result, females may have smaller pools of resources potentially available to parasites, thus leading to lower parasite loads. We tested this prediction in New Zealand's largest native moth (Aenetus virescens: Lepidoptera), whose larvae parasitize Aristotelia serrata (Elaeocarpaceae), an endemic species of dioecious tree. We measured parasite loads in male and female trees, as well as annual seed set in females. We then derived a technique to equate the energetic cost of seed set in females to an equivalent number of parasitic larvae. Our results showed evidence for male-biased parasitism: male trees harboured more larval parasites than female trees. However, when parasite loads in males were compared with parasite loads in females, plus the energetic cost of seed production calculated as an equivalent number of parasitic larvae, differences in parasitism between the sexes disappeared. We conclude that male-biased parasitism in plants could arise from parasite-offspring (i.e. herbivore-seed) competition for female resources.

In first-order streams, pCO(2) and pN(2)O were significantly higher in the stream with the most wetland influence (mean1std: 3,9651,504 and 1.180.37atm, respectively) than the forested stream (2,927439 and 0.470.08atm, respectively). In second-order streams, pCO(2), pCH(4), and pN(2)O were higher in the 14% wetland stream (3,274 +/- 825, 501 +/- 207, and 1.37 +/- 0.43atm, respectively) than in the 2% wetland stream (1,858 +/- 423, 137 +/- 53, and 0.37 +/- 0.08atm, respectively). In first-order streams, pCO(2) in streams with wetland influence increased during rain events, while pCO(2) in streams with little to no wetland influence decreased or remained constant. Generally, pCH(4) and pN(2)O followed the same trend, except in one stream with intermediate wetland influence. Gas transfer velocity increased in all streams during storm events. However, the forested streams had higher gas transfer velocities than the wetland streams due to steeper topography. CO2, CH4, and N2O evasion peaked in one of the intermediate wetland streams at high flow (maximum: 66gC.m(-2).day(-1), 177mgC.m(-2).day(-1), and 9.7mgN.m(-2).day(-1), respectively). These findings suggest that gases are shunted downstream in flatter, wetland streams, while gases are evaded closer to their source in steeper, forested streams. Plain Language Summary Greenhouse gas evasion from inland waters is an important component of the global carbon cycle. However, this flux has only just been included in the most recent IPCC carbon cycle (AR5). Headwater streams are areas where gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, tend to collect and are released to the atmosphere. Gas dynamics in headwater streams must be understood to improve global evasion estimates. We sampled streams covering a gradient of wetland to forest land covers during rainstorms to examine the effects on gas evasion. We found that gas concentrations generally increased during storms in wetland streams, while concentrations tended to decrease or remain constant in forested streams. However, we found that gases were more easily evaded from forested streams than from wetland streams. Forested streams tend to be found in steeper areas and have more turbulent flows than wetland streams, which promote evasion. Conversely, gas inputs to wetland streams are carried downstream and released farther from the source. The significance of this work is that greenhouse gas evasion from headwater streams is a spatially and temporally variable flux from the landscape. Inclusion of this variability in global models may support higher global evasion estimates.	[Aho, K. S.; Raymond, P.

While burial of aquatic OC (by, e.g., phytoplankton) in reservoirs may count as a new C sink, the burial of terrestrial OC in reservoirs constitutes a new C sink only if the burial is more efficient in reservoirs than in other depositional environments. We carried out incubation experiments that mimicked the environmental conditions of different depositional environments along the land-sea continuum (oxic and anoxic freshwater, oxic and anoxic seawater, oxic river bedload, and atmosphere-exposed floodplain) to investigate whether reservoirs bury OC more efficiently compared to other depositional environments. For sediment OC predominantly of terrestrial origin, OC degradation rates were significantly lower, by a factor of 2, at anoxic freshwater and saltwater conditions compared to oxic freshwater and saltwater, river, and floodplain conditions. However, the transformation of predominantly terrestrial OC to methane was one order of magnitude higher in anoxic freshwater than at other conditions. For sediment OC predominantly of aquatic origin, OC degradation rates were uniformly high at all conditions, implying equally low burial efficiency of aquatic OC (76% C loss in 57days). Since anoxia is more common in reservoirs than in the coastal ocean, these results suggest that reservoirs are a depositional environment in which terrestrial OC is prone to become buried at higher efficiency than in the ocean but where also the terrestrial OC most efficiently is transformed to methane. Plain Language Summary The widespread construction of dams disrupts the transport of sediment particles by rivers and traps sediment in reservoirs. The sediment contains organic carbon (OC) that can be degraded into greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide and methane) or buried in the sediment. In the absence of dams, sediment would be deposited in other environments, such as rivers, floodplains, or sea. In our study, we investigated through incubation experiments if the construction of reservoirs creates an environment that stores sediment OC more efficiently than other environments. We found that OC from terrestrial origin is buried more efficiently in anoxic conditions than in oxic conditions. Slowing down of water and high primary production makes reservoirs prone to anoxia, implying that they may be sites of highly efficient OC burial. However, anoxic reservoir conditions were also characterized by higher methane emissions than other environments. OC from aquatic origin was degraded extensively in all studied conditions. Our results suggest that the similar to 50% of the terrestrial OC that escapes degradation if it gets trapped in an anoxic reservoir may be accounted as a new carbon sink; however, whole-system studies that account for site-specific environmental conditions are necessary to calculate the magnitude of this effect.

Here we used a total of 595 forest plots in South Korea to investigate the role of four grouped tree speciespines, oaks, other conifers, and other deciduous treesin the forest SOC content in both forest floors and mineral soils. Significant differences were observed in SOC content among the groups. Pines contained 7.12MgC/ha of organic carbon in forest floors, whereas oaks and other deciduous trees contained 5.39 and 5.41MgC/ha, respectively. In contrast, oaks and other deciduous trees contained similar to 66MgC/ha of organic carbon each in mineral soils (0- to 30-cm depth), whereas pines contained 49.50MgC/ha. The total SOC content including both forest floors and mineral soils was the largest under oaks and the smallest under other coniferous trees, due to SOC being approximately an order of magnitude higher in mineral soils than in forest floors. The effects of tree species on SOC storage became apparent for the forest stands with >20-year-old trees, which suggests that the observed differences in the SOC content are likely due to the current stands rather than remnants of previous stands. The decomposition rates of organic materials could be a controlling factor affecting SOC storage, rather than inputs of photosynthesized products to soils. Plain Language Summary Globally, soil contains more than three times the organic carbon (OC) than tree biomass. Fresh and decaying tree litter is piled up on the forest floor, whereas debris of roots and organic matter accumulate in the mineral soil. Different tree species can store different amounts of OC in their soils. However, most studies have been conducted on a relatively small number of plots, that is, less than similar to 50. We used a total of 595 forest plots in South Korea to investigate the role of tree species on SOC content and found that pines store more OC than oaks and other deciduous trees in the forest floor. In contrast, oaks and other deciduous trees have more OC than pines in their mineral soil. Since the SOC content in mineral soil is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that in forest floors, the total SOC content was also higher under deciduous trees than pines. Our results suggest that SOC content can be managed by the selection of tree species.

Dependence of Aspen Stands on a Subsurface Water Subsidy: Implications for Climate Change Impacts	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						plant hydraulics; transpiration; tree mortality; climate change; subsurface water subsidy; xylem	XYLEM VULNERABILITY; TREE MORTALITY; STOMATAL RESPONSES; PLANT HYDRAULICS; DROUGHT; CAVITATION; VEGETATION; FOREST; GROUNDWATER; TEMPERATURE	The reliance of 10 Utah (USA) aspen forests on direct infiltration of growing season rain versus an additional subsurface water subsidy was determined from a trait- and process-based model of stomatal control. The model simulated the relationship between water supply to the root zone versus canopy transpiration and assimilation over a growing season. Canopy flux thresholds were identified that distinguished nonstressed, stressed, and dying stands. We found growing season rain and local soil moisture were insufficient for the survival of 5 of 10 stands. Six stands required a substantial subsidy (31-80% of potential seasonal transpiration) to avoid water stress and maximize photosynthetic potential. Subsidy dependence increased with stand hydraulic conductance. Four of the six "subsidized" stands were predicted to be stressed during the survey year owing to a subsidy shortfall. Since winter snowpack is closely related to groundwater recharge in the region, we compared winter precipitation with tree-ring chronologies. Consistent with model predictions, chronologies were more sensitive to snowpack in subsidized stands than in nonsubsidized ones. The results imply that aspen stand health in the region is more coupled to winter snowpack than to growing season water supply. Winters are predicted to have less precipitation as snow, indicating a stressful future for the region's aspen forests.	[Love, D. M.; Venturas, M. D.; Sperry, J. S.; Wang, Y.; Anderegg, W. R.

Warming Alters Hydrologic Heterogeneity: Simulated Climate Sensitivity of Hydrology-Based Microrefugia in the Snow-to-Rain Transition Zone	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						snow redistribution; climate change; semiarid; SHAW; complex terrain; hydrology	UNITED-STATES; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; WATER AVAILABILITY; VEGETATION; TERRAIN; BALANCE; REFUGIA; RUNOFF; MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION	In complex terrain, drifting snow contributes to ecohydrologic landscape heterogeneity and ecological refugia. In this study, we assessed the climate sensitivity of hydrological dynamics in a semiarid mountainous catchment in the snow-to-rain transition zone. This catchment includes a distinct snow drift-subsidized refugium that comprises a small portion (14.5%) of the watershed but accounts for a disproportionate amount (modeled average 56%) of hydrological flux generation. We conducted climate sensitivity experiments using a physically based hydrologic model to assess responses of a suite of hydrologic metrics across the watershed. Experiments with an imposed 3.5 degrees C warming showed reductions in average maximum snow water equivalent of 58-68% and deep percolation by 72%. While relative decreases were similar across the watershed, much greater absolute decreases in snowpack occurred in the drift-subsidized site than the surrounding landscape. In drift-subsidized locations, warming caused a shift from a regime that included both energy- and water-limited evapotranspiration conditions to exclusively water-limited conditions. Warming also resulted in altered interannual variability of hydrologic metrics. The drift-subsidized unit was more sensitive to warming than the surrounding landscape, with reduced potential for the effects of warming to be offset by increased precipitation. Despite spatially homogeneous changes in climate, the effects of climate change on the hydrological dynamics were spatially heterogeneous in this watershed due to the presence of lateral water transport in the form of drifting snow. These findings suggest an increase in hydrologic homogeneity across the landscape and relatively large changes in snow drift-subsidized refugia.	[Marshall, A. M.; Link, T.

This variability is rarely captured by environmental monitoring but is crucial for accurately assessing the magnitude of lake CO2 emissions. However, it is unknown to what extent temporal variability needs to be captured to understand important drivers of lake carbon cycling such as climate and land management. We used environmental monitoring data of Swedish forest lakes collected in autumn (n = 439) and throughout the whole open water season (n = 22) from a wet and a dry year to assess temporal variability in effects of climate and forestry on CO2 concentrations across lakes. Effects differed depending on the season and year sampled. According to cross-lake comparisons based on autumn data, CO2 concentrations increased with annual mean air temperature (dry year) or catchment forest productivity (wet year) but were not related to colored dissolved organic matter concentrations. In contrast, open water-season averaged CO2 concentrations were similar across temperature and productivity gradients but increased with colored dissolved organic matter. These contradictions resulted from scale mismatches in input data, lead to weak explanatory power (R-2 = 9-32%), and were consistent across published data from 79 temperate, boreal, and arctic lakes. In a global survey of 144 published studies, we identified a trade-off between temporal and spatial coverage of CO2 sampling. This trade-off clearly determines which conclusions are drawn from landscape-scale CO(2 )assessments. Accurate evaluations of the effects of climate and land management require spatially and temporally representative data that can be provided by emerging sensor technologies and forms of collaborative sampling. Plain Language Summary Lakes interact with the atmosphere by exchanging greenhouse gases !in such as carbon dioxide that have implications for the global climate. In order to predict future carbon dioxide exchanges, the effects of climate and land management need to be determined. Here we show that the apparent effects of climate and forestry on carbon dioxide concentrations in temperate, boreal, and arctic lakes are inconsistent and depend on whether lakes are sampled during autumn or throughout the year and whether it was a wet or dry year. To accurately quantify effects, hundreds of lakes would need to be sampled at least six times per year. Published literature suggests that this is unrealistic. This implies a need for new automated measurement technologies and collaborative teamwork to provide representative data and allow accurate predictions of the effects of climate and land management.

We have limited understanding of the extent to which spatial behavior varies among groups and individuals within populations. Here, we use genetic pedigree reconstruction in a long-term study of European badgers (Meles meles) to characterize the extent of extra-group paternity, occurring as a consequence of breeding excursions, and to test hypothesized drivers of variation at multiple levels. We jointly estimate parentage and paternity distance (PD; distance between a cub's natal and its father's social group), and test whether population density and sex ratio influence mean annual PD. We also model cub-level PD and extra-group paternity (EGP) to test for variation among social groups and parental individuals. Mean PD varied among years but was not explained by population density or sex ratio. However, cub-level analysis shows strong effects of social group, and parental identities, with some parental individuals being consistently more likely to produce cubs with extra-group partners. Group effects were partially explained by local sex ratio. There was also a strong negative correlation between maternal and paternal social group effects on cub paternity distance, indicating source-sink dynamics. Our analyses of paternity distance and EGP indicate variation in extra-group mating at multiple levelsamong years, social groups and individuals. The latter in particular is a phenomenon seldom documented and suggests that gene flow among groups may be disproportionately mediated by a nonrandom subset of adults, emphasizing the importance of the individual in driving eco-evolutionary dynamics.

Here, we investigated multimodal signaling function in the visual and substrate-borne vibratory modalities of the UV-ornamented jumping spider Cosmophasis umbratica, in which the importance of UV coloration in courtship displays has been demonstrated. We first described vibratory signals produced by courting males. We found that while vibratory signals mainly consist of palp drumming and abdomen thump, amplitude of abdomen thump shows a high variance and is positively correlated with body mass. This suggests that abdomen thump as a vibratory component may be condition-dependent. To examine whether the vibratory and UV signal function as backup to each other in a variable environment (efficacy-based backup hypothesis), we used a fully crossed 2 x 2 mating assay, a signal-isolation approach, to investigate how isolated and combined signals affect mate choice by females. Our results showed that both signals in isolation or in combination result in similar female responses (i.e., mating success, latency to copulation, female attention ratio). The presence of both vibratory and UV signals affects mating frequency, with no significant differences in mating frequency when vibratory and UV signals are presented in isolation or in combination. These results support the efficacy-based backup hypothesis. We therefore conclude that vibratory and UV signals have equivalent effects in predicting mating success in C. umbratica.

Among the potential costs of nematode infection are physiological changes caused by immune system activation, reduction or reallocation of available energy, as well as potential social consequences in terms of decreased social activity or avoidance of infected individuals. We used experimental anthelmintic treatment to investigate effects of strongyle nematode infection in Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus), comparing 56 treated to 17 untreated individuals. Deworming success was monitored by coproscopy and infection probability estimated from patch occupancy models. Increasing strongyle infection probabilities were associated with increased fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels and slightly decreased activity and had no significant effect on energy balance quantified as urinary C-Peptide levels. The frequency to approach into close spatial proximity of a partner was predicted by the partner's, but not focal individual's infection status, with a tendency toward infected individuals being approached less frequently. Although effects were weak, they suggest a co-occurrence of sickness behavior and avoidance of infected conspecifics, both possibly shaping social interaction patterns with potential consequences for an individual's social relationships. This study adds to the growing body of research on the complex interactions of sociality, health, and fitness in a group living species.

Here, building upon previous sperm competition models, we theoretically investigate how variation in total investment into fertilization success, as well as differences in the form of precopulatory competition, influences the correlation between pre- and postcopulatory traits across species. We find that whenever species differ in the total investment into fertilization, optimal partitioning of investment typically generates positive correlations between sexual traits. This contrasts with the general expectation of a negative correlation based on the trade-off between investment in pre- and postcopulatory traits at the level of an individual. Nonetheless, negative correlations do arise under some conditions, notably when total investment into fertilization is similar across species and species vary in the form of precopulatory male-male competition along a continuum from dyadic contest to scramble competition. These results imply that the assessment of underlying trade-offs between pre- and postcopulatory trait investment requires an evaluation of how overall investment into total fertilization success varies across species.

Multiple environmental cues impact habitat choice during nocturnal homing of specialized reef shrimp	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						coral reef; habitat selection; homing; Lysmata pederseni; peppermint shrimp; sensory systems; sponges	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; HIGH DIVERSITY; CORAL-REEFS; SELECTION; METABOLITES; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; FISH; PREFERENCE; DISPERSAL	Habitat selection is a critical process for animals throughout their life, and adult organisms that travel to forage or mate must reselect habitat frequently. On coral reefs, competition for space has led to a high proportion of habitat specialists. Habitat selection is especially vital for organisms that require specialized habitat; however, research has primarily focused on the initial habitat choice made during the larval/juvenile stage. Here, we analyze habitat selection in the adult sponge-dwelling reef shrimp, Lysmata pederseni. Using a mark-and-recapture technique, belt transects, patch reefs, and cue isolation experiments, this study reveals that adult L. pederseni diurnally reselect habitat and a natural preference exists for specific sponge species and shapes. This natural preference is a function of chemical and morphological cues as well as sponge distribution. As habitat specialists can drive biodiversity, understanding the mechanisms behind habitat selection can inform research and management practices.

Despite an increasingly refined understanding of differences in foraging behavior between individuals, we still lack detailed characterizations of within-individual variation over space and time, and what factors may drive this variability. From 2014 to 2017, we used GPS transmitters and accelerometers to document foraging movements by breeding adult Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where the prey landscape is patchy and dynamic at various scales. Assessments of traditional foraging metrics such as trip distance, linearity, or duration did not yield significant relationships between individuals. However, we did observe lower site fidelity and less variation in energy expenditure in birds of higher body condition, despite a population-level trend of increased fidelity as the breeding season progressed. These findings suggest that high-quality individuals are both more variable and more efficient in their foraging behaviors during a period of high energetic demand, consistent with a rich get richer scenario in which individuals in better condition are able to invest in more costly behaviors that provide higher returns. This work highlights the importance of considering behavioral variation at multiple scales, with particular reference to within-individual variation, to improve our understanding of foraging ecology in wild populations.

Testes size increases with sperm competition risk and intensity in bony fish and sharks	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						polyandry; sexual selection; sperm competition	EXTRA-PAIR PATERNITY; MULTIPLE PATERNITY; SEXUAL SELECTION; REPRODUCTIVE MODE; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; FERTILIZATION; FREQUENCY; CONFLICT; SPERMATOZOA	Female multiple mating provides the opportunity for sexual selection to continue after gamete release, generating strong selection on male reproductive traits. In particular, in species where female multiple mating is common, males are expected to invest more in testicular tissue to afford them a numerical advantage during sperm competition. However, although relative testes size (correcting for body size) is a commonly used proxy of the strength of sperm competition, there is surprisingly scant direct evidence linking male investment in testes with genetic estimates of multiple paternity across species. Here, we test the hypothesis that testes size is associated with genetic estimates of sperm competition risk (multiple paternity percentage) and intensity (number of sires per brood) in fishes, the most diverse and specious vertebrate group. We provide conclusive evidence that relative testes size is larger in species experiencing a higher risk and intensity of sperm competition, a finding that remains consistent among sharks and bony fishes (including in separate analyses focused only on cichlids). These findings shed new light on evolutionary processes governing sperm competition in a basal vertebrate lineage and validate the now-widespread use of relative testes mass as a proxy for sperm competition risk and intensity in fishes.

Horizontal partner exchange does not preclude stable mutualism in fungus-growing ants	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						attine ants; mutualism; symbiont transmission; symbiosis	LEAF-CUTTING ANTS; SYMBIOTIC FUNGI; NEST ESTABLISHMENT; MULLERS RATCHET; ATTINE ANT; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; FORMICIDAE; TRANSMISSION; COEVOLUTION	Vertical symbiont transmission tends to stabilize mutualisms by aligning the reproductive interests of cooperating species. The attine ants conform well to this principle because all species are nutritionally dependent on vertically transmitted and clonally propagated fungal cultivars. Multiple mechanisms expressed by both partners constrain cultivar transmission between established colonies, but these appear not to preclude horizontal transfer during colony founding, consistent with multiple phylogenetic analyses indicating at least occasional horizontal transfer. The ecological and evolutionary impact of transfers is unknown because, although they can be induced in laboratory experiments, they remain undocumented in natural colonies. In a large-scale field study, we manipulated clusters of newly founded nests and their still portable gardens in two sympatric species of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants. This created mosaics of intact nests, queens without a cultivar, and cultivars without a tending queen. We tracked the movements of queens and cultivars through direct observation and microsatellite analysis, respectively. This showed that horizontal acquisition of incipient gardens is surprisingly common because queens actively searched for replacement cultivars and often adopted orphaned gardens. However, these horizontal cultivar exchanges are unlikely to destabilize obligate farming mutualisms when they are restricted to the founding stage, as colonies eventually commit to a single cultivar clone, irreversibly aligning the partners' fitness interests before colonies reproduce.

Social context affects thermoregulation but not activity level during avian immune response	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						house sparrow; immune heterogeneity; sickness behavior; social context; thermoregulation	SPARROWS PASSER-DOMESTICUS; ACUTE-PHASE RESPONSES; SICKNESS BEHAVIORS; FEVER; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; TESTOSTERONE; TEMPERATURE; HYPOTHERMIA; INFECTION; BIRDS	Determining how an animal's social context alters its immune responses will help us understand how pathogens impact individual health and spread within groups. Several studies have shown that group-housed animals can suppress components of the acute phase immune response, specifically sickness behaviors like lethargy. However, we do not know whether individuals alter sickness behaviors or other components of the acute phase response, including thermoregulation, in response to the infection status of other group members. We used automated radio telemetry on captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to test whether sickness behaviors and thermoregulation differed during immune challenge under 2 social contexts: 1) all of the flock inoculated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a non-replicating component of gram-negative bacterial cell walls, or 2) half of the flock inoculated. We predicted that with half of the flock inoculated, LPS-treated birds would be under more pressure to maintain competitive behaviors, so would suppress components of the acute phase response. As we predicted, LPS-inoculated birds showed less pronounced heterothermia (fever) when housed with a mixture of inoculated and healthy flockmates. In contrast, LPS-inoculated birds exhibited similar degrees of lethargy regardless of the infection status of their flockmates. Our results show that the infection status of an individual's social group did exert an effect on the acute phase response but surprisingly did not impact the expression of lethargy, a canonical sickness behavior. Determining the mechanisms underlying these responses will require testing additional social contexts with different ratios of infected to uninfected birds.

Behavioral syndromes are evolutionarily intriguing because they suggest that an adaptive change in one behavior requires a concomitant shift in another. Within species, behavioral syndromes might be evolutionarily constrained by intrinsic mechanisms that restrict behaviors from evolving independently. Alternatively, behavioral correlations might easily be decoupled over short evolutionary time scales due to variation in selective pressures between environments. In this regard, comparative studies that explore differences in diverse aspects of personality between geographically distinct populations can provide valuable insights into the evolutionary processes acting on different behavioral tendencies. Accordingly, we investigated how behavioral types and behavioral syndromes differed across four geographically distinct populations of the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. We found strong evidence of mean trait-level variation in activity, exploration, and boldness across populations, suggesting adaptation to local environmental conditions. Similarly, we found that within-population correlations involving boldness varied substantially between populations. However, we did find a consistent within- and among-population correlation between activity and exploration, suggesting that this behavioral syndrome is relatively stable and could explain behavioral divergence in activity and exploration between populations. We suggest that there may be thermal physiological mechanisms that could be limiting the adaptive potential of an activity-exploration correlation in the delicate skink. Broadly, we argue that some behavioral correlations may be more adaptive than others, and that this should be more regularly considered within the animal personality framework.

Their adaptive value and underlying mechanisms are thus fundamental questions. Many animals use information about resource locations inadvertently broadcasted by other individuals through visual, acoustic, or olfactory cues. Such simple, involuntary information transfer is commonly employed in groups of social animals. However, it remains unknown whether public information use could have been the initial cause of social aggregations. Here, using agent-based modeling, in the absence of inclusive fitness benefits or direct conspecific attraction, we show that the use of ephemeral public information about resource locations can cause memory-based foragers to spontaneously and permanently aggregate into communal home ranges that take the form of movement circuits (also called traplines) along which individuals travel asynchronously. Even though experienced individuals only rely on their personal memory to inform their movement decisions, we find that the use of public information during the learning phase is very beneficial in the long term because the communal circuits are more efficient than those established by individuals that do not use public information. Our results reveal how simple, inadvertent information transfer between naive, selfish foragers can cause the emergence of long-term aggregations, which are a prerequisite for the evolution of more complex social behaviors. They also suggest that individuals may not necessarily need to witness the entire sequences of actions performed by others to converge to the same behavioral routines.

We use satellite tracking data from northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), paired with simultaneous diving information, to develop a Bayesian state-space model that concurrently estimates an individual's location, feeding activity, and changes in condition. The model identifies important foraging areas and times, the relative amount of feeding occurring therein, and thus the different behavioral strategies in which the seals engage. The fitness implications of these strategies can be assessed by looking at the resulting variation in individuals' condition, which in turn affects the condition and survival of their offspring. Therefore, our results shed light on the processes affecting an individual's decision-making as it moves and feeds in the environment. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be used to simulate realistic patterns of disturbance at different stages of the trip, and how the predicted accumulation of lipid reserves varies as a consequence. Particularly, disturbing an animal in periods of high feeding activity or shortly after leaving the colony was predicted to have the potential to lead to starvation. In contrast, an individual could compensate even for very severe disturbance if such disturbance occurred outside the main foraging grounds. Our modeling approach is applicable to marine mammal species that perform drift dives and can be extended to other species where an individual's buoyancy can be inferred from its diving behavior.

During a predator chase, aquatic prey release chemical disturbance cues that may vary in their reliability depending on the individuals receiving them. Thus, prey may rely differentially on disturbance cues from familiar individuals (due to previous experience) or from kin (due to their relatedness). We examined the responses of wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) tadpoles to disturbance cues from familiar versus unfamiliar conspecifics and kin versus non-kin. In accordance with our prediction, tadpoles responded differently to disturbance cues from familiar versus unfamiliar conspecifics. Tadpoles receiving disturbance cues from unfamiliar individuals displayed a fright response, whereas tadpoles ignored disturbance cues from familiar individuals. Tadpoles may have habituated to familiar cues since they were unaccompanied by a true threat, hence rendering these cues functionally unreliable. Tadpoles responded similarly to disturbance cues from related and unrelated individuals suggesting they were similarly reliable and this mirrors the matching reliability of prey responses to damage-released alarm cues from kin and non-kin. Our findings shed light on a seldom-studied chemical communication system in aquatic prey.

Yet, studies on how developmental plasticity shapes patterns of variation within populations are comparatively rare and often focus on a subset of developmental cues (e.g., nutrition). One potentially important but understudied developmental experience is social experience, as it is explicitly hypothesized to increase variation among individuals as a way to promote social niches. To test this, we exposed juvenile black widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus) to the silk of conspecifics by transplanting them onto conspecific webs for 48 h once a week until adulthood. We also utilized an untouched control group as well as a disturbed group. This latter group was removed from their web at the same time points as the social treatment, but was immediately placed back on their own web. After repeatedly measuring adult behavior and web structure, we found that social rearing drove higher or significant levels of repeatability relative to the other treatments. Repeatability in the social treatment also decreased in some traits, paralleling the decreases observed in the disturbed treatments. Thus, repeated juvenile disturbance may decrease among-individual differences in adult spiders. Yet, social rearing appeared to override the effect of disturbance in some traits, suggesting a prioritization effect. The resulting individual differences were maintained over at least one-third of the adult lifespan and thus appear to represent stable, canalized developmental effects and not temporal state differences. These results provide proximate insight into how a broader range of developmental experiences shape trait variation.

Social rank, color morph, and social network metrics predict oxidative stress in a cichlid fish	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						dominance hierarchy; oxidative stress; social stress	TRADE-OFFS; HAPLOCHROMIS-BURTONI; TESTOSTERONE; DOMINANCE; LIFE; CORTISOL; CONSEQUENCES; REPRODUCTION; CAROTENOIDS; DIVERGENCE	Dominance hierarchies are a fundamental part of social systems in many species and social rank can influence access to resources and impact health and physiology. While social subordination is a profound stressor, few studies consider the social stress experienced by dominant males due to constantly needing to defend their dominance status through costly aggressive displays. Recent studies suggest that in species that use body coloration to signal status, these costs may also be color morph-specific. Our study examines the link between the social rank, intensity of territorial defense, body coloration, and oxidative stress in males of the color polymorphic cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni where males are either blue or yellow. We studied behavior in naturalistic communities and examined circulating reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) and antioxidant defenses. We found that dominant males experience higher concentrations of circulating ROMs without notably increasing their antioxidant defenses, but this effect was not related to color morph. Aggression and social network ties predicted oxidative stress in a morph-specific manner, with yellow but not blue males showing signs of increased oxidative damage with increasing agonistic effort. In contrast to expectation, oxidative stress was not influenced by cortisol or testosterone levels. We conclude that oxidative stress is instrumental to understanding the costs and benefits of high social rank.

Incubation temperature and social context affect the nest exodus of precocial ducklings	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Aix sponsa; early development; offspring behavior; parental effect; social environment; wood duck	WOOD DUCKS; CLUTCH SIZE; BEHAVIOR; BIRDS; EGG; GROWTH; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; SUCCESS; FITNESS	The environments that animals experience during development have important fitness consequences. In birds, parents influence the developmental environment of their offspring through incubation. Subtle changes in incubation temperature affect offspring morphology and physiology, such as growth, immune function, and thermoregulation, yet little is known about how it may affect critical early-life behaviors. Because expression of behavior can be influenced by the social environment, the effect of incubation temperature on behavior may be context-dependent. We investigated whether incubation temperature and social context influence a critical early-life task in wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Wood ducks nest in tree cavities and, shortly after hatching, ducklings must jump and climb out of the cavity. Failure to exit the nest is fatal. In 2 experiments, we incubated eggs at different mean temperatures and examined the nest exodus of ducklings individually and in mixed-incubation temperature pairs. When tested individually, ducklings incubated at 35.8 degrees C and 37.0 degrees C were similar to 2.5 times more successful at exiting the nest, and jumped and climbed more often, than those incubated at 35.0 degrees C. However, in an experiment conducted the following year, we found that social interactions mitigated these effects and there was no difference in nest exodus success when ducklings incubated at 35.0 degrees C and 36.0 degrees C were tested together in pairs. This may be because, when in pairs, ducklings incubated at the low-temperature experience social enhancement whereas those incubated at the high temperature maintain similar behaviors. These results advance our understanding of how parental effects influence offspring behaviors and performance within different social contexts.

Interactions between animal behavior and landscapes can therefore influence population dynamics, population and species distributions, population genetic structure, and the evolution of behavior. Spatially explicit individual-based models (IBMs) are ideal tools for exploring the effects of landscape structure on dispersal. We developed an empirically parameterized IBM in the modeling framework SEARCH to simulate dispersal of translocated American martens in Wisconsin. We tested the hypothesis that a time-limited disperser should be willing to settle in lower quality habitat over time. To evaluate model performance, we used a pattern-oriented modeling approach. Our best model matched all empirical dispersal patterns (e.g., dispersal distance) except time to settlement. This model incorporated a required search phase as well as the mechanism for declining habitat selectivity over time, which represents the first demonstration of this hypothesis for a vertebrate species. We suggest that temporal plasticity in habitat selectivity allows individuals to maximize fitness by making a tradeoff between habitat quality and risk of mortality. Our IBM is pragmatic in that it addresses a management need for a species of conservation concern. However, our model is also paradigmatic in that we explicitly tested a theory of dispersal behavior. Linking these 2 approaches to ecological modeling can further the utility of individual-based modeling and provide direction for future theoretical and empirical work on animal behavior.

Interspecific aggression among parapatric and sympatric songbirds on a tropical elevational gradient	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						competition; mountains; passerine; playback experiments; range limits	ADULT MORTALITY PROBABILITY; BRUSH-FINCHES EMBERIZINAE; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS; RANGE SHIFTS; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; PHYLOGENY; MOUNTAINS	Interspecific competition is hypothesized to be a strong force that sets species range limits and drives parapatric distributions of closely related species on tropical mountains. Yet, experimental evidence that competition drives spatial segregation of closely related species on elevational gradients is rare. To test whether competition limits elevational ranges of tropical songbirds, we conducted reciprocal playback experiments on 2 pairs of species with adjacent but nonoverlapping (parapatric) distributions and 1 pair of sympatric species. We found asymmetric interspecific aggression in one parapatric pair (Pycnonotidae) and a complete absence of interspecific aggression in the other (Zosteropidae). We also found asymmetric interspecies aggression in a pair of sympatric flycatchers (Muscicapidae). Our results indicate that interspecific aggression may set range limits in some cases, but it is not a prerequisite for parapatry. Furthermore, the presence of interspecific aggression between co-occurring relatives suggests that while competition may play a role in limiting species distributions, interspecific aggression alone is not sufficient evidence to assert that competition is the primary driver of parapatric distributions.

Here, we examined whether an increase in aggression is associated with a novel scale-eating trophic niche within a recent radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We measured aggression using multiple behavioral assays and used transcriptomic analyses to identify differentially expressed genes in aggression and other behavioral pathways across 3 sympatric species in the San Salvador radiation (generalist, snail-eating specialist, and scale-eating specialist) and 2 generalist outgroups. Surprisingly, we found increased behavioral aggression and differential expression of aggression-related pathways in both the scale-eating and snail-eating specialists, despite their independent evolutionary origins. Increased behavioral aggression varied across both sex and stimulus context in both species. Our results indicate that aggression is not unique to scale-eating specialists. Instead, selection may increase aggression in other contexts such as niche specialization in general or mate competition. Alternatively, increased aggression may result from indirect selection on craniofacial traits, pigmentation, or metabolismall traits which are highly divergent, exhibit signs of selective sweeps, and are affected by aggression-related genetic pathways which are differentially expressed in this system. In conclusion, the evolution of a novel predatory trophic niche within a recent adaptive radiation does not have clear-cut behavioral origins as previously assumed, highlighting the multivariate nature of adaptation and the complex integration of behavior with other phenotypic traits.

One particular form of parental behavior is egg care when parents brood their eggs after laying them. Parents of many oviparous vertebrates and terrestrial arthropods brood their eggs. Spiders present a particular interesting form of parental behavior, enclosing their eggs in a silk sac (or egg-sac) and can care for it until spiderlings emerge. This study investigated proximal cues which stimulate the wolf spider Pardosa saltans (Lycosidae) to care for their egg-sacs, transport them for 30 days and open it to allow spiderlings to emerge. We showed that mothers discriminate between egg-sacs differencing in mass (empty or not) as they do not hang an empty egg-sacs but do not discriminate between egg-sacs with viable and nonviable juveniles either when manipulating or when hanging them. However, mothers do not open nonviable egg-sacs but abandon them only at the end of the juvenile development period when spiderlings are due to emerge (30-day-old egg-sacs). We investigated egg-sac silk chemical cues that mothers detected by presenting them egg-sacs washed with different polar solvents or chemical egg-sacs silk extracts. We identified the polar and apolar chemical compounds of lipid extracts of egg-sacs detected by mothers during manipulation. Our results demonstrate that these compounds stimulate maternal care, and mothers detect mobility of juveniles at the end of the postembryonic period, when juveniles are ready to emerge from a 30-day-old egg-sacs indicating that tactochemical stimuli are involved in egg-sacs care.

Post-bleaching benthic status on reef sites of Mandapam group of islands and Palk Bay, Indian Ocean following the 2016 bleaching events	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						Coral reefs; Bleaching; SST anomaly; Recovery	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CORAL-REEFS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MORTALITY; RECOVERY; PATTERNS; TEMPERATURE; WINNERS; IMPACTS; STRESS	Global bleaching event of 2016 has caused large scale degradation of coral communities at many reef systems. It is inevitable to understand the post bleaching community changes in the benthic system to estimate the recovery and resilience potential of the reef system. Here, we investigated the response of the benthic communities to the bleaching events across the selected reef sites of Mandapam group of islands and Palk Bay reef sites at May 2017, one year post-bleaching. Benthic surveys were conducted during the March-May months of 2016 (bleaching period) and May 2017 (post bleaching). Bleaching was evident in all surveyed reef sites along Mandapam group of islands and Palk Bay during 2016 with the maximum bleaching of 43 +/- 2% in Poomarichan island coinciding with the maximum positive SST anomaly recorded in April 2016. Post bleaching survey revealed reduction of live coral cover followed with an increase in macroalgae cover. Maximum reduction of live coral cover was observed from Olakuda reef site (-2%), while maximum macroalgae outgrowth was observed from Kurusadai island (2.75%). Our results show reduced recovery capability of coral communities in Mandapam group of islands and necessitate the need for continuous observations to assess the recovery capability of corals of this region.

Forest canopy affects stream macroinvertebrate assemblage structure but not trophic stability	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						riparian; stability; macroinvertebrate; community; stream; land use; allochthonous; autochthonous; robustness; trophic network	FOOD-CHAIN LENGTH; NEW-ZEALAND; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE; WATER TEMPERATURE; RIPARIAN CANOPY; FLOW; DISTURBANCE; PERIPHYTON; INVERTEBRATES	Understanding the determinates of community structure and function is a central theme in community ecology. The form in which energy is supplied to food webs can strongly influence community structure and function. Trophic stability is also thought to be affected by the nature of food web energy pathways and whether they are external (allochthonous) or internal (autochthonous) to the ecosystem. In this study, we assessed whether stream invertebrate assemblages differ in taxonomic composition, energetic network structure, trophic network stability, and assemblage temporal variability based on whether the streams they occupy occur under forested canopies or in open grasslands. We assumed that forested sites would receive more allochthonous inputs, whereas grassland sites would rely more on autochthonous resources. We also tested whether food web stability (robustness, the conservation of energy flow) changed after simulated species extinctions. We found that the forest stream assemblages were dominated by filter feeders and shredders, whereas the grassland assemblages were dominated by grazers. In spite of these differences in assemblage composition, we found no significant differences in trophic network structure, stability, or temporal variability among different site types. Many stream systems, particularly in mountainous areas, such as New Zealand, are exposed to regular and large physical disturbance from flooding, which may result in assemblages with similarly generic diets irrespective of the energy source.

Watershed hydrology and salinity, but not nutrient chemistry, are associated with arid-land stream microbial diversity	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						arid-land streams; surface-subsurface interactions; nitrogen uptake; microbial diversity; bacteria; archaea; 16S rRNA gene; watershed; residence time	HYPORHEIC ZONE; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; NITRATE REMOVAL; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; DENITRIFICATION; ECOSYSTEMS; RETENTION; BIOFILM; METABOLISM; BIOGEOGRAPHY	Microbiota in streams drive many ecosystem functions, including whole-stream metabolism, nitrogen (N) cycling, and the production of basal resources that fuel stream food webs. Interactions between surface water and shallow, subsurface groundwater produce the oxygen and nutrient gradients that influence these microbially mediated biogeochemical functions. Microbial nutrient processing is often limited by nutrient availability, but we lack a clear understanding of the relationships between hydrology, water chemistry, microbial composition, and nutrient cycling. In this study we evaluated the prediction that the microbial (bacterial and archaeal) assemblage composition in surface and subsurface water (both within and among stream reaches) would be related to dissolved nutrient concentrations, surface-subsurface hydrologic connectivity, and reach-scale N cycling rates. To evaluate our predictions, we collected data on water chemistry, whole-stream hydrological connectivity, biogeochemical function, and surface and subsurface water microbial assemblage composition at 6 streams in the southwestern USA. We found no correlation between microbial assemblage composition and stream nutrient concentrations or cycling rates, but observed that subsurface waters in some streams had higher taxonomic richness than surface waters. Instead, differences in microbial assemblage composition among the study streams were correlated with both watershed size and stream water Br- concentrations. These results suggest that the longer, deeper groundwater flowpaths in larger watersheds, which promote solute accumulation, influence streamwater microbial assemblage composition. These contrasting streamwater microbial assemblages were associated with different reach-scale sinks for N immobilization (fine benthic organic matter versus filamentous algae). Overall, results suggest that the catchment-scale history of water movement, and salinity, may affect both microbial diversity and the fate of N. The mechanisms by which stream microbial diversity influences ecosystem function require more attention. In particular, we need a better understanding of how microbial biogeography is influenced by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of stream ecosystems.

We used both novel and existing microsatellites to assess how 2 low-head dams affect genetic diversity and differentiation in Longear Sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) and Bluntnose Minnow (Pimephales notatus) in an Illinois river system. We expected reduced genetic diversity above dams in both species and greater genetic differentiation in Longear Sunfish, given the species' more sedentary life history. No detectable patterns of genetic diversity were observed for L. megalotis, whereas a decrease in allelic richness and gene diversity occurred in P. notatus above 1 of the impoundments. The genetic differentiation analyses F-ST, principal components analysis, and Bayesian clustering revealed that slight genetic differences occurred among some L. megalotis throughout the study area, but these differences were not associated with either dam. In contrast, the same methods showed there were 2 genetically distinct populations of P. notatus separated by 1 of the 2 low-head dams. Our results show that dams do not necessarily impede gene flow or movement of L. megalotis in this region and that small genetic differences are likely the result of the species' limited home range. However, the strong genetic differentiation we found in P. notatus is probably a result of poor-quality habitat created by a dam that restricts P. notatus movement. Our data show that even small dams can influence genetic structure in river systems but that they affect species in different ways that are not necessarily intuitive based on the life history of a species.

The increasing recognition of the benefits to human health and well-being of contact with nature, especially in an increasingly urbanized world, reveals the need for a greater understanding of why we engage in bird feeding. This will undoubtedly result in enhanced benefits of feeding to both people and to the biodiversity it supports. Our study aimed to explore the motivations behind wild bird feeding in south-east England through both qualitative and quantitative approaches. This involved a two-phase process: first, the dimensions of involvement were ascertained through semistructured interviews with 30 people engaged in feeding. Interrogation of their responses was used to construct an online questionnaire. A total of 563 respondents completed this survey. Analysis of their responses discerned a series of themes with the most salient being based on or directed toward: pleasure, bird survival, nurture, education of children, and connection with nature. These findings reveal that bird feeding is underpinned by a complex array of motivations and influences involving both personal and environmental benefits.	[Clark, David N.; Reynolds, S.

Uneven global distribution of food web studies under climate change	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						aquatic; climate change; data gaps; extreme events; food webs; freshwater; global; marine; precipitation; species interactions; terrestrial; warming	SPECIES INTERACTIONS; TERRESTRIAL; COMMUNITY	Trophic interactions within food webs affect species distributions, coexistence, and provision of ecosystem services but can be strongly impacted by climatic changes. Understanding these impacts is therefore essential for managing ecosystems and sustaining human well-being. Here, we conducted a global synthesis of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater studies to identify key gaps in our knowledge of climate change impacts on food webs and determine whether the areas currently studied are those most likely to be impacted by climate change. We found research suffers from a strong geographic bias, with only 3.5% of studies occurring in the tropics. Importantly, the distribution of sites sampled under projected climate changes was biased-areas with decreases or large increases in precipitation and areas with low magnitudes of temperature change were under-represented. Our results suggest that understanding of climate change impacts on food webs could be broadened by considering more than two trophic levels, responses in addition to species abundance and biomass, impacts of a wider suite of climatic variables, and tropical ecosystems. Most importantly, to enable better forecasts of biodiversity responses to dimate change, we identify critically under-represented geographic regions and climatic conditions which should be prioritized in future research.

Contribution of non-native plants to the phylogenetic homogenization of US yard floras	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						alien yard species; anthropogenic factors; domestic gardens; horticulture; plant traits; urban biodiversity	URBAN FLORAS; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; COMPOSITIONAL SIMILARITY; RURAL-AREAS; DIVERSITY; TRAITS; ALIEN; URBANIZATION; GARDENS; COMMUNITIES	Cultivation and spread of non-native plant species may result in either phylogenetic homogenization (increasing similarity) or differentiation (decreasing similarity) of urban floras. However, it is unknown how non-native species influence homogenization of cultivated versus spontaneously occurring species in cities, and which traits are associated with species that promote homogenization versus differentiation. In this study, we compared homogenization effects of cultivated and spontaneous non-native species in yard floras across and within seven widely distributed U.S. cities. Additionally, we explored which traits explained their particular contribution to homogenization. We recorded plant presence/absence in 178 private yards distributed among seven metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. We compared phylogenetic homogenization effects of non-native species within both the cultivated and spontaneous species pools using phylogenetic dissimilarities and the homogenization index. Then, we expressed contributions of non-native species to the homogenization of each pool as a function of two different sets of plant functional traits using phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) models across and within cities. Across cities, spontaneous non-native species homogenized, and cultivated non-native species differentiated, yard floras. Within the spontaneous pool, short, small-seeded non-native plants and non-native grasses significantly homogenized yard floras. Within the cultivated pool, species contribution to homogenization was best predicted by plant height, presence of showy flowers, and growth form, with non-native grasses significantly homogenizing cultivated yard floras. Within cities, non-native species-whether they were cultivated or spontaneous- consistently homogenized yard floras of the three northern cities and differentiated yard floras of three of the four southern cities, suggesting that homogenization processes are context- and scale-dependent. Likewise, traits explaining homogenization differed substantially among cities. The inconsistent patterns among cities in the plant traits that promoted homogenization of both cultivated and spontaneous species suggest that local environmental and anthropogenic conditions of individual cities imposed strong constraints on trait selection. Linking plant functional traits that promote homogenization with residents' preferences for vegetation may further enhance understanding of how yard plant communities assemble at regional and local scales.

Interactions between direct (proximate or direct causes) and indirect (underling or indirect causes) drivers could duster these forest cover changes forming hotspots (areas that exhibit significant spatial correlation of deforestation or reforestation transitions). Using land use-land cover maps and global (1) and local (I i ) Moran's tests, we identified these hotspots in the Choco-Darien Global Ecoregion (CGE) of South America, a natural region that was declared one of the top 25 hotspots for conservation priorities in the world. Subsequently, we tested and studied the effects and interactions between deforestation and reforestation hotspots and their direct and indirect drivers using Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (Bayesian SEM). We found that deforestation and reforestation were spatially auto-correlated forming hotspots (I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions and I = 0.48, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Also, hotspots of deforestation and reforestation were auto-correlated within municipality borders (I = 0.5, P = 0.001 for deforestation transitions; I = 0.49, P = 0.001 for reforestation transitions). Eighteen municipalities located on the border between Colombia and Ecuador showed significant aggregations of deforestation hotspots, while thirty-four municipalities in three areas of Colombia and the area between the Colombian and Ecuadorian border showed significant clustering of reforestation hotspots. Eleven of these municipalities presented significant clustering of both reforestation and deforestation hotspots. The Bayesian SEM for deforestation showed that population growth and road density were indirect drivers of deforestation hotspots (0.191 and 0.127 standard deviation units). The Bayesian SEM for reforestation found that armed conflicts, Gross Domestic Product, and average annual rain were indirect drivers related to reforestation hotspots (0.228, 0.076, and 0.081 standard deviation units, respectively). Our assessment shows a novel methodology to study interactions among direct and indirect drivers of forest change and their potential dissimilar effects on forest transitions.	[Fagua, J.

Evidence for vertebrates in the boreal forest	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						anthropogenic disturbance; boreal forest; logging; mammals; natural disturbance-based management; partial harvesting; sustainable forestry; tree retention harvesting; vertebrates; wildlife; woodland caribou	WINTER HABITAT USE; CARIBOU RANGIFER-TARANDUS; GREEN-TREE RETENTION; SHORT-TERM RESPONSE; AMERICAN MARTEN; CANADA LYNX; WOODLAND CARIBOU; SNOWSHOE HARES; BLACK BEARS; SMALL MAMMALS	Retention harvesting, or the approach of leaving live mature trees behind during forest harvest, is used in natural disturbance-based management to mitigate the effects of logging on biodiversity. However, responses of many boreal vertebrates to variable retention harvesting are unknown. We investigated the influence of different retention levels in forest harvests on stand use by wildlife 15-18 yr post-harvest using a combination of surveys of wildlife signs (scats, middens) and camera trapping. Site-level measures of forest structure, including canopy cover, horizontal cover, tree height, tree diameter, basal area, cover of downed coarse woody material, and understory plant cover, were used to describe post-harvest differences in habitats used by common wildlife species in northwest Alberta's boreal forest. Stand use of six species (black bear, coyote, fisher, red squirrel, wolverine, woodland caribou) increased with level of retention, while stand use of two species (grouse, snowshoe hare) declined with retention level. Retention level did not significantly affect stand use of five species (American marten, Canada lynx, deer, gray wolf, moose). Higher levels of retention characterized by greater canopy cover, basal area, and abundance of deadwood were associated with use of forest habitats by late-seral species. Woodland caribou, a species of conservation concern, was detected only in harvested stands with at least 20% retention. Greater understory and horizontal cover characterized lower levels of retention being attractive for early-seral species. These findings demonstrate the value of retention harvesting for conservation of wildlife species in boreal forest, while highlighting the challenge of managing forests for multiple species with different habitat preferences.

When environments are temporally unpredictable, however, it is difficult to anticipate optimal offspring phenotype. Diversification of offspring phenotypes, a strategy called diversified bet-hedging, may allow parents to maximize their fitness by reducing between-year variation in reproductive success. The link between diversification of offspring phenotypes and individual reproductive success, however, has rarely been documented empirically. We used an eight-year dataset (1215 broods, 870 females) on individually marked tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to assess whether intra-brood mass variation was compatible with a diversified bet-hedging strategy. Intra-brood mass variation was weakly, but significantly repeatable within females, suggesting consistent individual differences. Greater intra-brood mass variation, however, was not associated with reduced between-year variation in reproductive success or increased female reproductive success. Moreover, contrary to diversified bet-hedging expectations, fledging success of large broods was greater when hatchlings had similar rather than variable masses. Our results suggest that intra-brood mass variation may not result from diversified bet-hedging, but rather from complex interactions between environmental, brood, and maternal characteristics.

However, tightly coupled interactions between aboveground and belowground organisms may buffer ecosystems to global change. Here, we test how four years of organic and inorganic N addition and removal of a dominant plant species, Festuca thurberi, independently and interactively influences fungal colonization patterns and performance in a co-dominant plant species, Helianthella quinquenervis. Surprisingly, we found N addition and Festuca removal had no measurable effects on the colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) or the performance of Helianthella seedlings grown with field-collected inoculum in a companion greenhouse experiment. However, the proximity of Helianthella to Festuca predicted fungal colonization: DSE colonization decreased by 1% for each cm of distance I lelianthella was from Festuca, although the differences in fungal inoculum potential had no effect on Helianthella seedling survival or biomass. Our results suggest that plant-fungal interactions can be resistant to N addition and resilient to the loss of dominant plant species. Additionally, our results suggest that soil legacies, mediated through surviving symbiont communities or changes in soil properties, can shape ecosystem resistance and resilience to disturbance and perturbations.

Consequently, aspects of the landscape, as well as local stream morphology, are likely to affect riparian and stream communities, including occupancy of semi-aquatic mammals. To gain a better understanding of how changing landscapes may affect the occupancy of semi-aquatic mammals, we sought to identify aspects of the riparian system and stream structure at multiple scales that relate to the presence of beaver (Castor canadensis) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), including their interactions with mink (Neovison vison) and river otter (Lontra canadensis). We estimated multi-season occupancy using 103 sites sampled over six seasons (2012-2014) in southern Illinois, USA. We hypothesized beaver and muskrat occupancy was related to multiple aspects of landscape and local habitat including land-cover, water availability, human disturbance, stream characteristics, and the presence of other semi-aquatic mammals. Beaver occupancy varied over time and was predicted by stream size, stream density, and land-cover at the landscape scale. Muskrat occupancy also varied over time and was related to local aspects of habitat including percentage of forest in the riparian area, channel incision, land-cover, and aspects of sediment chemistry.

Predicting residence time using a continuous-time discrete-space model of leatherback turtle satellite telemetry data	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						animal behavior; Bayesian; biologging; continuous-time discrete-space; Dermochelys coriacea; leatherback turtles; movement; telemetry	ANIMAL MOVEMENT; SEA-TURTLES; HABITAT; IDENTIFICATION; INFERENCE; BEHAVIOR; OCEAN	The utilization and capabilities of biotelemetry are expanding enormously as technology and access rapidly improve. These large, correlated datasets pose statistical challenges requiring advanced statistical techniques to appropriately interpret and model animal movement. We used satellite telemetry data of critically endangered Eastern Pacific leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) to develop a habitat-based model of their motility (and conversely residence time) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which could be broadly applied across species. To account for the spatiotemporally auto-correlated, unbalanced, and presence-only telemetry observations, in combination with dynamic environmental variables, a novel modeling approach was applied. We expanded a Poisson generalized linear model in a continuous-time discrete-space (CTDS) model framework to predict individual leatherback movement based on environmental drivers, such as sea surface temperature. Population-level movement estimates were then obtained with a Bayesian approach and used to create monthly, near real-time predictions of Eastern Pacific leatherback movement in the South Pacific Ocean. This model framework will inform the development of a dynamic ocean management model, "South Pacific TurtleWatch (SPTW)," and could be applied to telemetry data from other populations and species to predict motility and residence times in dynamic environments, while accounting for statistical uncertainties arising at multiple stages of telemetry analysis.

An integrated model decomposing the components of detection probability and abundance in unmarked populations	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						detection probability; distance sampling; integrated model; N-mixture model; temporary emigration; time-of-detection; unmarked populations	N-MIXTURE MODELS; TEMPORARY EMIGRATION; RECAPTURE; REMOVAL; DENSITY; SIZE	Accurate estimates of population abundance are essential to both theoretical and applied ecology. Rarely are all individuals detected during a survey and abundance models often incorporate some form of imperfect detection. Detection probability, however, consists of three components: probability of presence during a survey, probability of availability given presence, and probability of detection given availability and presence. We develop an integrated model to separate these three detection components and provide abundance estimates for the available, present, and superpopulation of individuals. Our framework integrates several common survey methods for unmarked populations: spatially and temporally replicated counts, distance sampling data, and time-of-detection data. Simulations indicated relatively unbiased estimates for detection and availability probabilities. Negative bias in estimated superpopulation abundance was present with three temporally replicated surveys, but greatly reduced with six surveys. In a case study of Island Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma insularis), posterior modes for presence, availability, and detection probabilities were 0.78, 0.96, and 0.26, respectively, from 10-min point counts repeated at 97 sites on three occasions, with noticeable differences among available, present, and superpopulation abundance estimates. This generalizable framework integrates common sampling protocols and provides joint inferences on the components of detection probability, spatial and non-spatial temporary emigration, and abundance in unmarked populations.

Vegetation and precipitation shifts interact to alter organic and inorganic carbon storage in cold desert soils	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Agropyron cristatum; Artemisia tridentata; carbon sequestration; carbonates; climate change; drylands; invasive species; long-term experiment; precipitation seasonality; semi-arid; soil inorganic carbon; soil organic carbon	EARTH SYSTEM MODELS; LONG-TERM; SAGEBRUSH-STEPPE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; TURNOVER TIMES; WATER-CONTENT; PATTERNS; SEQUESTRATION; RESPONSES	Dryland ecosystems are experiencing shifts in rainfall and plant community composition, which are expected to alter cycling and storage of soil carbon (C). Few experiments have been conducted to examine long-term effects on (1) soil organic C (SOC) pools throughout the soil profile, and (2) soil inorganic C (SIC) pools as they relate to dynamic changes in C storage and climate change. We measured SOC and SIC from 0 to 1 m beneath plants and in adjacent interplant microsites following nearly 20 yr of experimental manipulations of plant community (native sagebrush steppe or monoculture of exotic crested wheatgrass) and the amount and timing of water availability (ambient, or doubling of annual rainfall in the dormant, DORM, or growing, GROW, season). Under sagebrush plants, GROW increased both SOC and SIC pools, resulting in total carbon (TC) pools 15% greater than plots receiving ambient precipitation, while DORM decreased SOC and SIC pools, decreasing TC pools 20% from ambient. Under crested wheatgrass plants, GROW increased SOC by 73% but decreased SIC by 11% relative to ambient, netting no change in TC pools, while DORM SIC pools were 5% greater than ambient, with no significant increase in either SOC or TC pools. GROW significantly increased TC pools for interplant microsites, regardless of vegetation treatment. At the community scale and summing C pools weighted by percent patch cover, patterns of TC pool were similar to plot measurements. Our findings suggest that sagebrush communities can become a net C source to the atmosphere with increases in dormant season rainfall rather than a C sink as previously predicted. We also provide evidence of SIC as an important and dynamic C sequestration mechanism in drylands. Consideration of vegetation type, all or most of the soil profile, and both organic and inorganic C pools are all important to accurately predict C sequestration with changing climate and disturbance in drylands.

Recent studies have also shown that resource addition can substantially restructure communities by altering their functional and taxonomic composition-even when species richness remains unchanged. Understanding which aspects of community structure are impacted by different resources and over which timescales will provide insight for management decisions and may also elucidate which measures can act as early warning indicators for subsequent changes in the community. Here, we take advantage of a long-term factorial experiment to understand how grassland plant communities respond to a decade of nitrogen fertilization (14 g N.m(-2) .yr(-1)) and irrigation (25 mm water/week during the growing season). After 10 yr, fertilization and irrigation decreased species richness by 22% and 9%, while functional richness decreased by 31% and 41%. Abundance-weighted functional distance between treatments and controls increased by 55% and 24%, respectively. We expected that abundance-weighted measures would shift before presence-absence-based measures, but found limited evidence for this. Instead, our results suggest that species gains, which can occur quickly because they require the addition of only one individual, may serve as early indicators for subsequent community restructuring in the opposite direction. Overall, both chronic nitrogen fertilization and irrigation tended to have gradual and increasing impacts on community structure, but the magnitude of these effects varied greatly depending on the aspect of community structure investigated. Further study will be needed to determine the extent to which our results can be generalized to other resources or sites in order to develop management strategies to maintain both taxonomic and functional trait diversity in the face of chronic resource changes.

Consumers usually belong to different trophic guilds, from folivores and sapsuckers to parasitic plants. We propose that mistletoes parasitizing pines could play a key role acting as herbivores on host pines and coming indirectly into competition with other herbivores feeding on the same host. Changes caused by mistletoes on its host have been well studied, but its effects running across trophic webs remain unrevealed. In this study, we investigate the effect of European mistletoe (Viscum album subsp. austriacum) on the host-feeding herbivores via trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) across their shared pine host (Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii). We performed field and laboratory experiments, and analyzed the net effect of different mistletoe parasite loads on three host-phytophagous species: the sapsucker Cinara pini (Aphididae), the winter folivore Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Thaumetopoeidae), and the summer folivore Brachyderes sp. (Curculionidae), all being members of different functional feeding groups (FFGs). We summarize the mistletoe-host-herbivore interactions by means of a TMII, where mistletoe parasitism causes non-trophic links and detrimental indirect interactions on pine-feeding herbivores across its shared host, suggesting a worsening of host quality as food. These indirect interactions vary according to three parameters. First, the intensity has a non-proportional relation with parasite load, showing an impact threshold on highly parasitized pines. Second, the movement capacity of insect herbivores determines their response, by decreasing the abundance of herbivores with low movement ability (aphids and pine processionary caterpillars) while altering the behavior (plant selection) of more mobile herbivores (pine weevils). Finally, FFG determines the intensity of mistletoe parasitism effects, folivores being more responsive than sapsuckers. Overall, mistletoe generates non-trophic interaction linkages in the forest able to modify community structure by becoming a nexus of the entire herbivore community of the pine canopy.

Resource management benefits from local, species-specific phenology information. However, phenology monitoring programs in heterogeneous landscapes typically require serendipitous historical records or many years of contemporary data before trends in phenological responses to changes in climate can be analyzed. Here, we used a trails-as-transects approach to rapidly accumulate monitoring data across environmental gradients on three mountains in Acadia National Park, Maine, USA, and compared our results to phenological changes observed in Concord, Massachusetts, USA. In four years of intensive monitoring of transacts on three mountains, we found large variability in spring temperatures across the mountains, but consistent patterns of advancing flower and leaf phenology in warmer microclimates. Reduced sampling intensity would have yielded similar results, but a shorter duration would not have revealed these patterns. The plants in Acadia responded to warming spring temperatures by shifting leaf and flower phenology in the same direction (earlier), but at a reduced rate (as measured in d/degrees C), in comparison with plants in southern New England (e.g., Concord, Massachusetts, USA). Our approach takes advantage of topographical complexity and associated microclimate gradients to substitute for long time series, allowing for rapid assessment of phenological response to climate. Other climate gradients (e.g., urban-to-rural, latitudinal, or coastal-to-inland) could work similarly. This intensive monitoring over a short time period quickly builds a robust dataset and can inform management decisions regarding future monitoring strategies, including sampling designs for citizen science-based phenology monitoring programs.

Accounting for heterogeneous invasion rates reveals management impacts on the spatial expansion of an invasive species	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						control; elimination; expansion; invasion rate; invasive species; management; spatial heterogeneity; spatial spread; Sus scrofa; wild pig	BOAR SUS-SCROFA; FERAL SWINE; PIGS; ERADICATION; POPULATIONS; DYNAMICS; ECOLOGY; SCALE	Success of large-scale control programs for established invasive species is challenging to evaluate because of spatial variability in expansion rates, management techniques, and the strength of management intensity. For a well-established invasive species in the spreading phase of invasion, a useful metric of impact is the magnitude by which control slows the rate of spatial spread. The prevention of spatial spreading likely results in substantial benefits in terms of ecosystem or economic damage that is prevented by an expanding invasive species. To understand how local management actions could impact the spatial spread of an established invasive species, we analyzed distribution and management data for feral swine across contiguous United States using occupancy analysis. We quantified changes in the rate of spatial expansion of feral swine and its relationship to local management actions. We found that after 4 yr of enhanced control, invasion probability decreased by 8% on average relative to pre-program rates. This decrease was as high as 15% on average in states with low-density populations of feral swine. The amount of decrease in invasion rate was attributed to removal intensity in neighboring counties and depended on the extent of neighboring counties with feral swine (spatial heterogeneity in local invasion pressure). Although we did not find a significant overall increase in the probability of elimination, increased elimination probability tended to occur in regions with low invasion pressure. Accounting for spatial heterogeneity in invasion pressure was important for quantifying management impacts (i.e., the relationship between management intensity and spatial spreading processes) because management impacts changed depending on the strength of invasion pressure from neighboring counties. Predicting reduction in spatial spread of an invasive species is an important first step in valuation of overall damage reduction for invasive species control programs by providing estimates of where a species may be, and thus which natural and agricultural resources would be affected, if the control program had not been operating. For minimizing losses from spatial expansion of an invasive species, our framework can be used for adaptive resource prioritization to areas where spatial expansion and underlying damage potential are concurrently highest.

Effects of urbanization on cougar foraging ecology along the wildland-urban gradient of western Washington	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						building density; development; exurban; Odocoileus hemionus; Puma concolor; rodents; specialization; synanthropes	BEARS URSUS-AMERICANUS; LARGE CARNIVORE; PUMA-CONCOLOR; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; PUBLIC-ATTITUDES; RESOURCE USE; LANDSCAPE; PREDATION; PATTERNS; WILDLIFE	Humans have dramatically altered ecosystem structure through landscape manipulation, often leaving refuge patches of suitable habitat for wildlife amidst inhospitable terrain. Large carnivores are especially vulnerable to such habitat modification because they tend to have low population densities and wide-ranging movements necessitated by their food requirements. Cougars (Puma concolor), unlike many other large carnivores, have demonstrated an ability to exploit resources in fragmented and managed landscapes. The influence of increasing landscape development on cougar foraging behavior, however, has yet to be fully elucidated. Accordingly, we investigated variation in cougar use of three prey types (synanthropes, ungulates, and rodents) along a wildland-urban gradient in western Washington to determine how urbanization affects the foraging ecology of this apex predator. We predicted that cougar diets would comprise more synanthropic prey (e.g., prolific urban species) and fewer deer as a function of increasing residential development. Generalized linear mixed model results showed that the odds of cougar predation on synanthropic prey did increase with urbanization. The odds of ungulate predation, however, remained relatively consistent across the wildland-urban gradient despite cougar use of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) and elk (Cervus canadensis) increasing over time. These results suggest that cougar-ungulate predator-prey systems can persist in landscapes with substantial human presence. The odds of forest-associated rodent (Castor sp., Aplodontia sp.) predation decreased with increasing development, suggesting that urbanization may coincide with more intensive beaver management near residences and thereby reduce beaver and mountain beaver presence in exurban landscapes in western Washington. Most cougars exhibited similar diets, but certain individuals deviated significantly from the population averages characterizing use of all three major prey categories. This variation suggests that cougar population responses to urbanization are unlikely to be uniform and that cases of human-cougar conflict may be linked to individual cats, rather than the population as a whole.

The magnitude and frequency of disturbance is considered to influence the critical transition from juvenile into adult phases. Under fire-prone Australian savanna conditions, an extensive suite of both observational and manipulative studies have explored the responses of tree recruitment to fire disturbances. These studies oftentimes have produced seemingly highly disparate responses, particularly with respect to the differential responses of relatively fast-growing eucalypts versus non-eucalypts under different fire regime, and overstory competition, conditions. This study contrasts the responses of tree recruitment height classes to (1) the effects of total canopy removal from severe Cyclone Monica in 2006 over a subsequent 10-yr period, (2) with observations from long-term monitoring sites under relatively stable overstory conditions at Litchfield National Park over a six-year period, (3) under ambient, frequent fire occurrence (mean > 0.5 fires/yr) at both locales induding relatively severe late dry season fires. Recruitment at both study sites was represented mostly by resprouting, clonally reproducing juvenile trees <2 m tall, around half of which died over respective assessment periods. At post-cydone assessment plots, there was substantial release of eucalypts, including within the first five years, into the >5 m height class, with negligible corresponding release of non-eucalypts. At Litchfield plots, there was negligible release of both eucalypts and non-eucalypts. In discussion, we contrast these results with findings from relevant regional studies. We contend that collective disparate observations feasibly can be reconciled as reflecting significant interactions between fire regime characteristics and variable site overstory competition effects, such that the rate of recruitment of fast-growing savanna eucalypt individuals into the midstory is relatively independent of the fire regime, but is significantly regulated by resource competition interactions especially with the overstory, whereas recruitment of non-eucalypts is relatively independent of overstory competitive effects, but is suppressed under fire regimes dominated by frequent, especially severe fires.

We analyzed 20 yr of trawl data using a spatiotemporally explicit, hierarchically Bayesian model to define density distributions of an imperiled anadromous fish-the delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus-in the heavily modified and highly used San Francisco Estuary. To reduce management reliance on an estuary-wide annual population index that minimizes data resolution and ignores uncertainty, our model took a spatiotemporal approach and explicitly accounted for sampling and observation variation through both stochastic and deterministic elements. Our model demonstrated that juvenile smelt density has decreased over annual time and displays a distinct seasonal pattern (the combination of growth into the sampled size class, mortality, and movement into and out of the sampling frame) of increases in March-June followed by decreases in June-August. Smelt density was highly spatiotemporally autocorrelated and strongly tracked prey availability yet was also constrained by local hydrological factors (salinity, turbidity, velocity). Specifically, juvenile smelt preferred slightly saline, turbid, generally slow-moving water with ample cope-pod prey. However, poor swimming capabilities reduced the capacity of juvenile smelt to mix throughout the estuary and find optimal habitat, emphasizing the importance of accounting for spatiotemporal auto-correlation in species distribution models. Further, whole-estuary outflow appeared to influence the spatial distribution of covariates and juvenile smelt, such that smelt densities tended to peak closer to the marine zone at a lower maximal value when outflow was high. The predictions of our model accurately matched observed patterns of juvenile delta smelt catch while embracing uncertainty (although the predictions tended to exaggerate the total smelt catch variation via over-predicted tail values). These results highlight that data-driven improvements can be made to the analytical methods currently used to guide delta smelt management and lay the groundwork for mitigating the impacts of water use, flow regimes, habitat alteration, and climate change on an endangered species in a highly impacted and economically consequential habitat.

However, quantitative knowledge about vulnerability reduction via private precautionary measures is scarce and their effects are hardly considered in loss modeling and risk assessments. However, this is a prerequisite to enable temporally dynamic flood damage and risk modeling, and thus the evaluation of risk management and adaptation strategies. To quantify the average reduction in vulnerability of residential buildings via private precaution empirical vulnerability data (n = 948) is used. Households with and without precautionary measures undertaken before the flood event are classified into treatment and nontreatment groups and matched. Postmatching regression is used to quantify the treatment effect. Additionally, we test state-of-the-art flood loss models regarding their capability to capture this difference in vulnerability. The estimated average treatment effect of implementing private precaution is between 11 and 15 thousand EUR per household, confirming the significant effectiveness of private precautionary measures in reducing flood vulnerability. From all tested flood loss models, the expert Bayesian network-based model BN-FLEMOps and the rule-based loss model FLEMOps perform best in capturing the difference in vulnerability due to private precaution. Thus, the use of such loss models is suggested for flood risk assessments to effectively support evaluations and decision making for adaptable flood risk management.

The objective of this study was to establish a digestate typology according to its fertilizing-value with data from literature and internal unpublished databases. To establish a relatively big database allowing the application of advanced statistics, usual fertilizing-value parameters were used: dry matter, volatile solids, C/N, C/Organic-N, total N (TN), total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), TAN/TN, total P and total K. Statistical analysis was performed on a dataset of 91 raw digestates, 34 solid fractions and 25 liquid fractions after separation. The resulting typology outlined that fertilizing-values are linked to AD feedstock and process. As case study regulations, no digestate (without any post-treatment) fulfilled French standards and the latest European Union regulation proposal on fertilizers. Options to reach regulations' product categories were discussed according to the typology. For the first time, a digestate typology was established based on fertilizing value, which can be a useful tool enhancing digestate management and policy making. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Discharge Monthly Report data from a sample of 106 US municipal treatment plants for the period of 2004-2008 is used for the analysis. A Generalized Linear Model regression produces estimates for the probability and frequency of TAN discharge violations, using logistic and Poisson distributions, respectively. The expected magnitude of violations is modeled as a non-stationary Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD), using Extreme Value Theory. Regression covariates are plant inflow, fractional use of design hydraulic capacity, seasonality and previous month' s performance. The logistic regression model of the probability of a TAN violation has a median Brier Skill Score of 0.25, while the Poisson regression model of violation frequency has a median of 65% correct prediction in validation. The GPD model has equivalent model and empirical quantiles. Model predictions of probability and frequency are combined to obtain two composite risk indices-the Estimated Violation Index (EVI), which is the product of the average probabilities of violation and frequency at each location, and the Estimated Severity Index (ESI) which is the product of the EVI and the predicted 2-year return value of discharge TAN concentrations above the regulatory limit. Spatial maps of ESI and EVI provide visual guides for regulatory agencies to identify risks and prioritize compliance and enforcement efforts.

Farmed, juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were caged for six weeks at three different locations in Kollevag bay and at one reference location. Sediments and cod samples (bile and liver) were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites, revealing a contamination gradient at the four stations. Furthermore, hepatosomatic index (HSI) and Fulton's condition factor (CF) were significantly lower in cod caged closest to the disposal site. Levels and activities of biomarker proteins, such as vitellogenin (Vtg), metallothionein (Mt), and biotransformation and oxidative stress enzymes, including cytochrome P450 1a and 3a (Cyp1a, Cyp3a), glutathione s-transferase (Gst) and catalase (Cat), were quantified in blood plasma and liver tissue. Hepatic Cat and Gst activities were significantly reduced in cod caged at the innermost stations in Kollevag, indicating modulation of oxidative stress responses. However, these results contrasted with reduced hepatic lipid peroxidation. Significant increases in transcript levels were observed for genes involved in lipid metabolism (fasn and acly) in cod liver, while transcript levels of ovarian steroidogenic enzyme genes such as p450scc, cyp19, 3,8-hsd and 20 beta-hsd showed significant station-dependent increases. Cyp1a and Vtg protein levels were however not significantly altered in cod caged in Kollevag. Plasma levels of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and showed elevated E2 levels, but only at the innermost station. We conclude that the bay of Kollevag did not fullfill adequate environmental condition based on environmental quality standards (EQSs) for chemicals in coastal waters.

Functional responses (FRs) have shown excellent utility in predicting invasive predator success, however, their use in predicting invasive prey success is limited. Here, we assessed invader success by quantifying FRs and prey switching patterns of two native predators, the common sea star, Asterias rubens, and the green crab, Carcinus maenas, towards native blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, and invasive Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Asterias displayed destabilising type II FRs, whereas Carcinus displayed stabilising type III FRs towards both prey species. Both predators exhibited greater search efficiencies and maximum feeding rates towards native compared to invasive prey. Both predators disproportionately consumed native mussels over invasive oysters when presented simultaneously, even when native mussels were rare in the environment, therefore indicating negligible prey switching. We demonstrate that invasion success may be mediated through differential levels of biotic resistance exerted by native predators.	[Joyce, Patrick W.

Macrobenthic species are essential prey for numerous marine mammals and seabirds but the influence of climatic drivers that control macrobenthic community population dynamics are poorly known in critical prey habitats. We investigated associations of environmental, temporal, and climatic covariates with the biomass concentrations of six prey groups (Actinopterygii, Amphipoda, Bivalvia, Cumacea, Isopoda, and Polychaeta) in essential habitats for Korean-Okhotsk (western) gray whales adjacent to northeastern Sakhalin Island in the Sea of Okhotsk. Prey community biomass concentrations were correlated with water depth, year, and climate indices reflecting oceanographic and climatic patterns associated with macro-scale climatological effects. The correlation of prey biomass with water depth and year accounted for similar to 90% of total variation in canonical correlation analyses (CCor). Climate indices accounted for similar to 10% of total variation in CCor. Water circulation in winter may be particularly important for maintaining populations through the advection of particulate organic carbon entrained in winter currents. Overall, temporal trends in the biomass concentrations of gray whale prey resources appear to reflect climatic and oceanographic factors that are driving ecosystem changes across the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Arctic region.

While the underlying mechanisms remain widely debated, production was recently determined as the most probable cause of increases in fish biomass. Changes in fish biomass in a temperate AR system were investigated from December 2008 to November 2015 by considering seven distinct functional groups, and isotopic functional indices were used to identify how these changes may have affected organic matter (OM) fluxes. Contrasting patterns of change were observed between functional trophic groups, highlighting that combining the biomass of all species present in a community is inappropriate for assessing AR-induced effects. Benthic sedentary species pre-dominated (> 75% of the total biomass) through massive production, with a 68-fold increase in mean biomass over the study period. Mobile species tended to vary seasonally, suggesting only a slight influence of AR. Zooplanktivores biomass decreased over the 6-year period, as a possible result of changes in environmental conditions. Isotopic indices helped to reveal both the community maturation and the importance of local OM sources not only in supporting fish biomass production but also in attracting pelagic species. Our results corroborate that production and attraction are two extremes of a range of contrasting patterns and highlight the importance of considering the specific responses of functional components of fish communities to accurately describe changes in AR functioning. Functional attributes such as trophic traits, habitat use and dispersal abilities must not be overlooked as they modulate fish species responses to the deployment of man-made rocky substrates.

Here, we examine the recovery patterns of sea urchin populations following a high-intensity storm under contrasting protection regimes in the NW Mediterranean Sea. We found significant differences in the recovery trends of Paracentrotus lividus abundance and biomass in the five years following the storm. The P. lividus populations outside the NTZ recovered faster than the populations inside the NTZ, revealing that predation was the main factor controlling the sea urchin populations inside the NTZ during the study period. Arbacia Ibtula reached the highest abundance and biomass values ever observed outside the NTZ in 2016. Our findings reveal that predation can control the establishment of new sea urchin populations and emphasize top-down control in NTZs, confirming the important role of fully protected areas in the structure of benthic communities.

Soil carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from forests and other land use types in an African tropical montane region	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Deforestation; Kenya; GHG emissions; Fertilisers; Livestock	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; SAMPLING FREQUENCY; EUROPEAN SOILS; N2O EMISSIONS; COVER CHANGE; RESPIRATION; NITROGEN; OXIDATION; ECOSYSTEMS	In the last 40years, large areas of the Mau forest, the largest contiguous tropical montane forest in East Africa, have been cleared for agriculture. To date, there are no empirical data on how this land use change affects carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from soil respiration and soil methane (CH4) fluxes. This study reports measured annual soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the native Mau forest and previously forested lands converted to smallholder grazing land, smallholder and commercial tea plantations and eucalyptus plantations. Fluxes were measured weekly from August 2015 to August 2016 using the static chamber method. Grazing lands had the highest (p=0.028) cumulative respiratory CO2 fluxes (25.6 +/- 2.9Mg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1)), whereas lowest fluxes were observed in commercial tea plantations (5.6 +/- 0.5Mg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1)). Soil respiratory CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil pH, but negatively correlated with soil C:N ratio. Annual soil fluxes were explained by soil pH, bulk density and the interaction between soil pH and C:N ratio. Most soils were sinks for atmospheric CH4 across all land use types. Methane uptake was highest for native forest sites (-3.08 +/- 0.35 to -5.84 +/- 0.61kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1)) and for eucalyptus plantations (-3.43 +/- 0.19kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1)). Uptake decreased significantly with increasing land use intensity (smallholder tea plantations: -1.42 +/- 0.09kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1), commercial tea plantations: -1.44 +/- 0.29kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1)). Soils of smallholder grazing lands had the lowest CH4 uptake rates (-0.36 +/- 0.25kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1)). Annual CH4 uptake was negatively correlated with mean annual soil water-filled pore space (p<0.01) and bulk density (p=0.003) and decreased with increasing soil inorganic NH4+ concentrations (p=0.03). Annual soil CH4 can be explained by mainly soil water content and bulk density and these factors are related to gas diffusion. Our study shows that converting tropical montane forests to managed land use types affects soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes. Specifically, the CH4 sink strength in managed land use types of these montane tropical soils was reduced to less than half of the sink strength in the native forest. Soil respiratory CO2 fluxes were also altered by land use with grazing lands emitting 3-4 times more CO2 than the other land use types.

CARMEL; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; INTERSLOPE; ECTOTHERMS	The south-facing slopes in canyons, oriented along an east-west axis north of the equator, are often hotter and drier than north-facing slopes, promoting differences in the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the opposing slopes. We studied how diversity and abundance patterns have changed in Oren stream (Carmel Mountains, Israel) during the last 25 years. We tested whether temperature and habitat preferences of reptiles affected observation frequencies, to assess potential effects of global warming on the reptiles. We compared the results of a 1993-1994 survey in Oren stream to a survey we conducted during 2017-2018, using similar methods, survey area and effort. Species composition and abundance in Oren stream did not significantly change between studies, but the proportion of observations differed significantly across slopes for four out of the six most abundant species. The number of observations increased monotonically with increasing temperatures on the south-facing slope, but decreased on the north-facing slope above a temperature of 22 degrees C. The major biome species inhabit globally was unrelated to the number of observations across slopes or studies, but species inhabiting warmer ranges were more frequently observed in the current survey. Our results suggest that as global temperatures rise, reptile species which can tolerate higher temperatures, and those which can avoid the hottest temperatures of the day, may be able to cope better. These results however may also derive from better detection ability of some species over others between study teams.

Eco-estates are a form of urban housing development that is suggested to partially negate the effects of landscape development. Objectives We assessed avian functional diversity at four eco-estates (previously sugarcane plantations) and one sugarcane plantation site along the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. We determined whether the differing development, management types, and the effects of land-cover configuration and composition at the respective study sites influenced avian functional diversity. Methods Fixed-radius point-count surveys were conducted within varying levels of land cover (natural, semi-natural, golf course and urban) at each ecoestate, and at a control sugarcane plantation site (natural, sugarcane-natural, and sugarcane land cover). The influence of differing land-cover covariates on all three components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, and divergence) were determined through a series of general linear models. Results Sections of the respective study sites with increased natural land cover, mainly in the form of indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush, showed improved avian functional diversity in comparison to those with increased building and road density. Negative effects of increased building density may be offset through an interconnection with or incorporation within natural land cover. Each component of functional diversity was influenced dynamically by seasonal changes and depending on landcover type. Conclusion Eco-estates improved avian functional diversity if natural habitats are emphasised and connected. We suggest future development and management for eco-estates and agricultural land in coastal KZN follow ecological land-use complementation, to improve local ecosystem functioning.

Multiple environmental gradients influence the distribution and abundance of a key forest-health indicator species in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, USA	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Salamander; Plethodon; Bayesian binomial mixture modelling; Climate change; Environmental gradients; Montane; Abundance	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDERS; SPATIAL VARIATION; SCALE VARIATION; MODELS; TEMPERATURE; HABITAT; BIODIVERSITY; CONSTRAINTS; POPULATIONS	Context The effects of global climate change are threatening biodiversity, with particular concern for amphibians, whose survival often depends on specific abiotic conditions. To predict how future climate change will affect amphibian populations, it is first necessary to understand how patterns of abundance are shaped by multiple environmental conditions at both local and regional scales. Objectives Plethodontid salamander are a group of lungless ectotherms that require cool and moist habitats to survive. While the broad elevational distribution and abundance patterns are well-understood, other important abiotic gradients exist within montane systems that are contributing to fine-scale spatial abundance patterns. We aim to assess the fine-scale spatial abundance of a plethodontid salamander across two key environmental gradients: temperature and moisture. Methods We conducted area-constrained repeated point-count surveys at plots situated across temperature and moisture gradients in western North Carolina. Each plot was surveyed on 4 occasions, and site and survey-level covariates were measured. Results We found heterogeneous abundance patterns across these two gradients whereby warmer low elevations contain the greatest abundance near stream sides, where conditions are cooler and wetter than the regional landscape. At cooler, higher elevations, salamanders are distributed more uniformly across the broader landscape, likely as a result of the suitable regional climate. Conclusions Fine-scale habitat associations of plethodontids are driven by temperature and moisture, and the spatial patterns of suitable microhabitats drive regional scale patterns. Incorporating multiple environmental gradients provides a more biologically relevant prediction of abundance patterns, which will help inform conservation and management strategies especially in the context of climate change.

Even though marked seasonal changes have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating a long-term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA gene data from two organismal size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2-3 mu m) and the nanoplankton (3-20 mu m). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae or MALV-III presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13%-19% of the OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for similar to 40% of the relative abundance, featured recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links long-term whole community dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and non-recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages.

Conservation genomics in the fight to help the recovery of the critically endangered Siamese crocodile Crocodylus siamensis	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						bottleneck; conservation genomics; ddRADseq; extinction; gene enrichment; Siamese crocodile	GENETIC INTROGRESSION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; TOOL SET; HYBRIDIZATION; RELATEDNESS; DIVERSITY; PROGRAM; ISLAND; CONNECTIVITY; ASSOCIATION	Endangered species are often characterized by low genetic diversity and it is imperative for conservation efforts to incorporate the knowledge obtained from genetic studies for effective management. However, despite the promise of technological advances in sequencing, application of genome-wide data to endangered populations remains uncommon. In the present study we pursued a holistic conservation-genomic approach to inform a field-based management programme of a Critically Endangered species, the Siamese crocodile Crocodylus siamensis. Using thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms from throughout the genome, we revealed signals of introgression from two other crocodile species within our sample of both wild and captive-bred Siamese crocodiles from Cambodia. Our genetic screening of the Siamese crocodiles resulted in the subsequent re-introduction of 12 individuals into the wild as well as the selection of four individuals for captive breeding programmes. Comparison of intraspecific genetic diversity revealed an alarmingly low contemporary effective population size in the wild (<50) with evidence of a recent bottleneck around Tonle Sap Lake. We also projected a probable future extinction in the wild (within fewer than five generations) in this population in the absence of re-introduction efforts. However, an increase in the number of potential breeders through re-introductions, including the one resulting from this project, could counter this trend. Our results have been implemented in ongoing re-introduction and captive breeding programmes, with major implications for the conservation management of Siamese crocodiles, and provide a blueprint for the rescue effort of other "terminally ill" populations of critically endangered species.

The Asian long-horned beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis is a xylophagous pest native to Asia and invasive in North America and Europe. It is responsible for severe losses of urban trees, in both its native and invaded ranges. Based on historical and genetic data, several hypotheses have been formulated concerning its invasion history, including the possibility of multiple introductions from the native zone and secondary dispersal within the invaded areas, but none have been formally tested. In this study, we characterized the genetic structure of ALB in both its native and invaded ranges using microsatellites. In order to test different invasion scenarios, we used an approximate Bayesian "random forest" algorithm together with traditional population genetics approaches. The strong population differentiation observed in the native area was not geographically structured, suggesting complex migration events that were probably human-mediated. Both native and invasive populations had low genetic diversity, but this characteristic did not prevent the success of the ALB invasions. Our results highlight the complexity of invasion pathways for insect pests. Specifically, our findings indicate that invasive species might be repeatedly introduced from their native range, and they emphasize the importance of multiple, human-mediated introductions in successful invasions. Finally, our results demonstrate that invasive species can spread across continents following a bridgehead path, in which an invasive population may have acted as a source for another invasion.

In this study, we used three woody Amazonian plant species to evaluate Wallace's Hypothesis using tools of landscape genomics. We generated unlinked single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from the nuclear genomes of 234 individuals (78 for each plant species) across 13 sampling sites along the Rio Branco, Brazil, for Amphirrhox longifolia (8,075 SNPs), Psychotria lupulina (9,501 SNPs) and Passiflora spinosa (14,536 SNPs). Although significantly different migration rates were estimated between species, the population structure data do not support the hypothesis that the Rio Branco-an allopatric barrier for primates and birds-is a significant genetic barrier for Amphirrhox longifolia, Passiflora spinosa or Psychotria lupulina. Overall, we demonstrated that medium-sized rivers in the Amazon Basin, such as the Rio Branco, are permeable barriers to gene flow for animal-dispersed and animal-pollinated plant species.

The seasonal timing of diapause allows organisms to adapt to seasonal changes in habitat suitability and thus is key to their fitness. In the planktonic crustacean Daphnia, various cues can induce the production of diapause stages that are resistant to heat, drought or freezing and contain one to two embryos in developmental arrest. Daphnia is a keystone species of many freshwater ecosystems, where it acts as the main link between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels. The correct seasonal timing of diapause termination is essential to maintain trophic interactions and is achieved via a genetically based interpretation of environmental cues like photoperiod and temperature. Field monitoring and modelling studies raised concerns on whether populations can advance their seasonal release from diapause to advances in spring phenology under global change, or if a failure to adapt will cause trophic mismatches negatively affecting ecosystem functioning. Our capacity to understand and predict the evolution of diapause timing requires information about the genetic architecture underlying this trait. In this study, we identified eight quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and four epistatic interactions that together explained 66.5% of the variation in diapause termination in Daphnia magna using QTL mapping. Our results suggest that the most significant QTL is modulating diapause termination dependent on photoperiod and is involved in three of the four detected epistatic interactions. Candidate genes at this QTL could be identified through the integration with genome data and included the presynaptic active zone protein bruchpilot. Our findings contribute to understanding the genomic control of seasonal diapause timing in an ecological relevant species.

Cysteine metabolism is mainly mediated by the enzymes cysteine dioxygenase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, respectively coded by the genes CDO1 and GCLC. Here we test a new hypothesis posing that the synthesis of the pigment pheomelanin also contributes to cysteine homeostasis in melanocytes, where cysteine can enter the pheomelanogenesis pathway. We conducted an experiment with the Eurasian nuthatch Sitta europaea, a bird producing large amounts of pheomelanin for feather pigmentation, to investigate if melanocytes show epigenetic lability under exposure to excess cysteine. We increased systemic cysteine levels in nuthatches by supplementing them with dietary cysteine during growth. In feather melanocytes this led to the downregulation of genes involved in intracellular cysteine metabolism (GCLC), cysteine transport to the cytosol from the extracellular medium (Slc7a11) and from melanosomes (CTNS), and regulation of tyrosinase activity (MC1R and ASIP). These changes were mediated by increases in DNA m(5)C in all genes except Slc7a11, which experienced RNA m(6)A depletion. Birds supplemented with cysteine synthesized more pheomelanin than controls, but did not suffer higher systemic oxidative stress. These results suggest that excess cysteine activates an epigenetic mechanism that favours pheomelanin synthesis and may protect against oxidative stress.

Ecotype formation has been predominantly studied in outcrossing taxa, while far less attention has been paid to the implications of mating system shifts. Here, we addressed whether substrate-related ecotypes exist in selfing and outcrossing populations of Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata and whether the genomic footprint differs between mating systems. The North American subspecies colonized both rocky and sandy habitats during postglacial range expansion and shifted the mating system from predominantly outcrossing to predominantly selfing in a number of regions. We performed an association study on pooled whole-genome sequence data of 20 selfing or outcrossing populations, which suggested genes involved in adaptation to substrate. Motivated by enriched gene ontology terms, we compared root growth between plants from the two substrates in a common environment and found that plants originating from sand grew roots faster and produced more side roots, independent of mating system. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with substrate-related ecotypes were more clustered among selfing populations. Our study provides evidence for substrate-related ecotypes in A. lyrata and divergence in the genomic footprint between mating systems. The latter is the likely result of selfing populations having experienced divergent selection on larger genomic regions due to higher genome-wide linkage disequilibrium.

Natural selection is commonly accepted to play a large role in this process, and it has been widely assumed that reproductive isolation often results as a by-product of divergence driven by adaptation in allopatry. When such populations come into secondary contact, reinforcement can act to strengthen reproductive isolation, but the frequency and importance of this process are still unknown. Here, we explored genomic signatures of selection in allopatry and sympatry for loci associated with reproductive isolation using a natural primate hybrid zone. By analysing reduced-representation sequencing data, we quantified admixture and population structure across a howler monkey hybrid zone and examined the relationship between locus-specific differentiation and introgression. We detected extensive admixture that was mostly limited to the narrow contact zone. Loci with reduced introgression into the heterospecific genomic background (the pattern expected for loci associated with reproductive isolation due to selection against hybrids) were significantly more differentiated between allopatric parental populations than loci with neutral and increased introgression, supporting the hypothesis that reproductive isolation is a by-product of divergence in allopatry. Further, loci with reduced introgression showed greater differentiation in sympatry than in allopatry, suggesting a role for reinforcement. Thus, our results reflect multiple forms of selection that have shaped reproductive isolation in this system. We conclude that reproductive isolation may have initially been driven by divergence in allopatry, but later reinforced by divergent selection in sympatry.

Here, we examined evidence for inbreeding depression and inbreeding preference in two populations (Clinton, New York, and Davis, California, USA) of the cooperatively breeding American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos). We then compared observed inbreeding strategies with theoretical expectations for optimal, adaptive levels of inbreeding, given the inclusive fitness benefits and population-specific magnitude of inbreeding depression. We found that low heterozygosity at a panel of 33 microsatellite markers was associated with low survival probability (fledging success) and low white blood cell counts among offspring in both populations. Despite these costs, our data were more consistent with inbreeding preference than avoidance: The observed heterozygosity among 396 sampled crow offspring was significantly lower than expected if local adults were mating by random chance. This pattern was consistent across a range of spatial scales in both populations. Adaptive levels of inbreeding, given the magnitude of inbreeding depression, were predicted to be very low in the California population, whereas complete disassortative mating was predicted in the New York population. Sexual conflict might have contributed to the apparent absence of inbreeding avoidance in crows. These data add to an increasing number of examples of an "inbreeding paradox," where inbreeding appears to be preferred despite inbreeding depression.

However, in nature, bacteria interact with plants in multitaxa consortia, systems which remain poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that a consortium of five native bacterial isolates protected their host plant Nicotiana attenuata from a sudden wilt disease. Here we explore the mechanisms behind the protection effect against the native pathosystem. Three members of the consortium, Pseudomonas azotoformans A70, P. frederiksbergensis A176 and Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus E46, form biofilms when grown individually in vitro, and the amount of biofilm increased synergistically in the five-membered consortium, including two Bacillus species, B. megaterium and B. mojavensis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and scanning electron microscopy in planta imaging techniques confirmed biofilm formation and revealed locally distinct distributions of the five bacterial strains colonizing different areas on the plant-root surface. One of the five isolates, K1 B. mojavensis produces the antifungal compound surfactin, under in vitro and in vivo conditions, clearly inhibiting fungal growth. Furthermore, isolates A70 and A176 produce siderophores under in vitro conditions. Based on these results we infer that the consortium of five bacterial isolates protects its host against fungal phytopathogens via complementary traits. The study should encourage researchers to create synthetic communities from native strains of different genera to improve bioprotection against wilting diseases.

Fish passability of these structures, where water passes over but does not generate a waterfall, is primarily related to ramp length and slope, but their relative contribution has seldom been considered. This study aims to assess the passage performance of a potamodromous cyprinid, the Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei), negotiating an experimental ramped weir with varying ramp length (L) and slope (S). Four configurations were tested, with a constant discharge of 110 L.s(-1). Results suggest that both factors influenced passage performance of fish. Attraction efficiency (AE) increased with increasing L and S, whereas the number of successes (N) and passage efficiency (PE) decreased upon increasing L. For S, it was found that both N and PE peaked at the intermediate level (20%). These results suggest that configurations with the lowest slopes may not necessarily be the best option because they may be less attractive for the fish and their demand for space is higher. Higher slopes (but not excessive) could be more attractive to fish, less space-demanding, and therefore, more cost-effective. Future studies should investigate how discharge and boulder placement influence fish passage across ramped weirs, to improve habitat connectivity.

In this process, building design parameters are inseparable from these metrics; therefore, we need to know which parameters are truly important and how they impact performance. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between building design attributes and existing daylighting metrics based on a new methodology we are proposing. This methodology involves statistical learning. It is an emerging methodology that helps us to analyze a large quantity of output data and the impact of a large number of design variables. In particular, we can use these statistical methodologies to analyze which features are important, which ones are not, and the type of relationships they have. Using these techniques, statistical models may be created to predict daylighting metric values for different building types and design solutions. In this article we will outline how this methodology works, and analyze the building design features that have the strongest impact on daylighting performance.

The experiment included both self-assessments to monitor conscious evaluations of the products and biometric measurements (Eye-Tracking and Galvanic Skin Response) to capture unconscious aspects. The results show that different forms of perceived value emerge clearly. Green products, for which participants required greater efforts in the search for relevant information, boost the value attributed to creative solutions still believed of high quality. This effect is significantly more evident for participants showing remarkable interest for sustainability issues. Conversely, alternative products feature greater value perception because they are acknowledged to be functional and reliable.

Further development of the sector will affect the provision of ecosystem services that maintain the livelihood of local populations. In particular, the current size and growth rate of China's mariculture has raised many environmental concerns, but very few studies of this sector have been conducted to date. Here, we report the resource use in the production of six main Chinese mariculture products (Larimichthys crocea, Apostichopus japonicus, Haliotis spp., Laminaria japonica, Gracilaria spp., Porphyra spp.), taking the city of Ningde as a case study. We used the life cycle assessment framework and the Cumulated Exergy Demand indicator to quantify resource use, and implemented a Monte Carlo simulation where model uncertainty was included using various methods. The mean exergy demand values of the production of one live-weight ton of large yellow croaker, sea cucumber, abalone, laminaria, gracilaria, and porphyra are 106 GJ eq., 65 GJ eq., 126 GJ eq., 0.25 GJ eq., 1.55 GJ eq., and 0.98 GJ eq., respectively. For animal products, 45-90% of the impacts come from the feed requirements, while in seaweed production, 83-99% of the impacts are linked to the fuel used in operation and maintenance activities. Policies oriented toward efficient resource management in the mariculture sector thus should take the farm design, input management, and spatial planning of marine areas as the main targets to guide current practices into more sustainable ones in the future.

Restocking using glass eels in continental freshwater areas is a potential conservation measure for enhancing local eel stocks and for conserving the species in aquatic habitats, where it may otherwise disappear. However, little is known about the fate of these restocked individuals and the early ecological behaviour of the young eels translocated in rivers. A portable radio-frequency identification (RFID) telemetry system and 12-mm tags were used to track restocked eels for a duration of 4years. The aim was to understand the early movement, behavioural traits, dispersal, and habitat use of elvers after restocking performed in 2013 with glass eels in a shallow riverine environment. From the 241 tagged eels (total length, Q(50)=152mm), 85% were detected in 1968 positions during a period of 4years, beginning in 2014. Clear seasonality in eel activity was observed, with higher mobility in summer when the water temperature was high (above 12 degrees C). Dispersal was slowed by numerous artificial obstacles and the high carrying capacity of habitats. There was a negative relationship between the body size of eels at tagging and their mobility. Five behavioural categories of mobility patterns were identified: ascending, descending, oscillating with an upstream trend, oscillating with a downstream trend, and stationary. The first four categories depleted with time, in favour of stationary individuals that displayed a highly sedentary lifestyle. This study provides new knowledge of the long-term dispersal behaviour of restocked eels and the influence of seasons, barriers, and habitats on their colonization strategy changing with time. The results contribute to a better understanding of the issue of uncommon restocking practices in upland rivers.

No recruitment has been detected recently, indicating probable reproductive failure due to low densities. A pilot programme placed a total of over 11,000 hatchery-origin juveniles, age 18-22months, at 10 sites in the San Juan Islands. Observed (naive) year1 survival averaged 10.2% (0-23% range) and was most influenced by site compared with lineage or size-at-outplant. Families survived in the approximate proportions that they were outplanted, and there was little support for an effect of size-at-outplant on survival. etection was low due to the small chance of sighting individuals on complex substrate. When derived from repeated sampling, an upper bound on naive detection rate averaged 0.38 and increased with size. When derived from a closed capture-recapture model, average detection was estimated at 0.19. Growth was highly variable and confounded with detection, but an average 3.4% of detected outplants across all sites (0-7.5% range) had reached reproductive size in 2017. A state-space model of exponential population growth was modified to account for imperfect detection and yielded an estimated density of abalone for each survey. Seven out of eight sites included in the model remained above a target abalone density of 0.3m(-2) throughout the project. The majority of tagged abalone made little net movement over weekly and annual timescales, although some emigration likely reduced survival estimates. The restoration programme is transitioning from a pilot phase to a production phase, including optimization of hatchery and outplant processes. Existing well-performing sites will receive additional cohorts every 4-5years to maintain aggregation densities. New sites will replace poorly performing ones, although this is hampered by a poor understanding of the mechanisms behind site performance.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential for the use of plant litter decomposition as a functional indicator of ecosystem health in coastal lagoons. A field experiment was conducted to assess the decomposition rate of Ruppia maritima enclosed in coarse and fine mesh litterbags and incubated in 10 Mediterranean coastal lagoons that conform to a gradient of ecological status produced by anthropogenic impacts as determined by a structural quality index. The microbial decomposition rate in fine mesh litterbags increased linearly along the ecological gradient. However, this relationship was not observed for the overall decomposition rate in coarse mesh bags. Decomposition rates in coarse mesh bags were negatively related to macroinvertebrate diversity, indicating that, in transitional habitats, such as coastal lagoons, high biodiversity is not a prerequisite for successful ecosystem functioning. The results suggest that functional indicators, such as the microbial litter decomposition process, should be used in addition to structural ones to detect anthropogenic-derived environmental perturbations in coastal lagoons.

This study explores the co-occurrence of essential fish habitats for the most important nekto-benthic resources exploited by bottom-trawl fisheries in the western Mediterranean and areas of importance for nekto-benthic communities. Fishery-independent data obtained from Mediterranean scientific bottom-trawl surveys were used to identify persistent hotspots of recruitment for the most important nekto-benthic species around the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands between 2002 and 2016, as an indicator of their essential fish habitats. Likewise, hotspots of nekto-benthic community diversity and density were also determined, as an estimate of key areas for nekto-benthic communities. Areas of overlap of persistent hotspots of recruitment and of community species richness and density were mainly found on the deep shelf and the upper slope (100-200m and 200-500m deep respectively). These overlapping areas could be of particular interest in the development of fishery management plans aiming to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Protection, through temporary or permanent closures, of the overlapping areas identified would contribute to improving both the sustainable exploitation of the main target species of bottom-trawl fisheries and the conservation of nekto-benthic communities.

Bio-physical models of marine environments reveal biases in the representation of protected areas	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Bio-physical modelling; bioregion; environmental surrogates; habitat mapping; marine protected area; spatial analysis; surrogate variables	CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SURROGATES; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; RESERVES; DEPTH; REEF; SEAS	The significant shortfall in global marine protection targets is likely to continue to drive rapid growth in marine protected areas (MPAs). Systematic conservation planning to fill gaps in marine protection requires sufficient knowledge of both the distribution of biodiversity and the threats to species and ecosystems. Yet such data are lacking for much of the marine environment, creating significant challenges for planning effective marine protection. In the absence of habitat mapping data, critical environmental variables associated with species' distributions can be used to model the spatial distribution of different environments. Although this approach has been used in some jurisdictions to assist MPA planners, the increased availability and resolution of spatial data now provide an opportunity to improve assessments of MPA representation. Capitalizing on advances in spatial data, this study uses a range of biological and physical environmental attributes to model the distribution of Australian marine environments. Given many Australian MPAs were implemented without knowledge of the distribution of species and benthic habitats, this Bio-physical model is used to assess MPA coverage and equality of protection for Australian marine environments. Results of the Bio-physical model revealed that Australian MPAs overrepresent warm, offshore waters (such as the Coral Sea) and underrepresent temperate environments. Furthermore, the distribution of protection in Australian MPAs is heavily skewed, with no-take protection disproportionately targeting tropical environments, leaving major gaps in the protection of both temperate and nearshore habitats. Without comprehensive habitat mapping, the representativeness and adequacy of an MPA system cannot be accurately evaluated, nor can the required expansion of MPAs be planned effectively. In the interim, the biological and physical attributes chosen for this model provide useful proxies to assist in efforts to better target current and future protection based on the most up-to-date knowledge.

Tropical invertebrate response to marine reserves varies with protection duration, habitat type, and exploitation history	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						biodiversity; coral; fish; fishing; marine protected area; reef	FISH POPULATIONS; AREAS; CONSERVATION; COMPLEXITY; MANAGEMENT; FISHERIES; BENEFITS; DECLARATION; ASSEMBLAGES; ABUNDANCE	Macroinvertebrates play a critical role in marine processes, are important in global fisheries, and make up the vast majority of ocean biodiversity, yet are largely overlooked in fisheries stock assessment and conservation. Marine reserves are a heavily advocated method for promoting recovery of marine biodiversity, but the design of reserves and the methods for evaluating their performance often neglect invertebrate taxa, instead assessing changes in fish abundance or biomass. The purpose of this study is to (1) measure the impacts of no-take marine reserves on marine macroinvertebrates, (2) identify the correlates of changes to macroinvertebrate abundance, and (3) determine if the typical taxa used to measure reserve success (finfish) can predict changes in invertebrate abundance. Non-coral, non-sponge, macroinvertebrates were sampled inside and outside of 10 community-managed marine reserves in the Central Philippines and compared with abundances found at distant fished sites. Using generalized linear mixed effects models with multimodel inference, positive reserve effects were found in exploited invertebrate taxa both inside and outside of reserves (1.5-2.3 times greater abundances), but no effect was found in unfished taxa. Habitat composition and complexity were consistently associated with higher invertebrate abundance. Most surprisingly, invertebrate abundance was not consistently predicted by that of fish. These results indicate fish, in isolation, may not be an ideal indicator for biodiversity response to reserves, and habitat considerations are important when creating reserves that support invertebrates. These results are particularly relevant to practitioners in developing regions, where community-managed reserves are common and invertebrates are important in fisheries.

Moreover, few studies treated the time budget of behaviors as compositions and little was done to characterize the distribution of durations of behavior sequences in relation with health. Data from the RECORD (Residential Environment and CORonary heart Disease) study of two combined VitaMove accelerometers worn at the trunk and upper leg for a week by 154 male and female adults (age = 50.6 +/- 9.6 years, BMI = 25.8 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)) were analyzed. Using both iso-temporal substitution and compositional analysis, we examined associations between five physical behaviors (lying, sitting, standing, low physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous activity) and seven health outcomes (fasting serum glucose, low- and high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides levels, body mass index, and waist circumference). After adjustment for confounding variables, total standing time was positively associated with better lipid profile, and lying during the day with adiposity. No significant association was observed between breaking up moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and health. This study highlights the importance of refined categories of postures in research on physical activity and health, as well as the necessity for new tools to characterize the distribution of behavior sequence durations, considering both bouts and micro-sequences.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is frequently used as an outdoor green space metric capturing the chlorophyll content in the vegetation canopy. This study assessed (1) whether residential NDVI exposures vary over time, and (2) how these time series of NDVI scores vary across spatial context delimitations. Multi-temporal NDVI data for the period 2006-2017 for the Netherlands were obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite platform. Annual NDVI exposures were determined across multiple buffer sizes (i.e., 300, 600, and 1000 m) centered on a random sample of 10,000 Dutch residential addresses. Besides the descriptive statistics, pairwise Wilcoxon tests and Fligner-Killeen tests were used to determine mean and variance differences in annual NDVI scores across buffer widths. Heat maps visualized the correlation matrices. Significance levels were adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing. The results indicated that annual NDVI metrics were significantly correlated but their magnitude varied notably between 0.60 to 0.97. Numerous mean and variance differences in annual NDVI exposures were significant. It seems that the disparate buffers (i.e., 300 and 1000 m) were less strongly correlated, possibly because variance heterogeneity is reduced in larger buffers. These results have been largely consistent over the years and have passed Monte Carlo-based sensitivity tests. In conclusion, besides assessing green space exposures along different buffer sizes, our findings suggest that green space-health studies should employ NDVI data that are well-aligned with epidemiological data. Even an annual temporal incompatibility may obscure or distort green space-health associations. Both strategies may diminish contextual uncertainties in environmental exposure assessments.

We investigated associations between socio-economic status (SES) and health parameters and behaviors in German children and adolescents. Data were collected between 2011 and 2018 in the framework of the LIFE Child study. Participants included 2998 children aged 3-18 years. SES was represented by an index combining information on parental education, occupation, and income. Associations between SES and health outcomes were estimated using linear and logistic regression analyses. In a moderator analysis, all associations were checked for interactions between SES and age or sex. A higher SES composite score was associated with better health (lower body mass index ( = -0.26), fewer behavioral difficulties ( = -0.18), higher quality of life ( = 0.21), fewer critical life events (odds ratio (OR) = 0.93); all p < 0.05) and a healthier lifestyle (healthier nutrition ( = 0.16), less excessive television use (OR = 0.87), less nicotine consumption (OR = 0.93), and more physical activity (OR = 1.18); all p < 0.05). However, SES was not associated with alcohol consumption (OR = 1.02) or sleep problems ( = -0.04). The strengths of the associations between SES and child health did not differ depending on SES indicator (education, occupation, income). The associations between SES and parent-reported behavioral difficulties and physical activity were stronger in older vs. younger children. In contrast, none of the observed associations were moderated by sex. This study highlights the strong association between socio-economic status and child health, even in modern Western societies.

Socio-Ecological Factors Associated with Dengue Risk and Aedes aegypti Presence in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						dengue fever; Aedes aegypti; social-ecological risk; islands; Galapagos; Ecuador	INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE; HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; IMPACT; EPIDEMIOLOGY; EXPANSION; MOSQUITOS	Dengue fever is an emerging infectious disease in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, with the first cases reported in 2002 and subsequent periodic outbreaks. We report results of a 2014 pilot study conducted in Puerto Ayora (PA) on Santa Cruz Island, and Puerto Baquerizo Moreno (PB) on San Cristobal Island. To assess the socio-ecological risk factors associated with dengue and mosquito vector presence at the household level, we conducted 100 household surveys (50 on each island) in neighborhoods with prior reported dengue cases. Adult mosquitoes were collected inside and outside the home, larval indices were determined through container surveys, and heads of households were interviewed to determine demographics, self-reported prior dengue infections, housing conditions, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding dengue. Multi-model selection methods were used to derive best-fit generalized linear regression models of prior dengue infection, and Aedes aegypti presence. We found that 24% of PB and 14% of PA respondents self-reported a prior dengue infection, and more PB homes than PA homes had Ae. aegypti. The top-ranked model for prior dengue infection included several factors related to human movement, household demographics, access to water quality issues, and dengue awareness. The top-ranked model for Ae. aegypti presence included housing conditions, mosquito control practices, and dengue risk perception. This is the first study of dengue risk and Ae. aegypti presence in the Galapagos Islands.

The study aims at evaluating the sociodemographic, lifestyle, environmental, and pregnancy-related determinants of maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy. Methods: The analysis was conducted on a group of pregnant women from the Polish Mother and Child Cohort (REPRO_PL). During the second trimester of pregnancy, 1306 women filled in a modified version of the validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Dietary patterns were estimated using an exploratory factor analysis. Potential dietary determinants were assessed via a questionnaire or biomarker measurements (saliva cotinine level). Results: Two dietary patterns were identified. The Prudent dietary pattern was characterized by high consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, poultry, and low-fat dairy products, while the Western dietary pattern included high intake of refined grains, processed meat, potatoes, and very low intake of whole grains. Clear sociodemographic, environmental, lifestyle, and pregnancy-related determinants of diet quality were established. Older age ( = 0.2; p < 0.01), higher educational level ( = 0.3; p < 0.01), and socioeconomic status (SES) ( = 0.2; p < 0.01), overweight/obesity before ( = 0.3; p < 0.01), as well as physical activity during pregnancy ( = 0.2; p = 0.01) were positive determinants of a healthier diet (increasing Prudent-Western difference in dietary pattern scores). On the other hand, parity ( = -0.2; p = 0.04) and living in small cities ( = -0.3; p = 0.02) were significantly related to a rather Western dietary pattern. Conclusions: The current study presents evidence on specific factors influencing dietary patterns. They need to be accounted for in educational programs and interventions focused on healthy diet recommendations during pregnancy.

These techniques account for the complexities of, and interrelationships between, behaviours that occur throughout a day (e.g., physical activity, sitting, and sleep). The field of health geography research is also developing rapidly. Novel spatial techniques and data visualisation approaches are increasingly being recognised for their utility in understanding health from a socio-ecological perspective. Linking compositional data approaches with geospatial datasets can yield insights into the role of environments in promoting or hindering the health implications of the daily time-use composition of behaviours. The 7-day behaviour data used in this study were derived from accelerometer data for 882 Auckland school children and linked to weight status and neighbourhood deprivation. We developed novel geospatial visualisation techniques to explore activity composition over a day and generated new insights into links between environments and child health behaviours and outcomes. Visualisation strategies that integrate compositional activities, time of day, weight status, and neighbourhood deprivation information were devised. They include a ringmap overview, small-multiple ringmaps, and individual and aggregated time-activity diagrams. Simultaneous visualisation of geospatial and compositional behaviour data can be useful for triangulating data from diverse disciplines, making sense of complex issues, and for effective knowledge translation.

Methods compared were visual estimation, foliage cover computation from photographs, satellite imagery and aerial photographs. Observations and images from 1 m(2), 100 m(2) and 625 m(2) quadrats measured cover of small plants, understory plants and trees respectively. Aerial photography and satellite imagery allowed the number, height and cover of trees to be estimated in 625 m(2) and 1 ha plots. The accuracy of methods was compared using a 28 month time series commencing before and after an intense bushfire that removed all foliage cover. Directly comparable methods were in close agreement and in combination allowed plant recovery to be quantified in great detail. Visual estimation of cover in the field was time-consuming but necessary to measure the contribution of individual species. Visual estimates from 1 m(2) downward photos allowed functional groups of plants to be measured. The number of green pixels selected manually in photographs confirmed that cover calculated from ground-based photographs using algorithms was accurate, except when cover was very low. We developed a new algorithm for computing cover from photographs that was accurate at low cover (Gperc). Canopy cover estimation by algorithm from upward photographs was subject to more errors, requiring exclusion of some images. Landsat satellite images allowed the impacts of severe drought and previous fires to be identified against a background of relatively consistent seasonal variations since 1988. Aerial photographs from 1953 onwards showed gradual recolonisation by banksia woodland trees over 60 years following tree felling. These methods provide a toolkit for monitoring vegetation recovery after disturbance and baseline data for monitoring banksia woodland. This toolkit should also be suitable for most other plant communities.

Phenology and climate change in Africa and the decline of Afro-Palearctic migratory bird populations	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						ERLoB; growing season; migration; NDVI; remote sensing; VIPPHEN	SAND MARTIN RIPARIA; ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS; SPRING MIGRATION; PASSAGE AREAS; MIGRANT BIRDS; ARRIVAL DATE; SURVIVAL; CONNECTIVITY; BRITISH; WINTER	The populations of many Afro-Palearctic migratory bird species have declined over the last 50 years, for reasons that remain poorly understood, but which could include major environmental changes in Africa. We mapped, for the first time, the aggregated population trends of migratory species onto their non-breeding distributions in sub-Saharan Africa and used regression models that account for non-stationarity to examine correlations between assemblage population trend indices and changes in climate and vegetation phenology over the same time period. This also allowed us to map geographical variation in these relationships across Africa. Our results revealed that relationships between population trends of migrant bird species and climate and phenology are spatially highly variable, and that there are no consistent, flyway-wide associations between climate or phenology and population trends. However, we found evidence that migrant population changes may be more closely linked to indices of vegetation senescence and climate than to indices of greening, suggesting further lines of investigation. Simply using cumulative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across Africa greatly underestimates the extent to which phenology and climate vary spatially, as do the relationships between population trends and these environmental variables. Furthermore, much better data on the nonbreeding ecology and distributions of migrants, including connectivity between breeding and wintering grounds, are needed if we are to assess with any confidence the extent to which they may be impacted by changes in environmental conditions in Africa. Until then, we suggest that there is no simple relationship between migrant populations and NDVI across species' ranges, and that further studies should, at the very least, consider the multiple dimensions of phenology and the potential for spatial variation in relationships.

Long-term sand dune spatio-temporal dynamics and endemic plant habitat extent in the Athabasca sand dunes of northern Saskatchewan	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Athabasca sand dunes; endemic vascular plants; Landsat images; plant habitat modeling; remote sensing; sand dune migration; sand dune morphologies; species distribution modeling	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SAMPLE-SIZE; DESERT; FIELD; STABILIZATION; SALIX; TAXA; TM	The Athabasca sand dunes in northern Saskatchewan and north-east Alberta are a unique landscape of moving sand that hosts nine narrowly distributed endemic vascular plant taxa. We modeled the extent of habitat for each species, corresponding dune morphologies in species habitat, spatial and temporal variation in dune environments, and rates of woody vegetation encroachment at dune boundaries to support an assessment of long-term threats for the Athabasca endemic dune flora. Landsat images were used to maximize the time spans and areal coverage of the study. The Athabasca sand dunes are currently active and characterized morphologically by crescentic ridge and morphodynamically by transverse form dunes. Longitudinal sand movement parallel to the dune axis resulted in the creation of new dune areas along the east and south-east boundaries of the dune fields at a rate of 0.14 km(2) year(-1). Forest succession along the western boundaries of the dune fields resulted at an annual dune loss of 1.98 km(2) year(-1). The net extent of dune stabilization between 1985 and 2014 was 53.76 km(2) or nearly 20 percent of the total open sand dune extent. All habitat modeling methods showed robust performance (> 0.5 AUC), with the best performance in most cases from generalized linear models. Estimated total available/occupied habitat was comparatively low for the least abundant species Achillea millefolium (38.92 km(2)) and Armeria maritima (48.82 km(2)), and of those areas 53.5% and 16.29%, respectively, are influenced by dune stabilization. Continuing stabilization of the Athabasca sand dunes region may present conservation concerns for these narrowly distributed endemic taxa.

This knowledge is, however, many times lacking, particularly so for complex systems. On the other hand, recent developments have resulted in tools that enable the mapping of these patterns from remote sensing data, such as Sparse Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (SGDM). SGDM is a two-stage approach, which combines a Sparse Canonical Component analysis and a Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM), thus being designed to deal with high-dimensional data to predict community turnover in GDM. In this study, we use space-borne hyperspectral data to map woody plant community patterns collected in two study sites in the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah), namely, the Parque Estadual da Serra Azul (PESA) in Mato Grosso state and Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Veadeiros (PNCV) in Goias state. Field data were collected in both study sites, following a systematic sampling scheme adapted for the Cerrado. The Cerrado is the most diverse of all the world's savannahs, and while holding a high diversity and endemism of species, this biome is mostly unprotected and understudied. We used Hyperion data acquired over the two study sites, which were subject to data pre-processing (including radiometric and geometric corrections, as well as correction for sensor errors) and quality screening before analysis. Our models were used to map woody plant community patterns and turnover for the study areas. We also inspected the Hyperion spectral bands which most contributed in the SGDM, for each site. Furthermore, the modelled patterns were interpreted with respect to the ecological characteristics of the respective species, this way further enhancing our understanding of this complex system. This study has demonstrated that this approach is suitable for mapping woody plant communities in heterogeneous systems, based on combined field and space-borne hyperspectral data.

To explore these aspects in Sierra Nevada, the core of the Mediterranean Betic-Rifean hotspot, we have analyzed nuclear DNA microsatellite diversity and a set of biological and environmental factors (physicochemical soil parameters, floral traits, and community composition) in two strictly endemic taxa from dolomite outcrops of Sierra Nevada (Helianthemum pannosum and H. apenninum subsp. estevei) and two congeneric widespread taxa (H. cinereum subsp. rotundifolium and H. apenninum subsp. apenninum) that further belong to two different lineages (subgenera) of Helianthemum. We obtained rather unexpected results contrasting with the theory: (a) The narrow endemic taxa showed higher values of genetic diversity as well as higher average values of pollen production per flower and pollen-to-ovule ratio than their widespread relatives; and (b) the two taxa of subg. Helianthemum, with larger corollas, approach herkogamy and higher pollen production than the two taxa of subg. Plectolobum, displayed lower genetic diversity and higher values of inbreeding. Altogether, these results disclose how genetic diversity may be affected simultaneously by a large number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, especially in Pleistocene glacial refugia in mountains where the spatial context harbors a great ecological heterogeneity. On the other hand, differences in mating system and the significant effect of the substrate profile, both being highly diverse in the genus Helianthemum, in the genetic variability illustrate about the importance of these two factors in the diversification and species differentiation of this paradigmatic genus in the Mediterranean and open the field to formulate and test new hypotheses of local adaptation, trait evolution, and habitat diversification.

Accelerometers can solve some of these mysteries, as they collect activity data at a high temporal resolution (<1 s), can be relatively small (<1 g) so they minimally disrupt behavior, and are increasingly capable of recording data for long periods. Nonetheless, there is a need for increased validation of methods to classify animal behavior from accelerometers to promote widespread adoption of this technology in ecology. We assessed the accuracy of six different behavioral assignment methods for two species of seabird, thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla). We identified three behaviors using tri-axial accelerometers: standing, swimming, and flying, after classifying diving using a pressure sensor for murres. We evaluated six classification methods relative to independent classifications from concurrent GPS tracking data. We used four variables for classification: depth, wing beat frequency, pitch, and dynamic acceleration. Average accuracy for all methods was >98% for murres, and 89% and 93% for kittiwakes during incubation and chick rearing, respectively. Variable selection showed that classification accuracy did not improve with more than two (kittiwakes) or three (murres) variables. We conclude that simple methods of behavioral classification can be as accurate for classifying basic behaviors as more complex approaches, and that identifying suitable accelerometer metrics is more important than using a particular classification method when the objective is to develop a daily activity or energy budget. Highly accurate daily activity budgets can be generated from accelerometer data using multiple methods and a small number of accelerometer metrics; therefore, identifying a suitable behavioral classification method should not be a barrier to using accelerometers in studies of seabird behavior and ecology.

Unlike many species of birds, mammals, and amphibians which can be efficiently sampled using automated sensors including cameras and sound recorders, reptiles are often much more challenging to detect, in part because of their typically cryptic behavior and generally small body sizes. Although many lizard species are more active during the day which makes them easier to detect using visual encounter surveys, they may be unavailable for sampling during certain periods of the day or year due to their sensitivity to temperature. In recognition of these sampling challenges, we demonstrate application of a recent innovation in distance sampling that adjusts for temporary emigration between repeat survey visits. We used transect surveys to survey lizards at 229 sites throughout the Mojave Desert in California, USA, 2016. We estimated a total population size of 82 million (90% CI: 65-99 million) for the three most common species of lizards across this 66,830 km(2) ecoregion. We mapped how density at the 1-km(2) scale was predicted to vary with vegetation cover and human development. We validated these results against independent surveys from the southern portion of our study area. Our methods and results demonstrate how multispecies monitoring programs spanning arid ecoregions can better incorporate information about reptiles.

Offspring of the European common frog (Rana temporaria) exhibit a high degree of variability in metamorphic traits. However, environmental factors alone cannot explain this phenotypic variability, and the influence of genetic factors remains to be determined. Here, we tested whether the maternal genotype influences developmental time, body size, and body condition of offspring in a forest pond in Germany. We collected fertilized eggs from all 57 clutches deposited in the pond. We used multilocus genotypes based on seven microsatellite loci to assign metamorphosed offspring to mothers and to determine the number of fathers for a single matriline. We tested the influence of genetic effects in the same environment by comparing variability of metamorphic traits within and between full-sib offspring grouped to matrilines and tested whether multiple paternity increases the variability of metamorphic traits in a single matriline. The variability in size and body condition was higher within matrilines than between them, which indicates that these traits are more strongly influenced by environmental effects, which are counteracting underlying genetic effects. The developmental time varied considerably between matrilines and variability increased with the effective number of fathers, suggesting an additive genetic effect of multiple paternity. Our results show that metamorphic traits are shaped by environmental as well as genetic effects.

Molecular ecology tools are often employed to determine the origins and spread of introduced species, but the complexities of some organisms may be reducing the efficacy of these tools. Some colonial species exhibit complexities by way of chimerism and winter colony regression, which may alter the genetic diversity of populations and mask the connectivity occurring among them. This study uses nuclear microsatellite data and simple GIS-based modeling to investigate the influence of chimerism and winter regression on the genetic diversity and patterns of genetic population connectivity among colonies of Didemnum vexillum on artificial substrates. Colonies sampled in summer were shown to form a metapopulation, with high levels of admixture, extreme outcrossing, and some substructure. These patterns were consistent within the subsampled winter colonies and with the inclusion of chimeric data. However, allelic richness and diversity were significantly different between winter and summer samples, altering interpretations relating to population connectivity and pelagic larval duration. This study demonstrates the importance of including seasonal sampling and imperative life history traits in genetic studies for clear interpretations and the successful management of introduced species.

Toward accurate species-level metabarcoding of arthropod communities from the tropical forest canopy	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						arthropods; body size; compositionality; metabarcoding; sequencing bias; species diversity; taxon composition	BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY	Metabarcoding of arthropod communities can be used for assessing species diversity in tropical forests but the methodology requires validation for accurate and repeatable species occurrences in complex mixtures. This study investigates how the composition of ecological samples affects the accuracy of species recovery. Starting with field-collected bulk samples from the tropical canopy, the recovery of specimens was tested for subsets of different body sizes and major taxa, by assembling these subsets into increasingly complex composite pools. After metabarcoding, we track whether richness, diversity, and most importantly composition of any size class or taxonomic subset are affected by the presence of other subsets in the mixture. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) greatly exceeded the number of morphospecies in most taxa, even under very stringent sequencing read filtering. There was no significant effect on the recovered OTU richness of small and medium-sized arthropods when metabarcoded alongside larger arthropods, despite substantial biomass differences in the mixture. The recovery of taxonomic subsets was not generally influenced by the presence of other taxa, although with some exceptions likely due to primer mismatches. Considerable compositional variation within size and taxon-based subcommunities was evident resulting in high beta-diversity among samples from within a single tree canopy, but this beta-diversity was not affected by experimental manipulation. We conclude that OTU recovery in complex arthropod communities, with sufficient sequencing depth and within reasonable size ranges, is not skewed by variable biomass of the constituent species. This could remove the need for time-intensive manual sorting prior to metabarcoding. However, there remains a chance of taxonomic bias, which may be primer-dependent. There will never be a panacea primer; instead, metabarcoding studies should carefully consider whether the aim is broadscale turnover, in which case these biases may not be important, or species lists, in which case separate PCRs and sequencing might be necessary. OTU number inflation remains an issue in metabarcoding and requires bioinformatic development, particularly in read filtering and OTU clustering, and/or greater use of species-identifying sequences generated outside of bulk sequencing.

Molecular diet analysis finds an insectivorous desert bat community dominated by resource sharing despite diverse echolocation and foraging strategies	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						bat foraging ecology; community ecology; dietary analysis; metabarcoding	TROPHIC NICHE DIFFERENTIATION; BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY; MYOTIS-LUCIFUGUS; CHIROPTERA; PREY; ECOLOGY; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; PREDATOR; ADAPTATIONS	Interspecific differences in traits can alter the relative niche use of species within the same environment. Bats provide an excellent model to study niche use because they use a wide variety of behavioral, acoustic, and morphological traits that may lead to multi-species, functional groups. Predatory bats have been classified by their foraging location (edge, clutter, open space), ability to use aerial hawking or substrate gleaning and echolocation call design and flexibility, all of which may dictate their prey use. For example, high frequency, broadband calls do not travel far but offer high object resolution while high intensity, low frequency calls travel further but provide lower resolution. Because these behaviors can be flexible, four behavioral categories have been proposed: (a) gleaning, (b) behaviorally flexible (gleaning and hawking), (c) clutter-tolerant hawking, and (d) open space hawking. Many recent studies of diet in bats use molecular tools to identify prey but mainly focus on one or two species in isolation; few studies provide evidence for substantial differences in prey use despite the many behavioral, acoustic, and morphological differences. Here, we analyze the diet of 17 sympatric species in the Chihuahuan desert and test the hypothesis that peak echolocation frequency and behavioral categories are linked to differences in diet. We find no significant correlation between dietary richness and echolocation peak frequency though it spanned close to 100 kHz across species. Our data, however, suggest that bats which use both gleaning and hawking strategies have the broadest diets and are most differentiated from clutter-tolerant aerial hawking species.

These categories might be defined by demographics, functional traits, or species. Assignment of categories is often imperfect, but frequently treated as observations without error. When individuals are observed but not classified, these "partial" observations must be modified to include the missing data mechanism to avoid spurious inference. We developed two hierarchical Bayesian models to overcome the assumption of perfect assignment to mutually exclusive categories in the multinomial distribution of categorical counts, when classifications are missing. These models incorporate auxiliary information to adjust the posterior distributions of the proportions of membership in categories. In one model, we use an empirical Bayes approach, where a subset of data from one year serves as a prior for the missing data the next. In the other approach, we use a small random sample of data within a year to inform the distribution of the missing data. We performed a simulation to show the bias that occurs when partial observations were ignored and demonstrated the altered inference for the estimation of demographic ratios. We applied our models to demographic classifications of elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) to demonstrate improved inference for the proportions of sex and stage classes. We developed multiple modeling approaches using a generalizable nested multinomial structure to account for partially observed data that were missing not at random for classification counts. Accounting for classification uncertainty is important to accurately understand the composition of populations and communities in ecological studies.	[Ketz, Alison C.; Hobbs, N.

A fine-scale phylogenetic assessment of digenean trematodes in central Alberta reveals we have yet to uncover their total diversity	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Alberta; cercariae; digenea; diversity; phylogenetics; trematoda	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; AUSTRALAPATEMON SUDARIKOV; PLATYHELMINTHES DIGENEA; DIPLOSTOMOIDEA POIRIER; ECHINOSTOMA-REVOLUTUM; DREPANOCEPHALUS DIETZ; PHALACROCORAX-AURITUS; MOLECULAR ANALYSES; CRYPTIC DIVERSITY; LIFE-CYCLE	Despite over 100 years of digenean trematode parasite species descriptions, from a wide diversity of vertebrate and invertebrate host species, our ability to recognize the diversity of trematode species within a single lake remains an incredible challenge. The most challenging aspect is the identification of species from larval stages derived from intermediate hosts, due to the disjointed data of adult worm morphological descriptions, from which species are named, and links to corresponding molecular identifiers in depauperate databases. Cryptic species also play a significant role in the challenge of linking trematode larvae to adults, species identifications, and estimating diversity. Herein, we utilize a large, longitudinal dataset of snail first-intermediate host infection data from lakes in Alberta, Canada, to infer trematode larval diversity using molecular phylogenetics and snail host associations. From our assessments, we uncover a diversity of 79 larval trematode species among just five snail host species. Only 14 species were identified to a previously described species, while the other 65 species are either cryptic or otherwise unrepresented by mitochondrial genes in GenBank. This study currently represents the largest and most diverse singular molecular survey of trematode larval fauna composed of over one thousand mitochondrial sequences. Surprisingly, rarefaction analyses indicate we have yet to capture the complete diversity of trematodes from our sampling area.

Conservation of genetic diversity hotspots of the high-valued relic yellowhorn (Xanthoceras sorbifolium) considering climate change predictions	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						breeding; climate change; conservation; genetic diversity; Xanthoceras sorbifolium; yellowhorn	NONCODING REGIONS; INTERIOR SPRUCE; POPULATION; CHLOROPLAST; CHINA; INFERENCE; DIFFERENTIATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; MITOCHONDRIAL; BIOGEOGRAPHY	Genetic structure and major climate factors may contribute to the distribution of genetic diversity of a highly valued oil tree species Xanthoceras sorbifolium (yellowhorn). Long-term over utilization along with climate change is affecting the viability of yellowhorn wild populations. To preserve the species known and unknown valuable gene pools, the identification of genetic diversity "hotspots" is a prerequisite for their consideration as in situ conservation high priority. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) diversity was high among 38 natural populations (H-d = 0.717, K = 4.616, Tajmas' D = -0.22) and characterized by high genetic divergence (F-ST = 0.765) and relatively low gene flow (N-m = 0.03), indicating populations isolation reflecting the species' habitat fragmentation and inbreeding depression. Six out of the studied 38 populations are defined as genetic diversity "hotspots." The number and geographic direction of cpDNA mutation steps supported the species southwest to northeast migration history. Climatic factors such as extreme minimum temperature over 30 years indicated that the identified genetic "hotspots" are expected to experience 5 degrees C temperature increase in next following 50 years. The results identified vulnerable genetic diversity "hotspots" and provided fundamental information for the species' future conservation and breeding activities under the anticipated climate change. More specifically, the role of breeding as a component of a gene resource management strategy aimed at fulfilling both utilization and conservation goals.

Chronology of reproductive investment determines predation risk aversion in a felid-ungulate system	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						behavioral risk effect; predation risk; reproductive chronology; risk aversion; sexual segregation	WHITE-TAILED DEER; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; SEXUAL SEGREGATION; PATCH USE; HABITAT SELECTION; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; PREY; ELK; LANDSCAPE; PATTERNS	Fear of predators can behaviorally mediate prey population dynamics, particularly when predation risk influences reproductive investment. However, the costs of reproductive investment may mitigate predation risk aversion relative to periods when the link between reproductive output and prey behavior is weaker. We posit that intensity of reproductive investment in ungulates may predict their response to predation risk such that the sexes increase risk exposure during biological seasons that are pivotal to reproductive success, such as the fawn-rearing and breeding seasons for females and males, respectively. We examined the activity patterns of sympatric white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a sexually segregated polygynous ungulate, and Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) in the context of the "risky times - risky places hypothesis" and the reproductive strategy hypothesis. We compared detection rates and diel activity overlap of both species using motion-triggered camera traps positioned on (n = 120) and off (n = 60) anthropogenic trails across five reproductive seasons. Florida panthers were nocturnal and primarily observed on-trail providing an experimental framework with risky times and risky places. Contrary to studies in other taxa inversely correlating prey reproductive investment to predation risk, the sexes of deer were more risk prone during sex-specific seasons associated with intense reproductive investment. Our results suggest spatiotemporally variable predation risk influences sex-specific behavioral decision-making in deer such that reproductive success is maximized.

Population genomics of rapidly invading lionfish in the Caribbean reveals signals of range expansion in the absence of spatial population structure	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						distributional shifts; genetic drift; invasive species; natural selection and contemporary evolution; RAD-sequencing	MEMBRANE PROGESTIN RECEPTOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; PTEROIS-VOLITANS; MUTATIONS; GENETICS; HISTORY; COLONIZATION; DIVERSITY; FREQUENCY	Range expansions driven by global change and species invasions may have significant genomic, evolutionary, and ecological implications. During range expansions, strong genetic drift characterized by repeated founder events can result in decreased genetic diversity with increased distance from the center of the historic range, or the point of invasion. The invasion of the Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans, into waters off the US East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea provides a natural system to study rapid range expansion in an invasive marine fish with high dispersal capabilities. We report results from 12,759 single nucleotide polymorphism loci sequenced by restriction enzyme-associated DNA sequencing for nine P. volitans sampling areas in the invaded range, including Florida and other sites throughout the Caribbean, as well as mitochondrial control region D-loop data. Analyses revealed low to no spatially explicit metapopulation genetic structure, which is partly consistent with previous finding of little structure within ocean basins, but partly divergent from initial reports of between-basin structure. Genetic diversity, however, was not homogeneous across all sampled sites. Patterns of genetic diversity correlate with invasion pathway. Observed heterozygosity, averaged across all loci within a population, decreases with distance from Florida while expected heterozygosity is mostly constant in sampled populations, indicating population genetic disequilibrium correlated with distance from the point of invasion. Using an F-ST outlier analysis and a Bayesian environmental correlation analysis, we identified 256 and 616 loci, respectively, that could be experiencing selection or genetic drift. Of these, 24 loci were shared between the two methods.

The density of wild ungulates has increased in the last century, and browsing has become a major driver of forest succession in the northern hemisphere. In addition, tree species are expected to respond differently to future climate conditions, especially an increased frequency of late frost events. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of intraspecific genetic variation on the recovery of two tree species to frost and browsing. An experiment with saplings from 90 Abies alba and 72 Picea abies seed sources was conducted. Five-year-old saplings were clipped at three intensities before budburst in spring. Growth (height, diameter, leader shoot length, and biomass) and quality (e.g. stem form, multistemming, reaction type) were assessed before and 1-2 years after clipping or 3-4 years after natural frost events, and provenance differences were related to environmental differences at the seed source. For Abies, frost and clipping resulted in reduced height growth in the first year after the stress and reduced height for two (clipping) to four (frost) vegetation periods. Sapling biomass, diameter increment, and quality decreased after heavy clipping. For Picea, which grew twice as fast as Abies, such effects were only found after frost damage. Population differences were significant for both species for all investigated growth traits and for Picea also for some quality variables. The "reaction type" after browsing (e.g. new shoot, existing twig bending upward) seems to be species specific and independent of seed source. In contrast, the time lag between clipping and formation of a clear new leader shoot increased for Abieswith lower temperatures at the seed source. Lowland populations with warmer climates grew faster, and for Picea also qualitatively better, and recovered faster from leader shoot loss (Abies) or reacted at the uppermost meristem (Picea). Thus, the investigated stressors increased the existing differences among populations.

Information regarding morphological and genetic structure of coyote populations in the southeastern United States is limited, and where data exist, they are rarely compared to those from other regions of North America. We assessed geographic patterns in morphology and genetics of coyotes with special consideration of coyotes in the southeastern United States. Mean body mass of coyote populations increased along a west-to-east gradient, with southeastern coyotes being intermediate to western and northeastern coyotes. Similarly, principal component analysis of body mass and linear body measurements suggested that southeastern coyotes were intermediate to western and northeastern coyotes in body size but exhibited shorter tails and ears from other populations. Genetic analyses indicated that southeastern coyotes represented a distinct genetic cluster that differentiated strongly from western and northeastern coyotes. We postulate that southeastern coyotes experienced lower immigration from western populations than did northeastern coyotes, and over time, genetically diverged from both western and northeastern populations. Coyotes colonizing eastern North America experienced different selective pressures than did stable populations in the core range, and we offer that the larger body size of eastern coyotes reflects an adaptation that improved dispersal capabilities of individuals in the expanding range.

However, predators adapted to forage on local resources may have a reduced ability to couple habitats. Here, we show clear asymmetry in the ability to couple habitats by Eurasian perch-a common polymorphic predator in European lakes. We sampled perch from two spatially separate habitats-pelagic and littoral zones-in Lake Erken, Sweden. Littoral perch showed stronger individual specialization, but they also used resources from the pelagic zone, indicating their ability to couple habitats. In contrast, pelagic perch showed weaker individual specialization but near complete reliance on pelagic resources, indicating their preference to one habitat. This asymmetry in the habitat coupling ability of perch challenges the expectation that, in general, predators should stabilize spatially separated food webs. Our results suggest that habitat coupling might be constrained by morphological adaptations, which in this case were not related to genetic differentiation but were more likely related to differences in individual specialization.

To assist with their development, a better understanding of the genetic structure and diversity of these threatened species would allow a more targeted approach for preserving genetic variation and ultimately improve long-term species recoveries. It is hypothesized that the unfragmented river basins that have persisted across Mongolia provide unobstructed connectivity for resident salmonid species. Thus, genetic structure is expected to be primarily segregated between major river basins. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the population structure for three salmonid genera (Hucho, Brachymystax and Thymallus) using different genetic markers to identify evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) and priority rivers to focus conservation efforts. Fish were assigned to separate ESUs when the combined evidence of mitochondrial and nuclear data indicated genetic isolation. Hucho taimen exhibited a dichotomous population structure forming two ESUs, with five priority rivers. Within the Brachymystax genus, there were three B. lenokESUs and one B. tumensisESU, along with six priority rivers. While B. tumensiswas confirmed to display divergent mtDNA haplotypes, haplotype sharing between these two congeneric species was also identified. For T. baicalensis,only a single ESU was assigned, with five priority rivers identified plus Lake Hovsgol. Additionally, we confirmed that T. nigrescens from Lake Hovsgol is a synonym of T. baicalensis. Across all species, the most prominent pattern was strong differentiation among major river basins with low differentiation and weak patterns of isolation by distance within river basins, which corroborated our hypothesis of high within-basin connectivity across Mongolia. This new genetic information provides authorities the opportunity to distribute resources for management between ESUs while assigning additional protection for the more genetically valuable salmonid rivers so that the greatest adaptive potential within each species can be preserved.

Developmental and genetic effects on behavioral and life-history traits in a field cricket	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						behavioral traits; developmental plasticity; Gryllus firmus; heritability; population density; quantitative genetics	PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; INDIVIDUAL VARIATION; ANIMAL PERSONALITY; NATURAL-SELECTION; SAND CRICKET; TRADE-OFFS; WING MORPH; HERITABILITY; DENSITY	A fundamental goal of evolutionary ecology is to identify the sources underlying trait variation on which selection can act. Phenotypic variation will be determined by both genetic and environmental factors, and adaptive phenotypic plasticity is expected when organisms can adjust their phenotypes to match environmental cues. Much recent research interest has focused on the relative importance of environmental and genetic factors on the expression of behavioral traits, in particular, and how they compare with morphological and life-history traits. Little research to date examines the effect of development on the expression of heritable variation in behavioral traits, such as boldness and activity. We tested for genotype, environment, and genotype-by-environment differences in body mass, development time, boldness, and activity, using developmental density treatments combined with a quantitative genetic design in the sand field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Similar to results from previous work, animals reared at high densities were generally smaller and took longer to mature, and body mass and development time were moderately heritable. In contrast, neither boldness nor activity responded to density treatments, and they were not heritable. The only trait that showed significant genotype-by-environment differences was development time. It is possible that adaptive behavioral plasticity is not evident in this species because of the highly variable social environments it naturally experiences. Our results illustrate the importance of validating the assumption that behavioral phenotype reflects genetic patterns and suggest questions about the role of environmental instability in trait variation and heritability.

Castes usually derive from a single genotype initially by receiving social cues among individuals during development. Specific gene expression changes may be involved in caste differentiation, and thus, the regulatory mechanism of these changes should be clarified in order to understand social maintenance and evolution. The damp-wood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis is one of the most important model termite species, due to not only the availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic information but also evidence that soldier- and worker-destined individuals can be identified in natural conditions. Given that the nutritional intakes via social interactions are crucial for caste differentiation in this species, there is a possibility that transcriptomic changes are influenced by the nutritional difference among these individuals. Here, whole body RNA-seq analysis of 3rd-instar larvae with biological replications and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were conducted. We found the drastic expression differences during caste developments between soldier- and worker-destined individuals. The results indicated that there are several key signaling pathways responsible for caste formations, which are involved in developments and social interactions. Particularly, the nutritional sensitive signaling was upregulated in soldier-destined individuals, while some metabolic pathways were identified in worker-destined individuals. These bioinformatic data obtained should be utilized to examine the molecular mechanisms of caste determination in social insects.

Invasion genetics from eDNA and thousands of larvae: A targeted metabarcoding assay that distinguishes species and population variation of zebra and quagga mussels	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Dreissena; environmental DNA; Great Lakes; high-throughput sequencing; invasive species	DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA PALLAS; FRESH-WATER MUSSELS; ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; ILLUMINA MISEQ; BUGENSIS; HISTORY; ROSTRIFORMIS; IMPACTS; SPP.; IDENTIFICATION	Identifying species and population genetic compositions of biological invasions at early life stages and/or from environmental (e)DNA using targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcode assays offers powerful and cost-effective means for early detection, analysis of spread patterns, and evaluating population changes. The present study develops, tests, and applies this method with a targeted sequence assay designed to simultaneously identify and distinguish between the closely related invasive Eurasian zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis) and their relatives and discern their respective population genetic patterns. Invasions of these dreissenid mussel species have markedly changed freshwater ecosystems throughout North America and Europe, exerting severe ecological and economic damage. Their planktonic early life stages (eggs and larvae) are morphologically indistinguishable, yet each species exerts differential ecological effects, with the quagga often outcompeting the zebra mussel as adults. Our targeted assay analyzes genetic variation from a diagnostic sequence region of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, to assess temporal and spatial inter- and intra-specific genetic variability. The assay facilitates analysis of environmental (e)DNA from water, early life stages from thousands of individuals, and simultaneous analysis of 50-100 tagged field-collected samples. Experiments evaluated its accuracy and performance using: (a) mock laboratory communities containing known DNA quantities per taxon, (b) aquaria with mixed-species/haplotype compositions of adults, and (c) field-collected water and plankton versus traditional sampling of adult communities. Results delineated species compositions, relative abundances, and population-level diversity differences among ecosystems, habitats, time series, and life stages from two allopatric concurrent invasions in the Great Lakes (Lake Erie) and the Hudson River, which had separate founding histories. Findings demonstrate application of this targeted assay and our approach to accurately and simultaneously discern species- and population-level differences across spatial and temporal scales, facilitating early detection and ecological understanding of biological invasions.

We test whether the spread of arid and semi-arid biomes in Eurasia coincides with the biogeography of this drought-adapted genus, and whether the ITfr acted as source area of floristic elements for adjacent regions. Location Deserts and semi-deserts of Northern Africa, Mediterranean, Arabia, West and Central Asia. Methods Four cpDNA markers (rpL16 intron, atpB-rbcL, trnQ-rps16, and ndhF-rpL32 spacers) were sequenced for 58 accessions representing 21 Anabasis species. Phylogenetic relationships and divergence times were inferred using maximum likelihood and a time-calibrated Bayesian approach. To document the extant distribution of Anabasis, material from 23 herbaria was surveyed resulting in 441 well-documented collections used for the coding of eight floristic regions. Using this coded data, ancestral range was estimated using "BioGeoBEARS" under the DEC model. Results Anabasis originated during the Late Miocene and the ancestral range was probably widespread and disjunct between Western Mediterranean and the Irano-Turanian regions. Diversification started with two divergence events at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (5.1 and 4.5 mya) leading to Asian clade I with ITfr origin which is sister to a slightly younger Asian clade II, which originated in the Western ITfr, and a Mediterranean/North African clade with an origin in the Western Mediterranean. Main conclusions Anabasis did not follow aridification and continuously expanded its distribution area, in fact its probably wide ancestral distribution area seems to have been fragmented during the very Late Miocene and the remnant lineages then expanded into neighboring arid regions. This genus supports the role of the ITfr as source area for xerophytic elements in the Mediterranean and Central Asia.

This inbreeding xenvironment (I x E) interaction may be of particular importance for the success of plant invasions if introduced populations experience a release from attack by natural enemies relative to their native conspecifics. Here, we investigate whether inbreeding affects plant infestation damage, whether inbreeding depression in growth and reproduction is mitigated by enemy release, and whether this effect is more pronounced in invasive than native plant populations. We used the invader Silene latifolia and its natural enemies as a study system. We performed two generations of experimental out- and inbreeding within eight native (European) and eight invasive (North American) populations under controlled conditions using field-collected seeds. Subsequently, we exposed the offspring to an enemy exclusion and inclusion treatment in a common garden in the species' native range to assess the interactive effects of population origin (range), breeding treatment, and enemy treatment on infestation damage, growth, and reproduction. Inbreeding increased flower and leaf infestation damage in plants from both ranges, but had opposing effects on fruit damage in native versus invasive plants. Inbreeding significantly reduced plant fitness; whereby, inbreeding depression in fruit number was higher in enemy inclusions than exclusions. This effect was equally pronounced in populations from both distribution ranges. Moreover, the magnitude of inbreeding depression in fruit number was lower in invasive than native populations. These results support that inbreeding has the potential to reduce plant defenses in S. latifolia, which magnifies inbreeding depression in the presence of enemies. However, future studies are necessary to further explore whether enemy release in the invaded habitat has actually decreased inbreeding depression and thus facilitated the persistence of inbred founder populations and invasion success.

However, the expression of apomixis is typically linked to polyploidy. Thus, it is a priori not clear whether intrinsic effects related to the change in the reproductive mode or rather in the ploidy drive ecological differentiation. We used sympatric sexual and apomictic populations of Potentilla puberula to test for ecological differentiation. To distinguish the effects of reproductive mode and ploidy on the ecology of cytotypes, we compared the niches (a) of sexuals (tetraploids) and autopolyploid apomicts (penta-, hepta-, and octoploids) and (b) of the three apomictic cytotypes. We based comparisons on a ploidy screen of 238 populations along a latitudinal transect through the Eastern European Alps and associated bioclimatic, and soil and topographic data. Sexual tetraploids preferred primary habitats at drier, steeper, more south-oriented slopes, while apomicts mostly occurred in human-made habitats with higher water availability. Contrariwise, we found no or only marginal ecological differentiation among the apomictic higher ploids. Based on the pronounced ecological differences found between sexuals and apomicts, in addition to the lack of niche differentiation among cytotypes of the same reproductive mode, we conclude that reproductive mode rather than ploidy is the main driver of the observed differences. Moreover, we compared our system with others from the literature, to stress the importance of identifying alternative confounding effects (such as hybrid origin). Finally, we underline the relevance of studying ecological parthenogenesis in sympatry, to minimize the effects of differential migration abilities.

Prairie plant phenology driven more by temperature than moisture in climate manipulations across a latitudinal gradient in the Pacific Northwest, USA	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						climate manipulation; drought; latitudinal gradient; Mediterranean grassland; normalized difference vegetation index; Pacific Northwest; USA; phenology; prairie; soil moisture; warming	CHANGE IMPACTS; FORECASTING PHENOLOGY; GROWING-SEASON; SPRING GROWTH; ELEVATED CO2; SOIL-WATER; RESPONSES; OREGON; SHIFTS; ONSET	Plant phenology will likely shift with climate change, but how temperature and/or moisture regimes will control phenological responses is not well understood. This is particularly true in Mediterranean climate ecosystems where the warmest temperatures and greatest moisture availability are seasonally asynchronous. We examined plant phenological responses at both the population and community levels to four climate treatments (control, warming, drought, and warming plus additional precipitation) embedded within three prairies across a 520 km latitudinal Mediterranean climate gradient within the Pacific Northwest, USA. At the population level, we monitored flowering and abundances in spring 2017 of eight range-restricted focal species planted both within and north of their current ranges. At the community level, we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured from fall 2016 to summer 2018 to estimate peak live biomass, senescence, seasonal patterns, and growing season length. We found that warming exerted a stronger control than our moisture manipulations on phenology at both the population and community levels. Warming advanced flowering regardless of whether a species was within or beyond its current range. Importantly, many of our focal species had low abundances, particularly in the south, suggesting that establishment, in addition to phenological shifts, may be a strong constraint on their future viability. At the community level, warming advanced the date of peak biomass regardless of site or year. The date of senescence advanced regardless of year for the southern and central sites but only in 2018 for the northern site. Growing season length contracted due to warming at the southern and central sites (similar to 3 weeks) but was unaffected at the northern site. Our results emphasize that future temperature changes may exert strong influence on the timing of a variety of plant phenological events, especially those events that occur when temperature is most limiting, even in seasonally water-limited Mediterranean ecosystems.

As predicted, we found decreased genetic diversity in previously glaciated areas in comparison with nonglaciated regions and discovered three major maternal genetic groups: southern, northeastern, and northwestern Europe. Interestingly, host populations from Greenland were genetically similar to those from the Faroe Islands and Iceland, suggesting gene flow also between those areas. The level of variation among populations within regions is evidently highly dependent on the postglacial colonization history, in particular on the number of independent long-distance seed colonization events. Yet, also anthropogenic effects may have affected the population structure in F. rubra. We did not observe higher fungal infection rates in grass populations with lower levels of genetic variability. In fact, the fungal infection rates of E. festucae in relation to genetic variability of the host populations varied widely among geographical areas, which indicate differences in population histories due to colonization events and possible costs of systemic fungi in harsh environmental conditions. We found that the plants of different ploidy levels are genetically closely related within geographic areas indicating independent formation of polyploids in different maternal lineages.

Evaluating predator management efficacy is difficult, especially when resources are limited. Carefully designing monitoring programs in advance is critical for data collection that is sufficient to evaluate management success and to inform decisions. Aims. The aim was to investigate how the design of camera trap studies can affect the ability to reliably detect changes in red fox (Vulpes vulpes) activity over space and time. Specifically, to examine the effect of study duration, camera cost and detection zone under various environmental and management scenarios, including different fox densities, management impacts, monitoring budgets and levels of spatial and temporal variation. Methods. A generalised linear mixed model was used to analyse simulated datasets from control sites and sites with predator management actions implemented, following a before-after or control-impact sampling design. Statistical power analyses were conducted to evaluate whether a change in fox abundance could be detected across various environmental and management scenarios. Key results. Results showed that a before-after sampling design is less sensitive than a control-impact sampling design to the number of cameras used for monitoring. However, a before-after sampling design requires a longer monitoring period to achieve a satisfactory level of power, due to higher sensitivity to study duration. Given a fixed budget, there can be a trade-off between purchasing a small number of high quality cameras with large detection zones, or a larger number of cameras with smaller detection zones. In a control-impact design we found that if spatial heterogeneity was high, a larger number of cameras with smaller detection zones provided more power to detect a difference in fox abundance. Conclusion. This simulation-based approach demonstrates the importance of exploring various monitoring designs to detect the effect of predator management across plausible environmental and budgetary scenarios. Implications. The present study informs the monitoring design of an adaptive management program that aims to understand the role of managing fox predation on malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata), a threatened Australian bird. Furthermore, this approach provides a useful guide for developing cost-effective camera trap monitoring studies to assess efficacy of conservation management programs. Power analyses are an essential step for designing efficient monitoring, and indicate the strength of ecological signals that can realistically be detected through the noise of spatial and temporal heterogeneity under various budgetary constraints.

Feral-horse impacts on corroboree frog habitat in the Australian Alps	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						amphibian; Equus caballus; introduced herbivores; large ungulates; wetlands	EXOTIC HERBIVORES; VEGETATION; CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS; FORESTS; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY; COMMUNITY; ECOSYSTEM; DECLINES	Context. Introduced herbivores can have a substantial impact on native plants and animals, particularly in ecosystems that do not share a recent evolutionary history with similar herbivore species. The feral horse, Equus caballus, has a widespread but patchy distribution in Australia, with large populations present in national parks in the Australian Alps. There are few peer-reviewed studies of the impacts of feral horses on ecosystems in this region. However, impacts could be substantial, particularly in wetland and riparian environments that are focal points for horse activity and sensitive to trampling and physical disturbance. Aims. In the present study, we used replicated horse exclosures to investigate the effects of feral horses on breeding habitat of the critically endangered northern corroboree frog, Pseudophryne pengilleyi, in the Australian Alps. Methods. Pseudophryne pengilleyi constructs nests and lays eggs in dense litter surrounding small, seasonally flooded wetland pools. In 2010, we sampled the litter depth adjacent to pools at eight long-term P. pengilleyi monitoring sites. In 2011, horse exclosures were established at each of the eight sites, such that less than half of the wetland area was inside the exclosure. In 2015, we measured litter depth surrounding pools inside and outside the exclosures, as well as at three additional sites where feral horses were absent. Key results. Wefound that the pool-edge litter was 1.9 times deeper in areas without horses (inside horse-exclosure plots and horse-free sites) than in areas accessible to horses (unfenced areas in horse-occupied sites). Conclusions. Our study has presented experimental evidence that horse grazing and trampling reduce breeding-habitat quality for P. pengilleyi, which could result in reduced reproduction success. Implications. Ensuring the persistence of high-quality habitat is crucial for the conservation of P. pengilleyi, particularly given the severity of the decline of this species associated with chytrid fungus. Our results have provided direct evidence of a negative feral-horse impact on the habitat of a threatened animal species in the Australian Alps.	[Foster, C. N.; Scheele, B.

Four genera of adult fish were sampled (Myripristis spp., Siganus spp., Eptnephelus merra and Cheilopogon minus) from different trophic guilds around the tropical island of Moorea, French Polynesia. Digestive tracts from 133 adult fish were surveyed and microplastics were found in 28 tracts (21%). Abundance of ingested microplastic pieces per individual fish varied from 1 to 3 pieces, with an average of 1.25 +/- 0.13 ingested microplastic pieces. Microplastics size ranged from 0.031 to 2.44 mm and 70% of microplastics did not exceed 0.3 mm in size. Overall, this study shows that the number and size of microplastic ingested per trophic groups are independent of trophic guild. Additional studies are needed to sample in other tropical regions in order to have a better assessment of microplastic occurrence in coral reefs.

The effects of brine (0%, 50%, 100%) were compared to seawater treatments with the same salinity (37, 46, 54 psu) for seagrass (Posidonia australis) in mesocosms over 2 weeks. There were significant differences between brine and salinity treatments for photosynthesis, water relations and growth. Germinating seedlings of P. australis were also tested in brine treatments (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%) over 7 weeks followed by 2.5 weeks recovery in seawater. Growth was severely inhibited only in 100% brine. These experiments demonstrated that brine increased the speed and symptoms of stress in adult plants compared to treatments with the same salinity, whereas seedlings tolerated far longer brine exposure, and so could potentially contribute to seagrass recovery through recruitment.

The high DIN values were consistently distributed in the western inshore waters, mainly determined by terrestrial factors, e.g., riverine input, while DIP and DSi were mostly distributed in the southern coastal waters, the central BHB, or near the sea port Caofeidian in northern BHB, largely related to non-terrestrial factors, e.g., sediment release. Based on the nutrient distribution, BHB could be partitioned into western and eastern parts, with -15 m depth as the separation. The long-term variations of nutrients since 2000 showed an increase in DIN and decreases in DIP and DSi. Relatively slow changes in DIN and DIP and a rapid decrease in DSi were exhibited in summer, which was associated with precipitation and sediment release.

Three sites (at 500, 1000, and 2000 m off the coast) were sampled along three parallel transects in 2013, 2014 (before), and 2015 (after the flood). After the flood, metals (especially Al, Cr-VI, Ni, Cu, Zn) in the water column increased in concentration. The flood affected the structure of the benthic community, causing a decrease of diversity, the dominance of few opportunistic species, and the decrease of M-AMBI values.

Experimental trait mismatches uncover specificity of evolutionary links between multiple signaling traits and their interactions in hummingbirds	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Angle-dependent structural plumage; bee hummingbirds; courtship; coloration; shuttle display	NORTHERN CARDINALS; COURTSHIP DISPLAYS; COLOR; PLUMAGE; ORNAMENTS; COSTS; DIRECTIONALITY; ENVIRONMENT; SONATIONS; DESIGN	Many animal signals co-occur, and these signals may coevolve due to their interactive properties. Previous work has demonstrated ecological drivers of evolutionary relationships between signals and the environment, which leads to questions about why specific signal pairs evolved among species that possess multiple signals. We asked whether the coloration of different species was optimized for presentation with its natural behavioral display. We investigated this in "bee" hummingbirds, where males exhibit angle-dependent structurally-colored plumage and a stereotyped courtship (shuttle) display, by experimentally creating mismatches between the behavior and plumage of five species and quantifying how these mismatches influenced male color appearance during a display. Specifically, we photographed the plumage from a given species as we moved its feathers through the position-and-orientation-specific courtship display path of other species and quantified the resulting color appearance during the display in order to compare the mismatched color appearance to each species' natural color appearance. We found that mismatches significantly altered display flashiness (% change in coloration during displays) compared to the natural plumage-behavior pairings, and that such departures in flashiness were predicted by differences in shuttle behaviors alone. These results illustrate a tight evolutionary relationship between shuttle displays and color flashiness in these hummingbirds. Further, we found that interspecific variation in male plumage, behavior, and natural color appearance predicted deviations between natural and mismatched flashy color appearance. Altogether, our work provides a new method for testing signal coevolution and highlights the complex evolutionary relationships between multiple signals and their interactions.

Therefore, quantifying the sources of morphological (co)variation, dependent and independent of body size, is of key importance when trying to understand and predict responses to selection. We combine structural equation modeling with quantitative genetics analyses to study morphological (co)variation in a meta-population of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). As expected, we found evidence of a latent variable "body size," causing genetic and environmental covariation between morphological traits. Estimates of conditional evolvability show that allometric relationships constrain the independent evolution of house sparrow morphology. We also found spatial differences in general body size and its allometric relationships. On islands where birds are more dispersive and mobile, individuals were smaller and had proportionally longer wings for their body size. Although on islands where sparrows are more sedentary and nest in dense colonies, individuals were larger and had proportionally longer tarsi for their body size. We corroborated these results using simulations and show that our analyses produce unbiased allometric slope estimates. This study highlights that in the short term allometric relationships may constrain phenotypic evolution, but that in the long term selection pressures can also shape allometric relationships.

Benefits of EPP may be only available to specific individuals or under certain conditions. Red-winged fairy-wrens have extremely high levels of EPP, suggesting fitness benefits might be large and available to most individuals. Furthermore, extreme philopatry commonly leads to incestuous social pairings, so inbreeding avoidance may be an important selection pressure. Here, we quantified the fitness benefits of EPP under varying conditions and across life-stages. Extra-pair offspring (EPO) did not appear to have higher fitness than within-pair offspring (WPO), neither in poor years nor in the absence of helpers-at-the-nest. However, EPP was beneficial for closely related social pairs, because inbred WPO suffered an overall 75% reduction in fitness. Inbreeding depression was nonlinear and reduced nestling body condition, first year survival and reproductive success. Our comprehensive study indicates that EPP should be favored for the 17% of females paired incestuously, but cannot explain the widespread infidelity in this species. Furthermore, our finding that fitness benefits of EPP only become apparent for a small part of the population could potentially explain the apparent absence of fitness differences in population wide comparisons of EPO and WPO.

Establishing if such convergent phenotypes arose through convergent evolutionary pathways is a stronger test of determinism. We studied the evolution of snake-like body shapes in six clades of lizards, each containing species ranging from short-bodied and pentadactyl to long-bodied and limbless. We tested whether body shapes that evolved in each clade were convergent, and whether clades evolved snake-like body shapes following convergent evolutionary pathways. Our analyses showed that indeed species with the same numbers of digits in each clade evolved convergent body shapes. We then compared evolutionary pathways among clades by considering patterns of evolutionary integration and shape of relationship among body parts, patterns of vertebral evolution, and models of digit evolution. We found that all clades elongated their bodies through the addition, not elongation, of vertebrae, and had similar patterns of integration. However, patterns of integration, the body parts that were related by a linear or a threshold model, and patterns of digit evolution differed among clades. These results showed that clades followed different evolutionary pathways. This suggests an important role of historical contingency as opposed to determinism in the convergent evolution of snake-like body shapes.

Evolutionary pathways toward gigantism in sharks and rays	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Body size; elasmobranchs; evolution; filter feeding; gigantism; mesothermy	BODY-SIZE; LAMNIFORM SHARK; BONY FISHES; MIOCENE; ENDOTHERMY; FOSSILS; WHALE; WARM; TEMPERATURES; PERFORMANCE	Through elasmobranch (sharks and rays) evolutionary history, gigantism evolved multiple times in phylogenetically distant species, some of which are now extinct. Interestingly, the world's largest elasmobranchs display two specializations found never to overlap: filter feeding and mesothermy. The contrasting lifestyles of elasmobranch giants provide an ideal case study to elucidate the evolutionary pathways leading to gigantism in the oceans. Here, we applied a phylogenetic approach to a global dataset of 459 taxa to study the evolution of elasmobranch gigantism. We found that filter feeders and mesotherms deviate from general relationships between trophic level and body size, and exhibit significantly larger sizes than ectothermic-macropredators. We confirm that filter feeding arose multiple times during the Paleogene, and suggest the possibility of a single origin of mesothermy in the Cretaceous. Together, our results elucidate two main evolutionary pathways that enable gigantism: mesothermic and filter feeding. These pathways were followed by ancestrally large clades and facilitated extreme sizes through specializations for enhancing prey intake. Although a negligible percentage of ectothermic-macropredators reach gigantic sizes, these species lack such specializations and are correspondingly constrained to the lower limits of gigantism. Importantly, the very adaptive strategies that enabled the evolution of the largest sharks can also confer high extinction susceptibility.

A human-induced landscape of fear influences foraging behavior of brown bears	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Brown bears; Bilberries; Foraging behavior; Human induced mortality; Hunting; Landscape of fear; Ursus arctos; Vaccinium myrtillus	BILBERRY VACCINIUM-MYRTILLUS; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; HABITAT SELECTION; PREDATION RISK; URSUS-ARCTOS; FOREST; POPULATION; PATTERNS; STRATEGY; WOLVES	Animals adapt their foraging behavior to variations in food availability and predation risk. In Sweden, brown bears (Ursus arctos) depend on a nearly continuous intake of berries, especially bilberries (Vaccinium myrtilius) during late summer and early autumn to fatten up prior to hibernation. This overlaps with the bear hunting season that starts on 21 August. Bilberry occurrence varies across space, as does human-induced mortality risk. Here, we hypothesize that brown bears select for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence across a boreal forest ecosystem in Sweden (H1), and that human-induced mortality risk reduces bear selection for bilberries (H2). In addition, we hypothesized that hears that survived the hunting season avoided bilberry areas associated with high risk, whereas bears that were later killed selected more strongly for berries and less against risk prior to the hunting season (H3). To evaluate our hypotheses, we used resource selection functions to contrast bear GPS relocation data (N = 3 5, 2012-2015) and random positions within the bears home range with generalized linear mixed effect models against two focal variables: a map predicting bilberry occurrence and a map predicting human-induced mortality risk. We found that bears selected for areas with a high probability of bilberry occurrence (supporting H1), but avoided these areas if they were associated with and high risk of hunting mortality (supporting H2). The killed and surviving bears did not differ in their selection for bilberries, hut they did differ in their selection against risk (partially supporting H3). Surviving bears strongly avoided high risk areas, whereas killed hears responded less to risk and selected for high-risk areas with a low probability of bilberry occurrence. This suggests that killed bears selected for other food sources than berries in high risk areas, which exposed them to human hunters. We conclude that bears respond to a landscape of fear during the berry season and that different foraging strategies may have a direct impact on individual mortality during the hunting season.

Such declines have been attributed to a range of factors that act in tandem, rather than in isolation. Some of the most pervasive factors affecting pollinator populations are habitat loss and degradation, which results in the loss of floral resources, nesting sites and landscape connectivity. Intensification of agriculture and urbanisation are two major causes of such habitat alterations. Hedgerows and grasslands are two vital habitats for pollinators in European landscapes. When managed appropriately, these habitats may provide abundant floral resources and nesting opportunities, as well as connectivity between habitats in a fragmented landscape. This study examined the effects that management practices of hedgerows and grasslands may have on bumblebee species, an important group of wild pollinators. Bumblebee abundance was recorded using transect walks in managed and unmanaged sites, including both hedgerows and grasslands. Greater densities of bumblebees were found in unmanaged grasslands in comparison to managed grasslands. Unmanaged hedgerows were also found to have a greater density of bumblebees than managed hedgerows. These results indicate that sites which are less intensively managed provide a more suitable habitat for bumblebees. Therefore, our study underlines the importance of (a) enforcing restrictions on hedge-cutting, and (b) reducing the management intensity of grasslands to provide adequate habitat for pollinators.

In this way, it becomes possible to make meaningful comparisons among ecosystems and communities and to predict how plant communities might respond to changes in their environment. Here, we classified common alpine plants which occur in snowpatches (Early and Late snowmelt sites) and in adjacent vegetation (Snow-free sites which melt early in the growing season) using Grime's CSR plant strategy scheme. Alpine plant communities are largely driven by environmental filters associated with a relatively constant gradient of snowmelt timing. Since snow persistence influences the abiotic environment and plant assemblages alike, we hypothesised that these patterns would be reflected in community CSR scores. Weighted community CSR scores were clustered towards the stress-tolerator (S) corner of the triangular CSR space, and Snow-free communities were significantly more stress-tolerant than Early and Late snowmelt communities. This suggests that snowpatch communities are functionally distinct from surrounding vegetation when considering the major axes of plant variation identified by CSR theory. These results lend further support to the importance of the timing of snowmelt as a key filter, influencing how species and plant strategy types distribute themselves across the alpine landscape.

Asian temperate forests are inhabited by distinct frugivores, namely, large tree-climbing mammals such as bears and macaques, suggesting that fruits and frugivore assemblages may vary from those of other temperate forests. Our aim here was to systematically analyze the characteristics of fruits consumed by four dominant frugivorous mammals in Japanese temperate forests and to clarify the fruit palatability or preference of each species by comparing the fruit consumption patterns of the frugivores. We collected fruit feeding records of Asian black bear, Japanese marten, raccoon dog and Japanese macaque, as well as detailed information on the characteristics of the fruits consumed. Among the 299 fruit species recorded, the size, color and type of fruits consumed by bears and macaques were similar, and the fruiting season and life form of plants bearing fruits consumed by bears, macaques and raccoon dogs were similar. However, the characteristics of fruits consumed by martens were different. The ability to climb trees, body weight and manual dexterity may influence these differences.

The majority of these plans are limited in time by budget constraints and lack postintervention monitoring of population trends. This study was conducted in south-west Portugal and aimed to understand the effect of habitat management and its early cessation on rabbit populations. We assessed rabbit presence and relative abundance before management (2007), during the implementation of measures (2008), immediately after (2009) and 3 years after measures ended (2012). We applied a model selection approach, using generalized linear models to determine the relative importance of MANAGED and UNMANAGED habitat features on rabbit presence in each year. We used spatial eigenvector mapping to describe the spatial autocorrelation in rabbit presence and a variation partitioning approach to quantify the relative effects of management-related variables, unmanaged environmental descriptors and spatial characteristics on rabbit presence. Rabbit presence and abundance increased shortly after the management intervention but decreased 3 years after. Rabbit presence was positively related to the proximity of installed crops and the existence of favorable soils for digging. Habitat management-related variables explained most of the variation in all models. Habitat improvement actions, particularly the sowing of pastures, contributed to increased rabbit presence. We propose a continued long-term intervention and the cultivation of crops with auto-regeneration properties (e.g., subterranean cloverTrifolium subterraneum) with the aim of continuing to increase rabbit presence and abundance in areas where rabbit populations are scarce.

The spatially distinct Caucasian grouse (CG) (Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi) populations across discontinuous range in the Caucasus Mountains would likely possess different adaptation traits which are of importance for conservation management. Using a separate distribution model for each of four different regions with the MaxEnt technique, we investigated if CG's functional responses to habitat features differ between the core and peripheral populations and thus, the occurrence-habitat relationships could be better explained by region-specific models than a single, range-wide model. We validated the models using each region as a geographically independent dataset. The results revealed that although there was a similar response to elevation in the four regions and the species occurrence probability was highest at altitude about 2,500m, there was a consistently higher mean annual temperature in the species' southeastern Lesser Caucasus range compared to the western and eastern parts of the Greater Caucasus region (p<0.001). The southeastern population of CG was living under separate and unique climate conditions and did not share the same affinity to climate conditions as CG elsewhere; this may lead the species to be adapted this special climate condition through phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation. Long-term evolutionary studies are essential to confirm CG intra-specific variations, but in lack of knowledge of local adaptation, our recommendation is to treat CG as geographically distinct populations that may each require specific management. We investigated if Caucasian grouse (CG)'s functional responses to habitat features differ between the core and peripheral populations and thus, the occurrence-habitat relationships could be explained by region-specific models. Our study indicated that the southeastern population of CG is living under separately and unique climate conditions and does not share the same affinity to climate conditions as CG elsewhere; this may lead the species to be locally adapted this special climate condition through phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation.

In this light, we studied the relationships between the flocks' size of Mareca penelope and the distribution of three seagrass species (Cymodocea nodosa, Zoostera marina and Nanozostera noltei) occurring in the Marano and Grado lagoon (Northern Adriatic Sea). Twelve bird monitoring areas were monthly surveyed for 3 years whereas seagrass distribution data were collected for the whole lagoon in the following years. The overall number of individuals of M. penelope was related to seagrass meadow extension and species cover by using a multiscale approach in four circle buffers (with radius of 500, 750, 1,000 and 1,250m). Among the considered scales, the 750m radius scale showed the best performance. The overall number of M. penelope increased where the occupied area by seagrass meadows was larger. Results also showed that when C. nodosa mean percentage cover increased the number of M. penelope decreased, while if N. noltei mean percentage cover increased also M. penelope number increased. Z. marina showed a negligible influence for all the tested scales. Our findings demonstrate that M. penelope populations depend not only on the extension of seagrass meadows but also on their species assembly, evidencing that M. penelope seem to prefer N. noltei stands, avoiding meadows with high abundance of C. nodosa.

However, some chemicals produced by macrophytes harm zooplankton. Trapa japonica, a common annual floating-leaved macrophyte, commonly occurs in Asian shallow and eutrophic lakes. In this study, we conducted preliminary evaluation of the adverse effects of T. japonica leaf extracts on Daphnia magna survival. Specifically, we investigated the effects of lake water to D. magna in relation to T. japonica abundance. The effect of littoral water samples peaked when the density of the macrophyte leaves began to decline. These findings coincided with those of acute immobilization tests of leaf extracts that had substances from leaves in the early yellowing stage showed strongest effect to the cladocerans, D. magna and Scapholeberis kingi. Moreover, the ion composition and amount of each ion varied depending on the leaf stage. Additionally, the multimodel inference approach showed that leaf extract effects depend on the total amount of the chemicals. Our findings indicate that the littoral macrophytes have unintended effects on zooplankton due to those differential decomposition.

However, they are extremely sensitive to disturbance and attempts to facilitate their recovery have had variable success. In this study, we applied soil amendments designed to improve soil surface stability and accelerate biocrust recovery on an area disturbed by oil/gas exploration vehicles. Treatments included: (1) control (one time water only); (2) biocrust-only: biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (3) polyacrylamide gels (which are known to stabilize soils) + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (4) gypsum + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; and (5) saline (NaCl) solution + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water. Only the NaCl treatment showed any effects on soil properties and these were only short term. These effects included an increase in soil strength and a reduction in soil aggregate stability, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-h), and cyanobacterial biomass. The inoculated biocrust material failed to develop and even after 10 years, there was only a very low natural recolonization of the plots. These results show that inoculating soils or applying these levels of soil amendments does not guarantee recovery of soil stability or biocrust, and that some sites are unlikely to recover without assistance. Thus, there is a need for more research into ways to enhance soil stability and identify the factors limiting biocrust establishment.

This alteration of soil properties can in turn affect the establishment of plant species. We evaluated relationships among the extent of soil erosion, soil chemical properties, and the distribution of plant species in grassland ecosystems after goat eradication on Nakodo-jima Island in the northwestern Pacific. In 105 1 x 1-m quadrats, changes were measured in the position of topsoil over 2 years. Surface soils were sampled for analysis of chemical properties, and plant species in the quadrat were recorded. Changes in the position of topsoil were related to the area of bare ground. Soil loss occurred at sites where areas of bare ground were extremely large. Significantly higher values of soil exchange acidity and smaller amounts of available phosphorus, total carbon, and total nitrogen were detected in soils at sites with large soil losses. Most of the 11 dominant plant species were absent from sites with large losses of soil. The presence of eight species was significantly negatively related to soil exchange acidity, and three species were significantly positively related to available phosphorus. Our results indicated that exposure of subsoils at the soil surface after vegetation degradation can increase soil loss, which can alter soil chemical properties, and this alteration can continue to limit the establishment of plant species, even long after goat eradication.

Cover soil, comprising the upper 15-30 cm of the surface material on sites scheduled for mining, is commonly salvaged prior to mining and used directly or stockpiled for various lengths of time until it is needed. Salvaging and stockpiling causes physical, chemical, and biological changes in cover soils. In particular, stockpiling reduces the availability and vigor of vegetative propagules and seed, and can lead to increases in the abundance of some weedy species. This study uses data from monitoring plots to assess how stockpiling of cover soil impacts plant community development on reclaimed oil sands mine sites in northern Alberta. Development of plant communities differed distinctly between directly placed and stockpiled cover soil treatments even 18 years after reclamation. Direct placement of cover soil resulted in higher percent cover, species richness, and diversity. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and multiresponse permutation procedure revealed compositional differentiation between the treatments. Indicator species analysis showed that direct placement treatment was dominated by perennial species while grasses and annual forb species dominated sites where stockpiled soil was used. Results indicate that stockpiling leads to slower vegetation recovery while direct placement of cover soil supports more rapid succession (from ruderal and annual communities to perennial communities). In addition, direct placement may be less costly than stockpiling. However, scheduling of salvage and placement remains a challenge.

We evaluated the effect of transgenic American chestnut (Castanea dentata) leaf litter on the growth and survival of larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), a forest-dwelling amphibian species widely sympatric with American chestnut, that forage almost entirely on periphyton and litter detritus that accumulate in temporary vernal pools in forests. We reared wood frog larvae on Castanea leaf litter (American chestnut genetically engineered for blight tolerance, nontransgenic American chestnut, Chinese chestnut [Castanea mollissima], and an American-Chinese chestnut hybrid) and litter from two non-Castanea, nontransgenic control tree species, coupled with two levels of supplementary food. We observed no differences in growth or survival of wood frog larvae reared on transgenic versus nontransgenic American chestnut leaves. Without supplementary food, wood frog larvae provided leaves from American chestnut (both types) developed faster and grew larger than those exposed to other leaf litter treatments. Results of this study provide preliminary evidence that (1) American chestnut may have formerly been an important source of food for forest-dwelling amphibians and (2) transgenic American chestnut litter generated as part of chestnut restoration efforts is unlikely to present direct novel risks to developing amphibian larvae in the forest environment.

Plant community responses to bison reintroduction on the Northern Great Plains, United States: a test of the keystone species concept	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bison; keystone species restoration; livestock removal; mixed-grass prairie; Northern Great Plains; plant communities	TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; BETA-DIVERSITY; TROPHIC CASCADES; LONG-TERM; CONSERVATION; HERBIVORES; VEGETATION; AMERICAN; CATTLE; HETEROGENEITY	Keystone species restoration, or the restoration of species whose effect on an ecosystem is much greater than their abundance would suggest, is a central justification for many wildlife reintroduction projects globally. Following restoration, plains bison (Bison bison L.) have been identified as a keystone species in the tallgrass prairie ecoregion, but we know of no research to document similar effects in the mixed-grass prairie where restoration efforts are ongoing. This study addresses whether Northern Great Plains (NGP) mixed-grass prairie plant communities exhibit traits consistent with four central keystone effects documented for bison in the tallgrass prairie. We collected species composition, diversity, abundance, bare ground cover, and plant height data in three treatments: where livestock (Bos taurus L.) continuously grazed, livestock were removed for 10 years, and bison have been introduced and resident for 10 years. We observed mixed support for bison acting as keystone species in this system. Supporting the keystone role of bison, we observed higher species richness and compositional heterogeneity (-diversity) in the bison treatment than either the livestock retention or livestock removal treatments. However, we observed comparable forb, bare ground, and plant height heterogeneity between bison-restored sites and sites where livestock were retained, contradicting reported keystone effects in other systems. Our results suggest that after 10 years of being restored, bison partially fulfill their role as a keystone species in the mixed-grass prairie, and we encourage continued long-term data collection to evaluate their influence in the NGP.

Rehabilitation efforts to stabilize reef substratum sufficiently to support coral growth have been limited in size. We documented a large coral reef rehabilitation in Indonesia aiming to restore ecosystem functions by increasing live coral cover on a reef severely damaged by blast fishing and coral mining. The project deployed small, modular, open structures to stabilize rubble and to support transplanted coral fragments. Between 2013 to 2015, approximately 11,000 structures covering 7,000 m(2) were deployed over 2 ha of a reef at a cost of US$174,000. Live coral cover on the structures increased from less than 10% initially to greater than 60% depending on depth, deployment date and location, and disturbances. The mean live coral cover in the rehabilitation area in October 2017 was higher than reported for reefs in many other areas in the Coral Triangle, including marine protected areas, but lower than in the no-take reference reef. At least 42 coral species were observed growing on the structures. Surprisingly, during the massive coral bleaching in other regions during the 2014-2016 El Nino-Southern Oscillation event, bleaching in the rehabilitation area was less than 5% cover despite warm water (30 degrees C). This project demonstrates that coral rehabilitation is achievable over large scales where coral reefs have been severely damaged and are under continuous anthropogenic disturbances in warming waters.

Intuitive interpretation of model parameters and simplicity are some of the main characteristics of mechanistic models. Another possibility is the use of statistical models, which have their advantages but are not easy to interpret. The state-space model (SSM), also known as a mechanistic time series model, incorporates the beneficial aspects of both mechanistic and statistical models. This study introduces a SSM for Ae. aegypti ovitrap data to estimate latent state and static parameters, making suitable analysis of the data. The estimation of static and state parameters is easy to achieve in this framework. A simulation study is performed to study some properties of the estimators for the parameters. The model is also applied to Ae. aegypti trap data and highlights its importance and potential for the real trap data sets. The results show that the proposed SSM has good performance and the parameters can be reasonably estimated.

Transient Grazing and the Dynamics of an Unanticipated Coral-Algal Phase Shift	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						coral reefs; regime shift; macroalgal proliferation; Lobophora spp; herbivorous fish; grazing escape; transient dynamics; recovery process; mechanistic simulation	HERBIVOROUS FISHES; REGIME SHIFTS; REEF; RESILIENCE; COMMUNITIES; SUSCEPTIBILITY; RECRUITMENT; SENSITIVITY; DISTURBANCE; ECOSYSTEMS	Extreme disturbances often lead to community reorganisations, yet sometimes ecosystems unexpectedly fail to recover. Such surprising outcomes may pinpoint important yet overlooked mechanisms that drive ecosystems into undesirable states. Using long-term field observations, experimental manipulations and mechanistic modelling, we document the drivers of an unexpected phase shift from coral to macroalgal dominance following typhoon disturbance on reefs in Palau (Micronesia). After extensive coral mortality, an ephemeral bloom of a canopy-forming macroalga (Liagora sp.) provided physical refuge from herbivore grazing, resulting in the establishment of a secondary, understory macroalga (Lobophora spp.). After disappearance of Liagora canopies and resulting loss of grazing refuge, the Lobophora patches continued to expand and led to a macroalgal (Lobophora-) dominated state that has persisted for more than 2years. We developed a mechanistic model of Lobophora patch dynamics parameterised with rates of growth measured in situ to simulate the observed proliferation of Lobophora under variable grazing refuges in space and time. Model simulations showed that short-term escapes from grazing were pivotal in allowing establishment of patches of Lobophora. Ephemeral grazing refuges created an opportunity to reach a cover above which Lobophora growth exceeds grazing, so that Lobophora could expand after disappearance of Liagora canopies. Critically, in the absence of grazing refuge, herbivore biomass was sufficient to prevent the establishment of Lobophora patches. Our model demonstrates that with rapid algal growth and low grazing, a relatively minor grazing refuge (6month) is sufficient to escape herbivore control after extensive coral mortality, leading to unexpected recovery failure. Transient fluctuations in the intensity of control mechanisms, such as herbivore grazing, can have disproportionate and long-lasting effects on community structure. Overall, this study stresses that our perception of reef dynamics must integrate the time scales at which reefs can be sensitive to transient changes in mechanisms promoting coral dominance.

However, direct evidence of N-induced SOC sequestration from low-dose, long-term N addition experiments (that is, addition of<50kgNha(-1)y(-1) for>10years) is scarce worldwide and virtually absent for European temperate forests. Here, we examine how tree growth, fine roots, physicochemical soil properties as well as pools of SOC and soil total N responded to 20years of regular, low-dose N addition in two European coniferous forests in Switzerland and Denmark. At the Swiss site, the addition of 22kgNha(-1)y(-1) (or 1.3 times throughfall deposition) stimulated tree growth, but decreased soil pH and exchangeable calcium. At the Danish site, the addition of 35kgNha(-1)y(-1) (1.5 times throughfall deposition) impaired tree growth, increased fine root biomass and led to an accumulation of N in several belowground pools. At both sites, elevated N inputs increased SOC pools in the moderately decomposed organic horizons, but decreased them in the mineral topsoil. Hence, long-term N addition led to a vertical redistribution of SOC pools, whereas overall SOC storage within 30cm depth was unaffected. Our results imply that an N-induced shift of SOC from older, mineral-associated pools to younger, unprotected pools might foster the vulnerability of SOC in temperate coniferous forest soils.

The apparent solubility in a synthetic lung lining fluid (Hatch's solution) was used as proxy for the bio-accessibility. The Hatch solubility of the different elements was highly variable with a median <1% for Al, Fe, Pb, Ti, between 4 and 6% for Co, Cr, Ni, V, W, between 13 and 27% for Cd, Cu, Mn, Zn, and 41% for Mo. For many elements, the solubility varied over a wide range of several tens of percent. The welding techniques used influenced the solubility of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and V significantly. The plants investigated (i.e., the welded materials and used electrodes) had a significant influence on the solubility of Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, V and W. According to principal component analysis (PCA), the variation in solubility can be described by four components, which explain 69% of the variance. The first principal component mostly comprises elements that can predominantly occur as divalent cations, the second principal component elements often forming oxyanions. The principal components are independent of the absolute value of the Hatch solubility. The results of PCA indicate that the co-variation of Hatch solubility is mainly controlled by the most soluble compounds in contrast to the absolute value of apparent solubility, which is strongly influenced by the distribution of the elements between compounds with different equilibrium solubilities. The observed large variability and the significant differences between welding techniques and plants clearly show that the bio-accessibility cannot be obtained from the literature but has to be studied experimentally at each location of interest.

PM2.5 has as its main origin vehicular emissions, a characteristic source in megacities. In order to predict pollution episodes in different areas (rural, industrial, and urban), two models were applied, Holt-Winters (HW) and artificial neural network (ANN), using PM2.5 concentration time series. PM2.5 samples were collected using Hi-Vol samplers during a period of 24h, every 6days, from January 2011 to December 2013, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Meteorological data was also obtained for use in the models. The PM2.5 dataset was the longest obtained for this megacity and the Holt-Winters (HW) model was used, for the first time, to predict air quality. The results of the PM2.5 data series showed daily concentrations ranging from 1 to 65gm(-3). The root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for each model for the three sites. The HW model best explained the simulation of PM2.5 in the industrial area, since it presented the lowest RMSE (5.8 to 14.9gm(-3)). The ANN was the most appropriate model for urban and rural areas with RMSE between 4.2 to 9.3gm(-3). Overall, both forecast models proved accurate enough to be considered useful tools for air quality management and can be applied in other world regions.

Measuring heterogeneity in urban expansion via spatial entropy	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						categorical variables; environmental heterogeneity; spatial entropy; urban sprawl	SPRAWL; INDEXES	The lack of efficiency in urban diffusion is a debated issue, important for biologists, urban specialists, planners and statisticians, both in developed and new developing countries. Many approaches have been considered to measure urban sprawl, roughly identified as chaotic urban expansion; such idea of chaos is here linked to the concept of entropy. Entropy, firstly introduced in information theory, has rapidly become a standard tool in ecology, biology, and geography to measure the degree of heterogeneity among observations; in such contexts, entropy measures should include spatial information. The aim of this paper is to employ a rigorous spatial entropy-based approach to measure urban sprawl associated to the diffusion of metropolitan cities. In order to assess the performance of the considered measures, a comparative study is run over archetypical urban scenarios; afterwards, measures are used to quantify the degree of disorder in the urban expansion of three cities in Europe. Results are easily interpretable and can be used both as absolute measures of urban sprawl and for comparison over space and time.

In conducting this study, we used unpublished data from sampling campaigns performed in the past. Triplicate benthic sediment samples were taken at each station using a bottom grab and according to sampling protocols equal to the current ones. Benthic taxa were identified at the species and genus levels. According to our results, a protracted effect by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon on benthic fauna structure was evident. This effect was observed not only in the confluences but also all along the rivers, reflecting its ecological effect at least 1.5years after its occurrence. Thus, the ENSO effect on benthic organisms should not be treated like a physical action-reaction but rather as an ecological relationship with lag periods (ecological inertia) after its occurrence. On the other hand, one of the studied confluences was categorized as a hydro-geomorphic patch along the river channel, resulting from shifts in hydraulic and sedimentological conditions, which are explained by local morphological features. This hydro-geomorphic patch created a critical site of abrupt changes in ecological patterns, enhancing the biodiversity of the river system. However, this hydro-geomorphic patch was not detected in another anabranch confluence, where the benthic assemblage was comparable with that recorded in straight sections. Accordingly, we concluded that the mere presence of an anabranch confluence is not a sufficient reason to assume enhancing local habitat heterogeneity or biodiversity.	[Blettler, Martin C.

Fine-scale vegetation mosaics in Pyrenean mires are driven by complex hydrological regimes and threatened by extreme weather events	ECOHYDROLOGY			English	Article						alpine mountains; bryophyte communities; environmental gradients; habitat disturbance; mires; protected areas; Pyrenees; vascular plant communities	ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS; WATER-TABLE; PLANT; DIVERSITY; NORTH; ENCROACHMENT; CHEMISTRY; FEEDBACK; SWEDISH; DEPTH	Holarctic mires are systems of great ecological value and limited alpine distribution. Their southernmost European boundary borders the Mediterranean region. Understanding how environmental factors influence the plant community distribution and its response to disturbances, especially in the water regime, is a key step for their management and conservation. Here, we report our study of the main ecological gradients that determine the distribution of different plant community types in the Trescuro mire system and their response to variations in the environmental conditions such as summer drought. We set up 30 sampling points across the vegetation mosaic where pH, electrical conductivity, water table depth, and ion concentration were recorded during the 2014 and 2015 summers. The results revealed that variation in the water table level is what most drives the vegetation distribution at the local scale, followed by the ion concentration. Soligenous communities, which are highly dependent on water run-off, were the most affected by the drought event in 2015. Because these communities are generally situated in the marginal parts of mire systems, summer drought periods may facilitate invasion by trees into the areas they occupy, which may eventually lead to a reduction of mire area. This study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of these unique and complex systems through elucidating the relationship between the vegetation and climatic variations.

The condition of the ecosystem results not only from the occurrence of extreme events, such as floods and droughts but also from habitat availability and from its temporal variation. Describing the relationships between macroinvertebrate community characteristics and environmental gradients of flow, temperature, nutrient supplies, and habitat conditions is fundamental to understand ecological dynamics. This is the basis for predicting changes within the communities and in ecosystem functions and ultimately to properly manage and conserve the riverine ecosystems. Seven sites, along a 20-km river sector, were surveyed for macroinvertebrates and water chemistry seasonally, from 2012 to 2016. Habitat conditions were assessed along a 500-m stretch in each site. The river discharge was continuously monitored by two water level recorders and used to reconstruct various hydrological indices specific for each sampling location. During the sampling period, numerous high flow events and some prolonged periods of low flow were observed. Quantile regression was used to describe the effects of potential limiting factors on macroinvertebrate community, which were primarily driven by antecedent flow conditions and season whereas habitat conditions and water chemistry played only a minor role. Quantitative models have been developed to predict structural and functional characteristics of macroinvertebrate community as a function of antecedent flow conditions, habitat, and physicochemical water characteristics. Those models allow to identify the main drivers and predict the effect of different water management strategies to riverine ecosystem.

Spatial variation in throughfall, soil, and plant water isotopes in a temperate forest	ECOHYDROLOGY			English	Article						ecohydrologic separation; hydrogen isotopes; leaf water enrichment; mixing models; oxygen isotopes; root water uptake; spatial autocorrelation	FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; STABLE-ISOTOPES; TEMPORAL STABILITY; LEAF WATER; FRACTIONATION; EXTRACTION; VARIABILITY; SEPARATION; HYDROGEN; AUTOCORRELATION	Studies of stable isotopes of water in the environment have been fundamental to advancing our understanding of how water moves through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum; however, much of this research focuses on how water isotopes vary in time, rather than in space. We examined the spatial variation in the O-18 and H-2 of throughfall and bulk soil water, as well as branch xylem and bulk leaf water of Picea abies (Norway spruce) and Fagus sylvatica (beech), in a 1-ha forest plot in the northern Alps of Switzerland. Means and ranges of water isotope ratios varied considerably among throughfall, soil, and xylem samples. Soil water isotope ratios were often poorly explained by soil characteristics and often not predictable from proximal samples. Branch xylem water isotope values varied less than either soil water or bulk leaf water. The isotopic range observed within an individual tree crown was often similar to that observed among different crowns. As a result of the heterogeneity in isotope ratios, inferences about the depth of plant root water uptake drawn from a two end-member mixing model were highly sensitive to the soil sampling location. Our results clearly demonstrate that studies using water isotopes to infer root water uptake must explicitly consider how to characterize soil water, incorporating measures of both vertical and lateral variations. By accounting for this spatial variation and the processes that shape it, we can improve the application of water isotopes to studies of plant ecophysiology, ecohydrology, soil hydrology, and palaeoclimatology.

However, edges in natural and semi-natural forest-grassland mosaics have received less attention, despite the fact that they cover a considerable proportion of these mosaic ecosystems. We studied forest edges in a semi-natural forest-grassland mosaic ecosystem of the Samobor Mountains (Croatia). Our aim was to compare the species composition, diversity and ecological indicator values of forest edges to those of the interior parts of the adjacent forest and grassland habitats. The vegetation was studied in 80 plots established in forest patch interiors, north-facing forest edges, south-facing forest edges and grassland interiors. We found that edges had a unique species composition, containing species from both the forest and the grassland interiors plus their own edge-related species (i.e. species that significantly preferred the edge habitat). These local edge-related species did not correspond to regionally-identified edge-related species. Compared to the forest and the grassland interiors, we revealed increased species richness in north-facing edges but not in south-facing edges. The mean light availability and nutrient supply indicator values of the edges were intermediate between those of the forest interiors and the grasslands. The mean soil moisture indicator values of the edges were similar to those of the grasslands. Our results show that edges form a unique component of forest-grassland mosaics, and they contribute considerably to landscape complexity, which should be taken into account during conservation decisions and habitat management.

Changes in rainfall are expected to have particularly detrimental effects on seedlings due to their inability to reach deep water sources. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to test how the timing of watering affects seedling performance, physiology, and morphology in a keystone island endemic tree, Metrosideros polymorpha. Seedlings were grown for 60 days in one of five conditions: control treatment with daily watering to 100% field capacity (FC), a 28-day pulse drought with no water, and three groups maintained at 80% FC and watered every 2, 7, or 14days. Seedling drought tolerance depended on the duration of drought; growth for plants watered to 80% FC every 2 or 14 days was comparable to 100% FC plants, but was reduced in the 28-day pulse drought and 7-day 80% FC. Survival was high in all treatments except the pulse drought. Stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, and C:N ratio were positively related to height and biomass under drought. Traits associated with resource investment, fluorescence, and water use were plastic in their expression, shifting under drought compared to control conditions. M. polymorpha seedlings exhibit trait plasticity that allows them to tolerate drought, but its duration and intensity influence their survival and growth. Our results highlight the need for experimental studies manipulating temporal variation in water with explicit consideration of the role of trait plasticity in drought tolerance.

Season of fire influences seed dispersal by wind in a serotinous obligate seeding tree	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Callitris verrucosa; Fire intensity; Gene flow; Prescribed burning; Turbulence; Wind speed	LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; CALLITRIS-VERRUCOSA; MECHANISTIC MODEL; SHRUB RECRUITMENT; INTENSITY; DETERMINANTS; TEMPERATURE; GERMINATION; MANAGEMENT; CONSEQUENCES	In temperate ecosystems, fire management involving prescribed burning and wildfire suppression often causes a shift in fire season from hot and dry summer conditions to cooler, moister conditions in spring or autumn. The effects of this change on seed dispersal by wind after fire are unknown. However, calmer wind conditions and increased standing vegetation after fires in cooler seasons may reduce seed dispersal following fire. We studied seed dispersal in different seasons for a serotinous obligate-seeder, Callitris verrucosa, growing in a semi-arid environment in South Australia. We measured primary (wind-borne) and secondary (on-ground) seed dispersal during spring, summer and autumn, using empirical observations and modelling based on detailed measurement of wind characteristics. At comparable horizontal wind speeds, primary dispersal was greater in summer compared to spring and autumn. Secondary dispersal was similarly short in all three seasons when vegetation cover was high, but when cover was low, seeds travelled much further in summer than in the other two seasons. A shift in the seasonal timing of seed release can decrease dispersal distances of serotinous obligate seeders, which is likely to reduce gene flow and the ability to colonise new sites. This can lead to changes in population and community structures which may further affect fire patterns. These findings could be applicable to other serotinous obligate seeding plant species found in other families such as Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, Pinaceae and Cupressaceae.	[Dunker, Bianca; Bull, C.

Carbon exchange responses of a mesic grassland to an extreme gradient of precipitation	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Climate extremes; Drought; Primary production; Rainfall; Soil respiration	SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS; CLIMATE EXTREMES; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; SOIL RESPIRATION; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; EVENTS; AVAILABILITY	Growing evidence indicates that ecosystem processes may be differentially sensitive to dry versus wet years, and that current understanding of how precipitation affects ecosystem processes may not be predictive of responses to extremes. In an experiment within a mesic grassland, we addressed this uncertainty by assessing responses of two key carbon exchange processesaboveground net primary production (ANPP) and soil respiration (R-s)to an extensive gradient of growing season precipitation. This gradient comprised 11 levels that specifically included extreme values in precipitation; defined as the 1st, 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of the 112-year climate record. Across treatments, our experimental precipitation gradient linearly increased soil moisture availability in the rooting zone (upper 20cm). Relative to ANPP under nominal precipitation amounts (defined as between the 15th and 85th percentiles), the magnitude of ANPP responses were greatest to extreme increases in precipitation, with an underlying linear response to both precipitation and soil moisture gradients. By contrast, R-s exhibited marginally greater responses to dry versus wet extremes, with a saturating relationship best explaining responses of R-s to both precipitation and soil moisture. Our findings indicate a linear relationship between ANPP and precipitation after incorporating responses to precipitation extremes in the ANPP-precipitation relationship, yet in contrast saturating responses of R-s. As a result, current linear ANPP-precipitation relationships (up to similar to 1000mm) within mesic grasslands appear to hold as appropriate benchmarks for ecosystems models, yet such models should incorporate nonlinearities in responses of R-s amid increased frequencies and magnitudes of precipitation extremes.

Identifying the species most at risk is, therefore, a conservation priority. Some species have the capacity to adapt to rising temperatures through changing their phenology, behavior, distribution, or physiology, and, therefore, may be more likely to persist under rising temperatures. Recent findings suggest that the African wild dog Lycaon pictus may be impacted by climate change, since reproductive success is consistently lower when pup-rearing coincides with periods of high ambient temperature. We used GPS collars, combined with generalized linear mixed-effects models, to assess wild dogs' potential to adapt to high ambient temperatures through flexible timing of hunting behavior. On days with higher maximum temperatures, wild dogs showed lower daytime activity and greater nocturnal activity, although nocturnal activity did not fully balance the decrease in daytime activity, particularly during the denning period. Increases in nocturnal activity were confined mainly to moonlit nights, and were seldom observed when packs were raising pups. Our findings suggest that nocturnal activity helps this cursorial hunter to cope with high daytime temperatures. However, wild dogs appear not to use this coping strategy when they are raising pups, suggesting that their resource needs may not be fulfilled during the pup-rearing period. Given that moonlight availabilitywhich will not change as the climate changesconstrains wild dogs' nocturnal activity, the species may have insufficient behavioral plasticity to mitigate increasing diurnal temperatures. These findings raise concerns about climate change impacts on this endangered species, and highlight the need for behavior to be considered when assessing species' vulnerability to climate change.

Female reindeer have evolved antlers possibly due to interference competition on winter-feeding grounds. Here, we investigate if variation in antler size explains part of the cost of reproduction in late winter mass of female reindeer. We captured 440 individual Svalbard reindeer a total of 1426 times over 16years and measured antler size and body mass in late winter, while presence of a calf-at-heel' was observed in summer. We found that reproductive females grew smaller antlers and weighed 4.3kg less than non-reproductive females. Path analyses revealed that 14% of this cost of reproduction in body mass was caused by the reduced antler size. Our study is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that antlers in female Rangifer have evolved due to interference competition and provides evidence for antler growth as a cost of reproduction in females. Antler growth was constrained more by life history events than by variation in the environment, which contrasts markedly with studies on male antlers and horns, and hence increases our understanding of constraints on ornamentation and life history trade-offs.

This new approach challenges classical niche theory with potentially great ecological consequences, but so far has only scarce empirical support. Here, we investigated if and how consistent inter-individual differences in behavior predict space use and movement patterns in free-ranging bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and thereby contribute to individual niche specialization. Individuals were captured and marked from three different subpopulations in North-East Germany. Inter-individual differences in boldness and exploration were quantified via repeated standardized tests directly in the field after capture. Subsequently, space use and movement patterns of a representative sample of the behavioral variation (n=21 individuals) were monitored via automated VHF telemetry for a period of four days, yielding on average 384 locations per individual. Bolder individuals occupied larger home ranges and core areas (estimated via kernel density analyses), moved longer distances, spatially overlapped with fewer conspecifics and preferred different microhabitats based on vegetation cover compared to shyer individuals. We found evidence for personality-dependent space use, movement, and occupation of individual spatial niches in bank voles. Thus, besides dietary niche specialization also spatial dimensions of ecological niches vary among individuals within populations, which may have important consequences for ecological interactions within- and between species.

Hyperparasitoids exploit herbivore-induced plant volatiles during host location to assess host quality and non-host identity	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Hyperparasitoid foraging behavior; Non-host parasitoid species; Fourth trophic level organisms; Multitrophic interactions; Plant-based food web	FORAGING BEHAVIOR; PARASITOID WASPS; TROPHIC LEVEL; EVOLUTION; COMPETITION; PERCEPTION; STRATEGIES; INDUCTION; COMMUNITY; RESPONSES	Although consumers often rely on chemical information to optimize their foraging strategies, it is poorly understood how top carnivores above the third trophic level find resources in heterogeneous environments. Hyperparasitoids are a common group of organisms in the fourth trophic level that lay their eggs in or on the body of other parasitoid hosts. Such top carnivores use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to find caterpillars containing parasitoid host larvae. Hyperparasitoids forage in complex environments where hosts of different quality may be present alongside non-host parasitoid species, each of which can develop in multiple herbivore species. Because both the identity of the herbivore species and its parasitization status can affect the composition of HIPV emission, hyperparasitoids encounter considerable variation in HIPVs during host location. Here, we combined laboratory and field experiments to investigate the role of HIPVs in host selection of hyperparasitoids that search for hosts in a multi-parasitoid multi-herbivore context. In a wild Brassica oleracea-based food web, the hyperparasitoid Lysibia nana preferred HIPVs emitted in response to caterpillars parasitized by the gregarious host Cotesia glomerata over the non-host Hyposoter ebeninus. However, no plant-mediated discrimination occurred between the solitary host C. rubecula and the non-host H. ebeninus. Under both laboratory and field conditions, hyperparasitoid responses were not affected by the herbivore species (Pieris brassicae or P. rapae) in which the three primary parasitoid species developed. Our study shows that HIPVs are an important source of information within multitrophic interaction networks allowing hyperparasitoids to find their preferred hosts in heterogeneous environments.

Drought alters the trophic role of an opportunistic generalist in an aquatic ecosystem	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Insects; Microcosm experiment; Precipitation; Tank bromeliad; Trophic plasticity	FOOD WEBS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; INTERACTION STRENGTH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDATION; RESPONSES; DIPTERA; WATER; BEHAVIOR	Abiotic change can alter species interactions by modifying species' trophic roles, but this has not been well studied. Until now, bromeliad-dwelling tipulid larvae were thought to positively affect other macroinvertebrates via a facilitative processing chain. However, under drought, we found the opposite. We performed two microcosm experiments in which we factorially manipulated water level and predation by tipulids, and measured the effects on mosquito and chironomid larvae. The experiments differed in whether high water was contrasted with low or no water, allowing us to distinguish between the effects of desiccation stress (no water) and increased encounter rates due to compression of habitat or reductions in prey mobility (low and no water). We also included a caged tipulid treatment to measure any non-consumptive effects. As well as directly reducing prey survival, reductions in water level indirectly decreased chironomid and mosquito survival by altering the trophic role of tipulids. Our results suggest that increased encounter rates with prey led to tipulids becoming predatory under simulated drought, as tipulids consumed prey under both low and no water. When water level was high, tipulids exerted negative non-consumptive effects on prey survival. Because opportunistic predators are common throughout aquatic ecosystems, the effects of drought on the trophic roles of species may be widespread. Such restructuring of food webs should be considered when attempting to predict the ecological effects of environmental change.

Body size mediates the relationship between spider (Arachnida: Araneae) assemblage composition and prey consumption rate: results of a mesocosm experiment in the Yukon, Canada	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Arthropod; Community; Ecosystem function; Predator; Tundra	INTRAGUILD PREDATION; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NICHE OVERLAP; ECOSYSTEMS; PRODUCTIVITY; CANNIBALISM; COMMUNITIES	Many ecological assemblages are undergoing rapid changes in composition and diversity, and changes at one trophic level can have direct and cascading effects on other trophic levels. Prey consumption typically increases with predator diversity due to niche complementarity and sampling effects. However, the effect of functional traits and interactions between predator species mean that the relationship is far from simple. In July 2016, we performed a series of experiments in the Yukon, Canada, to investigate the relationship between spider assemblage composition and prey consumption, with a focus on the wolf spider Pardosa lapponica (Thorell 1872). We carried out feeding trials, in which P. lapponica and other spider species were offered potential prey, as well as mesocosm experiments, in which we varied spider assemblage composition within small enclosures. We confirmed that P. lapponica is a generalist consumer, individual consumption rate increased with spider body size, and that intraguild predation is present. We found that prey consumption was greatest in the least diverse assemblage but consumption did increase with predator functional trait variation and biomass. The best model of prey consumption included predator assemblage composition, variation in body mass, biomass, and all interactions. The body size of a spider affects its trophic niche, energy requirements, and its interactions with other spiders. As a result, body size mediates the relationship between spider assemblage composition and prey consumption. A deeper understanding of the relationships between traits and functions will allow us to better predict the effect of species loss or gain on ecosystem functions.

Different degrees of water-related stress affect evolutionary diversity in a seasonally dry biome	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Phylogenetic diversity; Stress gradients; Caatinga; Flooding; Dry forests	PHYLOGENETIC STRUCTURE; RIVERINE FOREST; PLANT DIVERSITY; BETA DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; ANGIOSPERMS; TRAITS; CONSERVATISM; SUBMERGENCE; ASSEMBLAGES	Environmental gradients play a key role in shaping diversity in tropical forests. However, we have a little understanding of how evolutionary diversity is affected by gradients and the role of niche persistence in flooded forests in dry biomes. Here, we assessed the evolutionary diversity across a flooding gradient in the Caatinga Domain of South America. We established 120 plots across four tributaries of the SAo Francisco River, eastern Brazil, consisting of 72 plots in flooded, 24 in occasionally flooded, and 24 in unflooded forests. We computed richness, phylogenetic diversity (PD), mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), and mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD) and their standardized effect sizes (ses.PD, ses.MNTD, and ses.MPD). We found low richness, low PD, and high MNTD values in flooded forests relative to unflooded and occasionally flooded forests. MPD did not differ across the flooding gradient. The standardized effect size metrics were higher in flooded forests. Despite the unflooded and occasionally flooded forests being rich in terms of species and correlated phylogenetic structure, flooded forests showed more lineage diversity than expected by chance. We assessed whether this pattern could be driven by resprouting ability testing its phylogenetic signal. Resprouting is randomly distributed across phylogeny, but plant communities are likely assembled from random draws of the resprouters' lineage pool. Quantifying evolutionary diversity across flooding gradients in dry environments brought new insights to how the same environmental filters may lead to disparate patterns of evolutionary diversity and the role of response traits in allowing certain clades to persist in flooded habitats.

Temperature-mediated selection on body mass in mountain wagtails	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Body mass; Climate change; Survival; Motacilla clara; Bergmann's rule	BERGMANNS RULE; AVIAN THERMOREGULATION; HEAT TOLERANCE; SIZE; SURVIVAL; RESPONSES; BIRDS; CAPACITY; DYNAMICS; DECLINE	Climate change appears to affect body size of animals whose optimal size in part depends on temperature. However, attribution of observed body size changes to climate change requires an understanding of the selective pressures acting on body size under different temperatures. We examined the link between temperature and body mass in a population of mountain wagtails (Motacilla clara) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between 1976 and 1999, where temperature increased by 0.18 degrees C. The wagtails became lighter by 0.035g per year. Partitioning this trend, we found that only a small part of the effect (0.009g/year) was due to individuals losing weight and a large part (0.027g/year) was due to lighter individuals replacing heavier ones. Only the latter component was statistically significant. Apparently, the wagtails were reacting to selection for reduced weight. Examining survival, we found that selection was temperature-mediated, i.e., lighter individuals survived better under high temperatures, whereas heavier individuals survived better under low temperatures. Our results thus support the hypothesis that temperature drove the decline in body mass in this wagtail population and provides one of the first demonstrations of the selective forces underlying such trends.

Predicting the landslides triggered by the 2009 96E/Ida tropical storms in the Ilopango caldera area (El Salvador, CA): optimizing MARS-based model building and validation strategies	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Landslide susceptibility; MARS; Temporal validation; Ida hurricane; Caldera Ilopango (El Salvador)	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT; EVENTS APPLICATION; DEBRIS FLOW; MESSINA; TRANSFERABILITY; EVOLUTION; SELECTION	The main topic of this research was to evaluate the effect in the performance of stochastic landslide susceptibility models, produced by differences between the triggering events of the calibration and validation datasets. In the Caldera Ilopango area (El Salvador), MARS (multivariate adaptive regression splines)-based susceptibility modeling was applied using a set of physical-environmental predictors and two remotely recognized landslide inventories: one dated at 2003 (1503 landslides), which was the result of a normal rainfall season, and one which was produced by the combined effect of the Ida hurricane and the 96E tropical depression in 2009 (2237 landslides). Both the event inventories included shallow debrisflow or slide landslides, which involved the weathered mantle of the pyroclastic rocks that largely outcrop in the study area. To this aim, different model building and validation strategies were applied (self-validation, forward and backward chrono-validations), and their performances evaluated both through cutoff-dependent and -independent metrics. All of the tested models produced largely acceptable AUC (area under curve) values, albeit a loss in the predictive performance from self-validation to chrono-validation was observed. Besides, in terms of positive/negative predictions, some critical differences arose: using the 2009 extreme landslide inventory for calibration resulted in higher sensitivity but lower specificity; conversely, using the 2003 normal trigger landslide calibration inventory led to higher specificity but lower sensitivity, with relevant increase in type-II errors. These results suggest the need for investigating the extent of such effects, taking multitrigger intensities inventories as a standard procedure for susceptibility assessment in areas where extreme events potentially occur.

In this setting, we aimed to understand how geomorphology and hydroclimate altered the style and intensity of erosion and sediment composition in a tropical lake and its tectonically active catchment. Lake Towuti (2.75 degrees S, 121.5 degrees E) is one of the oldest and deepest lakes in Indonesia, with uninterrupted lacustrine sedimentation over several glacial-interglacial cycles. Here we present results from a novel set of Lake Towuti surface sediment, bedrock and soil samples from the catchment, and two existing sediment cores that extend to 30,000 and 60,000years before present. We studied the catchment morphology, soil properties, geochemistry, and clay and bulk mineralogy. Results from several river long profiles show clear signs of tectonic activity, which enhances river incision, favours mass movement processes, and together with remobilisation of fluvial deposits, strongly influences modern sedimentation in the lake. Material from the Mahalona River, the lake's largest inflow, dominates modern sediment composition in Towuti's northern basin. The river transports Al-poor and Mg-rich sediments (mainly serpentines) to the lake, indicating river incision into the Mg-rich serpentinised peridotite bedrock. Relatively small, but important additional contributions of material, come from direct laterite-derived input and the Loeha River, which both provide Al-rich and Mg-poor sediment to the lake. Over time, the Al/Mg and kaolinite-to-serpentine ratios varied strongly, primarily in response to lake-level fluctuations driven by hydroclimatic changes. In the past 60,000years, both the Al/Mg and kaolinite-to-serpentine ratios showed variations sensitive to changes in climate boundary conditions across glacial-interglacial cycles, while tectonic activity had less influence on changes in sediment composition on these short time-scales.

Chironomid-based temperature reconstruction for the Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e) at Sokli, northeast Finland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Paleoclimate; Abrupt events; Last Interglacial; AMOC; Transfer functions; Validation	QUANTITATIVE RECONSTRUCTIONS; AIR TEMPERATURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLACIAL CYCLE; WEST EUROPE; DIPTERA; SHALLOW; LAKES; INDICATORS; INSECTA	The Last Interglacial (Eemian, MIS 5e) can be considered a test-bed for climate dynamics under a warmer-than-present climate. In this study we present a chironomid record from the high latitude Sokli site (N Finland), where a long continuous sediment sequence from the last interglacial has been preserved from glacial erosion. The chironomid-analysis shows a diverse fauna, with dominance of warm-water indicators and shifts in assemblage composition that can be attributed to temperature, lake depth, productivity and habitat availability. Quantitative mean July paleotemperature estimates based on the chironomid data indicate overall mean July air temperatures up to 1 degrees C warmer than present. Two cooling events can be discerned, the Tunturi event, dated to about 127.5kaBP, in the lower part of the sequence, and the Varrio event, dated to about 119kaBP, associated with the beginning of a cooling trend in the upper part of the record. Warm conditions already at the onset of the interglacial contrast with a recent chironomid-based last interglacial temperature reconstruction from Denmark, which suggests a late onset of Eemian warming. The relatively small increase in inferred temperatures compared to present day temperatures at Sokli differs from other high latitude Eemian sites, and likely reflects the influence of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in maintaining already elevated temperatures in Fennoscandia during interglacials.

It has been argued that this pattern is produced by a higher degree of specialization on part of both hummingbirds and plants. We here test an alternative hypothesis: The often highly territorial hummingbirds may on average carry pollen over shorter distances than other pollinators and drive diversification by reducing gene flow distances. We present experimental data from pollen analogue tracking showing shorter dispersal distances in hummingbird-pollinated than in bee-pollinated species among ten Neotropical species of Justicia (Acanthaceae). in Spanish is available with online material.

These species have been called "hyperdominant" at large geographical scales and "oligarchs" at regional-landscape scales when being abundant and frequent. Forest community assembly is shaped by environmental factors and stochastic processes, but so far the contribution of oligarchic species to the variation of community composition (i.e., beta diversity) remains poorly known. To that end, we established 20.1-ha plots, that is, five sites with four forest types (ridge, slope and ravine primary forest, and secondary forest) per site, in humid lowland tropical forests of southwestern Costa Rica to (a) investigate how community composition responds to differences in topography, successional stage, and distance among plots for different groups of species (all, oligarch, common and rare/very rare species) and (b) identify oligarch species characterizing changes in community composition among forest types. From a total of 485 species of trees, lianas and palms recorded in this study only 27 species (i.e., 6%) were nominated as oligarch species. Oligarch species accounted for 37% of all recorded individuals and were present in at least half of the plots. Plant community composition significantly differed among forest types, thus contributing to beta diversity at the landscape scale. Oligarch species was the component best explained by geographical and topographic variables, allowing a confident characterization of the beta diversity among tropical lowland forest stands. in Spanish is available with online material.

Using dendrometers, we measured fine-scale growth for 96 trees of 25 species from 2013 to 2016 in an everwet forest in Puerto Rico. Rainfall over this time span varied, including an unusual, severe El Nino drought in 2015. We assessed how growing season onset, median day, conclusion, and length varied with absolute growth rate and tree size over time. Stem growth was seasonal, beginning in February, peaking in July, and ending in November. Species growth rates varied between 0 and 8 mm/year and correlated weakly with specific leaf area, leaf phosphorus, and leaf nitrogen, and to a lesser degree with wood specific gravity and plant height. Drought and tree growth were decoupled, and drought lengthened and increased variation in growing season length. During the 2015 drought, many trees terminated growth early but did not necessarily grow less. In the year following drought, trees grew more over a shorter growing season, with many smaller trees showing a post-drought increase in growth. We attribute the increased growth of smaller trees to release from light limitation as the canopy thinned because of the drought, and less inferred hydraulic stress than larger trees during drought. Soil type accounted for interannual and interspecific differences, with the finest Zarzal clays reducing tree growth. We conclude that drought affects the phenological timing of tree growth and favors the post-drought growth of smaller, sub-canopy trees in this everwet forest. in Spanish is available with online material.

Asteraceae species composition and relative abundance were sampled in 21-1 ha plots distributed across park conservation units, comprising an environmental gradient in soils and relief (elevation and slope). We found high levels of heterogeneity overall in assemblages of herbaceous and woody Asteraceae species at the intermediate spatial scale of this study (10-100 km). We found that both relief and soil properties (texture and total exchangeable bases) explained significant proportions of variation in community composition, suggesting that definitions or expansions of conservation units should span the highest possible variability in observed relief and soil values. We also found that Asteraceae distribution exhibited strong spatial structure independent of environmental variation, reinforcing the need to consider conservation across larger areas. Considering the dystrophic character of the soils found in the Espinhaco Range and the few differences in the fertility observed between the sampling units, our results also support the hypothesis that plant distributions in the tropics are controlled by a hierarchy of environmental gradients, where variables such as altitude and exchangeable bases and Al texture are important predictors in low-fertility soils. We suggest that Asteraceae could be a model family for conservation planning in other countries and regions because it is particularly well represented in open and montane areas of the Neotropics in general. in Portuguese is available with online material.

In tropical forests, for example, seeds defecated by mammals that are subsequently buried by dung beetles are less likely to suffer predation. While the effects of dung beetles on the fate of defecated seeds have been relatively well studied, their effect on seeds already buried in the soil has not. To contribute to fill this gap, we designed a study with three objectives: (a) Describe the vertical re-distribution of soil seeds that occurs due to dung beetle activity; (b) Determine if beetle activity favors establishment of seedlings from the soil seed bank; and (c) Determine if the effect of dung beetles is stronger in sites of recurrent mammal defecation. We carried out three complementary field experiments, one with artificial seeds (plastic beads) of three sizes buried at known depths, one with two species of seeds buried at those same depths, and one with the natural soil seed bank in sites of single vs. recurrent defecation. Buried beads were moved by dung beetles along the vertical axis, both upwards (9.5%) and downwards (11.5%); smaller beads were more frequently moved downwards while the contrary occurred for larger beads. Dung beetle activity caused an increase in seedling establishment, both from experimentally buried seeds and from the natural seed bank. Defecation recurrence had no effect on seedling establishment. We conclude that dung beetle activity affects seed bank dynamics with important consequences for seedling establishment in tropical forests. in Spanish is available with online material.

Connectivity with primary forest determines the value of secondary tropical forests for bird conservation	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						bird communities; community structure; conservation; landscape management; land-use change; Panama; secondary forest; tropical extinction crisis	BARRO-COLORADO ISLAND; PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA; RAIN-FOREST; CENTRAL PANAMA; LAND-USE; SHIFTING-CULTIVATION; BURN AGRICULTURE; ABUNDANCE; ASSEMBLAGES; DIVERSITY	Species extinctions caused by the destruction and degradation of tropical primary forest may be at least partially mitigated by the expansion of regenerating secondary forest. However, the conservation value of secondary forest remains controversial, and potentially underestimated, since most previous studies have focused on young, single-aged, or isolated stands. Here, we use point-count surveys to compare tropical forest bird communities in 20-120-year-old secondary forest with primary forest stands in central Panama, with varying connectivity between secondary forest sites and extensive primary forest. We found that species richness and other metrics of ecological diversity, as well as the combined population density of all birds, reached a peak in younger (20-year-old) secondary forests and appeared to decline in older secondary forest stands. This counter-intuitive result can be explained by the greater connectivity between younger secondary forests and extensive primary forests at our study site, compared with older secondary forests that are either (a) more isolated or (b) connected to primary forests that are themselves small and isolated. Our results suggest that connectivity with extensive primary forest is a more important determinant of avian species richness and community structure than forest age, and highlight the vital contribution secondary forests can make in conserving tropical bird diversity, so long as extensive primary habitats are adjacent and spatially connected. in Spanish is available with online material.

Lowland tapirs facilitate seed dispersal in degraded Amazonian forests	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						Brazil; forest restoration; frugivory; natural regeneration; seed dispersal; Tapirus terrestris; understory fires	INCREASES; TREE; RECRUITMENT; TERRESTRIS; PREDATION; REGENERATION; FRUGIVORY; SECONDARY; PATTERNS; INTACT	The forests of southeastern Amazonia are highly threatened by disturbances such as fragmentation, understory fires, and extreme climatic events. Large-bodied frugivores such as the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) have the potential to offset this process, supporting natural forest regeneration by dispersing a variety of seeds over long distances to disturbed forests. However, we know little about their effectiveness as seed dispersers in degraded forest landscapes. Here, we investigate the seed dispersal function of lowland tapirs in Amazonian forests subject to a range of human (fire and fragmentation) and natural (extreme droughts and windstorms) disturbances, using a combination of field observations, camera traps, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Tapirs travel and defecate more often in degraded forests, dispersing much more seeds in these areas [9,822 seeds per ha/year (CI95% = 9,106; 11,838)] than in undisturbed forests [2,950 seeds per ha/year (CI95% = 2,961; 3,771)]. By effectively dispersing seeds across disturbed forests, tapirs may contribute to natural forest regeneration-the cheapest and usually the most feasible way to achieve large-scale restoration of tropical forests. Through the dispersal of large-seeded species that eventually become large trees, such frugivores also contribute indirectly to maintaining forest carbon stocks. These functions may be critical in helping tropical countries to achieve their goals to maintain and restore biodiversity and its ecosystem services. Ultimately, preserving these animals along with their habitats may help in the process of natural recovery of degraded forests throughout the tropics. in Portuguese is available with online material.

ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Spatial prediction; Environmental factors; Modelling; Random forest	HABITAT DISTRIBUTION; SUITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PREVALENCE; ACCURACY; FORESTS; FUTURE	Rangelands with more than 8000 plant species occupy nearly 54.6% of the land area of Iran and thus are accounted for a rich plant genetic storage. Mazandaran province has 378,000 ha of rangelands with high plant species richness and diversity due to its climate conditions but plants distribution is at risk because of non-principle management, land use change and as a result changing environmental factors. Vegetation management strategies can be guided by models that predict plant species distribution based on governing environmental variables. This is especially useful for the dominant species that determine ecosystem processes. In fact, modelling algorithm in each SDM determines its suitability for different ecosystems. Our aim was to compare the predictive power of a number of SDMs and to evaluate the importance of a range of environmental variables as predictors in the context of semi-arid rangeland vegetation. The selected study area, the Sarkhas rangelands (northern Iran, 36 degrees 10' 42 '' N-51 degrees 19' 11 '' E), covers approximately 4358.9 ha of Mazandaran province. The efficacy of four different modelling techniques as well as Ensemble model was evaluated to predict the distribution of five dominant forage plant species (Vicia villosa, Stachys lavandlilifolia, Coronilla balansae, Sanguisorba minor and Alopecurus textllis). The used models included artificial neural network (ANN), boosted regression trees (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest (RF). Ensemble, RF and CART had the highest area under curve. The AUC obtained for Vicia villosa, Stachys iavandulifolia, Coronilla balansae, Sanguisorba minor and Alopecurus textiiis, were 0.90, 0.72, 0.76, 0.69 and 0.75 respectively. Ensemble model was the model that most consistently demonstrated high predictive power across species in the rangeland context investigated here. BRT exhibited the least predictive power. An importance analysis of variables showed that soil organic C according to the CART model (0.396) and K according to the RF model (0.396) were the most important environmental variables.

Constraint-based simulation of multiple interactive elemental cycles in biogeochemical systems	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Flux network; Microbial metabolism; Optimization; Redox potential; Stoichiometry; Thermodynamics	THERMODYNAMIC CONSTRAINTS; ECOLOGICAL STOICHIOMETRY; NITROGEN; CARBON	Simulating multiple linked elemental cycles is a frontier in the field of biogeochemistry. The Generalized Algorithm for Nutrient, Growth, Stoichiometric and Thermodynamic Analysis (GANGSTA) is a software framework that automates the instantiation of formalized, user-defined conceptual models of linked elemental cycles as simulation model code. The GANGSTA employs first principles of stoichiometry and thermodynamics to generate models that simulate any suite of elemental cycles, compounds, metabolic processes, and microorganisms. Results demonstrated, e.g., that simulating the oxygen (0) cycle, rather than oxic versus anoxic conditions, fundamentally altered carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling - despite holding the compounds and processes involved in the C and N cycles constant. Additionally, incorporating the sulfur (S) cycle substantively changed C and N cycling, largely via shifts in the O cycle. Thus, emergent dynamics from GANGSTA-derived models can aid in the development of hypotheses to describe the specific mechanisms of interdependence among linked elemental cycles.

Unimodal diversity-productivity relationship emerged under stressful environment through sampling effect	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; Diversity-productivity relationship; Environmental stress; Context dependence; Sampling effect; Unimodal relationship	ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; RICHNESS; COMMUNITIES; DISTURBANCE; STABILITY; INCREASES	Researches on the context dependence of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) reveal the variation of diversity-productivity relationship (DPR) under stressful environment. The "habitat sampling effect" (HSE) is proposed as the dominant species interaction mechanism at stressful environment, whereas its potential role in driving the DPR has never been testified before. We constructed an individual-based simulation model to explore the variation of DPR along environmental stress gradient, and evaluated the contribution of HSE in explaining this variation. Our results indicated that DPR changed from positive to negative along environmental stress gradients. An unimodal DPR curve emerged at stressful environment, which was caused by the counterbalance of two opposite impacts of HSE on community productivity. At low richness level, the positive impact of HSE on community productivity dominated through the promotion of community size, which resulted in the positive DPR. Whereas with the increase of richness, the negative impact of HSE dominated instead through the reducing of individual productivity, which caused the decreasing part of unimodal curve. Our results highlight the complex characteristic of BEF relationship at stressful environment, and emphasize the necessity of biodiversity in maintaining community's functioning at stressful environment which are often sparse in species richness.

This study updates and extends the several previous works undertaken to analyse tide-gauge records and satellite altimetry around South Korea using enhanced time-series analysis techniques to detect coastal vertical land motion and current rates of rise and accelerations in mean sea level to augment planning, design, and risk management activities. Although the longest tide-gauge records available only date back to 1960, every effort has been made to separate the mean sea-level trend from the more dynamic influences with improved precision using state-of-the-art analytical techniques. The analysis identified general trends of subsidence observed around the margins bounded by the East China Sea and East Sea (Sea of Japan) below 36 degrees N, whereas uplift was a more prevalent feature along the margins bounded by the Yellow Sea. All tide-gauge records longer than 50 years exhibited 'relative' mean sea-level rise increasing marginally over the length of the record, suggesting the presence of an acceleration; however, the estimated time-varying accelerations (albeit predominantly positive) are small and not statistically different from zero (95% confidence interval). Although the average trend of sea-surface height from satellite altimetry across this region was 3.2 mm/y, key spatial variations were evident, with the highest rates of rise centred in two discrete areas east and west of South Korea around 37.5 degrees N, each exceeding 8 mm/y.

The consequences for community structure after a catastrophic event have been well studied. However, changes in ecosystem functioning that occur after such an event, including ecosystem recovery, are still uncertain. A catastrophic event was simulated in an intertidal sedimentary habitat. Postevent sediment replicates were assigned to one of four recovery scenarios: (1) no recovery, (2) migration recovery, and recovery by differential opportunistic colonisation by (3) the polychaete worm Hediste diversicolor and (4) the mud snail Peringia ulvae, two locally dominant infauna species. These are compared with a control scenario not subjected to the event. The simulated extreme event caused a shift in habitat state due to a reduction in mobile macrofauna abundance and an increase in microphytobenthos biomass. Migratory recovery of species and the simulated opportunistic expansion of a single species ameliorated this shift and, for some metrics, functional compensation for the loss of other species and the preservation of certain ecosystem functions was observed. The dominant species identity during postevent habitat recovery can have considerable effects on important ecosystem processes and functions with consequences that may result in functional regime shifts in a habitat and alter coastal stability.

A filtering algorithm for high-resolution flow traces to improve water end-use analysis	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						filtering; residential water flow trace disaggregation; smart metering data; water end-use event; water micro-component	DEMAND; MODEL	One of the main difficulties encountered when designing automatic tools for water end-use identification is the inherent noise present in recorded flow traces. Noise is mainly caused by the inability of the monitoring equipment to accurately register water consumption and data-loggers to register, without distortion, the signal received from the water meter. A universal filtering algorithm has been developed to remove noise and simplify water consumption flow traces with the aim of improving future automatic end-use identification algorithms. The performance of the proposed filtering methodology is assessed through the analysis of 21,647 events. Water consumption data were sourced from two different water end-use studies, having consumers and monitoring equipment with dissimilar characteristics. The results obtained show that the algorithm is capable of removing an average of 70% of the data points that constitute the flow traces of the complex events examined. The simplified flow traces allow for faster and more accurate disaggregation and classification algorithms, without losing significant information or distorting the original signal. The ability of the proposed filtering algorithm to fit the original flow traces was benchmarked using the Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient, obtaining an average value above 0.79.

However, its global use as a human-specific MST marker requires validation in a tropical region. In this study, a crAssphage qPCR marker (CPQ_056) was detected in 21 sewage samples in Thailand with 100% sensitivity. The marker was detected in sewage from hospitals and residential buildings at 5.28-7.38 log(10) copies/100 mL and in four influent and four effluent samples of municipal wastewater treatment plants at 4.23-6.19 and 3.78-4.89 log(10) copies/100 mL, respectively. Furthermore, a 99.2% specificity (n = 127) was observed using feces from swine, cattle, chicken, duck, goat, sheep, buffalo, and fish, with cross-detection only occurring for one composite swine sample. The crAssphage marker was present in 56.25% (27 out of 48) of river samples at 3.20-7.29 log(10) copies/100 mL. The concentrations of the crAssphage marker and a prevalidated human-specific Bacteroidales marker (HF183/BFDrev) did not differ significantly in any of the sewage or wastewater samples, whereas the crAssphage marker abundance was higher in river samples. This initial validation of the crAssphage gene as a human-specific MST marker in Southeast Asia will promote its inclusion in an MST toolbox.

We measured or estimated pCO(2), CO2 fluxes with the atmosphere, planktonic community respiration (PCR), and environmental and landscape variables along the Negro and Amazon-Solimoes rivers during different periods of the fluvial hydrological cycle. Values of pCO(2) ranged from 307 to 7527atm, while CO2 fluxes ranged from -9.3 to 1128mmolm(-2)d(-1) in the Amazon-Solimoes basin. In the Negro basin, pCO(2) values ranged from 648 to 6526 atm, and CO2 fluxes from 35 to 1025mmolm(-2)d(-1). In a general linear model including data from Negro and Amazon-Solimoes basins, seasonal and spatial variation in flooded vegetated habitat area, dissolved oxygen, depth and water temperature explained 85% of surface pCO(2) variation. Levels of pCO(2) varied with inundation extent, with higher pCO(2) values occurring in periods with greater water depth and inundation area, and lower dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures. In a separate analysis for the Amazon-Solimoes river and floodplains, ecosystem type (lotic or lentic), hydrological period, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, depth and dissolved phosphorus explained 83% of pCO(2) variation. Our results demonstrate the influence of alluvial floodplains and seasonal variations in their limnological characteristics on the pCO(2) levels in river channels of the lowland Amazon.

The simultaneous collection of environmental temperature and animal location may contribute not only to deepen the understanding of animal behavior in different climatic conditions, but also to increase the knowledge of climate features in inaccessible areas. The measurement of environmental temperature provided by the sensors, however, can be biased by several factors (e.g., surface temperature of the animal, direct solar radiation, precipitation), so in-depth studies are required to verify the correlation. The aim of this study was to identify an equation for correcting the collar-recorded temperature data, allowing to improve and refine the results obtained by the analysis of spatial data and to highlight the environmental factors having the greatest impact on the accuracy of the measures. Temperature data from GPS collars were obtained within a research on spatial behavior on 11 hinds while spatialized temperature data were obtained from LAMMA-IBIMET dataset. These data showed high correlation and an identical trend, although the GPS collar temperature data was always higher. This model could represent a tool to obtain an accurate measurement of temperatures in complex geographical areas with wild animals but low density of weather stations. The availability of corrected temperature data, recorded simultaneously with the animal location, could be useful for a more accurate comprehension of animal behavior in free-ranging conditions, both in case of forthcoming studies and to valorize existing datasets.

The heterogeneous quality of available topographic information (i.e. higher resolution digital elevation model only for a sub-region) encouraged to confront modelling results based on two different study area delineations and two raster resolutions. Input data was based on the larger modelling region L15 (163 km(2)) and smaller S (70 km(2); located inside L15) with an associated raster cell size of 15 m (region L15 and S15) and 5 m (region S5). The resulting three data sets (L15, S15 and S5) were included into three differently flexible modelling techniques (Generalized Linear Model - GLM, General Additive Model - GAM, Support Vector Machine-SVM) to produce nine landslide susceptibility models. Preceding variable selection was performed heuristically and supported by an exploratory data analysis. The final models were based on the explanatory variables slope angle, slope aspect, lithology, relative slope position, elevation, convergence index, distance to streams, distance to springs and topographic wetness index. The ability of the models to classify independent test data was elaborated using a k-fold cross validation procedure and the AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) metric. In general, all produced landslide susceptibility maps depicted the hillslopes of the ravines, which cut the pyroclastic ramp, as prone to landsliding. The modelling results showed that predictive performances (i.e. AUROC values) slightly increased with an increasing flexibility of the applied modelling technique. Thus, SVM performed best, while the GAM outperformed the GLM. This tendency was most distinctive when modelling with the largest landslide sample size (i.e. data set L15; n = 662 landslides). Non-linear classifiers (GAMs, SVMs) performed slightly better when trained on the basis of lower raster resolution (data set S15) compared to the 5 m counterparts (data set S5). Highest predictive performance was obtained for the model based on data set L15 and the SVM classifier (median AUROC: 0.82). However, SVMs also indicated the highest degree of model overfitting. This study indicates that the decision to delineate a study area, the selection of a raster resolution as well as the chosen classification technique can affect varying aspects of subsequent modelling results. The results do not support the assumption that a higher raster resolution (i.e. a more detailed digital representation of the terrain) inevitably leads to better performing or geomorphically more plausible landslide susceptibility maps.

If management (treatment) is applied nonrandomly, as in observational studies, then analysis must account for the potential confounding caused by variables that could have influenced both treatment assignment and the outcome of interest. Methods that do not adjust for all confounding variables can only estimate associations between treatment and outcome, not treatment effects. Data collected in observational studies are usually analysed with linear or generalized linear models, which can estimate treatment effects by adjusting for confounding variables. However, if there is little overlap in the distributions of confounding variables among the treatment groups then conventional regression extrapolates to areas of the covariate space where at least one of the treatment groups was unlikely to be observed. An alternative procedure for assessing treatment effects is to use the propensity score, which is the probability of treatment assignment given potential confounding variables. The propensity score can be used to reduce systematic differences in confounding variables among the treatment groups, ensuring that data more closely resemble that expected under a randomized experiment. The propensity score also identifies situations where treatment inferences must rely on strong assumptions. We used Monte Carlo simulation to examine the properties of commonly used propensity score methods for estimating treatment effects in the presence of nonrandom allocation of treatments. We then illustrated their application in a case study estimating the effects of invasive herbivore management on tree condition. Our results indicate that propensity score methods can be robust to model misspecification, allowing the estimation of average causal effects and resulting in more reliable inferences. We discuss key considerations for using propensity score methods for analysing ecological data.	[Ramsey, David S.

However, the accurate description of food webs requires significant effort in time and resources, limiting their widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently described methods, as well as describe a composite model of the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a large, well-described dataset. Both niche and neutral processes are involved in determining whether or not two species will form a feeding link in communities. Three different models for determining niche constraints of feeding interactions are compared, and all three models are extended by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative abundances. The three models compared here infer niche processes through (a) phylogenetic relationships, (b) local species trait distributions (e.g., body size), and (c) a composite of phylogeny and local traits. We show that all three methods perform well at predicting individual species interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up to the network level, resulting in food web structure of inferred networks being similar to their empirical counterparts. Our results indicate that inferring food web structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test of changes in food web structure, particularly when there is low species turnover between sites. Inferences made using traits require more data, but allows for greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions. A composite model of the two methods provides a framework for investigating the importance of how phylogeny, trait distributions, and relative abundances, affect species interactions, and network structure.

Functional traits and community composition: A comparison among community-weighted means, weighted correlations, and multilevel models	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						community assembly; ecological community; environmental gradients; fourth-corner approach; generalized linear mixed models; hierarchical models; species niche centroid; Whittaker Siskiyou Mountains data	ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS	Of the several approaches that are used to analyse functional trait-environment relationships, the most popular is community-weighted mean regressions (CWMr) in which species trait values are averaged at the site level and then regressed against environmental variables. Other approaches include model-based methods and weighted correlations of different metrics of trait-environment associations, the best known of which is the fourth-corner correlation method. We investigated these three general statistical approaches for trait-environment associations: CWMr, five weighted correlation metrics (Peres-Neto, Dray, & ter Braak, Ecography, 40, 806-816, 2017), and two multilevel models (MLM) using four different methods for computing p-values. We first compared the methods applied to a plant community dataset. To determine the validity of the statistical conclusions, we then performed a simulation study. CWMr gave highly significant associations for both traits, whereas the other methods gave a mix of support. CWMr had inflated type I errors for some simulation scenarios, implying that the significant results for the data could be spurious. The weighted correlation methods had generally good type I error control but had low power. One of the multilevel models, that from Jamil, Ozinga, Kleyer, and ter Braak (Journal of Vegetation Science, 24, 988-1000, 2013) had both good type I error control and high power when an appropriate method was used to obtain p-values. In particular, if there was no correlation among species in their abundances among sites, a parametric bootstrap likelihood ratio test (LRT) gave the best power. When there was correlation among species in their abundances, a conditional parametric LRT had correct type I errors but had lower power. There is no overall best method for identifying trait-environment associations. For the simple task of testing associations between single environmental variables and single traits, the weighted correlations with permutation tests all had good type I error control, and their ease of implementation is an advantage. For the more complex task of multivariate analyses and model fitting, and when high statistical power is needed, we recommend MLM2 (Jamil et al., 2013). However, care must be taken to ensure against inflated type I errors for both weighted correlations and MLM2. Because CWMr exhibited highly inflated type I error rates, it should always be avoided.

Extension of the gambin model to multimodal species abundance distributions	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						compound distributions; gambin; horse flies; multimodal species abundance distributions		Species abundance distributions (SADs) are one of the most widely used tools in macroecology, and it has become increasingly apparent that many empirical SADs can best be described as multimodal. However, only a few SAD models have been extended to incorporate multiple modes and no software packages are available to fit multimodal SAD models. In this study, we present an extension of the gambin SAD model to multimodal SADs. We derive the maximum likelihood equations for fitting the bimodal gambin distribution and generalize this approach to fit gambin models with any number of modes. We present these new functions, along with additional functions to aid in the analysis of multimodal SADs, within an updated r package ("gambin"; version 2.4.0) that enables the fitting, plotting and evaluating of gambin models with any number of modes. We use a mixture of simulations and empirical datasets to test our new models, including tests of the sensitivity of the model parameters to the number of individuals and the number of species in a sample. We show that the new multimodal gambin models perform well under a variety of circumstances, and that the application of these new models to empirical SAD and other macroecological (e.g., species range size distributions) datasets can provide interesting insights. The updated software package is simple to use and provides straightforward yet flexible statistical analyses of multimodality in SAD-type datasets.

In environments with high spatial and temporal variability, addressing these challenges often requires numerous assumptions regarding organism distributions and their relationships to biophysical features. These assumptions may limit the resolution or accuracy of predictions resulting from survey-based distribution models. We propose an iterative modeling approach that incorporates a negative binomial hurdle, followed by modeling of the relationship of organism distribution and abundance to environmental covariates using generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Our approach accounts for key features of survey data by separating binary (presence-absence) from count (abundance) data, separately modeling the mean and dispersion of count data, and incorporating selection of appropriate covariates and response functions from a suite of potential covariates while avoiding overfitting. We apply our modeling approach to surveys of sea duck abundance and distribution in Nantucket Sound (Massachusetts, USA), which has been proposed as a location for offshore wind energy development. Our model results highlight the importance of spatiotemporal variation in this system, as well as identifying key habitat features including distance to shore, sediment grain size, and seafloor topographic variation. Our work provides a powerful, flexible, and highly repeatable modeling framework with minimal assumptions that can be broadly applied to the modeling of survey data with high spatiotemporal variability. Applying GAMLSS models to the count portion of survey data allows us to incorporate potential overdispersion, which can dramatically affect model results in highly dynamic systems. Our approach is particularly relevant to systems in which little a priori knowledge is available regarding relationships between organism distributions and biophysical features, since it incorporates simultaneous selection of covariates and their functional relationships with organism responses.

Linking warming effects on phenology, demography, and range expansion in a migratory bird population	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						climate change; population dynamics; species distribution; temperature; waders	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEATHER; FITNESS; GROWTH; RESPONSES; IMPACTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ASSOCIATIONS; GRASSLANDS; HERBIVORE	Phenological changes in response to climate change have been recorded in many taxa, but the population-level consequences of these changes are largely unknown. If phenological change influences demography, it may underpin the changes in range size and distribution that have been associated with climate change in many species. Over the last century, Icelandic black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa islandica) have increased 10-fold in numbers, and their breeding range has expanded throughout lowland Iceland, but the environmental and demographic drivers of this expansion remain unknown. Here, we explore the potential for climate-driven shifts in phenology to influence demography and range expansion. In warmer springs, Icelandic black-tailed godwits lay their clutches earlier, resulting in advances in hatching dates in those years. Early hatching is beneficial as population-wide tracking of marked individuals shows that chick recruitment to the adult population is greater for early hatched individuals. Throughout the last century, this population has expanded into progressively colder breeding areas in which hatch dates are later, but temperatures have increased throughout Iceland since the 1960s. Using these established relationships between temperature, hatching dates and recruitment, we show that these warming trends have the potential to have fueled substantial increases in recruitment throughout Iceland, and thus to have contributed to local population growth and expansion across the breeding range. The demographic consequences of temperature-mediated phenological changes, such as the advances in lay dates and increased recruitment associated with early hatching reported here, may therefore be key processes in driving population size and range changes in response to climate change.

However, to date there has been very little systematic comparison of human and machine detection ability. We present an experiment based on broadcast calls of nocturnal New Zealand birds in an area of natural forest. The soundscape was monitored by both novice and experienced humans performing a call count, and autonomous recording units. We match records of when calls were broadcast with detections by both humans and machines, and construct a hierarchical generalized linear model of the binary variable of correct detection or not, with a set of covariates about the call (distance, sound direction, relative altitude, and line of sight) and about the listener (age, experience, and gender). The results show that machines and humans have similar listening ability. Humans are more homogeneous in their recording of sounds, and this was not affected by their individual experience or characteristics. Humans were affected by trial and location, in particular one of the stations located in a small but deep valley. Despite recorders being affected significantly more than people by distance, altitude, and line of sight, their overall detection probability was higher. The specific location of recorders seems to be the most important factor determining what they record, and we suggest that for best results more than one recorder (or at least, microphone) is needed at each station to ensure all bird sounds of interest are captured.

In order to evaluate the evolutionary mechanisms behind invasiveness, it is crucial to identify the source populations of the introduction. Studies in population genetics were carried out on Robinia pseudoacacia L., a North American tree which is now one of the worst invasive tree species in Europe. We realized large-scale sampling in both the invasive and native ranges: 63 populations were sampled and 818 individuals were genotyped using 113 SNPs. We identified clonal genotypes in each population and analyzed between and within range population structure, and then, we compared genetic diversity between ranges, enlarging the number of SNPs to mitigate the ascertainment bias. First, we demonstrated that European black locust was introduced from just a limited number of populations located in the Appalachian Mountains, which is in agreement with the historical documents briefly reviewed in this study. Within America, population structure reflected the effects of long-term processes, whereas in Europe it was largely impacted by human activities. Second, we showed that there is a genetic bottleneck between the ranges with a decrease in allelic richness and total number of alleles in Europe. Lastly, we found more clonality within European populations. Black locust became invasive in Europe despite being introduced from a reduced part of its native distribution. Our results suggest that human activity, such as breeding programs in Europe and the seed trade throughout the introduced range, had a major role in promoting invasion; therefore, the introduction of the missing American genetic cluster to Europe should be avoided.

Considerable complexity in marine trophic structure can exist due to the presence of highly mobile species with long life spans. Mobula rays are highly mobile, large, planktivorous elasmobranchs that are frequently caught either directly or as bycatch in fisheries, which, combined with their conservative life history strategy, makes their populations susceptible to decline in intensely fished regions. Effective management of these iconic and vulnerable species requires an understanding of the diets that sustain them, which can be difficult to determine using conventional sampling methods. We use three DNA metabarcode assays to identify 44 distinct taxa from the stomachs (n = 101) of four sympatric Mobula ray species (Mobula birostris, Mobula tarapacana, Mobula japanica, and Mobula thurstoni) caught over 3 years (2013-2015) in a direct fishery off Bohol in the Philippines. The diversity and incidence of bony fishes observed in ray diets were unprecedented. Nevertheless, rays showed dietary overlap, with krill (Euphausia) dominating their diet. Our results provide a more detailed assessment of sympatric ray diets than was previously described and reveal the complexity that can exist in food webs at critical foraging habitats.

Recently, there has been increased interest in deciphering the evolutionary role of Daphnia's plasticity and the molecular mechanisms of local adaptation. Using transcriptome data, we assessed the differences in gene expression profiles and sequences in four European Daphnia galeata populations. In total, similar to 33% of 32,903 transcripts were differentially expressed between populations. Among 10,280 differentially expressed transcripts, 5,209 transcripts deviated from neutral expectations and their population-specific expression pattern is likely the result of local adaptation processes. Furthermore, a SNP analysis allowed inferring population structure and distribution of genetic variation. The population divergence at the sequence level was comparatively higher than the gene expression level by several orders of magnitude consistent with strong founder effects and lack of gene flow between populations. Using sequence homology, the candidate transcripts were annotated using a comparative genomics approach. Additionally, we also performed a weighted gene co-expression analysis to identify population-specific regulatory patterns of transcripts in D. galeata. Thus, we identified candidate transcriptomic regions for local adaptation in this key species of aquatic ecosystems in the absence of any laboratory-induced stressor.

Multiple habitat use by declining migratory birds necessitates joined-up conservation	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						aquaculture; China; coastal land use; land claim; shorebirds; stopover ecology; working coastal wetlands	HIGH-TIDE ROOSTS; YELLOW SEA; HOME-RANGE; SHOREBIRDS; CHINA; WATERBIRDS; SOUTHERN; WETLANDS; COAST; AVAILABILITY	Many species depend on multiple habitats at different points in space and time. Their effective conservation requires an understanding of how and when each habitat is used, coupled with adequate protection. Migratory shorebirds use intertidal and supratidal wetlands, both of which are affected by coastal landscape change. Yet the extent to which shorebirds use artificial supratidal habitats, particularly at highly developed stopover sites, remains poorly understood leading to potential deficiencies in habitat management. We surveyed shorebirds on their southward migration in southern Jiangsu, a critical stopover region in the East Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), to measure their use of artificial supratidal habitats and assess linkages between intertidal and supratidal habitat use. To inform management, we examined how biophysical features influenced occupancy of supratidal habitats, and whether these habitats were used for roosting or foraging. We found that shorebirds at four of five sites were limited to artificial supratidal habitats at high tide for similar to 11-25 days per month because natural intertidal flats were completely covered by seawater. Within the supratidal landscape, at least 37 shorebird species aggregated on artificial wetlands, and shorebirds were more abundant on larger ponds with less water cover, less vegetation, at least one unvegetated bund, and fewer built structures nearby. Artificial supratidal habitats were rarely used for foraging and rarely occupied when intertidal flats were available, underscoring the complementarity between supratidal roosting habitat and intertidal foraging habitat. Joined-up artificial supratidal management and natural intertidal habitat conservation are clearly required at our study site given the simultaneous dependence by over 35,000 migrating shorebirds on both habitats. Guided by observed patterns of habitat use, there is a clear opportunity to improve habitat condition by working with local land custodians to consider shorebird habitat requirements when managing supratidal ponds. This approach is likely applicable to shorebird sites throughout the EAAF.

Complex immune responses and molecular reactions to pathogens and disease in a desert reptile (Gopherus agassizii)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						desert tortoise; immunity; mRNA; Mycoplasma agassizii; transcription	RESPIRATORY-TRACT DISEASE; SOFT-SHELLED TURTLE; ARYL-HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR; MYCOPLASMA-AGASSIZII; ECOLOGICAL IMMUNOLOGY; GENE-TRANSCRIPTION; TORTOISE; SYSTEM; EXPOSURE; EXPRESSION	Immune function plays an important role in an animal's defense against infectious disease. In reptiles, immune responses may be complex and counterintuitive, and diagnostic tools used to identify infection, such as induced antibody responses are limited. Recent studies using gene transcription profiling in tortoises have proven useful in identifying immune responses to various intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. As part of a larger experiment with Mojave desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii), we facilitated the transmission of the pathogenic bacteria, Mycoplasma agassizii (Myag), to naive adults and measured innate and induced immune reactions over time. Specifically, we evaluated clinical condition, presence of Myag in the nasal/oral cavity, induced antibody responses specific to Myag, and measured molecular reactions (gene transcript profiles) in 15 captive tortoises classified as naive, exposed, or infected and 14 wild tortoises for comparison. Myag was confirmed inside the nasal/oral cavity in exposed tortoises within 30-60 days of introduction to infected animals, yet we did not detect Myag specific induced antibody responses in these individuals until 420-595 days post exposure. Surprisingly, we found no overall differences in the gene transcript profiles between our experimental treatment groups throughout this study. This work highlights the complexities in assessing immune function and diagnosing pathogen related infections in tortoises and other reptiles.	[Drake, K.

Individual variation and seasonality drive bird feeder use during winter in a Mediterranean climate	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						bird feeding; Black-capped Chickadee; PIT-tagging; Poecile atricapillus; RFID; supplemental feeding	BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEES; MOUNTAIN CHICKADEES; POECILE ATRICAPILLA; PARUS-ATRICAPILLUS; FORAGING ROUTINES; UNITED-STATES; FOOD; TITS; PERFORMANCE; POPULATION	Purposeful provisioning of food to wild animals is a widespread and growing activity that has the potential to impact populations and communities. Nevertheless, studies assessing use of recreational feeders by free-living birds during winter are surprisingly rare and largely limited to regions with continental climates characterized by freezing temperatures and snow cover. In contrast, there is little information available regarding bird use of feeders within warmer climates during winter, despite widespread recreational feeding in these areas. In this study, we quantified visitation patterns to bird feeders in a Mediterranean climate to evaluate the relationship between feeder use and several environmental variables known to influence supplemental feeder use in continental climates. We established a network of bird feeders in Corvallis, Oregon, USA, that were filled with black oil sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seeds and equipped with radio frequency identification (RFID) data loggers that recorded >315,000 visits by 70 individual Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) across a 5-month period (October 2016-March 2017). We found extensive variation in feeder use, with individuals averaging 1-406 feeder visits/day and using 1-9 of the 21 feeders that were available; individual variability was largely consistent during the course of our study. At the population level, we found that feeder use decreased from the start of our study, and this decline continued through the period when foraging was most limited by daylight, including the winter solstice. In contrast to theoretical predictions and empirical work in continental climates, we found that weather variables did not drive feeder use and that feeder visits peaked at mid-day and gradually decreased until sunset. Our study indicates that individual-level differences combined with seasonality to drive feeder use patterns, and we conclude that use of supplemental feeders during winter in Mediterranean climates appears to differ notably from feeder use in continental climates.

However, for designing spatially explicit management strategies, distribution maps should include information on the local cover/abundance of the IAPS. This study compares the performances of five MLAs: gradient boosting machine in two different implementations, random forest, support vector machine and deep learning neural network, one ensemble model and a generalized linear model; thereby identifying the best-performing ones in mapping the fractional cover/abundance and distribution of IPAS, in this case called Prosopis juliflora (SW. DC.). Field level Prosopis cover and spatial datasets of seventeen biophysical and anthropogenic variables were collected, processed, and used to train and validate the algorithms so as to generate fractional cover maps of Prosopis in the dryland ecosystem of the Afar Region, Ethiopia. Out of the seven tested algorithms, random forest performed the best with an accuracy of 92% and sensitivity and specificity >0.89. The next best-performing algorithms were the ensemble model and gradient boosting machine with an accuracy of 89% and 88%, respectively. The other tested algorithms achieved comparably low performances. The strong explanatory variables for Prosopis distributions in all models were NDVI, elevation, distance to villages and distance to rivers; rainfall, temperature, near-infrared and red reflectance, whereas topographic variables, except for elevation, did not contribute much to the current distribution of Prosopis. According to the random forest model, a total of 1.173 million ha (12.33% of the study region) was found to be invaded by Prosopis to varying degrees of cover. Our findings demonstrate that MLAs can be successfully used to develop fractional cover maps of plant species, particularly IAPS so as to design targeted and spatially explicit management strategies.

Location 2,000 km along the coast of Chile. Methods We collected ground-dwelling arthropod samples from nine marshes during two seasons. A clustering method was used to examine patterns of arthropod similarity across salt marshes. We also calculated multiple-site beta diversity and partitioned it into its turnover and nestedness components. Variation partitioning was then used to identify the major drivers of their variation (regional, spatial, and local variables). We compared results for the whole arthropod community and for the most abundant, speciose, and functionally different groups, Crustacea, Coleoptera, and Araneae. Results Salt marsh arthropod similarities did not depend on the geographic proximity of sites. Arthropod beta diversity was mainly determined by its turnover component. A significant fraction of community variation was related to the spatially structured variation of climate or edaphic factors. However, the exclusive contribution of spatial variables had also a role. Main conclusions Each salt marsh on the Chilean coast has the capacity to accommodate unique invertebrate taxa. Species sorting along the climatic gradient together with dispersal-based processes seems the key structuring force of the arthropods and Crustacean variation in the marshes we studied, while species sorting alone might be more important for Coleoptera variation.

This system has been supported by changes in vocal emission rates when shrews encounter different habitats of varying complexity, although detailed acoustic features in this system have not been reported. In this study, behavioral experiments were conducted using the long-clawed shrew (Sorex unguiculatus) to assess this orientation system. Three experimental conditions were set, two of which contained obstacles. Short-click, noisy, and different types of tonal calls in the audible-to-ultrasonic frequency range were recorded under all experimental conditions. The results indicated that shrews emit calls more frequently when they are facing obstacles or exploring the experimental environment. Shrews emitted clicks and several different types of tonal calls while exploring, and modified the use of different types of calls for varying behavior. Furthermore, shrews modified the dominant frequency and duration of squeak calls for different types of obstacles, that is, plants and acrylic barriers. The vocalizations emitted at short inter-pulse intervals could not be observed when shrews approached these obstacles. These results are consistent with the echo-based orientation hypothesis according to which shrews use a simple echo-orientation system to obtain information from their surrounding environments, although further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Variation in chronic radiation exposure does not drive life history divergence among Daphnia populations across the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Daphnia pulex; life history; mutation; radiation	INDUCED GENOMIC INSTABILITY; IONIZING-RADIATION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; GROWTH; ECOSYSTEMS; EVOLUTION; SURVIVAL; PLANTS	Ionizing radiation is a mutagen with known negative impacts on individual fitness. However, much less is known about how these individual fitness effects translate into population-level variation in natural environments that have experienced varying levels of radiation exposure. In this study, we sampled genotypes of the freshwater crustacean, Daphnia pulex, from the eight inhabited lakes across the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ). Each lake has experienced very different levels of chronic radiation exposure since a nuclear power reactor exploded there over thirty years ago. The sampled Daphnia genotypes represent genetic snapshots of current populations and allowed us to examine fitness-related traits under controlled laboratory conditions at UK background dose rates. We found that whilst there was variation in survival and schedules of reproduction among populations, there was no compelling evidence that this was driven by variation in exposure to radiation. Previous studies have shown that controlled exposure to radiation at dose rates included in the range measured in the current study reduce survival, or fecundity, or both. One limitation of this study is the lack of available sites at high dose rates, and future work could test life history variation in various organisms at other high radiation areas. Our results are nevertheless consistent with the idea that other ecological factors, for example competition, predation or parasitism, are likely to play a much bigger role in driving variation among populations than exposure to the high radiation dose rates found in the CEZ. These findings clearly demonstrate that it is important to examine the potential negative effects of radiation across wild populations that are subject to many and varied selection pressures as a result of complex ecological interactions.

The workers, being sterile females, are not subject to selection for reproductive function providing a natural control for parsing the effects of selection on reproductive function (i.e., sexual and fecundity selection) from other kinds of natural selection. Patterns of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and testing of Rensch's rule controlling for phylogenetic effects were analyzed in the Meliponini or stingless bees. Theory predicts that queens may exhibit higher selection for fecundity in eusocial taxa, but contrary to this, we found mixed patterns of SSD in Meliponini. Non-Melipona species generally have a female-biased SSD, while all analyzed species of Melipona showed a male-biased SSD, indicating that the direction and magnitude of the selective pressures do not operate in the same way for all members of this taxon. The phylogenetic regressions revealed that the rate of divergence has not differed between the two castes of females and the males, that is, stingless bees do not seem to follow Rensch's rule (a slope >1), adding this highly eusocial taxon to the various solitary insect taxa not conforming with it. Noteworthy, when Melipona was removed from the analysis, the phylogenetic regressions for the thorax width of males on queens had a slope significantly smaller than 1, suggesting that the evolutionary divergence has been larger in queens than males, and could be explained by stronger selection on female fecundity only in non-Melipona species. Our results in the stingless bees question the classical explanation of female-biased SSD via fecundity and provide a first evidence of a more complex determination of SSD in highly eusocial species. We suggest that in highly eusocial taxa, additional selection mechanisms, possibly related to individual and colonial interests, could influence the evolution of environmentally determined traits such as body size.

Cover crops and compost prevent weed seed bank buildup in herbicide-free wheat-potato rotations under conservation tillage	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						compost; conservation agriculture; cover crop; organic management; reduced tillage; seed bank; weed dynamic	LONG-TERM TILLAGE; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; MULCHES; FUNGI; SIZE	1. Weeds are a major constraint affecting crop yields in organic farming and weed seed bank analysis can be an important tool for predicting weed infestation and assessing farming system sustainability. 2. We compared the weed seed banks two and four years after transition from conventional to reduced tillage in organically managed winter wheat-potato cropping sequences in two replicated field trials. Experimental factors were either conventional (CT) with moldboard (25 cm) or reduced tillage (RT) with chisel ploughing (5-15 cm). Dead mulch (8-10 cm), consisting of rye-pea or triticale-vetch mixtures, was additionally applied to potatoes in the RT system. In both systems, one-half of the plots received 5 t (ha/year) dry matter of a commercially sold yard waste compost as an organic amendment. Furthermore, subsidiary crops were grown in both systems, either as legume living mulches undersown in wheat or as cover crops sown after wheat. Prior to sowing the wheat and after potatoes, the soil seed bank from 0 to 12.5 and from 12.5 to 25 cm was sampled and assessed in an unheated glasshouse over nine months. The initial weed seed bank size in the topsoil was uniform (4,420 seedlings m(-2)). Two years later, wheat-associated weeds, such as Galium aparine, Lamium spp., and Myosotis arvensis, were 61% higher on average in RT than in CT. This was independent of subsidiary crops used. In contrast, Chenopodium album, a potato-associated weed that depends on intensive tillage, was reduced by 15% in the mulched RT system compared to CT. When RT was combined with cover crops and compost application, the seed bank did not differ significantly from the CT system. We conclude that subsidiary crops, mulches, and potentially compost are important management tools that contribute to the success of RT in herbicide-free cereal-based systems in temperate climates.

In species with bright warning coloration, phenotypic diversity is particularly compelling because many factors, including natural and sexual selection, contribute to intraspecific variation. To better understand the causes of dramatic phenotypic variation in Malagasy poison frogs, we quantified genetic structure and color and pattern variation across three closely related species, Mantella aurantiaca, Mantella crocea, and Mantella milotympanum. Although our restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing approach identified clear genetic clusters, they do not align with current species designations, which has important conservation implications for these imperiled frogs. Moreover, our results suggest that levels of intraspecific color variation within this group have been overestimated, while species diversity has been underestimated. Within major genetic clusters, we observed distinct patterns of variation including: populations that are phenotypically similar yet genetically distinct, populations where phenotypic and genetic breaks coincide, and populations that are genetically similar but have high levels of within-population phenotypic variation. We also detected admixture between two of the major genetic clusters. Our study suggests that several mechanisms-including hybridization, selection, and drift-are contributing to phenotypic diversity. Ultimately, our work underscores the need for a reevaluation of how polymorphic and polytypic populations and species are classified, especially in aposematic organisms.

Changes in the magnitude and frequency of environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature along latitudes can be used by organisms to predict seasonal changes. While the role of temperature variation on the induction of plastic and seasonal responses is well established, the importance of photoperiod for predicting seasonal changes is less explored. Materials and methods Here we studied changes in life-history and thermal stress resistance traits in Drosophila subobscura in response to variation in photoperiod (6:18, 12:12 and 18:6 light:dark cycles) mimicking seasonal variations in day length. The populations of D. subobscura were collected from five locations along a latitudinal gradient (from North Africa and Europe). These populations were exposed to different photoperiods for two generations, whereafter egg-to-adult viability, productivity, dry body weight, thermal tolerance, and starvation resistance were assessed. Results We found strong effects of photoperiod, origin of populations, and their interactions on life-history and stress resistance traits. Thermal resistance varied between the populations and the effect of photoperiod depended on the trait and the method applied for the assessment of thermal resistance. Perspectives Our results show a strong effect of the origin of population and photoperiod on a range of fitness-related traits and provide evidence for local adaptation to environmental cues (photoperiod by population interaction). The findings emphasize an important and often neglected role of photoperiod in studies on thermal resistance and suggest that cues induced by photoperiod may provide some buffer enabling populations to cope with a more variable and unpredictable future climate.

These studies, however, assume the functional importance of the predominant pigment while ignoring that of other minor pigments, and few studies have focused on the composition of these pigments. Using the pheomelanin-based plumage in two swallow species, we studied the allocation of two pigments (the predominant pigment, pheomelanin, and the minor pigment, eumelanin) in relation to physiological properties and viability in populations under a natural and sexual selection. This is indispensable for studying the evolution of pheomelanin-based plumage coloration. Pheomelanin and eumelanin share the same pathway only during their initial stages of development, which can be a key to unravel the functional importance of pigment allocation and thus of plumage coloration. Using the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, a migratory species, we found that plasma testosterone levels increased with increasing the proportion of eumelanin pigments compared with pheomelanin pigments, but not with the amount of pheomelanin pigments, during the mating period. In the Pacific swallow Hirundo tahitica, a nonmigratory congener, we found that, during severe winter weathers, survivors had a proportionally smaller amount of eumelanin pigments compared with pheomelanin pigments than that in nonsurvivors, but no detectable difference was found in the pheomelanin pigmentation itself. These results indicated that a minor pigment, eumelanin, matters at least in some physiological measures and viability. Because the major pigment, pheomelanin, has its own physiological properties, a combination of major and minor pigments provides multiple information to the signal receivers, potentially enhancing the signaling function of pheomelanic coloration and its diversification across habitats.

Rooting alters species composition by opening niches for less-competitive plants and, as a recurrent factor, becomes a part of the community disturbance regime. Vegetation responses to wild boar disturbance have mostly been studied in the boar's non-native range or in native forest, rather than in open habitats in the native range. We investigate the response of open European semidry grassland vegetation dominated by Brachypodium pinnatum to native wild boar pressure in an abandoned agricultural landscape. Methods To describe the disturbance regime, we repeatedly mapped rooted patches during a 5-year period. Additionally, to study the vegetation response, we performed an artificial disturbance experiment by creating 30 pairs of simulated disturbances and undisturbed plots. The vegetation composition of the paired plots was repeatedly sampled five times in eight years of the study. Results Based on repeated mapping of disturbances, we predict that if the disturbance regime we observed during the 5-year period were maintained over the long term, it would yield a stable vegetation ratio consisting of 98.7% of the grassland undisturbed, 0.4% with fresh disturbance, and 0.9% in older successional stages. Vegetation composition in the artificially disturbed plots was continuously converging to that of undisturbed vegetation, but these disturbed plots still differed significantly in composition and had higher species number, even after eight years of succession. Synthesis Our results thus show that wild boar disturbance regime in its native range increases heterogeneity and species diversity of semidry grassland vegetation.

In the present study, we establish an approach to study the genetic structure patterns of two European hedgehog species Erinaceaus europaeus and E. roumanicus. These species are usually associated with human settlements and are good models to study anthropogenic impacts on the genetic diversity of wild populations. The short sequence repeats genotyping by sequence (SSR-GBS) method presented uses amplicon sequences to determine genotypes for which allelic variants can be defined according to both length and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To evaluate whether complete sequence information improved genetic structure definition, we compared this information with datasets based solely on length information. We identified a total of 42 markers which were successfully amplified in both species. Overall, genotyping based on complete sequence information resulted in a higher number of alleles, as well as greater genetic diversity and differentiation between species. Additionally, the structure patterns were slightly clearer with a division between both species and some potential hybrids. There was some degree of genetic structure within species, although only in E. roumanicus was this related to geographical distance. The statistically significant results obtained by SSR-GBS demonstrate that it is superior to electrophoresis-based methods for SSR genotyping. Moreover, the greater reproducibility and throughput with lower effort which can be obtained with SSR-GBS and the possibility to include degraded DNA into the analysis, allow for continued relevance of SSR markers during the genomic era.

Describing and understanding functional syndromes is an important prerequisite for predicting the effects of organisms on ecosystem functioning. At the intraspecific level, functional syndromes have recently been described, but very little is known about their variability among populations and-if they vary-what the ecological and evolutionary drivers of this variation are. Here, we quantified and compared the variability in four functional traits (body mass, metabolic rate, excretion rate, and boldness), their covariations and the subsequent syndromes among thirteen populations of a common freshwater fish (the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus). We then tested whether functional traits and their covariations, as well as the subsequent syndromes, were underpinned by the phylogenetic relatedness among populations (historical effects) or the local environment (i.e., temperature and predation pressure), and whether adaptive (selection or plasticity) or nonadaptive (genetic drift) processes sustained among-population variability. We found substantial among-population variability in functional traits and trait covariations, and in the emerging syndromes. We further found that adaptive mechanisms (plasticity and/or selection) related to water temperature and predation pressure modulated the covariation between body mass and metabolic rate. Other trait covariations were more likely driven by genetic drift, suggesting that nonadaptive processes can also lead to substantial differences in trait covariations among populations. Overall, we concluded that functional syndromes are population-specific, and that both adaptive and nonadaptive processes are shaping functional traits. Given the pivotal role of functional traits, differences in functional syndromes within species provide interesting perspectives regarding the role of intraspecific diversity for ecosystem functioning.

Here, vast areas of sea urchin-dominated barren grounds have shifted back to kelp forests, in parallel with changes in sea temperature and predator abundances. We have compiled data from studies covering more than 1,500-km coastline in northern Norway. The dataset has been used to identify regional patterns in kelp recovery and sea urchin recruitment, and to relate these to abiotic and biotic factors, including structurally complex substrates functioning as refuge for sea urchins. The study area covers a latitudinal gradient of temperature and different levels of predator pressure from the edible crab (Cancer pagurus) and the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus). The population development of these two sea urchin predators and a possible predator on crabs, the coastal cod (Gadus morhua), were analyzed. In the southernmost and warmest region, kelp forests recovery and sea urchin recruitment are mainly low, although sea urchins might also be locally abundant. Further north, sea urchin barrens still dominate, and juvenile sea urchin densities are high. In the northernmost and cold region, kelp forests are recovering, despite high recruitment and densities of sea urchins. Here, sea urchins were found only in refuge habitats, whereas kelp recovery occurred mainly on open bedrock. The ocean warming, the increase in the abundance of edible crab in the south, and the increase in invasive red king crab in the north may explain the observed changes in kelp recovery and sea urchin distribution. The expansion of both crab species coincided with a population decline in the top-predator coastal cod. The role of key species (sea urchins, kelp, cod, and crabs) and processes involved in structuring the community are hypothesized in a conceptual model, and the knowledge behind the suggested links and interactions is explored.

Previous investigations do, however, suggest that the impacts of biotic interactions (epibiosis and competition) and increased water turbidity are important. We investigated the depth-related patterns of growth, epibiosis, and mortality in two sample populations of kelp, from the south and the southwest coast of Norway. The investigations were performed over a period of seven months, in a crossed translocational study, where kelps were mounted on rigs at six depths (1, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 m). In a second experiment, the amounts of light blocked by different epibiont layers growing on the kelp frond were investigated. While growth decreased with depth in spring and summer, the kelp grew faster at 15 m than at shallower depths in fall. Survival was low both in shallow water and below 15 m depth. Epibionts covered the kelp growing at depths from 1 to 9 m, and the laboratory study showed that the coverage may have deprived the individuals of as much as 90% of the available light. Although the depth-related results we present apply-in the strictest sense-only to kelp translocated on rigs, we argue that the relative patterns are relevant for natural populations. Growth and survival of S. latissima is likely to be reduced by heavy loads of epibionts, while depths where epibionts are sparse may be close to the lower limit of the kelps depth distribution along the south coast of Norway. This suggests that a vertical squeeze, or narrowing of the distribution range of kelp forests may be occurring in Norway.

Getting ready for the winter: Timing and determinants of molt in an alpine ungulate	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						aging; allocation; hair growth; mountain goat; resources availability	FEMALE MOUNTAIN GOATS; FECAL TESTOSTERONE; BIGHORN SHEEP; FIBER GROWTH; REPRODUCTION; AGE; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; PELAGE; COSTS	Because growth of new hairs entails energetic costs, individual condition and access to food should determine the timing of molt. Previous studies on the timing of molt in ungulates have mostly focused on the influence of age class and reproductive status, but the effects of body condition and environmental phenology have not been evaluated. Our goal was to assess how intrinsic traits and environmental conditions determine the timing of winter coat shedding in a mountain goat population monitored for 27 years. The date of molt completion followed a U shape with age, suggesting that senescence occurs in terms of the molting process in mountain goats. Juveniles of both sexes delayed molting in a similar fashion, but molt timing differed between sexes during adulthood. Males molted progressively earlier until reaching age when reproduction peaked, after which they started delaying molting again. Females reached earliest molt dates at age of first reproduction and then progressively delayed molt date. Lactating females molted 10 days later than barren females on average, but this only occurred in females in good condition. Thus, although it has been shown that reproduction delays molt in ungulates, our results indicate that body condition can override this effect. Overall, our results revealed that access to both extrinsic and intrinsic resources is one of the key mechanisms driving molting processes in a mammalian herbivore.

Natural selection contributes to geographic patterns of thermal plasticity in Plantago lanceolata	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						genetic drift; geographic clines; natural selection; phenotypic plasticity; temperature; thermal plasticity	ADAPTIVE PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; LOCAL ADAPTATION; GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; DIVERGENT SELECTION; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT; MOUNTAIN PASSES; RAPID EVOLUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE	A long-standing debate in evolutionary biology concerns the relative importance of different evolutionary forces in explaining phenotypic diversification at large geographic scales. For example, natural selection is typically assumed to underlie divergence along environmental gradients. However, neutral evolutionary processes can produce similar patterns. We collected molecular genetic data from 14 European populations of Plantago lanceolata to test the contributions of natural selection versus neutral evolution to population divergence in temperature-sensitive phenotypic plasticity of floral reflectance. In P. lanceolata, reflectance plasticity is positively correlated with latitude/altitude. We used population pairwise comparisons between neutral genetic differentiation (F-ST and Jost's D) and phenotypic differentiation (P-ST) to assess the contributions of geographic distance and environmental parameters of the reproductive season in driving population divergence. Data are consistent with selection having shaped large-scale geographic patterns in thermal plasticity. The aggregate pattern of P-ST versus F-ST was consistent with divergent selection. F-ST explained thermal plasticity differences only when geographic distance was not included in the model. Differences in the extent of cool reproductive season temperatures, and not overall temperature variation, explained plasticity differences independent of distance. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that thermal plasticity is adaptive where growing seasons are shorter and cooler, that is, at high latitude/altitude.

Compensatory and additive helper effects in the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						additive care; compensatory care; cooperative breeding; investment strategies; load-lightening; parental care; Seychelles warbler	REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; INVESTMENT STRATEGIES; PARENTAGE ASSIGNMENT; AEGITHALOS-CAUDATUS; MATERNAL INVESTMENT; FEMALE BREEDERS; FAIRY-WRENS; LONG-TERM; CARE; BENEFITS	In cooperatively breeding species, care provided by helpers may affect the dominant breeders' investment trade-offs between current and future reproduction. By negatively compensating for such additional care, breeders can reduce costs of reproduction and improve their own chances of survival. Alternatively, helper care can be additive to that of dominants, increasing the fledging fitness of the current brood. However, the influence helpers have on brood care may be affected by group size and territory quality. Therefore, the impact of helping needs to be disentangled from other factors determining offspring investment before conclusive inferences about the effect of help on additive and compensatory care can be made. We used 20 years of provisioning data to investigate the effect of helping on provisioning rates in the facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis. Our extensive dataset allowed us to statistically disentangle the effects of helper presence, living in larger groups and different food availability. We show compensatory and additive care (i.e., partial compensation) in response to helper provisioning. Helpers lightened the provisioning load of the dominant male and female and increased total provisioning to nestlings. This was irrespective of group size or territory quality (food availability). Moreover, our results illustrate sex-specific variation in parental care over the course of the breeding event. We discriminate between temporal variation, group size, and territory quality processes affecting cooperative care and as such, gain further insight into the importance of these factors to the evolutionary maintenance of helping behavior.

Behavioural plasticity modulates temperature-related constraints on foraging time for a montane mammal	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive capacity; behavioural flexibility; climate variability; food cache; foraging behaviour; global warming; pika; reaction norm	PIKAS OCHOTONA; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMERICAN PIKA; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; THERMOREGULATION; RESPONSES; PHYSIOLOGY; STRATEGY; VULNERABILITY	Contemporary climate change is altering temperature profiles across the globe. Increasing temperatures can reduce the amount of time during which conditions are suitable for animals to engage in essential activities, such as securing food. Behavioural plasticity, the ability to alter behaviour in response to the environment, may provide animals with a tool to adjust to changes in the availability of suitable thermal conditions. The extent to which individuals can alter fitness-enhancing behaviours, such as food collection, to proximately buffer variation in temperature, however, remains unclear. Even less well understood are the potential performance advantages of flexible strategies among endotherms. We examined the degree to which individuals altered rates of food collection in response to temperature, and two potential benefits, using the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a temperature-sensitive, food-hoarding mammal, as a model. From July-September 2013-2015, we used motion-activated cameras and in situ temperature loggers to examine pika food-caching activity for 72 individuals across 10 sites in the central Rocky Mountains, USA. We quantified % nitrogen by cache volume as a metric of cache quality, and the number of events during which pikas were active in temperatures >= 25 degrees C as a measure of potential thermoregulatory stress. We found a strong negative effect of temperature on the rate at which pikas cached food. Individual responses to temperature varied substantially in both the level of food-collecting activity and in the degree to which individuals shifted activity with warming temperature. After accounting for available foraging time, individuals that exhibited greater plasticity collected a comparable amount of nitrogen, while simultaneously experiencing fewer occasions in which temperatures eclipsed estimated thermal tolerances. By varying food-collection norms of reaction, individuals were able to plastically respond to temperature-driven reductions in foraging time. Through this increased flexibility, individuals amassed food caches of comparable quality, while minimizing exposure to potentially stressful thermal conditions. Our results suggest that, given sufficient resource quality and availability, plasticity in foraging activity may help temperature-limited endotherms adjust to climate-related constraints on foraging time.

Salmonid species diversity predicts salmon consumption by terrestrial wildlife	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						black bear; competition; foraging; grizzly bear; resource waves; salmon; stable isotope analysis; Ursus	BEARS URSUS-ARCTOS; KODIAK BROWN BEARS; PACIFIC SALMON; POPULATION DIVERSITY; BLACK BEARS; BODY-SIZE; ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE; STABLE-ISOTOPES; SOCKEYE-SALMON; SYNCHRONIZATION	Resource waves-spatial variation in resource phenology that extends feeding opportunities for mobile consumers-can affect the behaviour and productivity of recipient populations. Interspecific diversity among Pacific salmon species (Oncorhynchus spp.) creates staggered spawning events across space and time, thereby prolonging availability to terrestrial wildlife. We sought to understand how such variation might influence consumption by terrestrial predators compared with resource abundance and intra- and interspecific competition. Using stable isotope analysis, we investigated how the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of male black bears (Ursus americanus; n = 405) varies with species diversity and density of spawning salmon biomass, while also accounting for competition with sympatric black and grizzly bears (U. arctos horribilis), in coastal British Columbia, Canada. We found that the proportion of salmon in the annual diet of black bears was approximate to 40% higher in the absence of grizzly bears, but detected little effect of relative black bear density and salmon biomass density. Rather, salmon diversity had the largest positive effect on consumption. On average, increasing diversity from one salmon species to similar to four (with equal biomass contributions) approximately triples the proportion of salmon in diet. Given the importance of salmon to bear life histories, this work provides early empirical support for how resource waves may increase the productivity of consumers at population and landscape scales. Accordingly, terrestrial wildlife management might consider maintaining not only salmon abundance but also diversity.

One example for such a detrimental effect is the parasitic copepod Mytilicola intestinalis that infected blue mussels Mytilus edulis after being introduced into the North Sea in the early 20th century. Since 1949, the parasite was blamed for multiple mass mortalities of infested blue mussels but evidence for a direct causal involvement of M. intestinalis remained circumstantial. Here, we now examine the potential effects of primary infections by the invasive parasite on the susceptibility to secondary infections with virulent bacteria (Vibrio spp.) in a full factorial infection experiment combining parasite infection (control vs. infected) with different Vibrio infection treatments (control, bath challenge, injection) in environmental conditions that either favoured the host (ambient temperature) or the bacterium (elevated temperature). The influence of primary and secondary infections on cellular immunity (phagocytosis) and Vibrio load in the haemolymph was used to correlate these results to host survival. Our results suggest that the rate of secondary Vibrio infection is increased due to lower efficiency of the cellular immune response. As a consequence, the failure of clearing Vibrio from the haemolymph might increase mortality of mussels infected by M. intestinalis. This demonstrates that indirect effects of parasite invasions can outweigh direct effects of the infection highlighting the need for a more integrative approach to understand and predict the consequences of parasite invasions.

Do spatial scale and life history affect fish-habitat relationships?	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Australia; landscape ecology; reef fish; scale of effect; spatial grain	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BODY-SIZE; REEF; CORAL; ASSEMBLAGES; PATTERNS; GENERALITY; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; MARINE	Understanding how animals interact with their environment is a fundamental ecological question with important implications for conservation and management. The relationships between animals and their habitat, however, can be scale-dependent. If ecologists work at suboptimal spatial scales, they will gain an incomplete picture of how animals respond to the landscape. Identifying the scale at which animal-landscape relationships are strongest (the "scale of effect") will improve our ability to better plan management and conservation activities. Several recent studies have greatly enhanced our knowledge about the scale of effect, and the potential drivers of interspecific variability, in particular life-history traits. However, while many marine systems are inherently multiscalar, research into the scale of effect has been mainly focussed on terrestrial taxa. As the scales of observation in fish-habitat association studies are often selected based on convention rather than biological reasoning, they may provide an incomplete picture of the scales where these associations are strongest. We examined fish-habitat associations across four nested spatial scales in a temperate reef system to ask: (a) at what scale are fish-habitat associations the strongest, (b) are habitat elements consistently important across scales, and (c) do scale-dependent fish-habitat associations vary in relation to either body size, geographic range size or trophic level? We found that: (a) the strongest fish-habitat associations were observed when these relationships were examined at considerably larger spatial scales than usually investigated; (b) the importance of environmental predictors varied across spatial scales, indicating that conclusions about the importance of habitat elements will depend on the scales at which studies are undertaken; and (c) scale-dependent fish-habitat associations were consistent across all life-history traits. Our results highlight the importance of considering how animals relate to their environment and suggest the small scales often chosen to examine fish-habitat associations are likely to be suboptimal. Developing a more mechanistic understanding of animal-habitat associations will greatly aid in predicting and managing responses to future anthropogenic disturbances.

Energetic investment associated with vitellogenesis induces an oxidative cost of reproduction	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						antioxidants; free glycerol; reactive oxygen metabolites; reptile; triglycerides	CYCLURA-CYCHLURA-INORNATA; ROCK IGUANA CYCLURA; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; FREE-RADICALS; STRESS; HISTORY; ANTIOXIDANTS; OXIDANTS; MECHANISMS; ECOLOGY	Oxidative stress is a potential cost of reproduction, but conclusive evidence for this relationship is lacking. The goal of this study was to serially assess across a seasonal gradient the relationship between reproduction, circulating plasma energy metabolites and oxidative state. Here, we examine a study animal ideally suited to test for the oxidative costs of reproduction: the Allen Cays Rock Iguana. Female rock iguanas reproduce at varying frequencies, often skipping years, allowing for a comparison between reproductive and non-reproductive females during the same narrow, annual breeding season. This feature of iguana life history enabled us to address not just sex and seasonal differences in physiology, but also potential oxidative costs of reproduction in females. Male and female iguanas were sampled during the early (vitellogenic), late (gravid) and post-reproductive seasons. Ultrasound examinations were performed on females to quantify reproductive investment, and blood samples were collected for physiology assays, which included reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), antioxidants, triglycerides, free glycerol and glucose. The early reproductive season was characterized by significant increases in reproductive female's triglycerides, free glycerol and oxidative stress compared to late and post-reproductive periods and non-reproductive females and males during all sampling periods. Antioxidants were significantly elevated during the early reproductive season for reproductive females, non-reproductive females and males when compared to late and post-season. Follicle number in early reproductive females was positively related to d-ROMs, triglycerides and free glycerol, negatively related to antioxidants and showed no relationship with glucose. Measures of oxidative stress, d-ROMs and oxidative index were positively correlated with circulating levels of the lipid metabolite free glycerol during the early reproductive period, but this relationship weakened in the late season and disappeared in the post-season. Broadly, this study supports the hypothesis that the relationship between reproduction and oxidative stress is driven by energy investment, being greatest during early reproduction when vitellogenesis is occurring.

Proximate determinants of Taylor's law slopes	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						population dynamics; skewness; spatial Taylor's law; synchrony; temporal Taylor's law; variance	SPATIAL SYNCHRONY; TEMPORAL STABILITY; POWER-LAW; SKEWED DISTRIBUTIONS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; VARIABILITY; ABUNDANCE; VARIANCE; BEHAVIOR; ROLES	Taylor's law (TL), a commonly observed and applied pattern in ecology, describes variances of population densities as related to mean densities via log(variance) = log(a) + b*log(mean). Variations among datasets in the slope, b, have been associated with multiple factors of central importance in ecology, including strength of competitive interactions and demographic rates. But these associations are not transparent, and the relative importance of these and other factors for TL slope variation is poorly studied. TL is thus a ubiquitously used indicator in ecology, the understanding of which is still opaque. The goal of this study was to provide tools to help fill this gap in understanding by providing proximate determinants of TL slopes, statistical quantities that are correlated to TL slopes but are simpler than the slope itself and are more readily linked to ecological factors. Using numeric simulations and 82 multi-decadal population datasets, we here propose, test and apply two proximate statistical determinants of TL slopes which we argue can become key tools for understanding the nature and ecological causes of TL slope variation. We find that measures based on population skewness, coefficient of variation and synchrony are effective proximate determinants. We demonstrate their potential for application by using them to help explain covariation in slopes of spatial and temporal TL (two common types of TL). This study provides tools for understanding TL, and demonstrates their usefulness.

Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Saturated Riparian Buffers: Are We Trading a Water Quality Problem for an Air Quality Problem?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; TILE DRAINAGE; SUBSURFACE-DRAINAGE; NITRATE-NITROGEN; DENITRIFICATION; REMOVAL; STREAM; BIOREACTORS; DIVERSITY; SEDIMENT	Reestablishing perennial vegetation along riparian areas in agroecosystems reduces nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural lands. However, subsurface (tile) drains bypass traditional buffers routing the majority of shallow groundwater straight to surface waters, limiting their nutrient removal capabilities. Saturated riparian buffers (SRBs) reconnect subsurface drainage water with the soil profile to remove NO3 in tile water through microbial denitrification. One concern of enhancing denitrification on agricultural landscapes is the potential increase in N2O emissions from incomplete denitrification. Our objective was to compare N2O emissions from SRBs to traditional buffers and bordering crop fields at two sites, Bear Creek Site 1 and Iowa Site 1, in Central Iowa. We measured N2O emissions directly from the soil surface and dissolved in shallow groundwater and estimated indirect emissions from downstream denitrification from 2015 through 2017. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil surfaces were greatest from fertilized corn (Zea mays L.). Saturated riparian buffers were only significantly greater (P < 0.05) than traditional buffers in one out of six site-years. Dissolved N2O in shallow groundwater seeping from SRBs was not significantly greater (P < 0.05) than dissolved N2O from the tile outlet among site years. Indirect N2O emissions from rivers and estuaries were significantly reduced from NO3 removal in both SRBs. Overall, total N2O emissions from SRBs were similar to those from traditional buffers and less than those from fertilized corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] agriculture. Replacing cultivated land in riparian areas with a SRB has shown potential to subsequently remove NO3 from surface waters and reduce N2O emissions from agricultural landscapes.

Management Options to Reduce Phosphorus Leaching from Vegetated Buffer Strips	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							MITIGATION OPTIONS; WATER-QUALITY; STREAM; RETENTION; EUTROPHICATION; AVAILABILITY; RESTORATION; PROTECTION; GRASSLAND; RELEASE	Vegetated buffer strips (VBS) between agricultural areas and surface waters are important retention areas for eroded particulate P through which they may obtain critically high degrees of P saturation imposing high risk of soluble P leaching. We tested topsoil removal and three harvesting frequencies (once, twice, or four times per year) of natural buffer vegetation to reduce P leaching with the aim to offset erosional P accumulation and high degrees of P saturation. We used a simple numerical time-step model to estimate changes in VBS soil P levels with and without harvest. Harvesting offset erosional deposition as it resulted in an annual ammonium oxalate-extractable P reduction of 0.3 to 2.8% (25-cm topsoil content) in soils of the VBS and thus, with time, reduced potential P leaching below a baseline of 50 mg L-1. Topsoil removal only marginally reduced potential leaching at two sites and not anywhere near this baseline. The harvest frequency only marginally affected the annual P removal, making single annual harvests the most economical. We estimate 50 to 300 yr to reach the P leaching baseline, due to substantial amounts of P accumulated in the soils. Even in high-erosion-risk situations in our study, harvesting reduced soil P content and the P leaching risk. We suggest harvesting as a practical and efficient management to combat P leaching from agricultural VBS, not just for short-term reductions of dissolved P, but also for reductions of the total soil P pool and for possible multiple benefits for VBS.

A common feature of all the studied IBZ sites is that tile drainage, which previously discharged directly into the streams, is now intercepted within the IBZ. Specifically, the design of IBZs combines a pond, where soil particles present in drain water or surface runoff can be deposited, and a planted subsurface flow infiltration zone. Together, these two components should provide an optimum environment for microbial processes and plant uptake of nutrients. Nutrient reduction capacities, biodiversity enhancement, and biomass production functions were assessed with different emphasis across 11 IBZ sites located in Denmark, Great Britain, and Sweden. Despite the small size of the buffer zones (250-800 m(2)) and thus the small proportion of the drained catchment (mostly <1%), these studies cumulatively suggest that IBZs are effective enhancements to traditional buffer zones, as they (i) reduce total N and P loads to small streams and rivers, (ii) act as valuable improved habitats for aquatic and amphibian species, and (iii) offer economic benefits by producing fastgrowing wetland plant biomass. Based on our assessment of the pilot sites, guidance is provided on the implementation and management of IBZs within agricultural landscapes.

In Situ Denitrification in Saturated Riparian Buffers	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							DRAINAGE WATER MANAGEMENT; ORGANIC-MATTER; TILE DRAINAGE; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; NITROGEN REMOVAL; COVER CROPS; HOT MOMENTS; SOIL; NITRATE; CARBON	Excess NO3 leaching from the agricultural Midwest via tile drainage water has contributed to both local drinking water and national Gulf of Mexico benthic hypoxia concerns. Both in-field and edge-of-field practices have been designed to help mitigate NO3 flux to surface waters. Edge-of-field practices focus on maximizing microbial denitrification, the conversion of NO3 to N-2 gas. This study assessed denitrification rates from two saturated riparian buffers (SRBs) for 2 yr and a third SRB for 1 yr, for a total of five sample years. These SRBs were created by diverting NO3-rich tile drainage water into riparian buffers soils. The SRBs in this study removed between 27 and 96% of the total diverted NO3 load. Measured cumulative average denitrification rate for each SRB sample year accounted for between 3.7 and 77.3% of the total NO3 removed. Both the cumulative maximum and 90% confidence interval denitrification rates accounted for all of the NO3 removed by the SRBs in three of the five sample years, indicating that denitrification can be a dominant NO3 removal mechanism in this edge-of-field practice. When adding the top 20 cm of each core to the cumulative denitrification rates for each SRB, denitrification accounted for between 33 and over 100% of the total NO3 removed. Buffer age (time since establishment) was speculated to enhance denitrification rates, and there was a trend of the soil closer to the surface making up the majority of the total denitrification rate. Finally, both NO3 and C could limit denitrification in these SRBs.

Mulch-Derived Organic Carbon Stimulates High Denitrification Fluxes from Agricultural Ditch Sediments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							DISSIMILATORY NITRATE REDUCTION; NITROUS-OXIDE PRODUCTION; COMPOST FILTER SOCKS; GULF-OF-MEXICO; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; FRESH-WATER; REMOVAL; STREAM	Reactive N is an essential input for healthy, vibrant crop production, yet excess N is often transported off field via agricultural ditches to downstream receiving ecosystems, where it can cause negative impacts to human health, biodiversity loss, as well as eutrophication and resultant hypoxia. Denitrification, the transformation of reactive N to unreactive N-2 gas, within agricultural ditches has potential to reduce impacts to downstream ecosystems but requires substantial organic C substrates. We used a flow-through intact core experiment to test the effects of low-cost management options including a common agricultural amendment, gypsum, and an overlying hardwood mulch layer on promoting denitrification within agricultural ditch sediments. We found significantly higher denitrification potentials in mulch (11.2 mg N-2-N (-2) h(-1)) and mulch-gypsum cores (9.2 mg N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)) than in gypsum (1.3 mg N-2 -N m(-2) h(-1)) or control cores (0.6 mg N-2-Nm(-2) h(-1)). Higher denitrification rates corresponded with high dissolved organic C (DOC) fluxes within the mulch and mulch-gypsum treatments (72.8-115.2 mgm(-2) h(-1)) and were ultimately able to remove 65 to 69% of N loads. Results indicate DOC from overlying mulch additions to agricultural ditches significantly increase denitrification in intact cores and suggest that the addition of DOC sources in agricultural ditches may contribute a simple, low-cost option to reduce reactive N export and improve ecological outcomes within aquatic agroecosystems.

Infiltration rate, plant growth response, and turbidity of the effluent were also measured. The BSMs were made from a range of types and rates of composts and additional materials such as water treatment residuals, sawdust, and oyster shells. Sand was used as a control. Total N and P in stormwater measured 1.8 +/- 1 and 0.08 +/- 0.03 mg L-1. All treatments were a source of these nutrients. Metal concentrations in the stormwater were low, with mean Cu and Zn concentrations of 39.8 +/- 19.1 and 173 +/- 113 mu g L-1, and Cd and Pb close to detection limits. All treatments absorbed Cu and Zn from stormwater with varying levels of removal efficiency. The three treatments tested removed 84 to 100% of the PAHs from the stormwater. In general, contaminant removal (N, P, and Zn) efficiency was not related to infiltration rate, with a slight decrease in Cu removal efficiency observed with increased infiltration rate (R-2 = 0.32). These results indicate that the BSMs tested were a source of nutrients but were generally effective at removing metals and PAHs from stormwater.

To this purpose, we examined the effect of location (i.e., three different levels of pollution), substrate (peat moss and vermiculite), and plant species (oilseed rape [Brassica napus L.] and kale [Brassica oleracea L.]) on the accumulation of trace elements on leaves. A total of 36 samples of unwashed leaves were digested with HNO3-H2O2 and analyzed for 27 elements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Considering the location, plants exposed next to the road showed higher contents of traffic-related elements, and additionally, outdoors samples were enriched in marine aerosol ions. Cadmium and Pb concentrations did not exceed the European legal maximum levels for vegetables, so their consumption would be safe for human health. Results support the hypothesis that edible plants such as kale and rapeseed could be used as bioindicators of atmospheric pollution.

These efforts are driven by the need to quickly determine whether waters are contaminated and may pose excessive public health risks. In situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrometers have been used to monitor levels of multiple contaminants in surface waters by relating the absorption spectra to the measured concentrations using regression models. In this study, three different regression models were tested to see if spectroscopy could be used to rapidly predict Escherichia coli concentrations in a freshwater stream. The regression models did not produce acceptable results when tested for all of the samples collected during an 11-mo period (R-2 < 0.2). When divided into multiple subsets based on temperature, concentration, or rainfall, models produced adequate results for subsets of samples collected in the cooler months (R-2 = 0.72) or on days when rainfall occurred (R-2 = 0.58). Pairing a UV-vis spectrometer with regression models did not result in a model that could be used to estimate E. coli levels throughout the year, but the results promote further testing of this method when flow data is available in freshwaters, on beaches where rainfall causes elevated bacteria levels, and in shellfish growing waters.

Although mycorrhizal fungi do not degrade petroleum, they are a very good example of beneficial soil microorganisms that improve both the growth and vitality of plants and may enhance their bioremediation activity. In this work, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were investigated in sites containing soil exposed to the long-term presence of petroleum. These sites are located in southern Poland (Carpathians), where remnants of commercial oil exploitation in the 19th century and natural petroleum seeps can be found. The mean concentrations of mineral oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH16) in the soil were 46473 mu g x g(-1) d.w. and 138 mu g x g(-1) d.w., respectively. Roots of collected petroleum-tolerant plants were analyzed using light microscopy and the associated AMF were identified by sequencing the 18S rRNA SSU genes. Most of these plants showed the presence of mycorrhizal colonization. 11 AMF phylotypes were identified: Acaulospora sp., Archaeospora sp., Claroideoglomus sp., Diversispora sp., Rhizophagus intraradices, R. iranicus; plus five groups that could not be unambiguously identified. The results of this study provide additional insight into the diversity of beneficial fungi that interact with plants which survive in a hostile environment. The data obtained are the first steps towards the application of well-adapted AMF to the bioremediation of hydrocarbon-polluted soils.

We address this gap by investigating associations between belowground traits and metrics of species dynamics. Our analysis included 85 species from a long-term data set on the transition from old field to forest in eastern North America (the Buell-Small Succession Study) and the new Fine-Root Ecology Database. Given the prominent roles of life form (woody vs. non-woody) and species origin (native vs. exotic) in defining functional relationships, we also assessed whether traits or their relationships with species dynamics differed for these groups. Species that reached their peak abundance early in succession had fine-root traits corresponding to resource acquisitive strategies (i.e., they were thinner, less dense, and had higher nitrogen concentrations) while species that peaked progressively later had increasingly conservative strategies. In addition to having more acquisitive root traits than native species, exotics diverged from the above successional trend, having consistently thinner fine roots regardless of the community context. Species with more acquisitive fine-root morphologies typically had faster rates of abundance increase and achieved their maximal rates in fewer years. Decreasing soil nutrient availability and increasing belowground competition may become increasingly strong filters in successional communities, acting on root traits to promote a transition from acquisitive to conservative foraging. However, disturbances that increase light and soil resource availability at local scales may allow acquisitive species, especially invasive exotics, to continue colonizing late into the community transition to forest.

Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species-richness-biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species-richness-biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species-richness-biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species-richness-biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species-richness-biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration.

We explored the response of major pollinator guilds to fire severity, across a fire-severity gradient at different spatial scales. We show that the abundance of all pollinator groups responded to fire severity, and that bees and beetles showed in addition a significant species-diversity response. Bees, sawflies, and wasps responded to fire severity at relatively small spatial scales (250-300 m), whereas flies and beetles responded at larger spatial scales. The response of bees, sawflies, and wasps was unimodal, as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, whereas flies and beetles showed a negative response. A possible explanation is that the observed patterns (spatial scale and type of response) are driven by taxa-specific ecological and life-history traits, such as nesting preference and body size, as well as the availability of resources in the postfire landscape. Our observational study provides an insight into the effect of fire severity on pollinators. However, future research exploring the explicit link between the pre- and postfire landscape structure and pollinator traits and responses is required for further establishment and understanding of cause-effect relationships.

On the one hand, studies of plant-plant interactions rarely consider how plants interact with other trophic levels such as pollinators. On the other, studies of plant-animal interactions rarely deal with interactions within trophic levels such as plant-plant competition and facilitation. Thus, to what degree plant interactions affect biodiversity and ecological networks across trophic levels is poorly understood. We manipulated plant communities driven by foundation species facilitation and sampled plant-pollinator networks at fine spatial scale in a field experiment in Sierra Nevada, Spain. We found that plant-plant facilitation shaped pollinator diversity and structured pollination networks. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions on pollinator diversity and interaction diversity were synergistic in one foundation species networks while they were additive in another foundation species. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions were due to rewiring of pollination interactions. In addition, plant facilitation had negative effects on the structure of pollination networks likely due to increase in plant competition for pollination. Our results empirically demonstrate how different network types are coupled, revealing pervasive consequences of interaction chains in diverse communities.

Evaluating consumptive and nonconsumptive predator effects on prey density using field time-series data	ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bythotrephes longimanus; Daphnia mendotae; iterated filtering; Laurentian Great Lakes; nonconsumptive effects; predator-prey interaction	VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; LAKE-MICHIGAN; POPULATION-GROWTH; BYTHOTREPHES; INVERTEBRATE; DYNAMICS; LANDSCAPE; INFERENCE; INVASION; SHIFTS	Determining the degree to which predation affects prey abundance in natural communities constitutes a key goal of ecological research. Predators can affect prey through both consumptive effects (CEs) and nonconsumptive effects (NCEs), although the contributions of each mechanism to the density of prey populations remain largely hypothetical in most systems. Common statistical methods applied to time-series data cannot elucidate the mechanisms responsible for hypothesized predator effects on prey density (e.g., differentiate CEs from NCEs), nor can they provide parameters for predictive models. State-space models (SSMs) applied to time-series data offer a way to meet these goals. Here, we employ SSMs to assess effects of an invasive predatory zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus, on an important prey species, Daphnia mendotae, in Lake Michigan. We fit mechanistic models in an SSM framework to seasonal time series (1994-2012) using a recently developed, maximum-likelihood-based optimization method, iterated filtering, which can overcome challenges in ecological data (e.g., nonlinearities, measurement error, and irregular sampling intervals). Our results indicate that B. longimanus strongly influences D. mendotae dynamics, with mean annual peak densities of B. longimanus observed in Lake Michigan estimated to cause a 61% reduction in D. mendotae population growth rate and a 59% reduction in peak biomass density. Further, the observed B. longimanus effect is most consistent with an NCE via reduced birth rates. The SSM approach also provided estimates for key biological parameters (e.g., demographic rates) and the contribution of dynamic stochasticity and measurement error. Our study therefore provides evidence derived directly from survey data that the invasive zooplankter B. longimanus is affecting zooplankton demographics and offer parameter estimates needed to inform predictive models that explore the effect of B. longimanus under different scenarios, such as climate change.

Disentangling the functional trait correlates of spatial aggregation in tropical forest trees	ECOLOGY			English	Article						community assembly; dispersal limitation; diversity maintenance; environmental filtering; leaf hydraulics; leaf toughness; spatial point process modeling	SEED DISPERSAL; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; PATTERNS; DISTRIBUTIONS; DIVERSITY; POINT; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS; MAINTENANCE; MECHANISMS	Environmental filtering and dispersal limitation can both maintain diversity in plant communities by aggregating conspecifics, but parsing the contribution of each process has proven difficult empirically. Here, we assess the contribution of filtering and dispersal limitation to the spatial aggregation patterns of 456 tree species in a hyperdiverse Amazonian forest and find distinct functional trait correlates of interspecific variation in these processes. Spatial point process model analysis revealed that both mechanisms are important drivers of intraspecific aggregation for the majority of species. Leaf drought tolerance was correlated with species topographic distributions in this aseasonal rainforest, showing that future increases in drought severity could significantly impact community structure. In addition, seed mass was associated with the spatial scale and density of dispersal-related aggregation. Taken together, these results suggest environmental filtering and dispersal limitation act in concert to influence the spatial and functional structure of diverse forest communities.

Despite its importance to the theory and application of population ecology, and to conservation biology, quantifying the role and strength of density dependence is particularly challenging. We present a hierarchical formulation of the temporal symmetry approach, also known as the Pradel model, that permits estimation of the strength of density dependence from capture-mark-reencounter data. A measure of relative population size is built in the model and serves to detect density dependence directly on population growth rate. The model is also extended to account for temporal random variability in demographic rates, allowing estimation of the temporal variance of population growth rate unexplained by density dependence. We thus present a model-based approach that enable to test and quantify the effect of density-dependent and density-independent factors affecting population fluctuations in a single modeling framework. More generally, we use this modeling framework along with simulated and empirical data to show the value of including density dependence when modeling individual encounter data without the need for auxiliary data.

Individual and temporal variation in pathogen load predicts long-term impacts of an emerging infectious disease	ECOLOGY			English	Article						disease burden; long-periodicity oscillation; population viability; Tasmanian devil; transmissible cancer; wildlife health	FACIAL-TUMOR DISEASE; APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; TRANSMISSION DYNAMICS; WITHIN-HOST; DEVIL; MODEL; EVOLUTION; INFERENCE; SELECTION; HISTORY	Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We used individual-based modeling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed approximate Bayesian computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and demographic system properties derived from 10 yr of data after disease emergence, enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics (initial dynamics after disease emergence). Only 21% of matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 yr following devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 yr, usually with long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of Tasmanian devil populations. This is because strong population declines of devils after disease emergence do not necessarily translate into long-term population declines at equilibria. Our modeling approach is widely applicable to other host-pathogen systems to predict disease impact beyond transient dynamics.

Environmental Na levels vary with proximity to coasts, local geomorphology, climate, and with anthropogenic inputs (e.g., road salt). We tested two key predictions across 54 grasslands in North America: Na shortfall commonly limits herbivore abundance, and the magnitude of this limitation varies inversely with environmental Na supplies. We tested them with a distributed pulse experiment and evaluated the relative importance of Na limitation to other classic drivers of climate, macronutrient levels, and plant productivity. Herbivore abundance increased by 45% with Na addition. Moreover, the magnitude of increase on Na addition plots decreased with increasing levels of plant Na, indicating Na satiation at sites with high Na concentrations in plant tissue. Our results demonstrate that invertebrate primary consumers are often Na limited and track local Na availability, with implications for the geography of invertebrate abundance and herbivory.

Habitats and cardinal directions are key variables structuring spider leaf litter assemblages under Searsia lancea	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Orientation; Position; Aspect; Soil; Sifting; Grassland	SOUTHERN FREE STATE; COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION; VEGETATION ECOLOGY; SCALE; CONSERVATION; PREDATORS; DIVERSITY; FORESTS; GRASSHOPPERS	Spiders are a prominent component of leaf litter assemblages, where they function as critical predators of other invertebrates. We investigated the influence of habitat, cardinal directions and position on Searsia lancea litter-dwelling spider assemblages in central South Africa. A total of 1521 spiders were collected, representing 27 families and 77 species. Species richness, abundance and coverage per tree were highest in the grassland, followed by the hillside and riparian habitats. Neither of the finer scale filters, direction nor position, had significant effects on species richness or abundance, although there was weak evidence for an increase in spider abundance toward the periphery of a tree (p = 0.09) and a decrease in abundance towards the western cardinal direction (p = 0.08). Species composition, though, was significantly affected by habitat (p = 0.001) and direction (p = 0.014), as well as a three way-interaction between habitat, direction and position (p = 0.01). Hillside assemblage structure is intermediate between the other two habitats. Species abundance distributions of all three habitats were multimodal, indicating disturbance. Particularly, the log-series distribution of both the grassland and riparian woodland point to more disturbed assemblages than the hillside (Poisson log-normal distribution). Habitat therefore played a significant role in affecting richness, abundance and assemblage structure (composition and abundance). Although finer scale variables only had a weak effect on abundance, spider assemblages were influenced by direction, particularly for the climatically more variable habitats of the grassland and hillside. The significantly higher evenness and less disturbed nature of the hillside emphasize the conservation significance of this habitat.	[Haddad, Charles R.; de Jager, Linde J.

Co-introduction success of monogeneans infecting the fisheries target Limnothrissa miodon differs between two non-native areas: the potential of parasites as a tag for introduction pathway	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Lake Kivu; Lake Kariba; Comparative morphometrics; Intraspecific variability; Genetic characterisation	ENEMY RELEASE; GYRODACTYLUS-SALARIS; TANGANYIKA SARDINE; CICHLID FISHES; LAKE KIVU; HOST; CLUPEID; DACTYLOGYRIDAE; COMMUNITIES; EVOLUTION	Fish have been widely translocated into non-native areas, commonly as fishery targets. Since fish figure as hosts of various parasite taxa, their introduction may pose often-underestimated threats to ecosystems. However, parasites can also serve to track host species' introduction routes when these would otherwise be unknown. To verify the potential of parasites in reconstructing invasion routes, we investigated two of the best-documented introductions: those of Limnothrissa miodon into lakes Kivu and Kariba. As a proof of concept, we investigate the possibility of using parasites to evaluate the effect of host size in the introduction pathway and to track the host origins of L. miodon. Combining historical collections and recent field samples, specimens of L. miodon from Lake Kivu and Lake Kariba were examined for monogenean flatworms. Intraspecific variation was investigated using morphometrics of the parasite's sclerotised structures. Three markers from the ribosomal DNA region were used for genetic parasite identification. In Lake Tanganyika, L. miodon is infected by two species of monogeneans, Kapentagyrus limnotrissae and K. tanganicanus. One of these species, K. limnotrissae, was found on L. miodon from Lake Kariba. In contrast, not a single monogenean individual was found in specimens from Lake Kivu. Morphometric results suggested that the origin of K. limnotrissae introduced into Lake Kariba may be the southern part of Lake Tanganyika, which corresponds to historical reports. Moreover, differences in the size of introduced fish, fry versus juveniles, were proposed as one of the factors influencing parasite occurrence in non-native areas.

Invasion dynamics: interactions between the European Green Crab Carcinus maenas and the Asian Shore Crab Hemigrapsus sanguineus	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Hemigrapsus sanguineus; Carcinus maenas; Competition; Intraguild predation	INTRAGUILD PREDATION; AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; ATLANTIC COAST; COMPETITION; HABITAT; COEXISTENCE; POPULATION; IMPACTS; PREY	As ecosystems are increasingly inhabited by multiple invasive species, interactions among exotic species have the potential to negatively impact native communities and habitats, often in counterintuitive ways. In rocky intertidal habitats along southern New England, the recently introduced Asian Shore Crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, has been implicated in the displacement of the more established invasive European Green Crab, Carcinus maenas. We coupled faunal sampling with two field experiments to examine whether H. sanguineus is also displacing C. maenas in the Gulf of Maine. First, we investigated natural recruitment of the two species across an elevation gradient, using cage exclusion units to manipulate predator access. Excluding H. sanguineus adults significantly increased the density of C. maenas recruits, but not conspecific recruit density. Next, to simulate the transition that occurred from pre-invasion to the establishment of H. sanguineus, we conducted a predator inclusion experiment manipulating the density of adult H. sanguineus to examine the effects on C. maenas and conspecific recruit densities. In contrast to the previous experiment, we found that the density of H. sanguineus included in cages negatively affected conspecific recruit density but had no effect on C. maenas recruit density. We hypothesize that juxtaposing results from the two experiments may be a consequence of the considerably greater abundance of C. maenas recruits relative to H. sanguineus recruits during the first experiment. Our work highlights the importance of considering the multitude of factors that influence competitive and intraguild predation interactions, including density-dependent effects, ontogeny and life history characteristics.

Various traits influence the invasiveness of a species but do not apply to all plant taxa. Ferns are rare or absent from such inventories, but notable fern invasions do exist. We developed a global inventory of terrestrial alien true ferns (Polypodiophyta) comprising 157 species, using published literature and online inventories. We aimed to determine which traits influence the probability that a terrestrial alien fern will become naturalised or invasive. Generalised linear models with transition stages as response variables, were used to assess the effects of various anthropogenic, biological and distributional traits on invasiveness. Our model explained 30-40% of the variance associated with invasiveness and showed that a ground-dwelling life form, reproductive plasticity, tolerance for disturbance and varied light conditions, and a broad introduced range (interpreted as high environmental tolerance and popularity in horticulture) were important determinants of invasiveness in alien ferns. We highlighted which geographic regions and fern families had the highest incidences of alien ferns and identified particular species of concern. This study aids in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying invasiveness in alien ferns and the findings can inform future research on this understudied taxon as invasive species.

We used non-chemical eradication methods (i.e. gillnetting and electrofishing) in four high mountain lakes in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Western Italian Alps) to eradicate alien brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis. Data of amphibians, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, and water transparency were used as indicators of the recovery process. All treated lakes were returned to their original fishless condition in spite of their different sizes and habitat complexity, without permanent negative side-effects for native species. Several ecological indicators showed that many impacts of introduced fish can be reversed over a short time period following eradication. The present study adds to a still growing body of specialized literature on the recovery of habitats after the eradication of alien species and provides further evidence that physical eradication methods are effective and can be part of a more general strategy for the conservation of high mountain lake biota.

Release from intraspecific competition promotes dominance of a non-native invader	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Aphaenogaster; Coexistence; Competition; Myrmica rubra; Niche; Supercolony	MYRMICA-RUBRA HYMENOPTERA; INVASIVE ANT; CONVERGENT DEVELOPMENT; PLANT INVASIONS; FORMICIDAE; SUPERCOLONIES; MECHANISMS; SUCCESS; RELATEDNESS; AGGRESSION	Species can coexist through equalizing (similar fitness abilities) and stabilizing (unique niche requirements) mechanismsassuming that intraspecific competition imposes more limitation than interspecific competition. Non-native species often de-stabilize coexistence, suggesting that they bring either a fitness advantage or a distinct niche requirement. We tested whether greater fitness or unique niche requirements best explained a successful North American invasion by the European Myrmica rubra ant. North American invaded-range M. rubra aggressively sting and occur in enormous numbers (suggesting a fitness advantage), yet our study site has a history of anthropogenic disturbance that might favor M. rubra (suggesting a unique niche). We compared M. rubra to native ants, principally the dominant North American woodland ant Aphaenogaster picea, using physiological health (lipids and size), monthly bait station surveys and aggression assays to assess fitness abilities, and we used nest surveys and isotope analysis to assess niche characteristics. We confirmed the field observations with laboratory experiments that tested colony aggression (direct competition) and food retrieval (indirect competition). In both the observational and experimental investigations, we found little evidence of M. rubra interspecific competitive advantage (aggression or food retrieval) or niche differentiation. Instead, M. rubra violated the basic assumption of coexistence theory: intraspecific competition consistently was less than interspecific competition. Freed up from the costs and limitations of territorial competition, some non-native species may outcompete native species by not competing with themselves. This friendly release' from intraspecific competition provides an ecological mechanism for some successful invasions.

A non-native agronomic legume (Astragalus cicer L.) alters multiple ecosystem-services in mixed prairie grassland	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Diversity; Forage production; Nitrogen; Soil organic carbon	SOIL CARBON; PLANT DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; MILKVETCH; DECOMPOSITION; TRADEOFFS; DENSITIES; DYNAMICS; CULTURE; RATES	Cicer milkvetch (Astragalus cicer L.), and other non-native agronomic legumes, are used extensively for forage in North America, but, despite their abundance, few studies have examined their effects when they colonize native grasslands. Cicer milkvetch provides excellent forage for livestock, but given its large size and ability to fix nitrogen, it is likely to affect other ecosystem services provided by grasslands. We have observed cicer milkvetch in the dry mixed-grass prairie of southern Alberta, Canada. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of cicer milkvetch on forage production, carbon storage and plant community diversity after it colonizes native mixed prairie grasslands and further examine whether these effects increase with cicer milkvetch patch size. We compared the ecosystem functions among plots located within a cicer milkvetch patch, beside a patch and 5m distant from the patch. The plant, as expected has positive effects on forage quantity and quality, reduced plant species diversity and richness, and altered numerous components of the carbon pool, as well as nitrogen availability. Furthermore, larger patches of cicer milkvetch had lower concentrations of soil carbon and nitrogen, and differentially affected other ecosystem properties. Given the potentially large propagule pressure of non-native legumes from agricultural lands, surrounding native grasslands in North America, and our results demonstrating effects on multiple grassland ecosystem services, further consideration and investigation of non-native legumes in grasslands is warranted.

It differs from controlled common garden studies because it examines the impact of evolutionarily novel plants that have replaced native plants in unmanaged ecosystems and thus provides a more accurate measure of what is happening to interactions between plants and insects in invaded natural areas. Four hedgerows of each treatment were searched methodically along 100m transects during June and July 2011 for a seasonal total of 500min each. Seasonal totals of species richness, caterpillar abundance, and caterpillar biomass were recorded and compared using linear mixed models. We also estimated a Lepidoptera productivity index for each hedgerow based on the plant species composition and biomass as well as literature host records for each species present. Although we found similar richness of plant species, and more plant biomass in novel hedgerows, novel hedgerows had 68% fewer caterpillar species, 91% fewer caterpillars, and 96% less caterpillar biomass than native hedgerows. Moreover, novel hedgerows were predicted to have 5.4 times less Lepidoptera productivity based on their plant composition. Interactions between caterpillars and hedgerow plants were also significantly impacted by introduced plants, with novel hedgerows supporting 84% fewer interactions between plants and caterpillars and 57% less interaction diversity than native hedgerows. This is a considerably larger impact of novel plants on a critical component of terrestrial food webs than has been measured in common garden experiments at the same location and demonstrates that plant-herbivore interactions are compromised when novel species replace resident species, even if plant species richness does not change.

A better understanding of the various barriers to the spread of insects introduced to control invasive plants will allow for more targeted release programs and potentially shorter lag times from introduction to management. In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, two seed eating beetles (Exapion fuscirostre and Bruchidius villosus) have been introduced to control the invasive plant Cytisus scoparius. These biological controls are predicted to be effective only at high rates of seed destruction, so any factors that limit their colonization or population sizes may allow C. scoparius populations to grow, leading to ecological and economic harm. In this study, we investigate relative impacts of biological control agents in relation to two barriers to insect movement: urbanization and elevation. We find that the impacts of B. villosus are not different between urban and rural sites, but that relative impacts of both biological control agents decrease with increasing elevation, a pattern consistent across 2years of measurements. Cytisus scoparius populations experience substantial seed destruction in urban settings, strongly suggesting successful population control. The low seed destruction at high elevation sites could indicate that biological control agents are ineffective there, and that C. scoparius may exist in enemy-reduced space.

El Nino drought and tropical forest conversion synergistically determine mosquito development rate	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						El Nino; drought; Aedes albopictus; tropical forest; oil palm; mosquitoes	AEDES-ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA; SENSU-STRICTO DIPTERA; OIL PALM; HOST-SEEKING; TEMPERATURE-FLUCTUATIONS; MALARIA TRANSMISSION; AEGYPTI DIPTERA; ADULT SIZE; MICROCLIMATE; CULICIDAE	Extreme warming events can profoundly alter the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne diseases by affecting mosquito life-history traits (e.g. survival, growth and reproduction). At local scales, temperatures are determined largely by vegetation structure and can be dramatically altered by drivers of land-use change (e.g. forest conversion). Disturbance activities can also hinder the buffering capacity of natural habitats, making them more susceptible to seasonal climate variation and extreme weather events (e.g. droughts). In experiments spanning three years, we investigated the interactive effects of tropical forest conversion and climate on fine-scale temperature, and the consequences for mosquito larval development. This study was conducted in the northern Malaysian Bornean state of Sabah using local Aedes albopictus mosquitoes; important vectors of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. We demonstrate that variation in temperatures due to forest conversion dramatically increases development rates in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. However, this effect was mediated by an El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought event. In normal years, mean temperatures did not differ between land-use types, however mosquitoes reared in oil palm plantations typically emerged 2-3 days faster than in logged forests. During an ENSO drought, mean temperatures did differ between land-use types, but surprisingly this did not result in different mosquito development rates. Driving this idiosyncratic response may be the differences in daily temperature fluctuations between the land-use types that either push mosquito larvae towards optimal development, or over the thermal optimum, thereby reducing fitness.

Variation in the timing of avian egg-laying in relation to climate	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article						breeding phenology; egg-laying; climate niche	PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY NPP; COMPARING GLOBAL-MODELS; BREEDING PHENOLOGY; EL-NINO; BIRDS; TEMPERATURE; DESERT; SEASONALITY; RESPONSES; RAINFALL	A significant proportion of birds around the world exhibit variation in the timing of egg-laying, taking advantage of intermittent resource pulses to provision their offspring. Quantification of the climatic conditions associated with variation in breeding is essential for understanding reproductive phenology and adaptive responses to a changing climate. We use a novel dataset from Australia to test long-established ideas about which climatic factors may govern avian breeding patterns. We combine similar to 146 000 breeding observations (first egg-laying dates) from 327 species with daily measures of minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation to examine the responsiveness of bird breeding to local climate conditions. Across five biomes we quantify and compare the difference in temperature and precipitation during each breeding event relative to 'average' conditions at each location (i.e. conditions during the one-year period either side of a breeding event). For a smaller subset of species, we examine responses to temperature and precipitation in birds breeding across multiple biomes. These biomes are arrayed along Australia's north to south temperature gradient, and east to west aridity gradient. We found that breeding is non-random in relation to climate. Within biomes, most species breed when temperature, precipitation, or both were distinctly different than the average conditions. Additionally, there is both intra- and inter-specific variation in the climatic conditions under which species lay eggs across aridity and temperature gradients. Breeding in hot and arid regions is in part driven by the lagged effect of previous rainfall, however, hot temperatures are the primary constraint. These findings imply that opportunistic breeding in response to localised climate, independent of day-length cues, may be relatively common in Australian birds. We conclude that breeding is likely closely associated with patterns of vegetation productivity and food resources, and limited by physiological stress resulting particularly from extreme temperature.

Rapid post-natal development decreases predation risk to offspring, while inclement weather likely prolongs development. For taxa with parental care, parental behaviour may partially buffer offspring against extrinsic drivers like predation risk and severe weather. Using a 7-year dataset from an alpine population of horned lark Eremophila alpestris, a ground-nesting songbird in northern British Columbia, Canada, we investigated multiple potential drivers of variation in the duration of incubation and nestling development. Using path analysis, we evaluated the direct effects of weather, predation risk and parental care on offspring development, as well as indirect developmental "carry-over" effects of conditions during incubation on the nestling period. Nestling period duration varied by nearly 100% (7-13 days) and incubation duration by 40% (10-14 days). Cold ambient temperatures late in the nestling period prolonged development by 1 day for every 2 days below 10 degrees C, particularly when combined with heavy precipitation. Rapid nestling development was associated with high predation risk, and prolonging development incurred a nest survival cost (-2.3% per day). Females in good condition created nest environments that promoted rapid nestling development periods (average = 8-9 days) compared to poor condition females during harsh, early-season conditions (10-11 days), indicating parental buffering capabilities against environmental constraints. Fledging age was weakly correlated with incubation duration (r = -0.21) suggesting minimal developmental carry-over effects. Given high nest predation risk, immediate fitness benefits can be derived by overcoming environmental constraints and reducing development time. While predation risk was influential, inclement weather and maternal condition had stronger effects on variation in offspring development. Addressing multiple drivers of variation in key life-history traits can provide important context for understanding life-history theory under changing environmental conditions.

Integrating vital rates explains optimal worker size for resource return by bumblebee workers	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bombus vosnesenskii; demography; foraging; nectar; optimal size; pollen; survival; trade-offs	DIVISION-OF-LABOR; BODY-SIZE; TRADE-OFFS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; COLONY GROWTH; FORAGING RATE; EVOLUTION; SURVIVAL; NUMBER; FLIGHT	Size-number trade-offs in reproduction are commonly observed in nature. Bumblebee (Bombus spp.) colonies produce workers that vary considerably in size. This variation suggests that colonies face potential size-number trade-offs when producing workers. Here, we estimated size-based vital rates of Bombus vosnesenskii workers using colonies reared from wild-caught queens. We conducted a mark-recapture study to estimate worker survival as a function of body size. We also collected data on pollen and nectar loads as well as foraging trips using a radiofrequency identification system to estimate daily resource return as a function of body size. We integrated survival and daily resource return to estimate lifetime resource collection and offset these estimates by the size-based worker production costs. We found size-based trade-offs among workers of different sizes. Smaller workers had higher survival, but larger workers returned with more resources per day. The largest workers made slightly fewer foraging trips per day. Overall, larger workers made the greatest lifetime contribution to both nectar and pollen collection. However, once the benefits of larger workers are offset by their higher production costs, intermediate-sized workers were the optimal for net resource contribution according to our models. Many previous studies have found that larger workers outperformed smaller workers with foraging and in-nest tasks, yet these studies have not integrated multiple fitness components or worker production costs to quantify net resource contribution towards colony growth. Accounting for trade-offs between costs and performance changed our conclusions about optimal body size from being large to being near the observed average. Similar approaches of integrating multiple vital rates may resolve apparently suboptimal life histories in other taxa. A is available for this article.

Whereas the effects of N availability on photosynthetic capacity are well established, we still know relatively little about the effects of P availability at a foliar level, especially in P-limited tropical forests. We examined photosynthetic capacity, leaf mass per area (LMA) and foliar P fractions in five woody plant species after 6 years of N and P fertilization in a lowland tropical forest. Foliar N:P ratios indicated P limitation of the unfertilized plants; accordingly, photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE) and LMA decreased with P addition, and foliar N and P concentrations increased, whereas N addition had little effect on measured foliar traits. However, P addition enhanced photosynthetic capacity only in one species and not in other four species. We then assessed plant acclimation to low P availability by quantifying four fractions of foliar P representing different functional pools: structural P, metabolic P (including inorganic P), nucleic acid P, and residual P. We found that P addition enhanced the concentrations of metabolic, structural, and nucleic acid P fractions in all species, but the magnitude of the effect was species-specific. Our findings indicate that tropical species acclimate to low P availability by altering allocation of foliar P to meet the demand of P for photosynthesis. Importantly, species typical of lowland tropical forests in East Asia maintained their photosynthetic rate under low P availability. We conclude that P limitation of leaf photosynthetic capacity may not be as common as previously assumed due to plant acclimation mechanisms in low-P tropical forests. Species-specific strategies to allocate P to different foliar fractions represent a potentially important adaptive mechanism for plants in P-limited systems.

Animal-mediated organic matter transformation: Aquatic insects as a source of microbially bioavailable organic nutrients and energy	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						biogeochemical cycling; brown food web; consumer nutrient dynamics; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic nitrogen; microbial ecosystem; organic matter decomposition	FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY; ECOLOGICAL STOICHIOMETRY; CARBON; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; DETRITUS; BACTERIA; TERRESTRIAL; EXCRETION; DIGESTION	Animal communities are essential drivers of energy and elemental flow in ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated the functional role of animals as sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the subsequent utilization of that DOM by the microbial community. In a small forested headwater stream, we tested the effects of taxonomy, feeding traits, and body size on the quality and quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) excreted by aquatic insects. In addition, we conducted steady-state solute additions to estimate instream demand for labile C and compared it to the C excreted by invertebrates. Individual excretion rates and excretion composition varied with body size, taxonomy and feeding guild. The estimated average community excretion rate was 1.31 mu g DOC center dot per mg insect dry weight (DW)(-1) hr(-1) and 0.33 mu g DON center dot mg DW-1 hr(-1), and individuals excreted DON at nearly twice the rate of NH4+. This DOM was 2-5 times more bioavailable to microbial heterotrophs than ambient stream water DOM. We estimated that the insect community, conservatively, excreted 1.62 mg of bioavailable DOC center dot m(-2) hr(-1) and through steady-state additions measured an ambient labile C demand as 3.97 +/- 0.67 mg C m(-2) hr(-1). This suggests that insect-mediated transformation and excretion of labile DOC could satisfy a significant fraction (40 +/- 7%) of labile C demand in this small stream. Collectively, our results suggest that animal excretion plays an essential functional role in transforming organic matter into microbially bioavailable forms and may satisfy a variable but significant portion of microbial demand for labile C and N.

To understand the evolution of this diversity, it is important to reveal to what degree this variation is genetic or environmental in origin and whether this depends on species' life histories. Here we applied quantitative genetic methods to a pedigreed multigenerational data set of the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis, a passerine bird with high levels of extra-pair paternity, to partition genetic and environmental sources of phenotypic variation in sperm dimensions for the first time in a natural population. Narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) of total sperm length amounted to 0.44 +/- 0.14 SE, whereas the corresponding figure for evolvability (estimated as coefficient of additive genetic variation, CVa) was 0.02 +/- 0.003 SE. We also found an increase in total sperm length within individual males between the arrival and nestling period. This seasonal variation may reflect constraints in the production of fully elongated spermatozoa shortly after arrival at the breeding grounds. There was no evidence of an effect of male age on sperm dimensions. In many previous studies on laboratory populations of several insect, mammal and avian species, heritabilities of sperm morphology were higher, whereas evolvabilities were similar. Explanations for the differences in heritability may include variation in the environment (laboratory vs. wild), intensity of sexual selection via sperm competition (high vs. low) and genetic architecture that involves unusual linkage disequilibrium coupled with overdominance in one of the studied species.

Diverse genotypes of the amphibian-killing fungus produce distinct phenotypes through plastic responses to temperature	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						amphibians; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; chytrid; climate; disease ecology; pathogen; phenotypic plasticity; phylogenetic conservatism	PATHOGEN BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; CHYTRID FUNGUS; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; EVOLUTION; CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS; ADAPTATION; PLANT; HOST; VIRULENCE	Phenotypes are the target of selection and affect the ability of organisms to persist in variable environments. Phenotypes can be influenced directly by genes and/or by phenotypic plasticity. The amphibian-killing fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has a global distribution, unusually broad host range, and high genetic diversity. Phenotypic plasticity may be an important process that allows this pathogen to infect hundreds of species in diverse environments. We quantified phenotypic variation of nine Bd genotypes from two Bd lineages (Global Pandemic Lineage [GPL] and Brazil) and a hybrid (GPL-Brazil) grown at three temperatures (12, 18 and 24 degrees C). We measured five functional traits including two morphological traits (zoospore and zoosporangium sizes) and three life history traits (carrying capacity, time to fastest growth and exponential growth rate) in a phylogenetic framework. Temperature caused highly plastic responses within each genotype, with all Bd genotypes showing phenotypic plasticity in at least three traits. Among genotypes, Bd generally showed the same direction of plastic response to temperature: larger zoosporangia, higher carrying capacity, longer time to fastest growth and slower exponential growth at lower temperatures. The exception was zoospore size, which was highly variable. Our findings indicate that Bd genotypes have evolved novel phenotypes through plastic responses to temperature over very short timescales. High phenotypic variability likely extends to other traits and may facilitate the large host range and rapid spread of Bd.

In addition, some properties are commonly not measured, such as wood density and carbon concentration. As a result, there have been few previous evaluations of uncertainty in estimates of downed coarse woody debris, which are necessary for analysis and interpretation of the data. To address this shortcoming, we quantified uncertainties in estimates of downed coarse woody debris volume and carbon storage using data collected from permanent forest inventory plots in the northeastern United States by the Forest Inventory and Analysis program of the USDA Forest Service. Quality assurance data collected from blind remeasurement audits were used to quantify error in diameter measurements, hollowness of logs, species identification, and decay class determination. Uncertainty estimates for density, collapse ratio, and carbon concentration were taken from the literature. Estimates of individual sources of uncertainty were combined using Monte Carlo methods. Volume estimates were more reliable than carbon storage, with an average 95% confidence interval of 15.9 m(3)/ha across the 79 plots evaluated, which was less than the mean of 31.2 m(3)/ha. Estimates of carbon storage (and mass) were more uncertain, due to poorly constrained estimates of the density of wood. For carbon storage, the average 95% confidence interval was 11.1 Mg C/ha, which was larger than the mean of 4.6 Mg C/ha. Accounting for the collapse of dead wood as it decomposes would improve estimates of both volume and carbon storage. On the other hand, our analyses suggest that consideration of the hollowness of downed coarse woody debris pieces could be eliminated in this region, with little effect. This study demonstrates how uncertainty analysis can be used to quantify confidence in estimates and to help identify where best to allocate resources to improve monitoring designs.

Applications of BACI designs mostly rely on testing for a significant interaction between periods and treatments (so-called BACI contrast) to demonstrate the effects of the perturbation. However, significant interactions can emerge for several reasons, including when changes are larger in control sites, such that additional diagnostics must be performed to determine the full complexity of system changes. We propose two measures that detail the nature of change implied by BACI contrasts, along with its uncertainty. CI-divergence (Control-Impact divergence) quantifies to what extent control and impact sites have diverged between the after and the before period, whereas CI-contribution (Control-Impact contribution) quantifies to what extent the change between periods is stronger in impact sites relative to control sites. To illustrate how these two CI measures can be combined with BACI contrast to gain insights about effects of environmental perturbations, we used count data from the Swedish Breeding Bird Survey to investigate how hurricane Gudrun affected the long-term abundances of four bird species in forested areas of southern Sweden. Before-After-Control-Impact contrasts suggested the hurricane affected all four species. However, the values of the two CI measures strongly differed, even among species showing similar BACI contrasts. Those differences highlight qualitatively distinct population trajectories between periods and treatments requiring different ecological explanations. Overall, we show that BACI contrasts do not provide the full story in assessing the effects of environmental perturbations. The two CI measures can be used to assist ecological interpretations, or to specify detailed hypotheses about effects of restoration actions to allow stronger confirmatory inference about their outcomes. By providing a framework to develop more detailed explanations and hypotheses about ecological changes, the two CI measures can improve conclusions and strengthen evidence of effects of conservation actions and impact assessments under BACI designs.

Multispecies hierarchical modeling reveals variable responses of African carnivores to management alternatives	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						apex predator; Bayesian analysis; carnivore conservation; community modeling; distance sampling; enforcement of regulations; imperfect detection; protected area; Serengeti-Mara	BLACK-BACKED JACKALS; SPECIES RICHNESS; SPOTTED HYENAS; CAPE FOXES; MARA; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; PASTORALISM; CONFLICT; SURVIVAL	Carnivore communities face unprecedented threats from humans. Yet, management regimes have variable effects on carnivores, where species may persist or decline in response to direct or indirect changes to the ecosystem. Using a hierarchical multispecies modeling approach, we examined the effects of alternative management regimes (i.e., active vs. passive enforcement of regulations) on carnivore abundances and group sizes at both species and community levels in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Alternative management regimes have created a dichotomy in ecosystem conditions within the Reserve, where active enforcement of regulations maintains low levels of human disturbance in the Mara Triangle and passive enforcement of regulations in the Talek region permits multiple forms of human disturbance. Our results demonstrate that these alternative management regimes have variable effects on 11 observed carnivore species. As predicted, some species, such as African lions and bat-eared foxes, have higher population densities in the Mara Triangle, where regulations are actively enforced. Yet, other species, including black-backed jackals and spotted hyenas, have higher population densities in the Talek region where enforcement is passive. Multiple underlying mechanisms, including behavioral plasticity and competitive release, are likely causing higher black-backed jackals and spotted hyena densities in the disturbed Talek region. Our multispecies modeling framework reveals that carnivores do not react to management regimes uniformly, shaping carnivore communities by differentially producing winning and losing species. Some carnivore species require active enforcement of regulations for effective conservation, while others more readily adapt (and in some instances thrive in response) to lax management enforcement and resulting anthropogenic disturbance. Yet, high levels of human disturbance appear to be negatively affecting the majority of carnivores, with potential consequences that may permeate throughout the rest of the ecosystem. Community approaches to monitoring carnivores should be adopted as single species monitoring may overlook important intra-community variability.

Fine-scale stand structure mediates drought-induced tree mortality in pinyon-juniper woodlands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						bark beetle; competition; die-off; forest dieback; Great Basin; pinon; semiarid; stand dynamics	PINE MORTALITY; DIE-OFF; FOREST; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; MECHANISMS; ADAPTATION; COMPETITION; PATTERNS	Severe drought has resulted in widespread tree die-off events in forests and woodlands globally and is forecast to become more frequent in coming decades. Tree mortality is a complex process influenced by climate, soils, characteristics of individual trees, interactions between trees, and the dynamics of pests and pathogens. The role of stand structure and stand density in mediating the resistance of trees to drought remains poorly understood, especially in semiarid woodlands, which are expected to be highly susceptible to future severe drought. We sampled permanent plots in central Nevada woodlands dominated by single-leaf pinyon pine and Utah juniper before and after a severe multi-year drought (2013-2015) to investigate the importance of climate, tree attributes, and local-neighborhood stand structure on tree mortality and canopy dieback at the level of individual trees and 0.1-ha plots. We observed widespread tree mortality of pinyon at approximately eight times the reported background mortality rate, and substantial canopy dieback in both pinyon and juniper. Both species were more prone to mortality and dieback in hotter, drier sites. Canopy dieback was associated with both long-term average climate and the severity of recent drought, with elevated mortality on sites with higher water deficits, average summer temperatures, and vapor pressure deficits. Soils also played a role in tree dieback, with greater mortality on deeper soils. While mortality was driven largely by climate at coarse scales, fine-scale stand structure interacted with climate to mediate mortality and dieback. Neighborhood statistics showed that trees were susceptible to competitive influence, and pinyon trees were especially sensitive to neighborhood density on drier sites. Mortality and dieback were associated with diverse, co-occurring insect and parasitic plant mortality agents. Canopy dieback prior to the drought was strongly associated with tree mortality during the drought, implying that current widespread defoliation caused by these agents may foreshadow future elevated woodland decline. Fine-scale influences such as stand structure and soil characteristics play a key role in the long-term dynamics of semiarid woodlands, and these factors should be considered in predictive models of forest and woodland susceptibility to drought.

Climatic variables have been the most commonly used environmental data in transfer zone development, even though soils are also a primary selective force on plants. We assessed the importance of including soils in seed transfer zones using Bromus marginatus, a native grass used for restoration and revegetation in the western United States, as an example. Seeds were collected from 64 populations across Montana and Idaho and grown in a common garden for two years. We assessed among-population variation based on 11 traits related to germination rate, plant size, vigor, inflorescence number, survival, and carbon isotope discrimination ( increment Delta(13)), and used this variation to develop seed transfer zone maps using two approaches: (1) a conventional approach, using only climatic variables (climate only) and (2) an expanded approach that included soils and climatic variables (soils + climate). The most influential drivers of trait variation were factors related to soil water availability: soil order, available water content (AWC), and organic carbon levels. Populations from areas with andic soils, which have high soil AWC and soil organic carbon, had low germination, limited first-year survival, low increment Delta(13), and small seeds. Growing season length and winter temperatures were also predictive of trait variation. In comparison to climate-only models, soils + climate models explained 11% more variance (120% relative increase) for increment Delta(13) and an average of 4.5% more (27% relative increase) for growth traits and survival. The transfer zone map developed using soils + climate differed from the climate-only map in both spatial pattern of ecotypic variation and number of transfer zones; the soils + climate map had more zones and a higher proportion of small (<4 km(2)) transfer zone patches, while the climate-only map had more large patches >37 km(2). Including soils in transfer zone development may identify adaptive trait variation that is obscured by large-scale differences in climate and could improve plant materials used for ecosystem management.

Compounding effects of climate change reduce population viability of a montane amphibian	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						amphibians; climate change; extinction risk; hydrology; montane ecosystems; population modeling	SKIPPED BREEDING OPPORTUNITIES; COMPLEX LIFE-CYCLES; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; DEMOGRAPHIC COMPENSATION; SURVIVAL; RESPONSES; FROGS; METAMORPHOSIS; VARIABILITY; RESILIENCE	Anthropogenic climate change presents challenges and opportunities to the growth, reproduction, and survival of individuals throughout their life cycles. Demographic compensation among life-history stages has the potential to buffer populations from decline, but alternatively, compounding negative effects can lead to accelerated population decline and extinction. In montane ecosystems of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, increasing temperatures are resulting in a transition from snow-dominated to rain-dominated precipitation events, reducing snowpack. For ectotherms such as amphibians, warmer winters can reduce the frequency of critical minimum temperatures and increase the length of summer growing seasons, benefiting post-metamorphic stages, but may also increase metabolic costs during winter months, which could decrease survival. Lower snowpack levels also result in wetlands that dry sooner or more frequently in the summer, increasing larval desiccation risk. To evaluate how these challenges and opportunities compound within a species' life history, we collected demographic data on Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) in Olympic National Park in Washington state to parameterize stage-based stochastic matrix population models under current and future (A1B, 2040s, and 2080s) environmental conditions. We estimated the proportion of reproductive effort lost each year due to drying using watershed-specific hydrologic models, and coupled this with an analysis that relates 15 yr of R. cascadae abundance data with a suite of climate variables. We estimated the current population growth (lambda(s)) to be 0.97 (95% CI 0.84-1.13), but predict that lambda(s) will decline under continued climate warming, resulting in a 62% chance of extinction by the 2080s because of compounding negative effects on early and late life history stages. By the 2080s, our models predict that larval mortality will increase by 17% as a result of increased pond drying, and adult survival will decrease by 7% as winter length and summer precipitation continue to decrease. We find that reduced larval survival drives initial declines in the 2040s, but further declines in the 2080s are compounded by decreases in adult survival. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for compounding or compensatory effects within different life history stages to exacerbate or buffer the effects of climate change on population growth rates through time.

Geographic patterns of the climate sensitivity of lakes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate change; LAGOS-NE; North American lakes; Secchi depth; water clarity; water quality	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; PHOSPHORUS; NUTRIENTS; RESPONSES; TRENDS; COLOR; TEMPERATURE; REGULATORS; SENTINELS; LIGHT	Climate change is a well-recognized threat to lake ecosystems and, although there likely exists geographic variation in the sensitivity of lakes to climate, broad-scale, long-term studies are needed to understand this variation. Further, the potential mediating role of local to regional ecological context on these responses is not well documented. In this study, we examined relationships between climate and water clarity in 365 lakes from 1981 to 2010 in two distinct regions in the northeastern and midwestern United States. We asked (1) How do climate-water-clarity relationships vary across watersheds and between two geographic regions? and (2) Do certain characteristics make some lakes more climate sensitive than others? We found strong differences in climate-water-clarity relationships both within and across the two regions. For example, in the northeastern region, water clarity was often negatively correlated with summer precipitation (median correlation = -0.32, n = 160 lakes), but was not correlated with summer average maximum temperature (median correlation = 0.09, n = 205 lakes). In the midwestern region, water clarity was not related to summer precipitation (median correlation = -0.04), but was often negatively correlated with summer average maximum temperature (median correlation = -0.18). There were few strong relationships between local and sub-regional ecological context and a lake's sensitivity to climate. For example, ecological context variables explained just 16-18% of variation in summer precipitation sensitivity, which was most related to total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, lake depth, and hydrology in both regions. Sensitivity to summer maximum temperature was even less predictable in both regions, with 4% or less of variation explained using all ecological context variables. Overall, we identified differences in the climate sensitivity of lakes across regions and found that local and sub-regional ecological context weakly influences the sensitivity of lakes to climate. Our findings suggest that local to regional drivers may combine to influence the sensitivity of lake ecosystems to climate change, and that sensitivities among lakes are highly variable within and across regions. This variability suggests that lakes are sensitive to different aspects of climate change (temperature vs. precipitation) and that responses of lakes to climate are heterogeneous and complex.

Because of their close proximity to coastal waters, nutrient delivery from many urban areas can have profound impacts on coastal ecology. Relatively little is known about the temporal and spatial variability in stoichiometry of inorganic nutrients such as dissolved silica, nitrogen, and phosphorus (Si, N, and P) and dissolved organic matter in tropical urban environments. We examined nutrient stoichiometry of both inorganic nutrients and organic matter in an urban watershed in Puerto Rico served by municipal sanitary sewers and compared it to two nearby forested catchments using samples collected weekly from each river for 6 yr. Urbanization caused large increases in the concentration and flux of nitrogen and phosphorus (2- to 50-fold), but surprisingly little change in N:P ratio. Concentrations of almost all major ions and dissolved silica were also significantly higher in the urban river than the wildland rivers. Yield of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not increased dramatically by urbanization, but the composition of dissolved organic matter shifted toward N-rich material, with a larger increase in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) than DOC. The molar ratio of DOC:DON was about 40 in rivers draining forested catchments but was only 10 in the urban river. Inclusion of Si in the assessment of urbanization's impacts reveals a large shift in the stoichiometry (Si:N and Si:P) of nutrient inputs. Because both Si concentrations and watershed exports are high in streams and rivers from many humid tropical catchments with siliceous bedrock, even the large increases in N and P exported from urban catchments result in delivery of Si, N, and P to coastal waters in stoichiometric ratios that are well in excess of the Si requirements of marine diatoms. Our data suggest that dissolved Si, often neglected in watershed biogeochemistry, should be included in studies of urban as well as less developed watersheds due to its potential significance for marine and lacustrine productivity.

However, we know little about how the stability of ecosystem services responds to landscape composition, and what ecological mechanisms underlie these trade-offs. Here, we develop a model to investigate the dynamics of three ecosystem services in intensively managed agroecosystems, i.e., pollination-independent crop yield, crop pollination, and biodiversity. Our model reveals trade-offs and synergies imposed by landscape composition that affect not only the magnitude but also the stability of ecosystem service delivery. Trade-offs involving crop pollination are strongly affected by the degree to which crops depend on pollination and by their relative requirement for pollinator densities. We show conditions for crop production to increase with biodiversity and decreasing crop area, reconciling farmers' profitability and biodiversity conservation. Our results further suggest that, for pollination-dependent crops, management strategies that focus on maximizing yield will often overlook its stability. Given that agriculture has become more pollination-dependent over time, it is essential to understand the mechanisms driving these trade-offs to ensure food security.

We investigated how a widespread tree mortality event concurrent with a severe drought influenced the avian community of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. We assessed and compared the separate effects of climate stresses and altered habitat conditions on the avian community and used this information to evaluate the changes that are likely to occur in the near future. We built tree mortality maps from freely available Landsat imagery with Google Earth Engine. We analyzed avian point counts from 2010 to 2016 in the southern Sierra Nevada, to model temperature, water deficit, and tree mortality effects on the abundances of 45 bird species, and then used these models to project abundances into the future based on three climate projections. A large portion of the avian community, 47%, had a positive relationship with temperature increase, compared to 20% that responded negatively. More species (36%) declined with drier conditions than increased (29%). More species declined in response to high tree mortality (36%) than increased (9%). A preponderance of species adapted to colder temperatures (higher elevation) had negative responses to high tree mortality and water deficit, but positive responses to increasing temperature. We projected the highest total bird abundances in the future under the warmest climate scenario that we considered, but habitat modification (e.g., tree mortality) and water deficit could offset the positive influence of temperature for many species. As other studies have shown, climate warming may lead to substantial but idiosyncratic effects on wildlife species that could result in community composition shifts. We conclude that future climate conditions may not have a universally negative effect on biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada, but probable vegetation changes and increased likelihood of extreme events such as drought should be incorporated into climate-smart forest and wildlife management decisions.

However, bee response to the disturbance of biomass harvesting may depend on their nesting location, thus their vulnerability to nest destruction, and the response of the forb community on which they forage. Moreover, because bees have long foraging ranges, effects of local harvesting may depend on the amount of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. We performed a large-scale one- and two-year experiment in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to examine how grassland harvesting, landscape context, and study year affect the forb community, above- and belowground-nesting bee species richness, community composition, trap nest emergence, and visitation rate. In Wisconsin, harvesting increased forb richness, cover, and evenness compared to unharvested control sites. Harvesting negatively affected aboveground-nesting bee richness and emergence from trap nests, possibly because of nest destruction during the previous harvest. By contrast, harvesting positively affected belowground-nesting bee richness, possibly because of the greater food resource availability and reduced thatch allowing greater access to nesting sites in the soil. Harvesting also affected bee community composition, reflecting the increase in belowground-nesting species at harvested sites. Despite harvesting effects on forb and bee communities, there was no effect on flower visitation rate, indicating little effect on pollination function. We did not find a harvest by landscape context interaction, which, in combination with the negative harvesting effect on trap nest emergence, suggests that harvesting can affect local population growth rather than simply affecting forager aggregation in different resource environments. For bees, there was no harvest by study year interaction, indicating a consistent response over a short timescale. Similarly, in Michigan, belowground-nesting species also responded positively to harvesting, which was more pronounced in sandier soils that are preferred for nesting. However, other components of the Michigan bee and forb communities were not significantly affected by biomass harvesting. Overall, our study demonstrates that harvesting grasslands can positively affect the similar to 80% of bee species that nest belowground by enhancing nest and/or forage resources, but that conserving aboveground nesters may require leaving some area unharvested.

Hydrological alteration by river damming represents one of the most prominent human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. This paper presents a methodological approach to assessing the natural patterns of flow variability and hydrological alterations in Mediterranean rivers. The methodology first defines the admissible range of flow variability under a natural flow regime. Then, the methodology measures the environmental impact of flow regulation according to the inferred hydrological alteration and classifies rivers into homogeneous groups according to the magnitude, frequency, duration and seasonality of the impacts. This paper applies the proposed methodology to thirty-three river segments below large reservoirs located in the three largest Spanish watersheds (Duero, Ebro and Tajo). For each segment, this study evaluates the general impoundment characteristics and geographical contexts and calculates the flow impacts and the divergence between the circulating flows and the reference area of admissible flow variability on a daily basis for the period 2000-2010. This assessment of dam regulation impacts provides a reference to plan measures for mitigating these impacts. The advantages of this flow regulation impact analysis over other analyses are discussed in terms of the implementation of environmental water costs as suggested by the European Water Framework Directive. This approach expands the current understanding of water environmental costs and represents a practical management tool for decreasing the environmental impacts of flow regulation and for increasing water-use efficiency.

Effects of soil tillage regime and frequency of cultivation on grassland bird assemblages in Mediterranean drylands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Farmland birds; Dry grasslands; Conservation agriculture; Livestock; Climate variability; Farmland management	CONSERVATION TILLAGE; NO-TILLAGE; MINIMUM-TILLAGE; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; INTENSIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE; ABUNDANCE; FARMLAND	Conservation agriculture (CA) gained recently some visibility in the Mediterranean region. By affecting soil and plant ecology, CA is expected to influence other biological groups, notably farmland birds. This study aims to assess (1) the importance of tillage regime (conventional vs. no-tillage) and frequency of cultivation under these two regimes in determining the richness and abundance of birds in extensive grasslands originated within rotational cropping systems, and (2) how tillage systems contribute to changes in bird richness and abundance, comparatively to other drivers of bird ecology in Mediterranean farmland. We conducted bird censuses (point counts) from 2012 to 2016 in 34-52 fields per year of 15 farms in Evora region (Southern Portugal). Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to link bird abundance/richness with agricultural descriptors. Both tillage regime and cultivation frequency showed weak effects on Species richness and Total bird abundance. However, a strong variability in the response to tillage descriptors was found between species. For the little bustard and the Iberian grey shrike, a strong interaction with the annual weather regime and opposite trends for the effect of tillage regime were detected. Despite its moderate influence on bird assemblages comparatively to other major drivers of bird richness and abundance (i.e. grazing and annual weather regime), CA could constitute a potential complementary "greening measure" to manage extensive grasslands within rotational cropping systems, particularly in areas where soil erosion is a problem, although some species may not benefit from its implementation.

To develop a more versatile and collaborative decision-making process for nutrient management in the San Francisco Bay Area, we used a mixed-methods approach consisting of stakeholder analysis with cluster analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and scenario planning. These methods allowed us to identify agreements and disagreements in stakeholder objectives and preferences, clarify ways in which different options could meet the goals of diverse stakeholders, and elucidate how scientific uncertainty about technical performance and future conditions could affect management strategies. Results of the analysis indicate that several non-conventional nutrient management options like constructed wetlands and increased water recycling for irrigation met the goals of many stakeholders under a variety of future scenarios. A comparison of MCDA results with a more traditional 'cost-efficiency' measure (i.e., optimizing for the lowest cost per mass of nutrients removed) revealed little correlation between the two methods for stakeholders who expressed a preference for co-benefits of management options such as increased water supply and nutrient recovery for fertilizer use. The method also allowed us to identify key areas of disagreement (e.g., the relative importance of constructing infrastructure that would not be affected by sea level rise) that should find regulatory or professional consensus before advancing with decision-making. This mixed-methods approach is time-consuming and requires specific expertise that is not always available to stakeholders. The development of more efficient preference elicitation and interaction procedures would increase the likelihood that decision-makers would make the extra effort required to use this potentially powerful method. Nonetheless, the mixed-methods approach had several important advantages over more traditional strategic planning methods including its ability to stimulate discussions amongst stakeholders who do not regularly interact, support collaborative planning, and encourage multi-benefit solutions.

There is concern that greater wildfire severity following projected increases in summer drought will lead to higher post-fire carbon losses. We measured soil carbon dynamics in a Calluna heathland and a raised peat bog after experimentally manipulating fire severity. A gradient of fire severity was achieved by simulating drought in 2 x 2 m plots. Ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), methane (CH4) flux and concentration of dissolved organic carbon ( [DOC], measured at the raised bog only) were measured for up to two years after burning. The response of these carbon fluxes to increased fire severity in drought plots was similar to plots burnt under ambient conditions associated with traditional managed burning. Averaged across all burnt plots, burning altered mean NEE from a net carbon sink at the heathland ( - 0.33 mu mol CO2 m(-2) S-1 in unburnt plots) to a carbon source (0.50 mu mol m(-2) S-1 in burnt plots) and at the raised bog ( - 0.38 and 0.16 mu mol m(-2) S-1, respectively). Burning also increased CH4 flux at the raised bog (from 1.16 to 25.3 nmol m(-2) S-1 in the summer, when it accounted for 79% of the CO2-equivalent emission). Burning had no significant effect on soil water [DOC].

The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times, particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands. Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography, and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance, greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes. Our findings highlight hydrologic controls on soil carbon storage, forest structure, and maple dominance, with implications for large-scale hydrologic restoration at GDS and in other degraded forested peatlands more broadly.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from soil (soil respiration) is one of the largest fluxes in the global C-cycle. Recovery of vegetation, organic matter and soil respiration may be influenced by the intensity of post-fire management such as salvage logging. To study the impact of forest fire, fire and salvage, and recovery time on soil respiration and soil C and N content, we sampled two permanent research areas in north-western Estonia that were damaged by fire: Vihterpalu (59 degrees 13' N 23 degrees 49' E) in 1992 and Nova (59 degrees 10' N 23 degrees 45' E) in 2008. Three types of sample plots were established: 1) unburned control with no harvesting (CO); 2) burned and uncleared (BU); and 3) burned and cleared (BC). Measurements were made in 2013, 21 years after wildfire in Vihterpalu and 5 years after wildfire in NOva. Soil respiration ranged from 0.00 to 1.38 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1). Soil respiration in the burned and cleared areas (BC) was not reduced compared to burned and uncleared (BU) areas but the average soil respiration in unburned control areas was more than twice the value in burned areas (average soil respiration in CO areas was 0.34 CO2 m(-2) h(-1), versus 0.16 CO2 m(-2) h(-1), the average soil respiration of BC and BU combined). Recovery over 20 years was mixed; respiration was insignificantly lower on younger than older burned sites (when BC and BU values were combined, the average values were 0.15 vs. 0.17 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1), respectively); soil-C was greater in the older burned plots than the younger (when BC and BU values were combined, the average values were 9.71 vs. 5.99 kg m(-2), respectively); but root biomass in older and recently burned areas was essentially the same (average 2.23 and 2.11 kg m(-2), respectively); soil-N was highest on burned areas 20 years after fire. Twenty years post-fire may be insufficient time for carbon dynamics to fully recover on these low productivity sandy sites.

Parks were labelled the lungs of the city, a metaphor which gained support as studies revealed the deposition of pollutants to leaf surfaces. More recently air purification by urban vegetation came to be seen as an ecosystem service, that add to the other important services it provides. However, the significance of deposition to foliage in reducing air pollutant concentrations in cities and the service this provides is often questioned. Although pollutants deposit on vegetation, the change in turbulence and wind speed brought about by increased friction can often limit dispersion and means that pollutant concentrations can be higher than expected. This paper re-analyses pollutant transects away from roads and into parks to compare the relevance of deposition and dispersion to lowered concentrations in park interiors and shows that pollutant concentrations typically decline more rapidly along transects with vegetation than those without. This may support the notion that deposition to vegetation rapidly reduces pollutant concentrations, but simulations using ENVI-MET reveal that even dense foliage offers little improvement to air quality via removal of pollutants in small urban parks with length scale less than 100 m. New field observations show the dominance of aerodynamic factors in changing air quality in urban parks and the way vegetation affects pollutant concentrations through altering air flows. Deposition is generally not important for parks although it plays a role in the rapid removal of large particles with rapid settling velocities (> 10 cm s(-1)) at the park borders (< 5 m). Across cities as a whole rarely more than a percent or so of individual pollutants are removed by urban vegetation. Deposition on foliage is not an important contribution to improved air quality. Vegetation can alter the dispersion of pollutants from roads into parks and effectively increase pollutant concentrations. Nevertheless stands of trees or flower beds can affect the distribution of park users, so may change exposure to air pollutants by altering the spatial distribution of occupants.

Among others, emissions produced by electricity generation plants and industries were significantly lowered. Ultralow (< 15 ppm) sulfur fuels were introduced for road vehicles, nonroad, rail, and maritime transport. New heavy-duty diesel trucks have been equipped with particle traps and NOx controls. Residual oil (No. 6) for space heating and for any other purpose was replaced with cleaner No. 2 and No. 4 oils. Chemical speciation of PM2.5 has been measured since 2005 at eight sites across the New York State. A prior study has identified and apportioned the major sources of PM2.5 across the State using receptor modelling (positive matrix factorization). This present study aims to investigate the long-term trends of those source-apportioned PM2.5 mass contributions from 2005 to 2016 at the eight sites: two rural sites (Pinnacle and Whiteface), three medium sized cities (Buffalo, Albany, Rochester), and three sites in the New York City metropolitan area (Bronx, Manhattan and Queens). Negative trends from 2005 to 2016 were detected across the state for secondary sulfate (from -0.19 mu g/m(3)/y in Rochester to -0.36 mu g/m(3)/y at BRO and QUE) and secondary nitrate (from -0.02 mu g/m(3)/y at the rural sites to approximately -0.2 mu g/m(3)/y at BRO and MAN). Spark-ignition vehicles were the only source type experiencing upward annual trends at all urban sites with slopes ranging from 0.02 mu g/m(3)/y (ROC, not statistically significant) to similar to 0.2 mu g/m(3)/y (Albany, Bronx, Manhattan). Other sources exhibited different trends among the sites. The relationships of source contributions with emissions inventories were explored with regression analysis. A new trajectory model, differential concentration-weighted trajectories (DCWT), was used to examine spatial changes in sources of secondary aerosol affecting the rural sites.

We investigated the influence of roadside green infrastructure (GI) on concentrations of particulate matters <= 10 mu m (PM10), <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), <= 1 mu m (PM1), black carbon (BC) and particle number concentrations (PNC) under three GI configurations - (i) hedges only, (ii) trees only, and (iii) a mix of trees and hedges/shrubs-separately in close (< 1 m) and away (> 2 m) road conditions. These configurations gave us a total of six different real-world scenarios for evaluation. The changes in concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, PM1, BC and PNC at all six sites were estimated by comparing simultaneous measurements behind and in front of GI (or adjacent clear area). A portable battery-operated experimental set-up was designed for measuring the pollutant concentrations for 30 full days over a field campaign period of three months. On each day, around 10 h of continuous data were recorded simultaneously behind and in front of GI/adjacent clear area, capturing both morning and evening traffic peaks. Our objectives were to: (i) assess the effectiveness of different types of GI in reducing various pollutants; (ii) evaluate the impact of wind directions and density of vegetation on reducing different pollutant concentrations behind GI; (iii) investigate the changes in fractional composition of sub-micron (PM1), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particles; and (iv) quantify the elemental composition of collected particles before and after the GI. In away-road conditions, all three configurations showed reductions behind the GI for all pollutants. The 'hedges only' configuration showed higher pollutant reductions than the other two configurations, with maximum reductions of up to 63% shown for BC. In close-road conditions, the results were mixed. The 'trees only' configuration reported increases in most of the pollutant concentrations, whereas the combination of trees and hedges resulted in reduced pollutant concentrations behind the GI. Among all pollutants, the highest relative changes in concentration were observed for BC (up to 63%) and lowest for PM2.5 (14%). Categorising the data based on wind directions showed the highest reduction during along-road wind conditions (i.e., parallel to the road). This was expected due to the sweeping of emissions by the wind and the wake of road vehicles whilst the barrier effect of GI enhanced this cleansing, limiting lateral diffusion of the pollutants. However, cross-road winds that took vehicular emissions to pass through the GI allowed us to assess their influence, showing up to 52, 15, 17, 31 and 30% reduction for BC, PM10, PM2.5, PM1 and PNC, respectively. The largest reductions were consistently noted for the mixed 'trees and hedges' configuration in close-road conditions and the 'hedge only' configuration in away-road conditions. The assessment of various fractions of PM showed that 'hedges only' and a combination of trees and hedges lowered fine particles behind GI. The SEM-EDS analysis indicated the dominance of natural particles (50%) and a reduction in vehicle-related particles (i.e., iron and its oxides, Ba, Cr, Mn) behind GI when compared with the in-front/adjacent clear area. The evidence contributed by this work enhances our understanding of air quality modifications under the influence of different GI configurations, for multiple pollutants. In turn, this will support the formulation of appropriate guidelines for GI design, to reduce the air pollution exposure of those living, working or travelling near busy roads.

The relationship between tree mortality from a pine beetle epidemic and increased dissolved copper levels in the upper Big Thompson River, Colorado	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Bark beetle; Water quality; Dissolved copper; Tree mortality	ORGANIC-MATTER; BARK BEETLES; BY-PRODUCTS; FOREST; TOXICITY; MOBILITY; HARDNESS; IMPACT; TROUT	Bark beetle outbreaks in the Rocky Mountains caused substantial tree mortality starting in the late 1990s, and continued into the 2000s, with the most severe mortality occurring from 2002 to 2012. Over the same time period, concentrations of dissolved copper in the Big Thompson River (BTR), Colorado, USA, increased significantly and are high enough to negatively affect aquatic life. We examined correlations between dissolved copper and tree mortality in the BTR. Two sites, one consisting of water from the western side of the continental divide and one consisting of water from the eastern side, demonstrated a positive relationship between percentage tree mortality and dissolved copper. The relationships were similar except that the best relationship occurred with a 3-year lag between tree mortality and subsequent dissolved copper levels at the eastern site and with a 5-year lag at the western site. The differential time lag is potentially the result of different levels of carbon in the soil in the watersheds associated with each site because carbon can affect copper mobility. Our results suggest that bark beetle-induced tree mortality may contribute significantly to dissolved copper levels in the BTR.

Under natural conditions, however, multiple environmental factors often vary simultaneously. I studied the consequences for lifetime fitness caused by single treatments or treatment combinations by investigating patterns of phenotypic plasticity within and between generations. The parental plants (three genotypes of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana) received zero, one or two stress treatments at an early life-stage. The treatments included wounding, shading, chilling, and their pairwise combinations. In the second generation, offspring of treated plants received either the parental or no treatment. Offspring of non-treated plants were reared under all treatment conditions. Plants responded strongly to the treatments, especially through delayed reproduction, which positively affected lifetime fitness. Notably, treatment combinations triggered stronger plastic responses on average. Because the delay in reproduction was offset by a delay in senescence, the treatments resulted in a fitness gain instead of a loss. However, under adverse environmental conditions, this delay represents a potential fitness cost, especially when the time for reproduction is limited. The treatments 'wounding' and 'shading' triggered parental effects that increased fitness only in plants that themselves received the treatment. Untreated offspring of wounded or shaded parents performed like control plants. Also, these parental effects were not accompanied by potential fitness costs, such as delayed reproduction. Chilling triggered genotype-specific parental effects that increased or reduced fitness. Of the treatment combinations only 'wounding' and 'shading' resulted in genotype-specific parental effects that increased or reduced fitness independently of offspring treatment. These results suggest that the response of annual plants to treatment combinations triggers predominantly within-generation plastic responses that include potential fitness costs, which cannot be inferred from studies that manipulate environmental factors individually. Therefore, single treatment studies likely underestimate the costs of plasticity in natural environments.

Thus, spontaneous preferences are hypothesised to reflect the floral reward properties of the habitats in which these insects evolved. However, little is known about colour preferences in non-flower-visiting insects, and the ecological significance of such preferences. We investigated spontaneous colour preferences in the context of feeding and colour learning in the obligate fruit-feeding satyrine butterfly Mycalesis mineus. We report that M. mineus has true colour vision and naive butterflies, both males and females, did not prefer any colour in the absence of olfactory cues in a four-colour test array. Interestingly, females preferred yellow in the presence of food odour, indicating the modulatory effect of olfactory cues on spontaneous colour preferences. Further, when yellow was replaced with orange, female preference shifted to red, demonstrating the influence of colour combinations used in the test. We also report that M. mineus females rapidly learn to associate colour, both the preferred yellow and the non-preferred blue, with fermented banana as reward. Thus, for the first time, we report spontaneous colour preferences and colour learning in a non-flower-visiting butterfly. We also demonstrate that the colour preferences are sexually dimorphic in M. mineus and argue that multimodal stimuli are important for foraging decisions in fruit-feeding butterflies.Significance statementSpontaneous colour preferences exhibited by naive flower-visiting insects are thought to reflect sensory biases and are hypothesised to be adaptive as they guide insects to rewarding flowers. However, such colour preferences in non-flower-visiting insects and their adaptive significance remain unclear. We demonstrate that Mycalesis mineus, a fruit-feeding butterfly, has true colour vision and exhibits spontaneous colour preferences and these preferences are sexually dimorphic. We also demonstrate that colour preferences are modulated by olfactory cues and are influenced by colour combinations presented in tests. We also report that female butterflies rapidly learn to associate colour with rewards. Our results demonstrate that naive fruit-feeding butterflies rely on both visual and olfactory modalities and depend on spontaneous and learnt behaviours while making foraging decisions.

In cooperatively breeding and eusocial taxa, there is potential for parents to strategically manipulate offspring phenotype in their own interests. Social insect queens are nearly always larger than their worker offspring, and queens could benefit by producing small daughter workers in several ways. If queens use aggression to dominate or coerce workers, a queen producing small workers might minimize potential conflict or competition from her offspring. In addition, because of the trade-off between the number of workers she is able to produce and their individual size, a queen may produce small workers to optimize colony work effort. In this study, we investigate why queens of the primitively eusocial paper wasp Polistes gallicus limit the size of their workers. We created queen-worker size mismatches by cross-fostering queens between nests. We then tested whether the queen-worker size difference affects worker foraging and reproductive effort, or the amount of aggression in the group. Some of our results were consistent with the idea that queens limit worker size strategically: small workers were no less successful foragers, so that producing a larger number of smaller workers may overall increase queen fitness. We found that queens were less likely to attack large workers, perhaps because attempting to coerce large workers is riskier. However, larger workers did not forage less, did not invest more in ovarian development, and were not more aggressive themselves. There was therefore little evidence overall that queens limit conflict by producing smaller workers.Significance statementIn social animals, parents might manipulate phenotypic traits of their offspring in their own interests. In paper wasps (Polistes), the first offspring produced are smaller than the queen and become workers: instead of founding their own nests, they stay and help their mother to rear new queens and males. We investigated whether P. gallicus queens could benefit by producing small daughter workers by using cross-fostering to create size mismatches between queens and their offspring. We then recorded foraging activity, reproductive effort, and aggression on nests. Queens were less likely to attack larger workers, but overall, there was limited evidence of size-based queen-worker conflict. However, because small workers were no less successful foragers, producing a larger number of smaller workers may optimize colony work effort.

We tested whether there are trade-offs between warning colouration and chemical defence or whether these have an additive effect when combined, using blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) as predators and the polymorphic wood tiger moth (Arctia plantaginis) as prey. We used artificial edible models (with and without the moths' defensive fluids) with paper wings whose colour and pattern properties matched those of real moths. When the models were presented sans defensive fluids or when the fluids were presented without colour cues, we detected no differences in initial avoidance between the two morphs. However, when the colour and chemical cues were combined, differences emerged. White wings elicited higher latency to approach regardless of the defensive fluids applied on them. After approach, however, the defensive fluids of both morphs presented on moth models elicited higher latency to attack than a water control, hinting at a repellent odour. Fluids of white moths rendered lower amounts of prey eaten regardless of wing colour, while yellow moths' fluids provoked the highest occurrence of beak wiping behaviour. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for interactive effects between different signal modalities, as these can create patterns not detectable when examined in isolation. Understanding these interactions is vital to determine how different components of multimodal warning displays provide protection at different stages of a predation event and, potentially, how multiple morphs can co-occur in a population.Significance statementThere are many things that can stop a predator attacking a prey such as looking scary or smelling bad, but if a predator does take a bite, tasting bad can make the difference between life and death for the prey. When combined with bright conspicuous colours, both repellent odours and deterrent tastes (i.e. chemical defences) can help predators learn to avoid unprofitable prey. However, it is unclear whether it is really the sum of these visual and chemical signals that most effectively deters predators or whether one is more important than the other. Examining the effects of warning colour and chemical defence in white and yellow wood tiger moths on wild-caught birds, we show that neither aspect of the moths' defence in isolation is as effective for predator deterrence as the sum of both.

Differential impacts of vaccination on wildlife disease spread during epizootic and enzootic phases	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						enzootic; epizootic; habitat fragmentation; individual-based model; infectious disease management; rabies; vaccination; wildlife disease	ORAL RABIES VACCINE; RACCOON RABIES; LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY; PROCYON-LOTOR; ONTARIO; DYNAMICS; DENSITY; EPIDEMIC; CANADA; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Dissemination of oral vaccine baits is a cost-effective method to contain and control infectious wildlife diseases. The effectiveness of vaccine barriers in slowing or halting disease spread depends on host ecology and landscape variability. However, it is not clear the extent to which the success of vaccine barriers to manage disease may change from an epizootic to an enzootic phase of a disease invasion, nor is it apparent if this depends on the quality and configuration of host habitats. We explore these questions using the raccoon variant rabies virus (RRV) as a model system. This zoonotic disease of high concern has been enzootic in eastern North America for decades, pushing into new areas and re-emerging in previously controlled zones. We use a spatially explicit individual-based model to assess how levels of oral vaccination and habitat fragmentation affect RRV spread across vaccine barriers during epizootic and enzootic phases. We use space-time characteristics of infection chains (individual-to-individual transmission of RRV) to compare simulated outcomes. Results indicate that vaccine barriers have the strongest impact on the control of RRV during the epizootic phase. Counterproductively, mid-levels of immunisation during an enzootic phase lead to more rabies-induced mortalities than lower or higher vaccination levels. Infection chains spread faster during the epizootic phase. Landscape effects on chain characteristics were more subtle than effects of invasion phase and vaccination. Synthesis and applications. A spatially explicit individual-based modelling approach to examine mechanisms of raccoon variant rabies virus spread during epizootic and enzootic phases provides insights into efficacy of wildlife disease vaccination efforts. Our results demonstrate the importance of detecting and controlling outbreaks before they become enzootic. We discuss the implications for moving vaccine barriers to push back and decrease the size of enzootic areas.

Privately protected areas provide key opportunities for the regional persistence of large- and medium-sized mammals	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity persistence; conservation planning; large mammal; megafauna; multi-tenure; private land conservation; privately protected area; protected areas	CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; SOUTH-AFRICA; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; LAND; COUNTRIES; NETWORKS; HOTSPOT	Biodiversity conservation relies heavily on protected areas (PAs). However, in locations that are desirable for agriculture, industry, or human habitation (e.g., lowland habitats on fertile soils, coastal zones), land is often privately owned and state-owned PAs tend to be under-represented. Despite the potentially disproportionate contribution that privately protected areas (PPAs) could make to representing biodiversity and supporting its persistence across regional PA estates, this contribution is poorly understood. We assessed the capacity of PPAs to contribute to the persistence of 38 large- and medium-sized mammals in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, based on a previously published conservation plan that used species population requirements to identify areas of importance for mammal conservation. We hypothesized that, relative to state-owned PAs, PPAs would be disproportionately located in areas important to the regional persistence of the mammal assemblage, given: (a) historic biases in the distribution of private- and state-owned land across high and low productivity landscapes, respectively; (b) private landholders' recent focus on wildlife-orientated enterprises; and (c) the conservation trade-offs influencing expansions of the state-owned PA estate. As a result of the high numbers of PPAs and their bias towards areas of importance for mammal conservation, the potential mammal species diversity and richness that could persist within a PA increased more rapidly with PA size on PPAs than on state-owned PAs. These PPAs therefore have the potential to significantly increase both the regional-scale diversity of protected mammals and the number of viable populations. Furthermore, PPAs could make the greatest absolute contribution to the conservation of protected species when adjoining, and thus expanding, state-owned PAs (i.e., mixed-ownership PAs). Regional conservation targets for a quarter of the species were only met due to the inclusion of private- and/or mixed-ownership PAs in the estate. Policy implications. Our findings show that privately protected areas (PPAs) could play a substantial role in the long-term conservation of terrestrial megafauna within a multi-tenure protected area (PA) estate, due to their prevalence in high-productivity landscapes. The significant gains from augmenting state-owned PAs with PPAs emphasize the value of systematic conservation planning and implementation across tenure types.

Individual consumption of supplemental food as a predictor of reproductive performance and viral infection intensity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						BFDV; diet; parrot; population recovery; qPCR; reproductive fitness; stable isotope analysis; supplemental feeding	MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGY; DISEASE; SIZE; IMMUNOCOMPETENCE; CONSERVATION; SENESCENCE; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; MODELS	Supplemental food is often provided to threatened species in order to maintain or enhance reproductive fitness and thus population growth. However, its impact on individual reproductive fitness is rarely evaluated, despite being associated with both positive and negative consequences. We used stable isotope analyses to characterise the relative proportional consumption of supplemental food and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assess beak and feather disease viral infection intensity among parakeets. Life-history and nest-site data from a long-term monitoring effort was incorporated. Older females benefitted the most from supplemental feeding; demonstrated by a greater reproductive uplift than younger females. There were no strong predictors of viral infection levels among nestlings. Reproductive fitness, measured by the number of fledglings produced per brood, was positively associated with proportional dietary content of supplemental food among adult parakeets and breeding pairs that nested closer to feeding stations consumed more supplemental food than those nesting further away. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that supplementary feeding can lead to an overall increase in population growth. However, by characterising individual consumption, we also reveal subtle patterns of use and differential benefits on reproductive fitness within a population. Manipulating the delivery of supplemental food may help to reduce demand on finite resources or target the proportion of a population that derives the most benefit, but is associated with trade-offs in fecundity. For example, the use of and access to feeding stations could potentially be targeted towards specific individuals, or positioned in the habitats most deficient in native food. However, increasing reproductive fitness in one component of the population may be accompanied by a decrease in another. This knowledge can be incorporated into adaptive management strategies that aim to fulfil specific objectives associated with species recovery and long-term viability as long as the relative importance of each objective is be considered.

However, they have been severely affected by farming intensification and land abandonment, which have been both exacerbated by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The most recent CAP included a "greening" measure dedicated to grassland conservation, presumed to be beneficial to biodiversity; however, scientific evidence about its effectiveness is still scarce. In the Alps, hay meadows have undergone dramatic management changes in recent decades. We used a comprehensive community ecology approach to highlight how the multi-scale and interacting effects of such changes impact birds, with the aim of providing knowledge to support improvements to the CAP. Birds were surveyed at 63 landscape units in northeast Italy, equally subdivided into areas dominated by (a) extensive hay meadows, (b) intensive hay meadows, and (c) areas formerly dominated by meadows but partially converted into other agricultural land use. This environmental gradient mirrors in space the temporal gradient of the agricultural changes that have recently occurred in the Alps. Community composition, species richness, and the number of meadow-specialist species were analysed according to environmental predictors (i.e. landscape, meadow management, and topography), and to spatial factors. We aimed to disentangle the exclusive and joint fraction of variation explained by each of them. Meadow conversion, allowed by the CAP in force, created a shift in community composition towards assemblages dominated by generalist species at the expense of meadow specialists. The cover of intensive meadows was negatively correlated with species richness, whereas the number of meadow specialists was negatively correlated with the cover of early-mown (i.e. within the third week of June) meadows. Mowing date was, in turn, related to elevation, with meadows at higher elevations mown later in the season, and to meadow intensification (the use of external inputs, in particular liquid manure, leads to earlier and more frequent cuts per year). Policy implications. Our study confirms the concerns about effectiveness of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy greening grassland measure in conserving biodiversity in those ecosystems. We suggest rethinking the Common Agricultural Policy environmental prescriptions to account for the importance of meadow management in determining bird diversity patterns in Alpine hay meadows. Finally, we highlight market-based conservation strategies as complementary approaches for preserving grassland biodiversity.

Population responses of farmland bird species to agri-environment schemes and land management options in Northeastern Scotland	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						agriculture; agri-environment schemes; farmland birds; low-intensity farmland; multimembership; offset; passerine; spatial statistics	LINEAR MIXED MODELS; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; LEVEL STEWARDSHIP; CIRL BUNTINGS; CREX-CREX; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; HABITATS	The decline of farmland birds across Europe is a well-documented case of biodiversity loss, and despite land stewardship supported by funding from agri-environment schemes (AES), the negative trends have not yet been reversed. To investigate the contribution of AES towards farmland bird conservation, we compared abundance of five farmland bird species across 13 years and 53 farms (158 farm years = AES, 72 farm years = non AES) in Northeastern Scotland (UK), a region with relatively mixed farmland. Between 2003 and 2015, on both AES and control farms, skylark (Alauda arvensis) showed a nonsignificant decline, and tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) nonsignificant increases, whereas reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and linnet (Carduelis cannabina) populations remained relatively stable. We did not detect a significant association between AES and avian abundance or population trends for any of these species, but there were positive associations with some AES management options. Possible explanations for the lack of a significant AES-bird abundance association include poor uptake of the best AES options for farmland birds, suboptimal implementation, spill-over effects from AES onto control farms, and the relatively good state of farmland habitats outwith AES in Northeastern Scotland. Synthesis and applications. We documented a weak effect size of participation in agri-environment schemes on farmland bird abundance. We therefore recommend future monitoring studies be designed after consulting a power analysis. Among different land management options, we found that species-rich grasslands, water margins, and wetland creation enhanced breeding bird abundance, highlighting the importance of relatively undisturbed herbaceous or grassland vegetation for farmland conservation.

However, knowledge regarding biological control of rodent pests is limited, and its effectiveness in temperate areas has not been quantified. In traditional Japanese apple orchards, the Ural owl Strix uralensis breeds in tree hollows and preys on the Japanese field vole Microtus montebelli, a native pest species that can harm fruit production. In this study, we hypothesised that the Ural owl, a generalist predator, can act as a biological control agent by reducing vole densities in temperate orchards. To quantify the pest control effects of breeding Ural owls, we first analysed the diet of individual owls nesting in apple tree hollows. Second, we installed nest boxes in orchards to attract breeding owl pairs and collected data on vole population changes around owl nests to compare with control areas. The population changes were analysed using a generalised linear mixed model to assess the effect of breeding owls within their breeding territory. The model considered seasonal fluctuations in vole population size as well as surrounding land-use. We also examined vole populations around the owl nests in April, and the distance between nests and forested areas, to determine if these variables influenced nest site selection. Voles were the primary prey of Ural owls breeding in orchards and the owls reduced vole populations within their estimated breeding territories by 63% (+/- SE: 53%-70%) compared with the predicted density without owls. Owls preferred to nest in orchards with higher vole population densities in April. Our findings also indicate that higher occupancy rates are possible by distributing nest boxes based on Ural owl breeding territory size (306 m radius circle in our study). Synthesis and applications. As breeding Ural owls provide significant pest control effects within their breeding territories, the reintroduction of breeding Ural owl pairs within orchards would contribute to rodent pest control. Promoting the reproduction of native raptors in agricultural areas can be an option for developing integrated pest management while simultaneously maintaining regional biodiversity.

Combining optimization and simulation modelling to measure the cumulative impacts of prescribed fire and wildfire on vegetation species diversity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity conservation; fire; management objective; optimization; prescribed fire; simulation modelling; species diversity; wildfire	SOIL SEED BANK; MULTISPECIES CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; AGE-CLASSES; MANAGEMENT; SUCCESSION; AUSTRALIA; RESPONSES; HEATHLAND; CLIMATE	Growth-stage optimization (GSO) offers a new approach to biodiversity conservation in fire-prone regions by estimating the optimal distribution of vegetation growth stages that maximize a species diversity index. This optimal growth-stage structure provides managers an operational goal explicitly linked to a positive conservation outcome but does not define the fire regime needed to achieve it. We paired GSO with LANDIS II, a landscape succession and disturbance simulation model, to (a) estimate the optimal growth-stage structure that maximized vegetation diversity in a south-east Australian heathy woodland, (b) define the fire regime needed to achieve it, and (c) determine the cumulative effects of different fire-regime scenarios on vegetation diversity over a 60-year period. Scenarios included 0%, 2%, 5%, and 10% of the landscape burnt per year by prescribed fire only, or in combination with three alternative wildfire regimes. Furthermore, we investigated the differences in the optimal growth-stage structure relating to above-ground, soil seedbank, and total (above and soil seedbank) diversity datasets. The growth-stage structure that maximized total vegetation diversity comprised approximately even proportions of all stages. In contrast, separately analysed above-ground and soil seedbank data resulted in a greater proportion of younger and older growth-stages, respectively. Scenarios including 5% prescribed burning per year (with and without wildfire) resulted in diversity values within 1.5% of the theoretical maximum value. Scenarios including 2% and 10% prescribed fire resulted in diversity values 8%-12% and 1.5%-5% lower than the maximum, respectively. Scenarios without prescribed fire caused diversity to fall 30%-70%. Trends across the 60 years showed that wildfire depressed diversity and subsequent prescribed fire drove recovery within 15 years. The largest threat to vegetation diversity was the absence of fire. Synthesis and applications. Combining growth-stage optimization and simulation modelling is a powerful way of defining a conservation-based fire management goal and identifying the prescribed fire regime needed to achieve it. We demonstrated that vegetation diversity in heathy woodland was increased by prescribed fire, with and without the cumulative effect of wildfire, and declined sharply when fire was excluded. Our method provides a flexible platform for developing long-term fire management strategies that seek to balance human safety and biodiversity conservation. Including both plants and animals in GSO will help land managers meet the needs of multiple taxa.

Despite the large extension of restored forests, the success of contrasting restoration strategies (active - planted forests - vs. passive - secondary forests -) over time has never been evaluated in Mediterranean forests. We studied how restoration strategy determined forest restoration success. We evaluated which restoration strategy resulted in forests more like references (i.e. forests with continuous canopy cover since at least the 1940s) in terms of structure, diversity, functional composition, and dynamics. We then assessed whether active restoration accelerated forest recovery compared to passive restoration. We studied a chronosequence of recovery in four forest types (mountain and Mediterranean pine forests and mesic and Mediterranean oak forests) using the data of the Spanish Forest Inventory in central Spain. Each plot was classified as planted, secondary or reference forest. We modelled the response ratios of 11 forest attributes and a multifunctionality index as a function of restoration strategy, forest age, and abiotic and biotic constraints. Secondary forests showed a greater likeness to references than planted forests in oak forests while minor differences between secondary and planted forests were found in pine forests. The recovery speed of most forest attributes in secondary and planted forests was similar. Multifunctionality was higher, and increased more rapidly, in planted than in secondary forests in Mediterranean oak forests. However, multifunctionality was similar for both restoration strategies in the other forest types. Synthesis and applications. The long-term assessment of forest recovery in Mediterranean abandoned fields indicated that both planted forests and natural forest succession are successful restoration strategies, depending on the aim and the forest type. In our research, restoration strategy did not influence the magnitude and speed of forest recovery in pine forests. However, in oak forests, natural forest succession led to forests more alike to references, but planted forests can maximize and accelerate recovery of forest multifunctionality.

Functional diversity can mitigate the impacts of climate extremes in different types of ecosystems, but few studies have focused on tree functional diversity in forest ecosystems. It is critical to identify functional traits that could help anticipate the impact of drought on tree mortality, and how these affect above-ground tree biomass productivity at the ecosystem level. We tested how three functional traits (ratio of dry leaf mass per unit area [LMA], xylem pressure at which 50% of stem xylem conductivity is lost through cavitation [psi(50)] and leaf area to sapwood ratio) influence severe drought impacts on stand mortality and productivity. We used structural equation modelling to compare the effect of a latent variable composed of these three traits between plots that had suffered drought and plots that had not, on the mortality and productivity of northern temperate and boreal forests of Quebec, Canada. A latent variable composed of LMA and psi(50) significantly explained drought-induced tree mortality, but did not explain stand productivity response to severe drought. Therefore, even if these traits relate to the ability of species to survive drought (drought tolerance) at the tree level, they did not affect the maintenance of plant productivity during drought events (drought resistance) at the stand scale. We hypothesize that the effect of tree mortality on productivity was likely compensated by the formation of canopy openings that stimulate the growth of surviving trees. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that mitigation of water loss and xylem resistance to cavitation contribute similarly to severe drought tolerance in trees within northern temperate and boreal forests. Therefore, including drought-resistant trees in fine-scale mixtures might mitigate the impacts of drought on forest productivity due to the survivors' response to released resources.

Instability of insular tree communities in an Amazonian mega-dam is driven by impaired recruitment and altered species composition	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						environmental impact assessment; fire; floristic change; fragmentation; habitat connectivity; hydropower; mega-dam; tropical forest	ATLANTIC FOREST; FRAGMENTATION; ASSEMBLAGES; RESPONSES; DIVERSITY; PARADIGM; DYNAMICS; ISLANDS; FUTURE; DECAY	Mega-dams create highly fragmented archipelagos, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in remnant forest isolates. This study assessed the long-term impact of dam-induced fragmentation on insular tropical tree communities, with the aim of generating robust recommendations to mitigate some of the detrimental biodiversity impacts associated with future dam development. We inventoried adult and sapling trees across 89 permanent plots, located on 36 islands and in three mainland continuous forest sites in the Balbina Dam, Brazilian Amazon. We examined differences in recruitment, structure, and composition of sapling and adult tree communities, in relation to plot-, patch- and landscape-scale attributes including area, isolation, and fire severity. Islands harboured significantly lower sapling (mean +/- 95% CI 48.6 +/- 3.8) and adult (5 +/- 0.2) tree densities per 0.01 ha, than nearby mainland continuous forest (saplings, 65.7 +/- 7.5; adults, 5.6 +/- 0.3). Insular sapling and adult tree communities were more dissimilar than in mainland sites, and species compositions showed a directional shift away from mainland forests, induced by fire severity, island area, and isolation. Insular sapling recruitment declined with increasing fire severity; tree communities with higher community-weighted mean wood density showed the greatest recruitment declines. Our results suggest that insular tree communities are unstable, with rare species becoming extinction-prone due to reduced tree recruitment and density on islands, potentially leading to future losses in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across Balbina's >3,500 reservoir islands. Policy implications. In Balbina, fire and reduced habitat area and connectivity were drivers of tree community decay after only 28 years of insularization, despite strict protection provided by the similar to 940,000 ha Uatuma Biological Reserve. Given that many dams are planned for lowland, moderately undulating Amazonia, we recommend that dam development strategy explicitly considers (a) dam location, aiming to minimize creation of small (<10 ha) and isolated islands, (b) maintaining reservoir water levels during droughts to reduce fire risk, and (c) including aggregate island area in environmental impact and offset calculations. Ideally, we recommend that alternatives to hydropower be sought in lowland tropical regions, due to the far-reaching biodiversity losses and ecosystem disruption caused by river impoundment.

Bryophytes comprise the main vegetation of the continent and they endure many adversities, thriving in an environment hostile to most living organisms. Mosses are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, due to genotypic heterogeneity, environmental influences, or a combination of both. We investigated morphological diversity and its possible relationship with genetic diversity in the Antarctic moss, Roaldia revoluta, and also if the geographic distribution of morphotypes was related with environmental variables. We obtained 49 samples from Antarctica, including King George Island (K), James Ross Island (J), and several locations in the Antarctic Peninsula (P), representing most of the habitats where this species is found. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using quantitative measures of gametophytic morphological characters. For molecular analyses, we used DNA sequences of five molecular markers obtained from 29 specimens. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was carried out to compare morphological diversity with environmental variables. Our data support the existence of two morphotypes of R. revoluta, morphotype A (apiculate and ovate leaves), more frequent in K, and morphotype B (acuminate and more oblong leaves), more common in J. Both morphotypes were present in P. The distinct morphotypes could not be related with genetic heterogeneity, since no sequence differences were found in any of the selected markers, supporting the morphological distinction being explained by environmental factors. The results from CCA supported a relationship between the observed morphological variation and the local environmental characteristics of wind speed and minimum temperature.

Due to ongoing warming of the sub-Arctic, there is potential for a mismatch between the peak in available invertebrate biomass and the peak in food demand for shorebird chicks. During the summers of 2010 and 2011, we investigated the relationship between temperature and benthic and terrestrial invertebrate biomass, measured using three sampling techniques in Churchill, Manitoba. We also investigated the relationship between timing of breeding of Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) and timing of peaks in invertebrate biomass. In 2011, chick growth rates were also measured to examine whether hatching in synchrony with the peak in invertebrate biomass during the brood rearing period affected growth rates. In 2010, emergent and core invertebrate biomass were negatively related to soil degree days, whereas in 2011, core biomass increased with soil degree days and pitfall biomass increased with air temperature. Total invertebrate biomass (summed over trap types) peaked from 25 to 31days before the median chick hatch date in 2010 and 10days after the median chick hatch date in 2011. In 2011 we did not detect any effects of asynchrony on the growth of Semipalmated Plover chicks. These results may indicate that food resources in their environment remain adequate throughout the breeding season, despite inter-annual fluctuations in the timing of invertebrate peaks.	[Corkery, C.

Simulation and power calculations were used to determine error rates based on observed control coefficients of variation (CV) for 8 laboratories over a range of effect levels. Average C. dubia control reproduction among laboratories was 20 to 40 offspring per female, and the 75th percentile CV was 0.10 to 0.31, reflecting a range in laboratory performance. The 2 approaches behave similarly for CVs of 0.2 to 0.3. At effects <10%, as CV decreases, TST is less likely to declare toxicity and NOEC is more likely to do so. Laboratory performance affects whether a sample is declared toxic and influences the probability of false-positive (and -negative) error rates using either approach. At the 75th percentile control CV observed for each laboratory, 4 laboratories would achieve approximately a 5% false-positive rate using 13 or fewer replicates for this test method. For the remaining 4 laboratories, more replicates would be needed to achieve a 5% false-positive rate. The present analyses demonstrate how false-positive rates are influenced by laboratory performance and WET test design. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:511-523.

Patterns of mercury and selenium exposure in minnesota common loons	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Common loon; Exposure risk; Mercury; Selenium; Wildlife toxicology	GAVIA-IMMER; YELLOW PERCH; TOXICOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE; METHYLMERCURY EXPOSURE; PISCIVOROUS FISH; LAKES; WISCONSIN; ACCUMULATION; BIOACCUMULATION; REPRODUCTION	Common loons (Gavia immer) are at risk of elevated dietary mercury (Hg) exposure in portions of their breeding range. To assess the level of risk among loons in Minnesota (USA), we investigated loon blood Hg concentrations in breeding lakes across Minnesota. Loon blood Hg concentrations were regressed on predicted Hg concentrations in standardized 12-cm whole-organism yellow perch (Perca flavescens), based on fish Hg records from Minnesota lakes, using the US Geological Survey National Descriptive Model for Mercury in Fish. A linear model, incorporating common loon sex, age, body mass, and log-transformed standardized perch Hg concentration representative of each study lake, was associated with 83% of the variability in observed common loon blood Hg concentrations. Loon blood Hg concentration was positively related to standardized perch Hg concentrations; juvenile loons had lower blood Hg concentrations than adult females, and blood Hg concentrations of juveniles increased with body mass. Blood Hg concentrations of all adult common loons and associated standardized prey Hg for all loon capture lakes included in the study were well below proposed thresholds for adverse effects on loon behavior, physiology, survival, and reproductive success. The fish Hg modeling approach provided insights into spatial patterns of dietary Hg exposure risk to common loons across Minnesota. We also determined that loon blood selenium (Se) concentrations were positively correlated with Hg concentration. Average common loon blood Se concentrations exceeded the published provisional threshold. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:524-532. Published 2018 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

To assess the potential effects of chlorpyrifos on the bird community, a multiyear, multisite monitoring program was carried out in treated cider orchards (in the United Kingdom) and treated citrus orchards (in Spain). Constant-effort mist netting was used over several consecutive years in the United Kingdom (2012-2014) and Spain (2010-2012). The general structure of the bird community and the presence of breeding species were analyzed. Twelve and 11 bird species (out of 81 and 45 trapped) in Spain and the United Kingdom, respectively, exceeded the 2% dominance value. For a selection of 6 species in citrus and 4 in cider orchards, N-mixture models were fitted to the number of trapped birds. The abundance of most species was strongly and significantly affected by seasonality. No species showed any indication of reduction in population size over the years. The results of this extensive field program support the indications that chlorpyrifos spray applications present a low risk to the bird community over the years. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:616-629.

Effect of soil properties and environmental factors on chemical compositions of forest soils in the Russian Far East	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Boreal forest; Cambisols; Geochemistry; Major and trace elements; Soil properties	FIRE-DERIVED CHARCOAL; TRACE-ELEMENTS; MAMYN TERRANE; RARE; ASH; MAGMATISM; ZN; PB; CR; NI	PurposeForest ecosystem acts as a significant sink and source of elements; however, the dynamics of trace elements (TEs) in soils of boreal zone are still poorly characterized. Data on relationships of TEs, major elements (MEs), soil properties, and parent rock geochemistry in boreal forest of Northeast Asia are scarce. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the origination of TEs in forest soils and identify soil properties and ecosystem processes controlling accumulation and profile distribution of TEs.Materials and methodsDystric Cambisols and underlying parent rocks have been sampled within hilly landscape covered by Gmelin larch (Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr.) forests in Amur region (Russia). This paper considers 10-selected soil characteristics, total concentrations of 19 TEs, and 10 MEs measured by ICP-MS and RFA analysis. Factor analysis has been employed to highlight underlying relationships hidden in a complex data of element concentration and soil characteristics. Origination of TEs was assessed by using an enrichment factor (EF) considering concentration of TEs in soil in comparison to underlying parent rocks using Ti as a reference element.Results and discussionA group of biophile Zn, Mo, Sn, and Pb were enriched in the upper soil horizon, and depleted in mineral compared to parent rocks. Beryllium, Sc, Cr, Cu, Ga, Ge, Ta, Th, and U were depleted in both horizons. Ni and Cs show highest enrichment in both studied soil horizons. Frequently occurring forest fires affect soil characteristics and TEs dynamic only in the upper part of soil profile. Factor analysis revealed potential effect of exchangeable Na and soil pH on accumulation of the elements in the upper horizon, as a result of ash deposition by fire.ConclusionsThe studied TEs primarily originate from underlying parent rocks. Accumulation versus leaching of TEs in Dystric Cambisols might be element specific and affected by fire-derived ash. Our work shows that the upper horizon of forest soils could act as a significant sink of group of TEs. Therefore, long-term observations of TEs dynamic in soil profiles are needed to elucidate biogeochemical cycles in frequently burned forests of Northeast Asia. The present study for the first time has established an important wide data set of TEs concentration in Dystric Cambisols of natural boreal forests in the Russian Far East.

Natural degradation of low-level petroleum hydrocarbon contamination under crop management	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Natural attenuation; Petroleum hydrocarbon degradation; Soil remediation	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; REMEDIATION; SOIL; BIODEGRADATION; BIOREMEDIATION; WHEAT; TECHNOLOGIES; ATTENUATION; RESIDUES; EXPOSURE	PurposeNatural degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) is a crucial process to consider when managing contaminated soils. However, the degradation rate is dictated by site-specific environmental factors and contaminant characteristics, so it is highly variable. Thus, region-specific research is required to determine the capacity of natural degradation processes to reach cleanup goals. This study describes the natural degradation of low levels of Bakken crude oil contamination in the Northern Great Plains, USA.Materials and methodsSoils contaminated by PHC from an accidental release of Bakken crude oil in western North Dakota, USA, were used to construct research plots adjacent to an active remediation site. The plots had four different initial PHC concentrations, 1400, 700, 220, and 100mgkg(-1), and they were monitored over two growing seasons under crop production. The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and field pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in the plots were assessed for uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).Results and discussionAfter two growing seasons under crop management, PHC concentrations were reduced between 46 and 53%. Neither the incorporation of composted manure nor the depth of sampling had any effect of PHC reduction, indicating that initial concentration is the driving factor in determining how long it will take to meet a given threshold. Half-life values ranged from 455 to 573days, which is critical information for land managers determining the best remediation approach. Notably, crops grown in these contaminated soils did not show increased risk of plant uptake of PAHs.ConclusionsOverall, these findings indicate that soil PHC concentrations decrease while producing common agricultural crops in this region, and the crops grown in these contaminated soils show no increased risk to crop safety. Thus, depending on specific project goals, continuing a normal crop rotation may be a viable management strategy for low-level soil contamination in this region.

SD25 application increased the solubility in seawater of PHE but not of NAP. Adsorbed SD25 increased the distribution coefficients of both polyaromatic hydrocarbons in sand but not silty loam and the solubilising effect of SD25 appeared to drive increased adsorption of PHE rather than sediment-adsorbed SD25 concentration.ConclusionsThe findings highlight the influence of SD25 application on the sorption dynamics of NAP and PHE in marine sediments from areas near hydrocarbon exploration and production regions. An understanding of these interactions may aid responders in the decision-making process of dispersant application in the event of a spill as seabed characteristics affect oil-dispersant-sediment interactions.

The error in stream sediment phosphorus fractionation and sorption properties effected by drying pretreatments	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Fractionation; Phosphorus; Pre-treatment; Sediment; Sorption	PHOSPHATE ADSORPTION; ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; WATER; SPECIATION; DYNAMICS; SAMPLES; MARINE; RIVERS; FORMS; SOIL	PurposeStream sediment can control phosphorus (P) in the water column at baseflow. Two common laboratory analyses of sediment P are the equilibrium phosphate concentration at net zero sorption (EPC0) and P fractionation. Good sample handling ensures representative results, but oftentimes, studies rely on air-dried or freeze-dried samples, which alters sediment biogeochemistry. How and to what extent this influences EPC0 and P fractionation remains unclear. We therefore examine pretreatment effects on sediment EPC0 and P fractionation.Materials and methodsWe collected fine sediments (<2mm) from streams in the Tukituki River and Reporoa Basins in New Zealand (n=31 sediments). Subsamples were then either kept fresh, frozen then lyophilized (freeze-dried), or dried at 40 degrees C for 2weeks (air-dried). Measurements of EPC0 and P fractionation were made in triplicate. The sequential P fractionation scheme determined five different P pools: NH4Cl (labile P), NaOH reactive P (RP; metal oxide-bound P) and unreactive P (URP; organic P), HCl (Ca-mineral P), and residual P. Along with statistical comparisons between fresh results and the two pre-treatments, we explored correlations between pre-treatment effects and sediment physicochemical characteristics.Results and discussionThe sediments had generally low EPC0 (majority <0.020mg PL-1), and uncertainty in EPC0 increased with concentration magnitude. While there were sediment-specific changes in EPC0 with pre-treatment, there was no consistent bias caused by pre-treatment. However, the differences between the fresh and air-dried sediment EPC0 were larger and more variable than between fresh and freeze-dried sediment. For P fractionation, the Tukituki sediments were enriched in HCl-P, while Reporoa sediments had more NaOH-RP and NaOH-URP. Despite large sediment-specific changes, the overall effects of freeze- and air-drying sediment were increased NH4Cl-P (estimated average effect, <mml:mo stretchy="true"></mml:mover>=+0.63 and +3.7mg Pkg(-1)), no significant changes for NaOH-RP, contrasting changes in NaOH-URP (-3.4 and +3.3mg Pkg(-1)), and decreased HCl-P (-40 and -33mg Pkg(-1)).ConclusionsWe found that drying sediment significantly influenced EPC0 and P fractions (especially the NH4Cl-P fraction). Air-drying was particularly error-prone and should be avoided. The use of freeze-drying to preserve samples for later analyses and improve ease of handling may be used with appropriate consideration of the research objectives and the error introduced by freeze-drying. However, we recommend using fresh sediments for analyses whenever possible, as they best represent natural conditions.

Arecaceae family is an important component of the tropical savanna flora, but the reproductive phenology of these plant species is not well understood. We aimed to: (i) test whether flowering and fruiting timing of the palms Syagrus comosa (Mart.) Mart., Syagrus flexuosa (Mart.) Becc. and Syagrus glazioviana (Mart.) Becc. were seasonal and correlated with precipitation; and (ii) investigate if closely related species overlapped in flowering and fruiting. The study was carried out during four years in three tropical woodland savanna sites in Brazil (Cerrado). At each of the three sites, we randomly tagged 20 adult individuals of each species and monthly monitored them for reproductive phenological events. We counted the number of flowers and of fruits and we compared these data with climatic records (precipitation). To test whether the three palm species flowered and fruited uniformly throughout the year, we applied the Rayleigh Z test. We correlated total rainfall of the month with number of flowers or fruits produced using a Spearman correlation test. Flowering and fruiting timing of the species during the years and across sites were mostly aseasonal and were in general not influenced by precipitation. These palm species had synchronous flowering but did not have synchronous fruiting. Because of the year-round fruit production, S. comosa, S. flexuosa and S. glazioviana might be fundamental species to the maintenance of frugivores. The synchronized flowering is an effective means of attracting pollinators and satiating florivores, improving plant reproductive success. The shifted fruiting peaks may emphasize the role of these palms in providing food for frugivores during the year.

POPULATIONS; DIVERSITY; EDGE; CONSERVATION; SIZE; HETEROGENEITY	The potential effects of climate change on the distribution of Mediterranean plants at their peripheral range make them extremely vulnerable to environmental fluctuations. The northern-most Italian population of Cistus albidus provides an outstanding case for study, as it grows at the extreme northern edge of its range and because phenological data have been available since the early XIX century. In the period 2012-2017, we analysed the population demography and spatial structure, growth and flowering phenology, and genetic variability to understand the history, current state and possible evolution of this population. Lastly, the population data were tested for association with environmental factors. The population studied consists of plants on average 10 years old, showing the highest growth rates in spring and autumn. Anthesis starts in April and ends in early June and is significantly dependent on temperature. High levels of genetic variability are present (average He = 0.471), with heterozygote excess detected at four loci out of five. Bayesian analysis does not support any genetic structuring of the population. The aggregated pattern in the distribution of individuals and their phenological traits, together with the absence of genetic structuring, seem to suggest that this extreme geographical population is not currently endangered.

Here we describe ramet growth and survival in an overdominant Neotropical bracken fern (Pteridium arachnoideum) and assess how these patterns resemble congeneric species and are affected by canopy closure in a savanna-riparian forest transition in southeastern Brazil. We measured frond length from early emergence to senescence during two consecutive years in three clonal patches dominated by P. arachnoideum and associated the resulting growth pattern with the local canopy closure. Pteridium arachnoideum exhibited average frond length and growth rate higher than previously reported for this species and for congeneric species. Frond mortality was generally high shortly after emergence from the ground, but was also much higher in one study site due to ant herbivory. Fronds of P. arachnoideum were higher, showed petiole elongation and higher mortality rate under high canopy closure, suggesting shading avoidance, in contrast to the shade tolerance reported for Pteridium aquilinum. Although our findings indicate that this species is unlikely to represent a threat to the biodiversity of undisturbed Brazilian savanna-riparian forest transitions with continuous canopy, they also suggest that introduction of fast growing tree species with dense canopy may accelerate the restoration of more disturbed and degraded sites.

Genomic sequence capture of haemosporidian parasites: Methods and prospects for enhanced study of host-parasite evolution	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						Apicomplexa; avian malaria; Haemoproteus; host-parasite relationships; hybrid enrichment; Leucocytozoon	AVIAN MALARIA PARASITES; BLOOD PARASITES; MICRODISSECTION MICROSCOPY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PLASMODIUM; HAEMOPROTEUS; PREVALENCE; DIVERSITY; PHYLOGENY; SPECIALIZATION	Avian malaria and related haemosporidians (Plasmodium, [Para]Haemoproteus and Leucocytoozoon) represent an exciting multihost, multiparasite system in ecology and evolution. Global research in this field accelerated after the publication in 2000 of PCR protocols to sequence a haemosporidian mitochondrial (mtDNA) barcode and the development in 2009 of an open-access database to document the geographic and host ranges of parasite mtDNA haplotypes. Isolating haemosporidian nuclear DNA from bird hosts, however, has been technically challenging, slowing the transition to genomic-scale sequencing techniques. We extend a recently developed sequence capture method to obtain hundreds of haemosporidian nuclear loci from wild bird samples, which typically have low levels of infection, or parasitemia. We tested 51 infected birds from Peru and New Mexico and evaluated locus recovery in light of variation in parasitemia, divergence from reference sequences and pooling strategies. Our method was successful for samples with parasitemia as low as similar to 0.02% (2 of 10,000 blood cells infected) and mtDNA divergence as high as 15.9% (one Leucocytozoonsample), and using the most cost-effective pooling strategy tested. Phylogenetic relationships estimated with >300 nuclear loci were well resolved, providing substantial improvement over the mtDNA barcode. We provide protocols for sample preparation and sequence capture including custom probe sequences and describe our bioinformatics pipeline using atram 2.0, phyluce and custom Perl/Python scripts. This approach can be applied to thousands of avian samples that have already been found to have haemosporidian infections of at least moderate intensity, greatly improving our understanding of parasite speciation, biogeography and evolutionary dynamics.

To study the microbial ecology of soils, and other microbiomes, biomolecules, that is, nucleic acids and proteins, must be efficiently and reliably co-recovered from the same biological samples. Commercial kits are currently available for the co-extraction of DNA, RNA and proteins but none has been developed for soil samples. We present a new protocol drawing on existing phenol-chloroform-based methods for nucleic acids co-extraction but incorporating targeted precipitation of proteins from the phenol phase. The protocol is cost-effective and robust, and easily implemented using reagents commonly available in laboratories. The method is estimated to be eight times cheaper than using disparate commercial kits for the isolation of DNA and/or RNA, and proteins, from soil. The method is effective, providing good quality biomolecules from a diverse range of soil types, with clay contents varying from 9.5% to 35.1%, which we successfully used for downstream, high-throughput gene sequencing and metaproteomics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the protocol can also be easily implemented for biomolecule co-extraction from other complex microbiome samples, including cattle slurry and microbial communities recovered from anaerobic bioreactors, as well as from Gram-positive and Gram-negative pure cultures.

A versatile Rapture (RAD-Capture) platform for genotyping marine turtles	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						conservation genetics; high-throughput sequencing; RAD-Seq; reptiles; sea turtle; sequence capture	POPULATION GENOMICS; CONSERVATION GENETICS; DNA; MITOCHONDRIAL; EVOLUTIONARY; SEQUENCE; NUCLEAR; PHYLOGENETICS; INTROGRESSION; LIBRARIES	Advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies coupled with increased interdisciplinary collaboration are rapidly expanding capacity in the scope and scale of wildlife genetic studies. While existing HTS methods can be directly applied to address some evolutionary and ecological questions, certain research goals necessitate tailoring methods to specific study organisms, such as high-throughput genotyping of the same loci that are comparable over large spatial and temporal scales. These needs are particularly common for studies of highly mobile species of conservation concern like marine turtles, where life history traits, limited financial resources and other constraints require affordable, adaptable methods for HTS genotyping to meet a variety of study goals. Here, we present a versatile marine turtle HTS targeted enrichment platform adapted from the recently developed Rapture (RAD-Capture) method specifically designed to meet these research needs. Our results demonstrate consistent enrichment of targeted regions throughout the genome and discovery of candidate variants in all species examined for use in various conservation genetics applications. Accurate species identification confirmed the ability of our platform to genotype over 1,000 multiplexed samples and identified areas for future methodological improvement such as optimization for low initial concentration samples. Finally, analyses within green turtles supported the ability of this platform to identify informative SNPs for stock structure, population assignment and other applications over a broad geographic range of interest to management. This platform provides an additional tool for marine turtle genetic studies and broadens capacity for future large-scale initiatives such as collaborative global marine turtle genetic databases.

Moreover, the repetitive nature of large genomes often represents a challenge in bioinformatic and downstream analyses. Here, we use in-depth transcriptome sequencing to design probes for exome capture in Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra), a conifer with an estimated genome size of 29.3 Gbp and no reference genome available. We successfully applied around 55,000 self-designed probes, targeting 25,000 contigs, to DNA pools of seven populations from the Swiss Alps and identified >160,000 SNPs in around 15,000 contigs. The probes performed equally well in pools of the closely related species Pinus sibirica; in both species, more than 70% of the targeted contigs were sequenced at a depth >= 40x (number of haplotypes in the pool). However, a thorough analysis of individually sequenced P. cembra samples indicated that a majority of the contigs (63%) represented multi-copy genes. We therefore removed paralogous contigs based on heterozygote excess and deviation from allele balance. Without putatively paralogous contigs, allele frequencies of population pools represented accurate estimates of individually determined allele frequencies. We show that inferences of neutral and adaptive genetic variation may be biased when not accounting for such multi-copy genes. Without individual genotype data, it would have been nearly impossible to recognize and deal with the problem of multi-copy contigs. We advocate to put more emphasis on identifying paralogous loci, which will be facilitated by the establishment of additional high-quality reference genomes.

Are soft coral habitats unfavourable? A closer look at the association between reef fishes and their habitat	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Soft coral; Coral cover; Reef fishes; Fish assemblage; Habitat associations	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; FEEDING BUTTERFLYFISHES CHAETODONTIDAE; OUTER-SHELF REEFS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; LOBOPHYTUM-COMPACTUM; CHEMICAL DEFENSES; MID-SHELF; OCTOCORALLIA; COMPLEXITY; DIVERSITY	The structural complexity of coral reef environments has a strong influence on the assemblage of reef-associated fishes and invertebrates. These unique ecosystems provide these reef-associated species with a broad range of potential habitats, which offer important resources such as food and shelter. The most studied habitat association on reefs is that of hard coral and fish, where hard coral cover has been found to have a large and positive influence on the assemblage of reef fishes. In contrast, soft coral has been considered poor habitat due to their chemical defences and weak body architecture. However, the empirical basis for this assumption is minimal and the ecological importance of soft corals remains controversial and unresolved. The present study closely examined fish assemblages utilising a mixed mosaic of coral reef habitats at sites ranging from hard to soft coral dominated assemblages. Fishes associated with soft coral in a variety of ways including as shelter, a source of food or a surface on which epiphytic food was sourced. Fish assemblages remained similar between soft and hard coral dominated habitats, and there was no evidence that a high percentage cover of soft coral had deleterious effects. Further, a significant increase in species richness of fishes was found with increasing soft coral cover, suggesting that the importance of soft coral habitat has been underestimated on reefs with a mosaic of different habitats. Here, we discuss the implications of these associations and suggest that soft coral provides distinct habitat for reef fishes, and future research should address their ecological importance.

Genetic diversity and differentiation may be explained by present-day niche centrality, historical processes, or morphological variation across a species' range, yet few studies evaluate these factors concurrently. Moreover, there is a particular lack of knowledge of the influence of these factors in ancient, unglaciated landscapes of the Southern Hemisphere. We investigate these concepts for their influence upon spatial patterns of genetic variation in a widespread plant species in a southern biodiversity hotspot. Location South-western Australia. Taxon Calothamnus quadrifidus. Methods We use genotyping-by-sequencing to assess genome-wide diversity and differentiation across the range of Calothamnus quadrifidus, a morphologically variable species that occurs over a wide geographic range in an ancient, unglaciated landscape. We correlated the patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation with those predicted under four hypotheses regarding effects of geographic centrality, climatic centrality, historical phylogeography and morphological subspecies. Results We found spatial variation in genetic diversity and strong population structuring, and while each hypothesis was consistent with some of these patterns, no hypothesis predicted the full extent of genetic diversity or structure in C. quadrifidus. Main conclusions Our results are indicative of a complex evolutionary history, with multiple factors shaping contemporary genetic variation in C. quadrifidus over time, rather than any one major driving factor. This is enabled by the greater capacity to build complex evolutionary signals in ancient, more stable landscapes like the southwest of Western Australia that are not as predictable as those within the younger, post-glacial landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, our study demonstrates the importance of using an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the spatial patterns of genetic variation across species' ranges and the influence of ecological, geographical and historical factors.

Location Iberian Peninsula. Methods We used molecular data (mtDNA and species-specific, polymorphic microsatellite loci) and species distribution modelling (SDM) from the Last Interglacial (LIG) to the present to characterize spatial patterns of genetic diversity in this species and assess their relationship with climatically favourable areas through time. Results Genetic diversity is heterogeneously distributed across the range of H. molleri, with two main genetic reservoirs located in (a) central and southern Portugal and (b) a fragmented area encompassing mountainous areas in northern Spain. According to SDM, the Iberian Peninsula has experienced a progressive and continuous decrease in climatically favourable areas for H. molleri since the LIG, especially in southern and eastern Iberia, where the species is currently absent. However, we found no correlation between areas that have remained climatically favourable since the LIG and current genetic diversity. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the demographic history of H. molleri since the Pleistocene has been characterized by relative stability, contrasting with the large-scale cycles of extinction-recolonization inferred for other more thermophilous, co-distributed amphibian species in Iberia. Accounting for discordant demographic responses to climatic changes across syntopic species provides new insights about the evolutionary history of amphibian communities in southern Europe.

Plumage coloration follows Gloger's rule in a ring species	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						background coloration; Gloger's rule; parrots; plumage coloration; ring species; visual modelling	EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; SPECIATION; PARROT; LIGHT; PIGMENTATION; HYPOTHESIS; BEHAVIOR; FORESTS; BIRDS	Aim Animal coloration is expected to differ between populations in different habitats according to Gloger's rule, with darker animals found in more humid, vegetated or warmer environments. Yet despite considerable support across the globe, the mechanisms behind this biogeographical rule are currently still unclear. Exploiting a ring species with plumage coloration from crimson to pale yellow, we test Gloger's rule and the mechanisms behind phenotypic divergence. Location South-eastern Australia. Major taxa studied Crimson rosellas (Platycercus elegans). Methods We combined three modelling approaches (spatial regression; random decision forest species distribution and conditional inference tree) to test the association between 10 environmental variables (based on long-term climate data and remotely sensed reflectance of the land) and plumage coloration across the distribution of P. elegans. We also took in-situ measurements of background coloration of dominant vegetation to examine the relationship between (a) background coloration measured locally and remotely, (b) P. elegans coloration and (c) known differences in visual sensitivity of the subspecies using species-specific visual models. Results On both a continental and a local scale, the distribution of yellow-red plumage coloration was strongly predicted by average rainfall, summer temperature and the Earth's reflectance between 620-670 nm. Remotely sensed radiance measures correlated strongly and positively with reflectance of the leaves of the dominant tree species at sites across the P. elegans distribution. Visual modelling indicated that differences in background colour could affect signalling efficacy in dim-light conditions. Main conclusions Our study shows that the highly variable plumage coloration conforms to Gloger's rule, and indicates that background coloration of the vegetation and thermoregulation are likely to be important mechanisms. Our results also show that Gloger's rule can explain variation in pigmentary systems other than melanin, and highlight that selection from environmental variation could be an important force behind the geographic diversity found in ring species.

Polyploidy in creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) shapes the biogeography of specialist herbivores	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Asphondylia; Cecidomyiidae; creosote bush; gall midge; herbivory; Larrea tridentata; North American deserts; polyploidy; species distribution models; species interactions	PLANT WATER-STRESS; HOST-PLANT; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; DIPTERA; CECIDOMYIIDAE; ASPHONDYLIA; CYTOTYPES; ECOLOGY; NORTH; ORIGINS	Aim Whole-genome duplication (polyploidy) can influence the biogeography and ecology of plants that differ in ploidy level (cytotype). Here, we address how two consequences of plant polyploidy (parapatry of cytotypes and altered species interactions) shape the biogeography of herbivorous insects. Location Warm deserts of North America. Taxa Gall midges (Asphondylia auripila group, Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) that attack three parapatric cytotypes of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata, Zygophyllaceae). Methods We surveyed Asphondylia species diversity at 177 sites across a 2300-km extent. After noting a correspondence between the distributions of eight Asphondylia species and L. tridentata cytotypes, we fine-mapped Asphondylia species range limits with transects spanning cytotype contact zones. We then tested whether plant-insect interactions and/or abiotic factors explain this coincidence by (a) comparing attack rates and gall midge communities on alternative cytotypes in a narrow zone of sympatry and (b) using species distribution models (SDMs) to determine if climatically suitable habitat for each midge species extended beyond cytotype contact zones. Results The range limits of 6/17 Asphondylia species (including two novel putative species confirmed with COI sequencing) perfectly coincided with the contact zone of diploid and tetraploid L. tridentata. One midge species was restricted to diploid host plants while five were restricted to tetraploid and hexaploid host plants. Where diploid and tetraploid L. tridentata are sympatric, cytotype-restricted midge species more frequently attacked their typical host and Asphondylia community structure differed markedly between cytotypes. SDMs predicted that distributions of cytotype-restricted midge species were not constrained by climatic conditions near cytotype contact zones. Main conclusions Contact zones between plant cytotypes are dispersal barriers for many Asphondylia species due to plant-insect interactions. The distribution of L. tridentata cytotypes therefore shapes herbivore species ranges and herbivore community structure across North American deserts. Our results demonstrate that polyploidy in plants can affect the biogeography of ecological communities.

Large changes in species distributions have occurred as a result of climate change. The objective of this study was to analyse how the spatial distribution of cod and flounder has changed in the Baltic Sea during the past four decades characterized by large hydrological changes. Location Baltic Sea Taxon Cod (Gadus morhua) and flounder (Platichthys flesus). Methods Catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data for adult and juvenile cod and for adult flounder were modelled using Delta-Generalized additive models including environmental and geographical variables between 1979 and 2016. From the annual CPUE predictions for each species, yearly distribution maps and depth distribution curves were obtained. Mean depth and the depth range were estimated to provide an indication on preferred depth and habitat occupancy. Results Adult and juvenile cod showed a contraction in their distribution in the southern areas of the Baltic Sea. Flounder, instead, showed an expansion in its distribution with an increase in abundance in the northern areas. The depth distributions showed a progressive shift of the mean depth of occurrence towards shallower waters for adult cod and flounder and towards deeper waters for juvenile cod, as well as a contraction of the species depth ranges, evident mainly from the late 1980s. Main conclusions Our study illustrates large changes in the spatial distribution of cod and flounder in the Baltic Sea. The changes in depth distribution occurred from the late 1980s are probably due to a combination of expanded areas of hypoxia in deep waters and an increase in predation risk in shallow waters. The net effect of these changes is an increased spatial overlap between life stages and species, which may amplify cod cannibalism and the interaction strength between cod and flounder.

Here we set out to test for the role of dispersal limitation, species sorting and shared effects in the assembly of pond macrophyte metacommunities across an extensive area within the Iberian Plateau, and to identify which traits, environmental variables and spatial scales are driving local community structure. Location North-western Spain (Iberian Plateau). Taxon Pond macrophytes. Methods We established a novel combination of robust methods capable of identifying the processes and most important landscape scales involved in the assembly of communities. We used metacommunity assembly modelling and multivariate multi-scale codependence analysis (mMCA) to first estimate the relative importance of spatial and environmental effects on community structure, and then to identify significant trait-environment relationships and spatial scales. Results Analyses showed that the greatest effects were seen for the spatial and mixed spatial and niche-based scenarios, particularly among wind-dispersed species. Thus, dispersal limitation interfered with species sorting in determining assemblage structure by hindering species' tracking of local environmental conditions. After accounting for this, the metacommunity assembly model revealed that species' traits were involved in determining abundance structure. mMCA identified the main trait-environment relationships (and spatial scales) as fruit size-nutrient status (similar to 300 km) and growth form-mean pond depth (similar to 250 km). Main conclusions Our study suggests that dispersal limitation acted in concert with species sorting to influence the community assembly processes underlying selection for particular traits in functional niche space. Accordingly, we emphasize the need to go beyond the traditional taxonomic-based analyses of community composition and the predominant thinking of considering spatial and environmental processes as two alternative and mutually exclusive scenarios of community assembly.

Location Dinaric Karst, Western Balkan, Europe. Taxon A clade of subterranean amphipods, genus Niphargus (Crustacea: Amphipoda). Methods Phylogenetic reconstructions; species delimitation; modelling competition using phylogeny and species distributions; reconstruction of historical dispersal. Results The clade comprises six species, which classify into two ecomorphs. Species of the same ecomorph are parapatric or allopatric, whereas species belonging to different ecomorphs overlap their ranges. The phylo-spatial reconstructions suggest that the shift from allopatry to sympatry is associated with relaxation of competitive interactions. Reconstruction of species past dispersal implies that sympatry is of secondary origin.

The best precision of +/- 0.2 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and of +/- 4 ppb for CO2 was obtained with an integration time of about 1 hour for delta C-13 and 2 hours for CO2. The seasonality of CO2 and delta C-13 was studied by fitting background curves for a complete 2-year period. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of the averaged seasonal cycle were 15.5 +/- 0.15 ppm for CO2 and 1.97 +/- 0.53%o for delta C-13, respectively. Based on the HYSPLIT Model, air masses were classified into five clusters, with westerly and northeasterly flows being the most and the least frequent, respectively. In the wintertime, northwest and northeast clusters had a higher median level for Delta CO2 and a lower median level for AEPC (the difference between observed and background concentrations), likely caused by anthropogenic emissions. In the summertime, air masses from the northwest had the lowest Delta CO2 and the highest Delta delta C-13. Potential source contribution functions (PSCFs) were used to identify the potential source and sink areas. In winter, source areas for high CO2 mixing ratios (> 75th percentile) were mainly located in northwestern Europe. In summer, areas with high delta C-13 ratios (> 75th percentile), indicating a carbon sink, were observed in the air from Eastern and Central Poland.

We present a large-scale, well-replicated study of floral resources and pollinators in 360 sites incorporating all major land uses in four British cities. Using a systems approach, we developed Bayesian network models integrating pollinator dispersal and resource switching to estimate city-scale effects of management interventions on plant-pollinator community robustness to species loss. We show that residential gardens and allotments (community gardens) are pollinator 'hotspots': gardens due to their extensive area, and allotments due to their high pollinator diversity and leverage on city-scale plant-pollinator community robustness.

We investigated global patterns in amphibian skin bacterial communities, incorporating samples from 2,349 individuals representing 205 amphibian species across a broad biogeographic range. We analysed how biotic and abiotic factors correlate with skin microbial communities using multiple statistical approaches. Global amphibian skin bacterial richness was consistently correlated with temperature-associated factors. We found more diverse skin microbiomes in environments with colder winters and less stable thermal conditions compared with environments with warm winters and less annual temperature variation. We used bioinformatically predicted bacterial growth rates, dormancy genes and antibiotic synthesis genes, as well as inferred bacterial thermal growth optima to propose mechanistic hypotheses that may explain the observed patterns. We conclude that temporal and spatial characteristics of the host's macro-environment mediate microbial diversity.

Leaf nutrients, not specific leaf area, are consistent indicators of elevated nutrient inputs	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							PLANT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; LAND-USE; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES; GENERALITY; GRASSLANDS; HERBIVORES; RESPONSES; NITROGEN; ECOLOGY	Leaf traits are frequently measured in ecology to provide a 'common currency' for predicting how anthropogenic pressures impact ecosystem function. Here, we test whether leaf traits consistently respond to experimental treatments across 27 globally distributed grassland sites across 4 continents. We find that specific leaf area (leaf area per unit mass)-a commonly measured morphological trait inferring shifts between plant growth strategies-did not respond to up to four years of soil nutrient additions. Leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations increased in response to the addition of each respective soil nutrient. We found few significant changes in leaf traits when vertebrate herbivores were excluded in the short-term. Leaf nitrogen and potassium concentrations were positively correlated with species turnover, suggesting that interspecific trait variation was a significant predictor of leaf nitrogen and potassium, but not of leaf phosphorus concentration. Climatic conditions and pretreatment soil nutrient levels also accounted for significant amounts of variation in the leaf traits measured. Overall, we find that leaf morphological traits, such as specific leaf area, are not appropriate indicators of plant response to anthropogenic perturbations in grasslands.

These changes directly affect the global carbon cycle by altering the transport of organic material from the surface ocean to depth, with consequences that remain poorly understood. We investigated how distributional and abundance changes of copepods, the dominant group of zooplankton, have affected biogenic carbon cycling. We used trait-based, mechanistic models to estimate the magnitude of carbon transported downward through sinking faecal pellets, daily vertical migration and seasonal hibernation at depth. From such estimates for over 200,000 community observations in the northern North Atlantic we found carbon flux increased along the northwestern boundary of the study area and decreased in the open northern North Atlantic during the past 55 years. These changes in export were primarily associated with changes in copepod biomass, driven by shifting distributions of abundant, large-bodied species. Our findings highlight how recent climate change has affected downward carbon transport by altering copepod community structure and demonstrate how carbon fluxes through plankton communities can be mechanistically implemented in next-generation biogeochemical models with size-structured representations of zooplankton communities.

Mycorrhizal fungi influence global plant biogeography	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; SPECIATION; COMMUNITY; TRAITS	Island biogeography has traditionally focused primarily on abiotic drivers of colonization, extinction and speciation. However, establishment on islands could also be limited by biotic drivers, such as the absence of symbionts. Most plants, for example, form symbioses with mycorrhizal fungi, whose limited dispersal to islands could act as a colonization filter for plants. We tested this hypothesis using global-scale analyses of similar to 1.4 million plant occurrences, including similar to 200,000 plant species across similar to 1,100 regions. We find evidence for a mycorrhizal filter (that is, the filtering out of mycorrhizal plants on islands), with mycorrhizal associations less common among native island plants than native mainland plants. Furthermore, the proportion of native mycorrhizal plants in island floras decreased with isolation, possibly as a consequence of a decline in symbiont establishment. We also show that mycorrhizal plants contribute disproportionately to the classic latitudinal gradient of plant species diversity, with the proportion of mycorrhizal plants being highest near the equator and decreasing towards the poles. Anthropogenic pressure and land use alter these plant biogeographical patterns. Naturalized floras show a greater proportion of mycorrhizal plant species on islands than in mainland regions, as expected from the anthropogenic co-introduction of plants with their symbionts to islands and anthropogenic disturbance of symbionts in mainland regions. We identify the mycorrhizal association as an overlooked driver of global plant biogeographical patterns with implications for contemporary island biogeography and our understanding of plant invasions.

Epigenetic gene silencing alters the mechanisms and rate of evolutionary adaptation	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE TELOMERES; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MUTATION-RATES; INHERITANCE; CHROMATIN; DISTANCE; SUBTELOMERES; EXPRESSION; HSP90; SIR2	Epigenetic, non-DNA sequence-based inheritance can potentially contribute to adaptation but, due to its transient nature and the difficulty involved in uncoupling it from genetic variation, it is unclear whether it has any effect on long-term evolution. However, short-term epigenetic inheritance may interact with genetic change by modifying the rate and type of adaptive mutations. Here, we test this notion in an experimental evolution set-up in yeast. We tune low, intermediate and high levels of heritable silencing of a URA3 reporter under selection by insertion at different positions within silent subtelomeric chromatin in otherwise isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Heritable silencing does not impact mutation rate but drives population size expansion and rapid epigenetic adaptation. This eventually leads to genetic assimilation of the silent phenotype by mutations that reduce or abolish URA3 expression. Moreover, at intermediate or low levels of heritable silencing we find that populations evolve more rapidly by accumulation of adaptive mutations, in part through acquisition of novel alleles that enhance gene silencing, aiding accelerated adaptation. We provide an experimental proof of concept that defines the impact and mechanisms of how short-term epigenetic inheritance can shape adaptive evolution.

The response of wild bees to tree cover and rural land use is mediated by species' traits	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Pollinators; Functional diversity; Agriculture; Linear networks; Roads; Riparian	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY INDEXES; MASS-FLOWERING CROPS; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; POLLINATION SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; FORAGING RANGES; NATIVE BEES; HABITAT; ABUNDANCE	Worldwide, bees have an important role in ecosystem function and the provision of ecosystem services through their role as pollinators. The diversity of bee species in rural landscapes is influenced by the type of landscape features present, and by land-use and management practices. A key challenge is to understand and predict how species vary across the landscape; and the role of functional traits in determining compositional patterns. We systematically sampled wild bees in four types of landscape feature - open farmland, scattered farmland trees, roadside vegetation and streamside vegetation - in rural landscapes in southern Australia. Landscapes were selected to represent wooded or non-wooded combinations of these site types (e.g. roadside vegetation with or without trees), embedded in farmland with different land-uses (e.g. cropping, grazing). The species richness and abundance of bees was greater at sites containing little or no tree cover; and the cumulative richness of species was greater for tree-less sites than for those with trees. In contrast, species evenness was greatest in wooded site types, indicating these were less dominated by abundant generalist species. Open farmland and treeless road-sides had greater functional diversity (based on species traits) than wooded site types. Strong species trait associations were more numerous with open parts of the landscape, reflecting the greater functional diversity of open site types. These results suggest that a suite of the extant bee fauna can exploit large-scale transformation from former extensively wooded ecosystems to open agricultural landscapes. However, not all species are able to exploit modified landscapes and may disappear with further loss of wooded vegetation. Trait-based approaches provide insight into how changes in landscape pattern affect the bee fauna. Failure to adequately cater for multiple functional groups of bees across all landscape features could mean a substantial loss in species that rely on more natural cover, thus affecting ecosystem function.

Exploring relationships between land use intensity, habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity to identify and monitor areas of High Nature Value farming	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Farmland biodiversity; Habitat diversity; Hedgerows; Landscape elements; Low intensity farming; Remote sensing	LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY; COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY; SPECIES RICHNESS; FARMLAND; DIVERSITY; MANAGEMENT; BIRDS; CONSERVATION; INDICATORS; ABUNDANCE	Understanding how species richness is distributed across landscapes and which variables may be used as predictors is important for spatially targeting management interventions. This study uses finely resolved data over a large geographical area to explore relationships between land-use intensity, habitat heterogeneity and species richness of multiple taxa. It aims to identify surrogate landscape metrics, valid for a range of taxa, which can be used to map and monitor High Nature Value farmland (HNV). Results show that variation in species richness is distributed along two axes: land-use intensity and habitat heterogeneity. At low intensity land-use, species rich groups include wetland plants, plant habitat indicators, upland birds and rare invertebrates, whilst richness of other species groups (farmland birds, butterflies, bees) was associated with higher land-use intensity. Habitat heterogeneity (broadleaved woodland connectivity, hedgerows, habitat diversity) was positively related to species richness of many taxa, both generalists (plants, butterflies, bees) and specialists (rare birds, woodland birds, plants, butterflies). The results were used to create maps of HNV farmland. The proportion of semi-natural vegetation is a useful metric for identifying HNV type 1. HNV type 2 (defined as a mosaic of low-intensity habitats and structural elements) is more difficult to predict from surrogate variables, due to complex relationships between biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity and inadequacies of current remotely sensed data. This approach, using fine-scaled field survey data collected at regular intervals, in conjunction with remotely sensed data offers potential for extrapolating modelled results nationally, and importantly, can be used to assess change over time.

With the aim of stopping and even reversing this decline, agrienvironment schemes (AES) have been implemented in many European countries since the 1990s. In Switzerland, farmers are required to manage at least 7% of their land in the form of biodiversity promotion areas (BPA), which are extensively managed, wildlife-friendly farmland habitats such as hay meadows and traditional orchards. We investigated how the occurrence and characteristics of these BPA influence birds and butterflies in the Swiss lowlands. Butterfly species richness and abundance increased by 22% and 60%, respectively, when the proportion of BPA in the landscape increased from 5% to 15%. Likewise, bird species richness increased, but to a lesser extent, with the proportion of BPA in the landscape. For birds, the proportion of BPA characterized by a high ecological quality played a role in promoting both priority-farmland and red-listed species. For both taxonomic groups, the amount and quality of BPA habitats contributed more to species richness than their spatial configuration, connectivity included. This study shows that AES measures implemented at the field scale have positive effects on mobile species that are noticeable at the landscape scale, and that the fraction of AES in the cultivated landscape matters more than their spatial configuration, which has strong implications for designing multi-functional agro-ecosystems.

Converting arable land into flowering fields changes functional and phylogenetic community structure in ground beetles	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Agri-environmental scheme; Biodiversity; Carabid diversity; Functional diversity; Phylogenetic diversity; Trait evolution	AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; COLEOPTERA CARABIDAE; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; TRAITS; PLANT; WHEAT; INTENSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES	Agri-environmental schemes aim to promote biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. However, knowledge about the impact of these measures on diversity components beyond species richness, especially for non-target species and their ecological functions, is still very poor. Here, we investigated the response of ground beetle communities to the conversion of arable land into flowering fields, which are primarily installed to counteract pollinator loss in agricultural landscapes. We are focusing on the relationship between biodiversity components and the evolutionary relationship among functional groups. Land-use conversion from arable land to flowering fields has changed the phylogenetic community composition of ground beetles towards a phylogenetically clustered community. This is due to an increase in closely related medium-sized herbivorous species and a decrease in evolutionarily distinct small carnivorous species. Phylogenetic clustering did not result in a reduction of functional richness, but it increased the number of unique trait combinations of species within the local communities. This suggests a low ecological redundancy among herbivorous species. Because species richness, functional richness and phylogenetic diversity were unaffected by conversion, phylogenetic community structuring was predominantly driven by species turnover rather than by numerical changes. Flowering fields can act as refuges for herbivorous carabids that potentially affect the surrounding agricultural landscape by providing important ecosystem services such as weed control. To understand the impact of habitat transformation on carabid biodiversity, it was more informative to relate response traits to phylogenic and functional diversity than to use single diversity measures such as species richness. This conclusion might also apply to many other taxa.

People living in urban areas are rapidly increasing worldwide and consequently the temporal pattern of occupation of natural areas for recreation is changing as well, resulting in an ever-increasing concentration of people during weekends and holidays. This is particularly evident in affluent societies, where more recreationists visit natural areas on holidays and weekends, causing disturbance to wildlife in the so-called "weekend effect". Here, we tested the response to disturbance of 30 Bonelli's eagles tracked by high-frequency GPS/GSM telemetry. We analysed daily home-range size, a measure of changing behaviour that integrates their vital requirements, throughout the annual cycle, considering three different levels (95%, 75% and 50% kernel density estimators). Our results showed that eagles made a higher ranging effort on weekends and holidays throughout the annual cycle. This was particularly evident during the non-breeding period, when larger home-ranges were observed. Higher ranging effort can lead to conservation problems such as extra energy expenditure, hunting interference, and eventually nest and/or territory abandonment, decreasing eagles' fitness. Measures aimed at reducing human wildlife conflicts including spatio-temporal limitation of leisure activities particularly during the most critical periods (i.e., incubation, chick rearing) are urgently needed. Finally, where possible, high quality information of animal movement should be incorporated into conservation plans in order to delineate efficient spatially-explicit management measures.

Owing to the high legal protection of bats, surveys are frequently required as part of ecological assessments. Yet there is uncertainty about the amount of survey effort that should be deployed to facilitate bat protection. Bat activity can be extremely variable, and capturing periods of high activity can be as important as estimating parameters such as the median activity level. However the frequency and intensity of surveys required to capture the required information is unknown. Here we assessed the probability that acoustic surveys of differing durations would detect periods of high activity within a focal site and the importance of a site relative to others in a regional or national context. We randomly subsampled from 660 nights of activity data collected from 33 wind farm sites across Britain. The minimum surveying effort required to classify bat activity accurately varied between species and was dependent on weather conditions. We found that the survey periods required to give reasonable certainty in assessing risk exceeded those currently recommended in Europe. The approach of using bat activity accumulation curves, as described here, is transferrable to other situations where determining surveying effort and risk is necessary to ensure that ecological assessments provide a robust evidence base, whilst minimising the time and expense of surveys.

While ecosystem approaches to management offer a potential means to balance those risks, they require a method of assessment that is commensurate across multiple objectives. A major challenge is conducting these assessments in a way that considers the priorities and knowledge of stakeholders. In this study, we co-developed an ecological risk assessment (ERA) for fisheries in California (USA) with scientists, managers, and stakeholders. This ERA was intended to meet the requirements of existing policy mandates in the state of California and provide a systematic, efficient, and transparent approach to prioritize fisheries for additional management actions, including the development of fisheries management plans fully compliant with California laws. We assessed the relative risk posed to target species, bycatch, and habitats from nine state-managed fisheries and found risk to target species was not necessarily similar to risks to bycatch and habitat groups. In addition, no single fishery consistently presented the greatest risk for all bycatch or habitat groups. However, considered in combination, the greatest risk for target species, bycatch groups, and habitats emerged from two commercial fisheries for California halibut. The participatory process used to generate these results offers the potential to increase stakeholders' trust in the assessment and therefore its application in management. We suggest that adopting similar processes in other management contexts and jurisdictions will advance progress toward ecosystem-based fisheries management that simultaneously satisfies fisheries, conservation, and relationship building objectives.

Culling must improve ecosystem function, so clear, measurable goals, such as improved breeding potential of target species, are necessary. Many overabundant and invasive species are also nest predators and nest predation is the principal cause of breeding failure of many birds of conservation concern. It is important for managers to know the likely effects on nest predation when culling one species among a suite of nest predatory species. We tested the effect of culling a hyperaggressive, overabundant bird and known nesting disruptor, the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephcda), on artificial nest predation rates in remnant eucalypt woodlands in a highly fragmented agricultural landscape of eastern Australia. Culling of noisy miners is already practised to manage this key threatening process, but evidence of improved breeding outcomes for target species is lacking. We found no significant change in artificial nest predation rates following the treatment, despite a 28% reduction in noisy miner abundance in treatment compared to control sites. We identified five other nest predatory bird species, the noisy miner being responsible for 18.3% of total predation. Our findings suggest a compensatory nest predation model, which is problematic for management. It means that, where culling is done with a view to improving breeding potential of target species by reducing nest predation, removing one nest predatory species may not result in a commensurate reduction in nest predation.

Explaining harvests of wild-harvested herbaceous plants: American ginseng as a case study	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						American ginseng; Forest herbaceous plant; Geoadditive model; Open access resource; Social-ecological; Plant conservation; Species distribution model; Time-series	TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; PANAX-QUINQUEFOLIUS; POPULATION VIABILITY; CONSERVATION; COLLECTION; L.; LIVELIHOOD; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY; TRADE	Wild-harvested plants face increasing demand globally. As in many fisheries, monitoring the effect of harvesting on the size and trajectory of resource stocks presents many challenges given often limited data from disparate sources. Here we analyze American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) harvests from 18 states in the eastern U.S. 1978-2014 to infer temporal patterns and evidence of population declines, and we test the effects of local environmental and socioeconomic factors on ginseng harvesting at the county level 2000-2014. Despite rising prices, annual wild ginseng harvests decreased from a high point in the late 1980s to early 1990s, then, in most, increased after 2005 or 2010 - suggesting range-wide overexploitation notwithstanding federal regulations that, since 1999, restrict minimum harvest age. County-level harvest rates increased with available habitat, road density, poverty and unemployment, but decreased when public land formed a large proportion of county area. Harvests were largest in the Southern Appalachian region. Poverty and accessibility were strongly related to high levels of harvesting. A key implication is that to conserve valuable wild native plant products while also improving local livelihoods, wild cultivation and good stewardship practices must be strongly promoted. Our approach to assessing the condition of wild populations offers a broad template that could be adapted to other wild-harvested plants.

Spatial risk assessment of eastern monarch butterfly road mortality during autumn migration within the southern corridor	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Danaus plexippus; Migratory threats; MaxEnt roadkill niche models; Insect roadkill hotspots	PLEXIPPUS LEPIDOPTERA; FALL MIGRATION; WILDLIFE; POPULATION; DANAIDAE; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; RESTORATION; LOCATIONS; DYNAMICS	Road mortality may contribute to the population decline of eastern monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.). We estimated autumn monarch roadkill rates within the primary Oklahoma to Mexico southern migration corridor (i.e., Central Funnel). Dead monarchs were surveyed along Texas roadsides during four weeks of autumn migration in 2016 and 2017. Roadkill averaged 3.4 monarchs per 100 m transect, reaching 66 per 100 m in a roadkill hotspot in southwestern Texas. Extrapolations of Central Funnel roadkill based on survey data and road types were 3.6 and 1.1 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Spatial distribution of roadkill across the Central Funnel was projected from Texas survey data using 30 m resolution MaxEnt niche models. Highest roadkill probability was linked to arid climate and low human population density. The latter variables may not be directly related to roadkill, but instead represent indirect correlates of increased densities of monarchs where the migration corridor narrows southwards. The higher roadkill projected in southwest Texas and Mexico by MaxEnt models agrees with previously reported monarch roadkill hotspots. MaxEnt-based 2016-2017 projections for annual roadkill rates throughout the Central Funnel averaged 2.1 million. This figure is similar to the result by simple extrapolation, and represents about 3% of the overwintering monarch population for these years. Mitigation at roadkill hotspots in the Central Funnel could reduce monarch roadkill mortality during migration and contribute towards conservation efforts for the monarch butterfly.

Two species, one snare: Analysing snare usage and the impacts of tiger poaching on a non-target species, the Malayan tapir	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Illegal wildlife trade; Panthera tigris; Tapirus indicus; Poaching; Snare trap	PATTERNS	The illegal trade in tiger bones and body parts is crippling the remaining populations of tigers worldwide, but what effect does this trade have on other wildlife that get caught in the cross fire? The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) is the only species of tapir found outside of South America, yet little is known of this subspecies despite its large size. Aside from habitat loss and an encroaching human population, effects of wildlife trade are taking their toll on this endangered species. In Sumatra Indonesia, tigers and tapirs are known to share habitat, potentially leaving tapirs vulnerable to fall victim to snare entrapment. This study looks at correlations between tiger and tapir indices as well as active tiger snares within Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia over a four-year period. Data was provided by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry and Fauna and Flora International, and this study investigated the frequency, and spatial relationships between all three variables. Across the study period, tiger snares increased significantly in numbers and spatial extent, indicating increased illegal poaching in KSNP. Areas with high frequencies of tiger evidence also showed high frequencies of tapir evidence, but while tiger frequency remained consistent, tapirs displayed a decreasing trend. Spatially, tiger evidence moved further away from snare and tapir locations over time, indicating tigers, (while being the target species) may display a greater response to poaching threats than tapirs. Tapir mortality was significantly correlated with the number of snares per kilometre surveyed, further supporting a negative impact from snares on tapirs. This study recommends long-term analysis to accurately determine the current population of Malayan tapirs in Sumatra and identify population trends. Identifying Sumatra's tapir population and recovery in response to poaching and habitat loss threats, must be determined to accurately inform conservation management actions of Sumatra's National Parks, and halt the decline of this illusive species.

Previous research has shown this practice modifies the soil conditions and ground flora community of these release pens. However, it is not currently known if and how these changes to soil and ground flora reverse once the pens are no longer used. We compared the soil chemistry, ground flora structure and community composition of disused release pen sites in ancient semi-natural woodlands with paired control sites. Some of the changes seen within release pens in active use persisted in disused pens; soil fertility and cover of species that prefer fertile soils were higher in disused pens, whereas winter green perennials, richness of species of ancient semi-natural woodland and overall species richness were lower. Total species richness and richness of ancient semi-natural woodland plants showed signs of recovery in pens that had been disused for longer than ten years, but this recovery only occurred in pens where <= 1000 pheasants/ha had been released. Pheasant release pens are sometimes relocated within woodland to reduce disease incidence but, as the flora within disused pens does not recover quickly, this practice may cause cumulative habitat damage. We recommend that release pen relocation should be minimised and suggest other management strategies that could reduce the need to relocate pens and increase the floral recovery in disused pens, such as reducing the density of pheasants released.

Here, we document a case of rapid divergence (over the past 100 generations, or similar to 150 years) in foraging traits and feeding efficiency between a lake and stream population pair of threespine stickleback. Building on predictions from functional trait models of fish feeding, we analyzed foraging experiments with a Bayesian path analysis and elucidated the traits explaining variation in foraging performance and the species composition of ingested prey. Despite extensive previous research on the divergence of foraging traits among populations and ecotypes of stickleback, our results provide novel experimental evidence of trait utility for jaw protrusion, gill raker length, and gill raker spacing when foraging on a natural zooplankton assemblage. Furthermore, we discuss how these traits might contribute to the differential effects of lake and stream stickleback on their prey communities, observed in both laboratory and mesocosm conditions. More generally, our results illustrate how the rapid divergence of functional foraging traits of consumers can impact the biomass, species composition, and trophic structure of prey communities.

Conspicuous Plumage Does Not Increase Predation Risk: A Continent-Wide Test Using Model Songbirds	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						color; plumage; predation risk; sexual dichromatism; Malurus; habitat; contrast	SEXUAL SELECTION; LIFE-HISTORY; FAIRY-WRENS; COLOR; FEMALE; BIRDS; EVOLUTION; DIMORPHISM; MORTALITY; MALES	The forces shaping female plumage color have long been debated but remain unresolved. Females may benefit from conspicuous colors but are also expected to suffer costs. Predation is one potential cost, but few studies have explicitly investigated the relationship between predation risk and coloration. The fairy-wrens show pronounced variation in female coloration and reside in a wide variety of habitats across Australasia. Species with more conspicuous females are found in denser habitats, suggesting that conspicuousness in open habitat increases vulnerability to predators. To test this, we measured attack rates on 3-D-printed models mimicking conspicuously colored males and females and dull females in eight different fairy-wren habitats across Australia. Attack rates were higher in open habitats and at higher latitudes. Contrary to our predictions, dull female models were attacked at similar rates to the conspicuous models. Further, the probability of attack in open habitats increased more for both types of female models than for the conspicuous male model. Across models, the degree of contrast (chromatic and achromatic) to environmental backgrounds was unrelated to predation rate. These findings do not support the long-standing hypothesis that conspicuous plumage, in isolation, is costly due to increased attraction of predators. Our results indicate that conspicuousness interacts with other factors in driving the evolution of plumage coloration.

At the same time, extreme environmental events can cause catastrophic collapse in otherwise healthy populations. Understanding what natural processes and management strategies may allow for persistence and recovery of natural populations is critical in the face of expected climate change scenarios of increased environmental variability. Using a spatially explicit continuous-size fishery model with stochastic dispersal parameterized for abalone-a harvested species with sedentary adults and a dispersing larval phase-we investigated whether the establishment of a system of marine protected areas (MPAs) can prevent population collapse, compared with nonspatial management when populations are affected by mass mortality from environmental shocks and subject to Allee effects. We found that MPA networks dramatically reduced the risk of collapse following catastrophic events (75%-90% mortality), while populations often continued to decline in the absence of spatial protection. Similar resilience could be achieved by closing the fishery immediately following mass mortalities but would necessitate long periods without catch and therefore economic income. For species with Allee effects, the use of protected areas can ensure persistence following mass mortality events while maintaining ecosystem services during the recovery period.

Black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans) fledge more goslings, on average, when their broods are experimentally enlarged to be greater than the most common clutch size of four eggs. Thus, we hypothesized that the lesser frequency of brant clutches exceeding four eggs results, at least partially, from a future reduction in survival, breeding probability, or clutch size for females tending larger broods. We used an 8-year mark-recapture data set (Barker robust design) with 5 years of clutch and brood manipulations to estimate long-term consequences of reproductive decisions in brant. We did not find evidence of a trade-off between reproductive effort and true survival or future initiation date and clutch size. Rather, future breeding probability was maximized (0.92 +/- 0.03 [SE]) for manipulated females tending broods of four goslings and was lower for females tending smaller (one gosling; 0.63 +/- 0.09 [SE]) or larger (seven goslings; 0.52 +/- 0.15 [SE]) broods. Our results suggest that demographic trade-offs for female brant tending large broods may reduce the fitness value of clutches larger than four and, therefore, contribute to the paucity of larger clutches. The lack of a trade-off between reproductive effort and survival provides evidence that survival, to which fitness is most sensitive in long-lived animals, is buffered against temporal variation in brant.

Personality types including boldness and aggression have been recently reported as important determinants of collective task performance, task specialisation and task proficiency in social spiders. These studies were performed in subadult and adult spiders and over the short term (3-15days). Therefore, the ontogeny of these personality types and its persistence over timescales relevant to the lifespan of any social spider species remains unknown. In the social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum, we investigated 1) if early instar juveniles exhibited consistent and repeatable personality types, 2) if personality types persisted over the long term in subadults and 3) if personality types are influenced by subadult body condition. Juveniles (3rd and 4th instars) showed consistent inter-individual differences and repeatability in boldness and aggression (across 21days). Subadults showed consistency in boldness and aggression over a duration of 51days, which covers a significant part of the subadult stage. However, repeatability of these traits declined over the long term. Moreover, boldness and aggression were not influenced by body condition (nutritional state) of subadults. Thus, we hypothesise that the early ontogeny of personality and its long-term persistence can influence behavioural propensities and task partitioning through later life stages in social spider colonies.Significance statementPersonalities have been demonstrated in a number of animal species. In animal societies, individuals with different personality types are known to engage in different activities within the group, leading to overall efficiency. Personalities have recently been shown to exist in social spiders. For example, aggressive spiders have a greater tendency to hunt prey than less aggressive individuals. However, for most animals, it remains unknown whether personality types manifest in very young individuals. Here, we show for the first time in social spiders that juveniles have personalities just as in adults. We also show that personality types persist over significant portions of individuals' life spans. These findings show that stable personality types can be important in collective tasks such as capturing prey.

Initially, focus was on the arid Karoo, but interest now includes KwaZulu-Natal, a populous, agricultural province with high cultural, ecological, and economic diversity. We conducted focus groups and an online survey to determine how some South Africans perceive fracking. Focus group participants were unanimous in their opposition, primarily citing concerns over water quality and rural way-of-life. The survey confirmed broad consistency with focus group responses. When asked which provinces might be affected by fracking, KwaZulu-Natal ranked behind provinces in the Karoo, suggesting an awareness bias towards Karoo projects. Frequently-identified concerns regarding Agriculture and Natural Resources were Reduced quality of water, Negative impacts to ecosystems and natural biodiversity, Reduced quantity of water, and Pollution hazards. Frequent concerns regarding Social, Cultural, and Local Community issues were Impacts to human health, Visual/aesthetic degradation of tourism areas, Degradation of local infrastructure, and Physical degradation of tourism sites. Most survey respondents were pessimistic about potential benefits of fracking to South Africa's domestic energy supply, and did not agree fracking would reduce negative impacts of coal mining or create jobs. Survey respondents were pessimistic about government's preparedness for fracking and agreed fracking created opportunity for corruption. Many respondents agreed they would consider fracking when voting, and identified needs for more research on fracking in South Africa, which focused heavily on environmental impacts, especially water, in addition to the welfare of local citizens and their communities.

Pollen data were recorded in Moscow, Russia, during 1994-2016 (except 1997 and 1998). Pollen data were collected by volumetric spore trap. Correlation analysis was used to study relationships between various parameters of pollen seasons. Simple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate trends over time; multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to describe fluctuations in the start date and in seasonal pollen integral (SPIn) as a function of monthly and cumulative climatic parameters. The forecasting model for the start date predicts 72% variability. The mean temperature in April and May and mean humidity in May are the main variables for forecasting the start of the Poaceae pollen season. The SPIn cannot be predicted with pre-seasonal temperature, humidity or rainfall.

The species is facing a regeneration failure in a large part of its natural distribution, likely due to interplay of climate change and browsing by herbivores. Forest management approaches that support inter-specific complementarity can help the species mitigate these negative effects. However, a lack of long-term records has prevented an adequate answer to the facilitation hypothesis. Therefore, we compiled unique data from eleven long-term plots established on three sites in the western Carpathian Mountains in 1972, 1989 and 1995. During the past 30-50years, forest stands were treated by various management alternatives, and the development of stands and regeneration were monitored in 5-12-year intervals. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an increase in tree species diversity positively correlates with abundance of yew regeneration. Additionally, we compared the relationships between management and no-management alternatives. Our results revealed the positive correlation of tree species diversity and the quantity of yew regeneration. Moreover, an increase in the proportion of maple seedling at the expense of beech supported the establishment of yew seedlings at increased abundance. However, recently (since 1982) the growth of yew saplings did not exceed 20cm in height, mostly because of heavy damage caused by deer browsing. We conclude that forest managers and conservationists can support the regeneration of yew using the treatments that increase tree species diversity.

However, methods for data collection and analysis of population estimates from wildlife surveys vary, often preventing comparisons between sites or years. In this study we compared population density estimates of spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi, derived from four commonly used methods to the actual density estimate based on known individual monkeys and home-range size and corroborated these results with surveys done on unhabituated monkeys in the same area. We recorded perpendicular distances of individual monkeys in the Otoch Ma'ax yetel Kooh Protected Area during two surveys: within the home range of an individually-recognized spider monkey group (survey one) and largely outside of the home range (survey two). We sighted 278 and 76 spider monkeys for a total effort of 93.74 and 42.78km in surveys one and two, respectively. The actual density estimate was 65.4individuals/km(2) (survey one). This value lies closer to the population density estimate obtained using the Kelker method (58.2individuals/km(2)) than conventional distance sampling (CDS; 92.9-93.8individuals/km(2)). Density estimates obtained with King and maximum perpendicular distance methods deviated substantially from the actual density. Population density estimates using the Kelker method and CDS differed less in survey two. Population density estimates differed little whether transects were walked slow or fast. We recommend using the Kelker method and CDS to estimate population density with a correction for distance estimation errors. We demonstrate how studies on populations of known size can improve the methods to survey populations of unknown size.

First, we compared trends in IUCN Red List criteria used in threatened plant species listings in Australia and globally. Second, using the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, as a study region, we conducted two complementary analyses: (1) An assessment of similar to 5000 currently unlisted NSW plant species against the thresholds for the geographic range criterion (Criterion B) to identify species which may require full assessment; and (2) A rapid assessment of currently listed threatened plant species, applying the IUCN Red List Critically Endangered thresholds for all criteria, to identify species likely to be at the highest risk of extinction from further decline. Impacts on these species could be considered to be serious and irreversible impacts (SAII). Geographic range size was the most common criterion used in Australia and globally for plant listings. Our assessment of unlisted NSW plant species revealed 92 species (75 endemic to NSW) met the geographic range thresholds for Critically Endangered. Our rapid assessments of currently listed NSW threatened plant species identified 53.5% as having an extremely high risk of extinction should further decline occur. Of these, most were flagged under Criterion B (88.8%). Geographic range and the other IUCN Red List criteria thresholds for Critically Endangered provide a useful framework to identify species at an extremely high risk of extinction from ongoing decline.

We monitored vegetation in different burn-age categories at three UK peatland sites over a 19-month period. Half of the plots had Sphagnum fragments added and their survival was assessed. Changes in vegetation composition over time, and associations between vegetation composition, site and burn-age category were investigated. Plots in the most recently burned category were likely to have more bare peat, a thinner moss layer and lower vascular plant strata. Graminoid cover initially increased after burning but was low after 10+ years. Dwarf shrub cover increased after burning and remained high after 10+ years. At the most Sphagnum-rich site, a high proportion of existing Sphagnum cover was bleached one year after burning, but recovery occurred during the study period. Sphagnum re-introduction success decreased over the study period in the most recent and intermediate burn-age categories at the most Sphagnum-poor site. These results show that burning rotation length is an important factor in determining site-level vegetation composition on burned sites. More frequent burning will result in a greater proportion of land in the early post-burning stages, potentially resulting in a thinner moss layer, more bare peat and less healthy Sphagnum, with potential consequences for carbon balance. No evidence was found to support the use of burning as a tool to increase existing Sphagnum or promote Sphagnum re-establishment success.

Examining forest resilience to changing fire frequency in a fire-prone region of boreal forest	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						alternative stable state; black spruce; climate change; immaturity risk; jack pine; resistance; self-regulation; spatially explicit state-and-transition simulation model	DISTURBANCE REGIMES; ECOLOGICAL MEMORY; TREE RECRUITMENT; CANADA FORESTS; UPLAND FOREST; CANDLE LAKE; CLIMATE; WILDFIRE; DYNAMICS; MIXEDWOOD	Future changes in climate are widely anticipated to increase fire frequency, particularly in boreal forests where extreme warming is expected to occur. Feedbacks between vegetation and fire may modify the direct effects of warming on fire activity and shape ecological responses to changing fire frequency. We investigate these interactions using extensive field data from the Boreal Shield of Saskatchewan, Canada, a region where >40% of the forest has burned in the past 30 years. We use geospatial and field data to assess the resistance and resilience of eight common vegetation states to frequent fire by quantifying the occurrence of short-interval fires and their effect on recovery to a similar vegetation state. These empirical relationships are combined with data from published literature to parameterize a spatially explicit, state-and-transition simulation model of fire and forest succession. We use this model to ask if and how: (a) feedbacks between vegetation and wildfire may modify fire activity on the landscape, and (b) more frequent fire may affect landscape forest composition and age structure. Both field and GIS data suggest the probability of fire is low in the initial decades after fire, supporting the hypothesis that fuel accumulation may exert a negative feedback on fire frequency. Field observations of pre- and postfire composition indicate that switches in forest state are more likely in conifer stands that burn at a young age, supporting the hypothesis that resilience is lower in immature stands. Stands dominated by deciduous trees or jack pine were generally resilient to fire, while mixed conifer and well-drained spruce forests were less resilient. However, simulation modeling suggests increased fire activity may result in large changes in forest age structure and composition, despite the feedbacks between vegetation-fire likely to occur with increased fire activity.

Here, we focus on nitrogen and ask whether plant community nitrogen uptake rate is determined (a) by nitrogen availability alone or (b) by the product of nitrogen availability and fine-root mass. Surprisingly, this is not empirically resolved. We performed controlled microcosm experiments and reanalyzed published pot experiments and field data to determine the relationship between community-level nitrogen uptake rate, nitrogen availability, and fine-root mass for 46 unique combinations of species, nitrogen levels, and growing conditions. We found that plant community nitrogen uptake rate was unaffected by fine-root mass in 63% of cases and saturated with fine-root mass in 29% of cases (92% in total). In contrast, plant community nitrogen uptake rate was clearly affected by nitrogen availability. The results support the idea that although plants may over-proliferate fine roots for individual-level competition, it comes without an increase in community-level nitrogen uptake. The results have implications for the mechanisms included in coupled carbon-nitrogen terrestrial biosphere models (CN-TBMs) and are consistent with CN-TBMs that operate above the individual scale and omit fine-root mass in equations of nitrogen uptake rate but inconsistent with the majority of CN-TBMs, which operate above the individual scale and include fine-root mass in equations of nitrogen uptake rate. For the much smaller number of CN-TBMs that explicitly model individual-based belowground competition for nitrogen, the results suggest that the relative (not absolute) fine-root mass of competing individuals should be included in the equations that determine individual-level nitrogen uptake rates. By providing empirical data to support the assumptions used in CN-TBMs, we put their global climate change predictions on firmer ground.

Because competition may amplify or mute tree climate-growth responses, understanding the role current forest structure plays in tree growth responses to climate is critical in assessing and managing future forest productivity in a warming climate. Using white spruce tree ring and carbon isotope data from a long-term vegetation monitoring program in Denali National Park and Preserve, we investigated the hypotheses that (a) competition and site moisture characteristics mediate white spruce radial growth response to climate and (b) moisture limitation is the mechanism for reduced growth. We further examined the impact of large reproductive events (mast years) on white spruce radial growth and stomatal regulation. We found that competition and site moisture characteristics mediated white spruce climate-growth response. The negative radial growth response to warm and dry early- to mid-summer and dry late summer conditions intensified in high competition stands and in areas receiving high potential solar radiation. Discrimination against C-13 was reduced in warm, dry summers and further diminished on south-facing hillslopes and in high competition stands, but was unaffected by climate in open floodplain stands, supporting the hypothesis that competition for moisture limits growth. Finally, during mast years, we found a shift in current year's carbon resources from radial growth to reproduction, reduced C-13 discrimination, and increased intrinsic water-use efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of temporally variable and confounded factors, such as forest structure and climate, on the observed climate-growth response of white spruce. Thus, white spruce growth trends and productivity in a warming climate will likely depend on landscape position and current forest structure.

This is particularly true in high-latitude environments, where current growing seasons are short, and expected temperature increases large. In such short-growing season environments, the timing of growth and reproduction is critical to survival. Here, we use the unique setting provided by a natural geothermal soil warming gradient (Hengill geothermal area, Iceland) to study the response of Cerastium fontanum flowering phenology to temperature. We hypothesized that trait expression and phenotypic selection on flowering phenology are related to soil temperature, and tested the hypothesis that temperature-driven differences in selection on phenology have resulted in genetic differentiation using a common garden experiment. In the field, phenology was related to soil temperature, with plants in warmer microsites flowering earlier than plants at colder microsites. In the common garden, plants responded to spring warming in a counter-gradient fashion; plants originating from warmer microsites flowered relatively later than those originating from colder microsites. A likely explanation for this pattern is that plants from colder microsites have been selected to compensate for the shorter growing season by starting development at lower temperatures. However, in our study we did not find evidence of variation in phenotypic selection on phenology in relation to temperature, but selection consistently favoured early flowering. Our results show that soil temperature influences trait expression and suggest the existence of genetically based variation in flowering phenology leading to counter-gradient local adaptation along a gradient of soil temperatures. An important implication of our results is that observed phenotypic responses of phenology to global warming might often be a combination of short-term plastic responses and long-term evolutionary responses, acting in different directions.

However, demographic mechanisms underlying these changes remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed variation and trends in climate (annual snowfall and spring temperature anomalies) and avian demographic variables from mist-netting data (breeding phenology and productivity) at six sites along an elevation gradient spanning the montane zone of Yosemite National Park between 1993 and 2017. We implemented multi-species hierarchical models to relate demographic responses to elevation and climate covariates. Annual variation in climate and avian demographic variables was high. Snowfall declined (10 mm/year at the highest site, 2 mm at the lowest site), while spring temperature increased (0.045 degrees C/year) over the study period. Breeding phenology (mean first capture date of juvenile birds) advanced by 0.2 day/year (5 days); and productivity (probability of capturing a juvenile bird) increased by 0.8%/year. Breeding phenology was 12 days earlier at the lowest compared to highest site, 18 days earlier in years with lowest compared to highest snowfall anomalies, and 6 d earlier in relatively warm springs (after controlling for snowfall effects). Productivity was positively related to elevation. However, elevation-productivity responses varied among species; species with higher productivity at higher compared to lower elevations tended to be species with documented range retractions during the past century. Productivity tended to be negatively related to snowfall and was positively related to spring temperature. Overall, our results suggest that birds have tracked the variable climatic conditions in this system and have benefited from a trend toward warmer, drier springs. However, we caution that continued warming and multi-year drought or extreme weather years may alter these relationships in the future. Multi-species demographic modeling, such as implemented here, can provide an important tool for guiding conservation of species assemblages under global change.

Using one million records of leaf phenology from four dominant temperate species in Europe, we investigated the temperature sensitivities of spring leaf unfolding and autumn leaf senescence (S-T, advanced or delayed days per degree Celsius). The S-T of spring phenology in all of the four examined species showed an increase and decrease during 1951-1980 and 1981-2013, respectively. The decrease in the S-T during 1981-2013 appears to be caused by reduced accumulation of chilling units. As with spring phenology, the S-T of leaf senescence of early successional and exotic species started to decline since 1980. In contrast, for late successional species, the S-T of autumn senescence showed an increase for the entire study period from 1951 to 2013. Moreover, the impacts of rising temperature associated with global warming on spring leaf unfolding were stronger than those on autumn leaf senescence. The timing of leaf senescence was positively correlated with the timing of leaf unfolding during 1951-1980. However, as climate warming continued, the differences in the responses between spring and autumn phenology gradually increased, so that the correlation was no more significant during 1981-2013. Our results further suggest that since 2000, due to the decreased temperature sensitivity of leaf unfolding the length of the growing season has not increased any more. These finding needs to be addressed in vegetation models used for assessing the effects of climate change.

During the second year of back-to-back bleaching events in the Florida Keys in 2014 and 2015, we characterized key environmental and biological factors associated with bleaching resilience in the threatened reef-building coral Orbicella faveolata. Ten reefs (five inshore, five offshore, 179 corals total) were sampled during bleaching (September 2015) and recovery (May 2016). Corals were genotyped with 2bRAD and profiled for algal symbiont abundance and type. O. faveolata at the inshore sites, despite higher temperatures, demonstrated significantly higher bleaching resistance and better recovery compared to offshore. The thermotolerant Durusdinium trenchii (formerly Symbiondinium trenchii) was the dominant endosymbiont type region-wide during initial (78.0% of corals sampled) and final (77.2%) sampling; >90% of the nonbleached corals were dominated by D. trenchii. 2bRAD host genotyping found no genetic structure among reefs, but inshore sites showed a high level of clonality. While none of the measured environmental parameters were correlated with bleaching, 71% of variation in bleaching resistance and 73% of variation in the proportion of D. trenchii was attributable to differences between genets, highlighting the leading role of genetics in shaping natural bleaching patterns. Notably, D. trenchii was rarely dominant in O. faveolata from the Florida Keys in previous studies, even during bleaching. The region-wide high abundance of D. trenchii was likely driven by repeated bleaching associated with the two warmest years on record for the Florida Keys (2014 and 2015). On inshore reefs in the Upper Florida Keys, O. faveolata was most abundant, had the highest bleaching resistance, and contained the most corals dominated by D. trenchii, illustrating a causal link between heat tolerance and ecosystem resilience with global change.

Aichi Target 10 of the Convention on Biological Diversity aims to minimize anthropogenic pressures affecting vulnerable ecosystems, and pressure interactions are increasingly being incorporated into environmental management and climate change adaptation strategies. In this study, we explore how climate change, overfishing, forest disturbance, and invasive species pressures interact to affect inland lake walleye (Sander vitreus) populations. Walleye support subsistence, recreational, and commercial fisheries and are one of most sought-after freshwater fish species in North America. Using data from 444 lakes situated across an area of 475 000 km(2) in Ontario, Canada, we apply a novel statistical tool, R-INLA, to determine how walleye biomass deficit (carrying capacity-observed biomass) is impacted by multiple pressures. Individually, angling activity and the presence of invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were positively related to biomass deficits. In combination, zebra mussel presence interacted negatively and antagonistically with angling activity and percentage decrease in watershed mature forest cover. Velocity of climate change in growing degree days above 5 degrees C and decrease in mature forest cover interacted to negatively affect walleye populations. Our study demonstrates how multiple pressure evaluations can be conducted for hundreds of populations to identify influential pressures and vulnerable ecosystems. Understanding pressure interactions is necessary to guide management and climate change adaptation strategies, and achieve global biodiversity targets.	[Gutowsky, Lee F.

Although future sea-level rise is predicted to change the characteristics of these habitats, its impact on their rate of C-org sequestration is highly uncertain. Here we used historical depositional records to show that relative sea-level (RSL) changes regulated C-org accumulation rates in boreal contiguous seagrass-saltmarsh habitats. Age-depth modeling and geological and biogeochemical approaches indicated that C-org accumulation rates varied as a function of changes in depositional environments and habitat relocations. In particular, C-org accumulation rates were enhanced in subtidal seagrass meadows during times of RSL rise, which were caused by postseismic land subsidence and climate change. Our findings identify historical analogs for the future impact of RSL rise driven by global climate change on rates of C-org sequestration in coastal habitats.

While organic amendments are predominantly applied to croplands, their application is increasingly proposed on relatively arid rangelands that do not typically receive fertilizers or other inputs, creating unique concerns for outcomes such as native plant diversity and water quality. To maximize environmental benefits and minimize potential harms, we must understand how soil, water, and plant communities respond to particular amendments and site conditions. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 92 studies in which organic amendments had been added to arid, semiarid, or Mediterranean rangelands. We found that organic amendments, on average, provide some environmental benefits (increased soil carbon, soil water holding capacity, aboveground net primary productivity, and plant tissue nitrogen; decreased runoff quantity), as well as some environmental harms (increased concentrations of soil lead, runoff nitrate, and runoff phosphorus; increased soil CO2 emissions). Published data were inadequate to fully assess impacts to native plant communities. In our models, adding higher amounts of amendment benefitted four outcomes and harmed two outcomes, whereas adding amendments with higher nitrogen concentrations benefitted two outcomes and harmed four outcomes. This suggests that trade-offs among outcomes are inevitable; however, applying low-N amendments was consistent with both maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. Short study time frames (median 1-2 years), limited geographic scope, and, for some outcomes, few published studies limit longer-term inferences from these models. Nevertheless, they provide a starting point to develop site-specific amendment application strategies aimed toward realizing the potential of this practice to contribute to climate change mitigation while minimizing negative impacts on other environmental goals.

Despite the vulnerability of Arctic and boreal landscapes to change, little has been done to characterize landscape change and associated drivers across northern high-latitude ecosystems. Here we characterize the historical sensitivity of Alaska's ecosystems to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbances using expert knowledge, remote sensing data, and spatiotemporal analyses and modeling. Time-series analysis of moderate-and high-resolution imagery was used to characterize land- and water-surface dynamics across Alaska. Some 430,000 interpretations of ecological and geomorphological change were made using historical air photos and satellite imagery, and corroborate land-surface greening, browning, and wetness/moisture trend parameters derived from peak-growing season Landsat imagery acquired from 1984 to 2015. The time series of change metrics, together with climatic data and maps of landscape characteristics, were incorporated into a modeling framework for mapping and understanding of drivers of change throughout Alaska. According to our analysis, approximately 13% (similar to 174,000 +/- 8700 km(2)) of Alaska has experienced directional change in the last 32 years (+/- 95% confidence intervals). At the ecoregions level, substantial increases in remotely sensed vegetation productivity were most pronounced in western and northern foothills of Alaska, which is explained by vegetation growth associated with increasing air temperatures. Significant browning trends were largely the result of recent wildfires in interior Alaska, but browning trends are also driven by increases in evaporative demand and surface-water gains that have predominately occurred over warming permafrost landscapes. Increased rates of photosynthetic activity are associated with stabilization and recovery processes following wildfire, timber harvesting, insect damage, thermokarst, glacial retreat, and lake infilling and drainage events. Our results fill a critical gap in the understanding of historical and potential future trajectories of change in northern high-latitude regions.

Aquatic risks from human pharmaceuticals-modelling temporal trends of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin at the global scale	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						global; temporal; risk assessment; pharmaceuticals; PCRGLOBWB	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; ANTIBIOTIC CONSUMPTION; SURFACE WATERS; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; SEPTIC SYSTEMS; DRINKING-WATER; CATCHMENT; EXPOSURE; FATE; PRIORITIZATION	Despite the worldwide presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, a comprehensive picture of their aquatic risk (AR) at the global scale has not yet been produced. Here, we present a procedure to estimate ARs of human pharmaceuticals at a freshwater ecoregion level. First, we predicted country- and year-specific per capita consumption with a regression model. Second, we calculated spatially explicit freshwater concentrations via a combination of mass balance models, addressing the pharmaceutical's fate in respectively humans, wastewater treatment plants and the environment. Finally, we divided the freshwater concentrations at the level of individual freshwater ecoregions with the regulatory limit value derived from toxicity tests to come to an ecoregion-specific AR. We applied our procedure to model time-trends (1995-2015) of ARs of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin, two widely detected and regulatory relevant human use pharmaceuticals. Our analysis of carbamazepine and ciprofloxacin showed that ARs, due to exposure to these human pharmaceuticals, typically increased 10-20 fold over the last 20 years. Risks due to carbamazepine exposure were still typically low for the time period assessed (AR < 0.1), although some more densely populated and/or arid ecoregions showed higher ARs (up to 1.1). Risks for ciprofloxacin were found to be much higher with ARs larger than 1 for 223 out of 449 freshwater ecoregions in 2015. Comparison with measured concentrations in ten river basins showed that carbamazepine concentrations were predicted well. Concentrations of ciprofloxacin, measured in four river basins, were, however, generally underestimated by our model with one to two orders of magnitude. We conclude that our procedure provides a good starting point to evaluate ARs of a wide range of human pharmaceuticals at the global scale.	[Oldenkamp, Rik; Huijbregts, Mark A.

While ecologists have long accounted for such nonhomogeneous demography in deterministic population models, nonhomogeneous stochastic population models are largely absent from the literature. This is especially the case for models that use exact stochastic methods, such as Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which commonly assumes that demographic rates do not respond to external environmental change (i.e., assumes homogeneous demography). In other words, ecologists are currently accounting for the effects of demographic stochasticity or environmental variability, but not both. In this paper, we describe an extension of Gillespie's SSA (SSA + ) that allows for nonhomogeneous demography and examine how its predictions differ from a method that is partly naive to environmental change (SSAn) for two fundamental ecological models (exponential and logistic growth). We find important differences in the predicted population sizes of SSA + versus SSAn simulations, particularly when demography responds to fluctuating and irregularly changing environments. Further, we outline a computationally inexpensive approach for estimating when and under what circumstances it can be important to fully account for nonhomogeneous demography for any class of model.

For some species, the typical environmental study focuses on presence/absence data, and particularly with small animals as amphibians and reptiles, the number of presences can be rather small. The aim of this study is to develop a spatial model for studying animal data with a low level of presences; we specify a Gaussian Markov Random Field for modelling the spatial component and evaluate the inclusion of environmental covariates.

The absence of large mammals frequently leads to increases in the abundance of small mammals such as rodents, but little is known about how the loss of large mammals affects the behaviour of small mammals. To investigate this question, we analysed long-term data collected at the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment, which excludes different combinations of large mammals from a savannah ecosystem in central Kenya. We investigated the effects of excluding large mammals, both wild and domestic, on the movements of the pouched mouse (Saccostomus mearnsi), the most common species of small mammal in this habitat. Mice moved similar to 20% more in the presence of wildlife, but their movements were not significantly affected by the presence of cattle. An index of intraspecific contacts between mice was higher at higher mouse densities, and these high densities were more likely when wildlife and cattle were absent. The results suggest that the absence of large mammals led to higher densities of small mammals, which resulted in a greater probability of intraspecific contacts, despite lower average movement distances.

The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis (Daudin), preferentially predates on larvae of Cape platannas, Xenopus gilli Rose & Hewitt	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						cannibalism; predator-prey; size; tadpole; vulnerability		Predators are not limited to prey from other species as they can cannibalise vulnerable individuals within their own population. The African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis (Daudin), is a predator with a broad diet, known to consume multiple prey species, including congeners and conspecifics. African clawed frogs occur in sympatry with the Endangered Cape platanna, Xenopus gilli Rose & Hewitt, which are under threat through competition and predation from X.laevis. We investigated the threat of X.laevis predation on X.gilli using choice and no-choice experiments to evaluate the relative vulnerability of X.laevis and X.gilli larvae. Results showed that large X.gilli larvae had a significantly higher vulnerability to X.laevis predation compared to small X.gilli larvae. However, the same discrimination was not discerned when offered large and small X.laevis larvae, or mixed larvae of the same size. We report ontogenic shifts in behaviour of X.gilli larvae that may be a factor in contributing to the vulnerability of large X.gilli larvae to adult X.leavis predation. Congeneric predation likely has negative implications for the population structure of the Endangered X.gilli. Our study underlines the call for the removal of X.laevis to conserve populations of X.gilli.

This study examined the impact of three nurse plants on vegetation diversity and soil physical properties in old fields located at Lapalala Wilderness, South Africa. Vegetation surveys in plots measuring 5mx5m under and outside the canopy of nurse plants in both old field and natural sites were conducted. Top soils under and outside the nurse plants canopy were collected in all plots and quantified for soil moisture, soil penetration resistance and soil water repellency. Results indicate that species diversity was high under plant canopy compared to outside plant canopy for all nurse plants. Soils under nurse plants canopy showed improved soil moisture and soil penetration resistance compared to soils outside plant canopy, but no differences were reported for soil water repellency. The study concludes that the presence of native plants under nurse plants canopy points to a positive vegetation recovery trajectory. For vegetation and soil restoration to be effective in Lapalala Wilderness old fields, nurse plants should be protected and active restoration, e.g. seeding or seedling sowing under nurse plants canopy should be considered.

This study aimed to assess the effect of human disturbance on the population structure of Pterocarpus erinaceus in different land use types (Highly protected area, Moderately protected area and Non-protected area) in Sudanian savannahs of Togo. Data were collected in forty randomly set plots (50mx30m) within each land use type. Population structure parameters and leaf and leaflet morphological traits were evaluated and compared among the land use types by performing different statistical analyses. Results showed an adverse effect of human disturbance on adult and juveniles densities as well as the total height (significant difference between highly protected and non-protected areas; p<0.001). Diameter class structures revealed in the three land use types an inverted J-shape indicating the predominance of young individuals. Significantly greater (p<0.001) values of leaflet length were observed in the non-protected area compared to highly protected one. The human-mediated area impacted the diameter-height relation and the one among assessed leaf and leaflet traits. These findings are tools to be incorporated in new policy development for the future management of this tree species population.

A field survey was conducted to identify and map Z.Mauritiana stems at 25 randomly located 6-ha plots placed along two main roads connecting the Zambezi Valley to the Highveld region. The L-function was used to test for evidence of significant spatial clustering of the stems. The inhomogeneous point model fitted by maximum likelihood was also applied to check whether distance from the road explains variation in the number of stems per unit area. Finally, a t test was executed on log-transformed abundance data to test for significant differences in the mean number of saplings and adults between the Zambezi Valley and the Highveld. Results of the L-function indicated that Z.mauritiana had a clustered and linear distribution along roads both in the Zambezi Valley and Highveld regions. Results of the t test showed that the mean number of saplings per plot in the Zambezi Valley ((1)=275) was three times higher than in the Highveld ((2)=78), with p<0.01. The mean number of adult trees was also significantly higher in the Zambezi Valley than in the Highveld.	[Mungate, Pauline N.

Liana abundance and relationships to sapling and tree hosts in an East African primary forest	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						host; liana; primary forest; saplings; Uganda	TROPICAL FORESTS; DIVERSITY; REGENERATION; DISTURBANCE; MORTALITY; BIOMASS; RESERVE; GROWTH; IMPACT	Lianas are an important structural component of tropical rain forests. Recent concern regarding a putative global rise in liana abundance, and its implications for forest conservation, calls for data collection across biomes. We here provide a first assessment and baseline data for a geographical gap in liana surveys to date. We surveyed liana (diameter at breast height [DBH]>1cm), tree (DBH>10cm) and sapling (DBH10cm) abundance and basal area, as well as liana-host relationships, in a tropical East African primary forest. We recorded a total of 347 liana stems (DBH>1cm) in 0.31ha, with an average basal area of 1.21m(2)/ha. Lianas were found to be widespread, with 24% of saplings and 57% of trees colonised by at least one liana, independently of bark texture or host diameter. The dominant liana colonisation strategy was to associate with a single host, through stem twining. We found no evidence of liana density being influenced by host density. We synthesised published liana density data across continents and report that our estimate of liana density for Kibale's primary forest fits within the expected range of liana densities for primary tropical forests. This synthesis further highlights a neotropical sampling bias, which our findings make a step towards addressing.

This event triggered the formation of brownish, necrotic patches and increased iron contents in the leaves and stems of E. densa, which contributed to a significant demise of the plant within the wetland. In this study, we estimate the recovery time as a proxy for resilience of this macrophyte at organismal and population levels. Macro- and micro-optical characteristics, as well as iron contents in tissues of E. densa, were documented in four time windows (2004, 2008, 2012, and 2014). In addition, the size of the macrophyte population and its spatial occurrence were monitored from 2008 to 2016 across 36 study sites within the wetland. Our results suggest necrotic patches and high iron contents in E. densa persisted at least until 2008. After 2013, a significant increase in the spatial occurrence of E. densa was observed within the wetland, reaching full recovery of the population during 2015. The health of plant tissues and iron contents in leaves and stems showed recovery period close to 4 years, while the recovery of the spatial occurrence of E. densa took approximately 9 years. While the monitoring of plant health was not performed on a strict annual basis, the recovery rates estimated here are slower than those described for other macrophytes. This finding might reflect the long-lasting effects of the disturbance from 2004 and the interaction with biotic processes, such as foraging by waterbirds recolonizing the Rio Cruces wetland. These results show that full recovery of E. densa was achieved through a cascade of effects starting with abiotic factors (water quality) and passing through physiological and individual levels, to finally reach the population level. A key aspect of this response is the invasive nature of the macrophyte, which likely contributed to its recovery as a consequence of improved water quality. Less successful macrophyte species in other systems may not reach the specific population recovery, and become subdominant species instead, or even be eradicated from the wetland either as the result of herbivory or due to competition with other macrophytes.

We present a repeatable method to estimate and map field values in monetary terms using common correlative models. We modelled, with a resolution of 1 km(2), the information obtained by several real estate's agencies with a set of eleven environmental, climatic, and anthropogenic variables. Land cover was the main influencing factor, but further variables were affecting bids on field sales according to the socio-economic specificity of each administrative province. The estimated values were related to endemic plant species richness, their conservation status and altitudinal ranges. Richest areas in endemics have lower values given current market conditions and, within these endemic rich areas, values near the coast were generally higher than the rest of endemic-rich territories. Despite their limits, our method offers an alternative perspective on the challenges of simplifying the extrapolation of useful information for planning and disseminating the conservation of many ecosystem services providers.

We used multiple regression to investigate associations between six self-reported behaviors hypothesized to influence PFAS exposure and serum concentrations of six PFAS chemicals in 178 middle-aged women enrolled in the Child Health and Development Studies, about half of whom are African American. Blood samples were collected in 2010-2013, and participants were interviewed about behavior in 2015-2016. Results showed that African American women had lower levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) compared with non-Hispanic white women. In African Americans, but not others, frequent consumption of prepared food in coated cardboard containers was associated with higher levels of four PFASs. Flossing with Oral-B Glide, having stain-resistant carpet or furniture, and living in a city served by a PFAS-contaminated water supply were also associated with higher levels of some PFASs.

Mineralized microbialites as archives of environmental evolution, Laguna Negra, Catamarca Province, Argentina	GEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							ORGANIC-MATTER; CARBONATE PRECIPITATION; CHILEAN ALTIPLANO; ATACAMA-ALTIPLANO; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; CALCIUM-CARBONATE; ANDEAN ALTIPLANO; HYPERSALINE LAKE; STABLE-ISOTOPE; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Environmental fluctuations are recorded in a variety of sedimentary archives of lacustrine depositional systems. Geochemical signals recovered from bottom sediments in closed-basin lakes are among the most sensitive paleoenvironmental indicators and are commonly used in reconstructing lake evolution. Microbialites (i.e., organosedimentary deposits accreted through microbial trapping and binding of detrital sediment or in situ mineral precipitation on organics [Palaios, 2, 1987, 241]), however, have been largely overlooked as paleoenvironmental repositories. Here, we investigate concentrically laminated mineralized microbialites from Laguna Negra, a high-altitude (4,100 m above sea level) hypersaline, closed-basin lake in northwestern Argentina, and explore the potential for recovery of environmental signals from these unique sedimentary archives. Spatial heterogeneity in hydrological regime helps define zones inside Laguna Negra, each with their own morphologically distinct microbialite type. Most notably, platey microbialites (in Zone 3A) are precipitated by evaporative concentration processes, while discoidal oncolites (in Zone 3C) are interpreted result from fluid mixing and biologically mediated nucleation. This spatial heterogeneity is reflected in petrographically distinct carbonate fabrics: micritic, botryoidal, and isopachous. Fabric type is interpreted to reflect a combination of physical and biological influences during mineralization, and paired C-isotope measurement of carbonate and organic matter supports ecological differences as a dominant control on C-isotopic evolution between zones. Laminae of Laguna Negra microbialites preserve a range of delta C-13(carb) from +5.75 parts per thousand to +18.25 parts per thousand and delta O-18(carb) from -2.04 parts per thousand to +9.28 parts per thousand. Temporal trends of lower carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions suggest that the influence of CO2 degassing associated with evaporation has decreased over time. Combined, these results indicate that microbialite archives can provide data that aid in interpretation of both lake paleohydrology and paleoenvironmental change.

Gut microbes may have contributed to this diversification of food habits. Here, we identified the pattern of the relationship between ground-dwelling beetles and their gut microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) in the field. We collected 46 beetle species of five families from secondary deciduous forests and grasslands in Japan and extracted microbial DNA from whole guts for amplicon sequencing. The gut bacterial and fungal communities differed among all habitats and all food habits of their hosts (carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, and scavengers) except for the fungal communities between carnivores and scavengers. Specifically, the abundant bacterial group varied among food habits: Xanthomonadaceae were abundant in scavengers, whereas Enterobacteriaceae were abundant in carnivores and herbivores. Phylogenetically closely related beetles had phylogenetically similar communities of Enterobacteriaceae, suggesting that the community structure of this family is related to the evolutionary change in beetle ecology. One of the fungal groups, Yarrowia species, which has been reported to have a symbiotic relationship with silphid beetles, was also detected from various carnivorous beetles. Our results suggest that the symbiotic relationships between ground-dwelling beetles and these microbes are widespread.

However, the extent of plant phylogenetic constraints on the free-living soil mycobiome remains unknown, especially at broad geographic scales. Here, 343 soil samples were collected adjacent to individual tree trunks, representing 58 woody plant species located in five mountain forests of eastern China. Integrating plant species identity and phylogenetic information, we aimed to unravel the relative contributions of phylogenetic relationships among tree species, abiotic environmental filtering, and geographic isolation to the geographic distribution of soil mycobiome. We found that the community dissimilarities of total fungi and each dominant guild (viz. saprotrophs, plant pathogens, and ectomycorrhizal fungi) significantly increased with increasing plant phylogenetic distance. Plant phylogenetic eigenvectors explained 11.4% of the variation in community composition, whereas environmental and spatial factors explained 24.1% and 7.2% of the variation, respectively. The communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi and plant pathogens were relatively more strongly affected by plant phylogeny than those of saprotrophs (13.7% and 10.4% vs. 8.5%). Overall, our results demonstrate how plant phylogeny, environment, and geographic space contribute to forest soil fungal distributions and suggest that the influence of plant phylogeny on fungal association may differ by guilds.

A challenge in understanding the effects of salinity on soil microbial communities is the fact that it can be difficult to disentangle the effects of salinity from those of other variables that may co-vary with salinity. Here we use a trait-based approach to identify direct effects of salinity on soil bacterial communities across two salinity gradients. Through dose-response relationships between salinity and bacterial growth, we quantified distributions of the trait salt tolerance within the communities. Community salt tolerance was closely correlated with soil salinity, indicating a strong filtering effect of salinity on the bacterial communities. Accompanying the increases in salt tolerance were consistent shifts in bacterial community composition. We identified specific bacterial taxa that increased in relative abundances with community salt tolerance, which could be used as bioindicators for high community salt tolerance. A strong filtering effect was also observed for pH across the gradients, with pH tolerance of bacterial communities correlated to soil pH. We propose phenotypic trait distributions aggregated at the community level as a useful approach to study the role of environmental factors as filters of microbial community composition.

Spatial modeling of litter and soil carbon stocks on forest land n the conterminous United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						National Forest Inventory; Machine learning; NDVI; Google Earth Engine	ORGANIC-CARBON; TURNOVER TIMES; LEAF-LITTER; FINE ROOTS; REGRESSION; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION; DYNAMICS; STORAGE; MATTER	Forest ecosystems contribute substantially to carbon (C) storage. The dynamics of litter decomposition, translocation and stabilization into soil layers are essential processes in the functioning of forest ecosystems, as these processes control the cycling of soil organic matter and the accumulation and release of C to the atmosphere. Therefore, the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks are important in greenhouse gas estimation and reporting and inform land management decisions, policy, and climate change mitigation strategies. Here we explored the effects of spatial aggregation of climatic, biotic, topographic and soil variables on national estimates of litter and soil C stocks and characterized the spatial distribution of litter and soil C stocks in the conterminous United States (CONUS). litter and soil variables were measured on permanent sample plots (n = 3303) from the National Forest Inventory (NEI) within the United States from 2000 to 2011. These data were used with vegetation phonology data estimated from LANDSAT imagery (30 m) and raster data describing environmental variables for the entire CONUS to predict litter and soil C stocks. The total estimated litter C stock was 2.07 +/- 0.97 Pg with an average density of 10.45 +/- 2.38 Mg ha(-1), and the soil C stock at 0-20 an depth was 14.68 +/- 3.50 Pg with an average density of 62.68 +/- 8.98 Mg ha(-1). This study extends NFI data from points to pixels providing spatially explicit and continuous predictions of litter and soil C stocks on forest land in the CONUS. The approaches described illustrate the utility of harmonizing field measurements with remotely sensed data to facilitate modeling and prediction across spatial scales in support of inventory, monitoring, and reporting activities, particularly in countries with ready access to remotely sensed data but with limited observations of litter and soil variables.

When considering options for adapting forests under climate change, climate is treated as the dominant driver of forest growth, while soil properties are often ignored mainly due to shortage of accurate data. The effects of climate and soil on forest growth may vary due to local adaptation to both climate and soil, and these local adaptations might need to be considered when transferring seed provenances under climate change. Data from 29 provenance trials of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) across a wide gradient of planting conditions in Austria was used to develop Structural Equation Models (SEMs) to quantified the role of climatic and soil drivers and their interactions on juvenile growth performance and to test if provenance origin affects the relative importance of these drivers. Climate and soil of the planting site location were found to have similar direct effects on juvenile tree growth, however, climate was found to be more important because of additional indirect effects via interactions with soil parameters. Notably, the relative effects of climate and soil vary among different provenance groups. Climate constraints are dominant for seed sources originating from colder and/or high altitude locations, while test site climate and soil are equally important contributors of growth for provenances originating from warmer origin and lower elevation sites. Together with the better growth performance of the latter provenance group their plasticity allows them to utilize a wide range of soil conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The impact of straw mulching and salvage logging on post-fire runoff and soil erosion generation under Mediterranean climate conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Wildfire; Salvage logging; Straw mulching; Soil erosion: runoff; Mediterranean forest ecosystems	SURFACE RUNOFF; HILLSLOPE EROSION; WATER REPELLENCY; SEDIMENT YIELDS; FOREST; FIRE; SEVERITY; WILDFIRE; REHABILITATION; COVER	Forest fires-affected landscapes enhance sudden runoff discharges, high sediment loads and extreme soil erosion rates. Different soil stabilisation treatments, such as mulching, can be applied to avoid runoffand soil erosion after wildfires. To characterise the post-fire soil erosion rates and runoff generation, we selected a Mediterranean forest affected by a wildfire in Lietor (Spain) to determine the sediment yield (dry sediment (DS), total suspended sediment (TSS), total dissolved sediment (MS)) and runoff discharge in twelve 200 m(2) (10 x 20 m) plots. Immediately after the wildfire, six plots were covered by straw and six other plots were set up as controls. Three months after the wildfire, logging activities were performed and the experimental designs were as follows: mulching + logging (three replicates), non-mulching + logging (three replicates), non-mulching + non-logging (three replicates) and mulching + non-logging (three replicates). During the period after wildfire and before salvage logging, the straw mulch controlled the soil erosion rates (DS, TSS and MS) versus the nonmulched plots, but straw had no real impact on runoff discharge. For the period after salvage logging, once again runoff did not differ when comparing all the treatments. DS was higher in the non-mulched and non-logging plots, whereas the highest TSS was found in the non-mulched plots (in logged or non-logged plots). TDS was higher in the mulched and non-logged plots. We conclude that straw mulch is efficient management in recent fire-affected mountainous terrains to control soil loss immediately after wildfire. Moreover, logging operations done 3 months after wildfire did not necessary generate higher DS, TSS, TDS rates, mainly because of the type of machinery used for forest operations.

Despite increasing evidence for effects of biodiversity (species diversity, functional diversity and functional dominance), stand structural attributes, stand age and environmental conditions (climate and topography) on tree carbon storage, the relative importance of these drivers at large scale is poorly understood. It is also still unclear whether biodiversity effects on tree carbon storage work through niche complementarity (i.e. increased tree carbon storage due to interspecific resource partitioning) or through the mass-ratio effect (tree carbon storage regulated by dominant traits within communities). Here we analyze tree carbon storage and its drivers using data of 480 plots sampled across subtropical forests in China. We use multiple regression models to test the relative effects of biodiversity, stand structural attributes, stand age and environmental conditions on tree carbon storage, and use a partial least squares path model to test how these variables directly and/or indirectly affect tree carbon storage. Our results show that tree carbon storage is most strongly affected by stand age, followed by climate, biodiversity and stand structural attributes. Stand age and dimate had both direct and indirect (through species diversity, functional dominance and stand structural attributes) effects. We find that tree carbon storage correlates with both species diversity and functional dominance after stand age and environmental drivers are accounted for. Our results suggest that niche complementarity and the mass-ratio effect, not necessarily mutually exclusive, both playa role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. Our results further indicate that biodiversity conservation might be an effective way for enhancing tree carbon storage in natural, species-rich forest ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Such colonies can increase their size by expanding clonally to surrounding open mudflats and their number by establishing new colonies on far away from the original colonies either by sexual reproduction or rhizome fragmentation. In this work, we aimed to link colony dynamics mechanisms, lateral growth and recruitment, to reproduce the overall population dynamics of Spartina alterniflora in an integrative manner. The proposed model describes a population as a collection of age-structured colonies randomly distributed in a habitat area. By applying a mean field approach for spatial dimensions, we derive dynamics of how the expected proportion of an area occupied by these colonies would disperse over time. We derive a parameter describing the contribution of lateral growth and recruitment to population, i.e., the growth potential. This growth potential is proportional to the geometrical mean of the lateral-growth speed and recruitment rate, representing the average growth rate including these two mechanisms. Moreover, we show that lateral growth, rather than recruitment, addresses transitional dynamics of stable-age-structure developments. The ratio between colony mortality and growth potential determines the equilibrium proportion of area occupied by these colonies. The application of this model to S. alternifiora population dynamics would be feasible across a wide range of populations determined by the spatial occupations of growing colonies.

Relationships between indicators of cardiovascular disease and intensity of oil and natural gas activity in Northeastern Colorado	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article							FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; AUGMENTATION INDEX; PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS; UNCONVENTIONAL OIL; BIRTH OUTCOMES	Background: Oil and natural gas (O&G) extraction emits pollutants that are associated with cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Objective: We evaluated associations between intensity of O&G activity and cardiovascular disease indicators. Methods: Between October 2015 and May 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 97 adults living in Northeastern Colorado. For each participant, we collected 1-3 measurements of augmentation index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). We modelled the intensity of O&G activity by weighting O&G well counts within 16 km of a participant's home by intensity and distance. We used linear models accounting for repeated measures within person to evaluate associations. Results: Adjusted mean augmentation index differed by 6.0% (95% CI: 0.6, 11.4%) and 5.1 /0 (95%CI: -0.1, 10.4%) between high and medium, respectively, and low exposure tertiles. The greatest mean IL-1 beta, and alpha-TNF plasma concentrations were observed for participants in the highest exposure tertile. IL-6 and IL-8 results were consistent with a null result. For participants not taking prescription medications, the adjusted mean SBP differed by 6 and 1 mm Hg (95% CIs: 0.1, 13 mm Hg and -6, 8 mm Hg) between the high and medium, respectively, and low exposure tertiles. DBP results were similar. For participants taking prescription medications, SBP and DBP results were consistent with a null result. Conclusions: Despite limitations, our results support associations between O&G activity and augmentation index, SBP, DBP, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Our study was not able to elucidate possible mechanisms or environmental stressors, such as air pollution and noise.

However, the relationship between ozone exposure and depression, especially among adolescents, is scarcely investigated. Objectives: The study aimed to analyze associations between ozone exposure and depressive symptoms among German adolescents. Methods: The analyses were based on 2827 adolescents aged 15 from Munich and Wesel areas of the GINIplus and LISA birth cohorts. The depressive symptoms were assessed by the Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen). Long-term ozone exposure was estimated by optimal interpolation techniques and assigned to home addresses. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 10 mu m (PM10) were assessed by land use regression models. For short-term exposure, maximum 8-h averages of ozone and daily average concentrations of NO2 and PM10 from the background monitoring sites 0 (same day), 1, 2, 3, and 7 days prior to depressive symptoms assessment were adopted. The cross-sectional analyses were conducted by adjusted logistic regression models controlling for residuals of NO2 and PM10, and covariates identified by a directed acyclic graph. Results: The prevalence of depressive symptoms ranged from 10.9% to 13.8% depending on regions. Overall, long- and short-term exposure to ozone were not statistically significantly associated with depressive symptoms. However, subgroup analysis showed inconsistent significant protective associations for short-term exposure to ozone lag 0 day (same day) and depressive symptoms in Wesel (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: (0.59, 0.98)), but not in Munich (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: (0.83, 1.21)). Conclusions: Our study does not support the hypothesis that ambient ozone exposure might increase the prevalence of depressive symptoms in German adolescents. Nevertheless, due to a lack of similar studies, these results need to be replicated in other samples.

Exceedance of the WHO guidelines for indoor air was observed, mainly for the hourly average NO2 concentrations. Seasonal variability was statistically significant for indoor NO2 and CO concentrations, with higher exposures in fall and winter. An extensive list of potential factors at the outdoor environment, school, and room level that may explain the variability in indoor exposure was examined. Factors with significant contributions to indoor exposure were mostly related to the outdoor pollution sources. This is evidenced by the strong associations between indoor concentration of CO and NO2 and factors including outdoor PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations, including length of the nearby roads and the number of nearby industrial facilities. Additionally, we found that poor conditions of the buildings (a prevalent phenomenon in the studied urban area), including physical defects and lack of proper ventilation, contributed to poor air quality in schools. The results suggest that improving building conditions and facilities as well as a consideration of the school surroundings may improve indoor air quality in schools.

Evaluating spatial variation in functional traits across environmental gradients may help determine the environmental filters that play a role in community assembly and how plant communities respond to prevailing environmental conditions. In this study, we evaluated spatial variation in leaf traits (size, thickness, specific area and dry matter content) of coastal sand dune plant communities across 16 sites along a precipitation gradient in the Yucatan Peninsula. We described community-wide trait variation in terms of dispersion and dominant values across the gradient in order to answer the following questions: Which environmental filters explain variation in leaf traits? What ecological strategies, in terms of leaf economics, do these environmental filters favour? Mean specific leaf area and dispersion in leaf thickness tended to be lower in drier sites, suggesting that plants invest more biomass per leaf (a conservative strategy) and become more succulent as aridity increases. Contrary to expectation, leaf size increased with proximity to the coastline and dry matter content was significantly greater in the wettest region. Therefore, variation in these leaf traits content cannot be explained by the precipitation gradient. We have shown that predictable variation in some functional leaf traits can be found, even at small scales within the same vegetation zone in coastal sand dunes. Our study supports the notion that variation in water availability can be an important driver of functional trait distribution in the plant communities of some arid environments.

The effects of nitrogen deposition and invasion on litter fuel quality and decomposition in a Stipa pulchra grassland	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Global change; Fuel loads; Litter quality; Decomposition; Grass-fire cycle	PLANT INVASION; SOIL-NITROGEN; RESPONSES; PRECIPITATION; COMMUNITY; ABUNDANCE; GRASSES; STORAGE; CARBON; RATES	Fuel loads from invasive annual grasses different from natives can alter the fire regime to one that positively feedbacks to their establishment, known as the grass-fire cycle. Nitrogen (N) deposition can exacerbate the grass-fire cycle by favoring non-native annual grasses and increase their biomass production, generating greater fuel loads. Less studied is how N enrichment can affect the chemical quality of litter as it pertains to the decomposition or accumulation of fuel. Here, we primarily tested how N addition affected the quality and mass loss of litter produced by the native perennial grass, Stipa pulchra, and the non-native annual grass, Bromus hordeaceus. We found that B. hordeaceus litter was significantly lower in quality and decomposed to a lesser extent than S. pulchra litter, even with N addition, which increased litter quality and mass loss overall. In addition, we show that B. hordeaceus sustained dead biomass with lower moisture content for a greater portion of the experimental year. Therefore, we conclude that B. hordeaceus invasion promotes fire by generating litter that decomposes more slowly, leaving a greater source of dry fuel for a longer period of time.

Can topography affect the restoration of soil properties after deforestation in a semiarid ecosystem?	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Sandy soil; Dryland; Caatinga biome; Dry forest; Land degradation	ORGANIC-CARBON; SLOPE ASPECTS; FOREST; STOICHIOMETRY; MORPHOLOGY; DYNAMICS; FLUXES; EXTENT	The use of vegetation as a source of energy and its clearing for agricultural production has contributed to the degradation of the drylands in world. On soil, the effects of deforestation are still controversial and need to be better understood. In this study, the effect of deforestation and soil topography on soil morphological properties, nutrient availability, and carbon (C) contribution in a topossequence that was deforested 12 years before in the Brazilian semi-arid region was evaluated. For this purpose, two areas (preserved and deforested) were selected and separated into three positions along the slope: lower, middle, and upper third. For each position, the characterization of the soil fertility and the physical and morphological attributes of the selected profiles were carried out. In general, deforestation had no effect on the total organic carbon (TOC) of the soil, but, on the other hand, was responsible for increasing the structural fragility of the soil. The major effect of deforestation on soil fertility was reduced availability of cationic nutrients (Mg2+ and K+). We conclude that topography had no effect on the restoration of soil properties after deforestation in this semiarid ecosystem. For these conditions, similar management strategies (e.g. reforestation), can be adopted for the different topographical positions of the slope. Our results can be used in forest restoration projects of degraded ecosystems in drylands, to select the best practices of management, aiming at restoring the natural ecological processes of the ecosystem.

Although some crops have benefited from this methodology, studies in Coffea are still emerging. To date, there have been no studies describing how well genomic prediction models work across populations and environments for different complex traits in coffee. Considering that predictive models are based on biological and statistical assumptions, it is expected that their performance vary depending on how well these assumptions align with the true genetic architecture of the phenotype. To investigate this, we used data from two recurrent selection populations of Coffea canephora, evaluated in two locations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms identified by Genotyping-by-Sequencing. In particular, we evaluated the performance of 13 statistical approaches to predict three important traits in the coffee-production of coffee beans, leaf rust incidence and yield of green beans. Analyses were performed for predictions within-environment, across locations and across populations to assess the reliability of genomic selection. Overall, differences in the prediction accuracy of the competing models were small, although the Bayesian methods showed a modest improvement over other methods, at the cost of more computation time. As expected, predictive accuracy for within-environment analysis, on average, were higher than predictions across locations and across populations. Our results support the potential of genomic selection to reshape traditional plant breeding schemes. In practice, we expect to increase the genetic gain per unit of time by reducing the length cycle of recurrent selection in coffee.

This genotype-dependent dispersal is difficult to assess, yet can impact the genetic variation of natural populations and their fitness. In this work, we demonstrate a high immigration rate of barn owls (Tyto alba) inside a Swiss population surveyed during 15 years. Using ten microsatellite loci as an indirect method to characterize dispersal, two-third of the genetic tests failed to detect a female-biased dispersal, and Monte Carlo simulations confirmed a low statistical power to detect sex-biased dispersal in case of high dispersal rate of both sexes. The capture-recapture data revealed a female-biased dispersal associated with an excess of heterozygote for the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R), which is responsible for their ventral rufous coloration. Thus, female homozygotes for the MC1R(WHITE) allele might be negatively selected during dispersal. Despite the higher immigration of females that are heterozygote at MC1R, non-random gene flow should not lead to a migration load regarding this gene because we did not detect an effect of MC1R on survival and reproductive success in our local population. The present study highlights the usefulness of using multiple methods to correctly decrypt dispersal and gene flow. Moreover, despite theoretical expectations, we show that non-random dispersal of particular genotypes does not necessarily lead to migration load in recipient populations.

While stressful environmental conditions are normally viewed as a strong selective force, they can also impact directly on the genetic basis of traits such as through environment-dependent gene action. Here, we used the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel to investigate the impact of developmental temperature on variance components and evolutionary potential of cold tolerance. We reared 166 lines at five temperatures and assessed cold tolerance of adult male flies from each line and environment. We show (1) that the expression of genetic variation for cold tolerance is highly dependent on developmental temperature, (2) that the genetic correlation of cold tolerance between environments decreases as developmental temperatures become more distinct, (3) that the correlation between cold tolerance at individual developmental temperatures and plasticity for cold tolerance differs across developmental temperatures, and even switches sign across the thermal developmental gradient, and (4) that evolvability decrease with increasing developmental temperatures. Our results show that the quantitative genetic basis of low temperature tolerance is environment specific. This conclusion is important for the understanding of evolution in variable thermal environments and for designing experiments aimed at pinpointing candidate genes and performing functional analyses of thermal resistance.

Differences between primary and secondary plant succession among biomes of the world	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						alien plants; convergence; divergence; latitudinal pattern; species richness; target vegetation	VEGETATION SUCCESSION; RESTORATION	Successional theory lacks an explicit, conceptual integration across types of disturbances and biomes. Most successional research addresses site- or process-specific questions, but extrapolation of the findings to broad scales is limited. Studies of plant succession are often distinguished by the severity of the disturbance that triggers them (severely disturbed: primary; less severely disturbed: secondary). Here, we examine the common assumption that primary and secondary succession differ. We use two anthropogenic disturbances for this comparison, mining and ploughing. Successional generalizations are confounded by a complexity of environmental factors including climatic and geographic variation. We address these issues by contrasting succession across multiple biomes. We selected 166 studies of succession on mining sites (n = 73) or abandoned fields (n = 93) that allowed us to compare successional trajectories in terms of the likelihood of a return to target vegetation, changes in species richness, type of trajectories, and the importance of alien species. Success of both types of succession (a return to target vegetation) differed significantly among biomes, with more likely success in cold than warm biomes (for both primary and secondary seres) and in humid than arid biomes (primary seres only). Primary seres were also more likely than secondary seres to have increases in species richness, a predominance of divergent trajectories, and a lower likelihood that alien species influenced succession. Synthesis. The probability of reaching target vegetation by spontaneous succession is generally greater in biomes at higher versus lower latitudes. Primary and secondary seres differed regarding species richness, trajectories, and the role of alien species. Our results highlight that broad generalizations about succession are possible, despite a paucity of comparable data and our use of only two types of anthropogenic disturbances. Any generalizations that might be found among seres across disturbances and biomes will provide a practical framework for land managers to guide restoration efforts, particularly in poorly studied areas.

Understorey succession after burial by tephra from Mount St. Helens	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						disturbance; diversity; old-growth; permanent plots; plant community; recovery; resilience; secondary succession; succession trajectory; volcanic eruption	VOLCANIC TEPHRA; FOREST; PLANT; GROWTH; LONG; VEGETATION; RECOVERY; SURVIVAL; ERUPTION; DIVERSITY	Successional change following disturbance is a fundamental ecological process that remains central to understanding patterns in plant ecology. Although succession has been studied for well over a century, understanding of the patterns and processes of change is still inadequate, partly because of the dearth of long-term studies. Here, we use, as a model system, a volcanic disturbance that is widespread and of global relevance. We examine succession in old-growth conifer forest understories following burial by tephra (aerially transported volcanic ejecta) in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Using four sites with different initial conditions and amounts of disturbance (tephra burial), we sampled plant communities at years 1, 20, and 36 since the eruption using permanent plots representing two treatments: undisturbed tephra and control plots from which tephra was experimentally removed. By using this long-term data, we were able to gauge change through time and differences between tephra-disturbed and control plots. In tephra-impacted plots, cover reached preeruption levels by year 36 except for bryophytes at three sites and shrubs at one site. Cover in control plots also increased significantly for all growth forms except bryophytes, remaining above that on tephra plots at the same site in most situations. Sites generally increased in species richness first, and then gradually increased in evenness and Shannon's diversity; after 36 years, differences between control and tephra-impacted plots remained at only one site. Community composition was stable in one site and shifted gradually through time at the two other sites, and differences between plot types persisted at one site. Communities change over 36 years could relate to various endogenic and abiotic factors. Synthesis. These data suggest that, while recovery to the predisturbance status occurs in some cases, recovery is site-specific. Understorey communities can be dynamic, even in old-growth forests, and may still be responding to disturbance over three decades later. Long-term experimental studies are key to understanding succession patterns and generalizations about the importance of initial conditions, disturbance intensity, and the complexity of interactions that determine vegetation change.

These systems are classic testing grounds for hypotheses about community assembly. However, old field succession can be difficult to predict: seemingly similar fields often diverge in terms of species composition and environmental conditions. Here, we test the relative roles of contingency and stochasticity in driving vegetative successional dynamics. We draw on three decades of surveys in 24 old fields at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (Minnesota, USA), and focus on five drivers that are known to shape local plant communities: soil fertility, fire, climate, competition, and demography. These drivers can contribute to contingency when they act consistently across fields and years (e.g., soil nitrogen accumulation, experimental fire regimes, or average climate), or to stochasticity when their effects are variable (e.g., annual variations in weather, or colonization and mortality events). We proceed in two steps. First, we fit regressions estimating abundance, colonization, and mortality for eight major functional groups in relation to these five drivers. We then use these regressions to parameterize a series of metacommunity simulation models, and test whether observed levels of stochasticity and variation in the drivers are sufficient to explain successional divergence. All drivers were significantly associated with plant species abundances, colonization, and mortality. Contingent factors strongly altered predicted successional trajectories. However, replicate simulations with similar conditions followed similar successional trajectories, suggesting that stochastic processes did not lead to divergence. This robustness of successional dynamics may be explained by compensatory trade-offs. For example, species that were abundant late in succession typically suffered from low colonization rates and high mortality rates early in succession. Synthesis. Average successional dynamics among old fields at Cedar Creek follow largely consistent trends. Though dynamics of individual fields vary, much of this variation can be explained by contingent factors. Stochastic processes appear not to be sufficiently strong to create divergent successional trajectories among fields with similar sets of drivers. Our results therefore suggest that divergence among successional trajectories in chronosequences may be the result of predictable contingent factors, rather than unpredictable stochastic fluctuations.

Soil nutrients and dispersal limitation shape compositional variation in secondary tropical forests across multiple scales	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						community assembly; dispersal limitation; forest fragments; forest succession; human-modified landscape; niche process; resource partitioning; soil nutrients	SPECIES COMPOSITION; SEED DISPERSAL; BETA-DIVERSITY; RAIN-FORESTS; TREE GROWTH; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; SHIFTING CULTIVATION; NATURAL REGENERATION; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; ABANDONED PASTURE	Soil resource partitioning and dispersal limitation have been shown to shape the tree community structure of mature tropical forests, but are poorly studied in the context of forest succession. We examined the relative contributions of both ecological processes to the variation in the species composition of young tropical secondary forests at different spatial scales, and if the relative importance of these two ecological processes changed during succession. At the species level, we examined if the association between species abundances and soil fertility differed between early and late successional species and/or changed over the course of succession. We used vegetation and soil data from 47 secondary forest sites with two plots each in a tropical agricultural landscape. A distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning were employed to examine the relative importance of spatial distance (proxy for dispersal limitation) and heterogeneity in soil nutrients (proxy for soil nutrient partitioning) at the landscape scale, and a linear regression to test their effects at the local scale. We examined interspecific variation in species' responses to successional age and soil nutrients with a joint species distribution model. Dispersal limitation and soil niche partitioning drove considerable variation in the composition of plant communities at local and landscape scales. The relative contribution of these two ecological processes changed with scale (local vs. landscape) and topography (lower slope vs. upper slope plots). At the species level, significant abundance-soil fertility associations were mostly positive. Most species became less responsive to soil nutrients over the first few decades of tropical forest succession, probably because light became the main limiting resource in older forests. Synthesis. Our key finding is that spatial heterogeneity in soil resources and spatial distance jointly drive compositional variation within and across early successional forests. Our results highlight that a network of forest fragments enhances the resilience of ecological processes and the potential of secondary forests to restore and preserve biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. To advance our understanding of ecological succession, we need to move beyond single-factor and local-scale studies and examine the effects of multiple variables on succession at different spatial scales.

Working with forest dynamics on islands in a vast lake created by a hydroelectric dam in China (the Thousand Island Lake), we sampled 29 islands that were cleared of forest during dam construction in 1959 and then underwent succession. Measurements taken in 2009-2010 and 2014-2015 evaluated community assembly during succession, based on species diversity, functional traits and structural properties. Forests on small islands remained at relatively early stages of compositional succession: species richness was low, and communities were dominated by early-successional species, with few animal-dispersed and shade-tolerant plants. However, these islands had accumulated similar above-ground biomass density to that on larger islands, mostly in the stems of a fast-growing pine species. Island size was the key driver of secondary succession in regenerating forest fragments, while isolation had comparatively little effect. Edge effects were important for species composition and functional composition. Synthesis. Habitat fragmentation resulting from the creation of an artificial lake affected community assembly, with fewer late-successional species on smaller islands. Maintenance of large fragments is critical for the rapid succession of forests. Paradigms on habitat fragmentation effects drawn from old-growth forest studies are unlikely to hold in regenerating forest fragments. Restoration activities should consider landscape patterns to accelerate secondary succession of regenerating forests.

However, some plant species also form dual symbioses involving ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, with a subset of those also forming triple symbioses also involving dinitrogen (N-2)-fixing bacteria. It has been suggested that these plants show plasticity in root symbioses to optimise nutrient acquisition depending on the type and strength of soil nutrient limitation (e.g., N vs. P), yet empirical evidence remains limited. Alternatively, the degree of investment or "preference" in particular root symbioses might simply reflect differences in inoculum potential among soils of contrasting nutrient availability, reflecting adaptations of root symbionts to different edaphic conditions. Here, we grew two co-occurring plant species forming triple (AM/ECM/N-2-fixing; Acacia rostellifera) or dual (AM/ECM; Melaleuca systena) symbioses in soils of increasing age and contrasting nutrient availability from an Australian long-term soil chronosequence to disentangle the relative importance of abiotic factors (e.g., soil nutrient availability and stoichiometry) and biotic factors (e.g., soil inoculum potential) in determining root colonisation patterns and functional outcomes of these multiple root symbioses. For both plant species, we found clear hump-shaped plant growth patterns along the pedogenesis-driven gradient in soil nutrient availability, with peak growth in intermediate-aged soils, while high levels of mycorrhizal colonisation by the "preferred" root symbionts were maintained across all soils. We found large increases (540%) in foliar manganese concentrations with increasing soil age and declining P availability, suggesting that plants may be relying on the release of carboxylates to help acquire P in the most P-impoverished soils. Finally, we found that soil abiotic properties, such as strong differences in soil nutrient availability, are generally more important than soil inoculum potential in explaining these shifts in our plant and root responses. Synthesis. Our study suggests that plants capable of forming multiple root symbioses show plasticity in their nutrient-acquisition strategies following shifts in soil nutrients during long-term ecosystem development, yet maintain a preference for certain root symbionts despite changes in soil microbial inoculum.

Fire, fragmentation, and windstorms: A recipe for tropical forest degradation	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Amazonia; biomass loss; fire scar; forest degradation; forest dynamics; tree mortality; windstorms	TREE MORTALITY; WIND DISTURBANCE; WOOD DENSITY; LARGE BLOWDOWNS; CARBON STOCKS; LAND-USE; DEFORESTATION; IMPACTS; CLIMATE; BIOMASS	Widespread degradation of tropical forests is caused by a variety of disturbances that interact in ways that are not well understood. To explore potential synergies between edge effects, fire and windstorm damage as causes of Amazonian forest degradation, we quantified vegetation responses to a 30-min, high-intensity windstorm that in 2012, swept through a large-scale fire experiment that borders an agricultural field. Our pre- and postwindstorm measurements include tree mortality rates and modes of death, above-ground biomass, and airborne LiDAR-based estimates of tree heights and canopy disturbance (i.e., number and size of gaps). The experimental area in the southeastern Amazonia includes three 50-ha plots established in 2004 that were unburned (Control), burned annually (B1yr), or burned at 3-year intervals (B3yr). The windstorm caused greater damage to trees (>10 cm DBH) in the burned plots (B1yr: 13 +/- 9% of 785 trees; B3yr: 17 +/- 13% of 433) than in the Control plot (8 +/- 4% of 2,300; +/- CI). It substantially reduced vegetation height by 14% in B1yr, 20% in B3yr and 12% in the Control plots, while it reduced above-ground biomass by 18% of 77.7 Mg/ha (B1yr), 31% of 56.6 (B3yr), and 15% of 120 (Control). Tree damage was greatest near the agricultural field edge in all three plots, especially among large trees and in B3yr. Trunk snapping (70%) and uprooting (20%) were the most common modes of tree damage and mortality, with the height of trunk failure on the burned plots often corresponding with the height of historical fire scars. Of the windstorm-damaged trees, 80% (B1yr), 90% (B3yr), and 57% (Control) were dead 4 years later. Trees that had crown damage experienced the least mortality (22%-60%), followed by those that were snapped (55%-94%) and uprooted (88%-94%). Synthesis. We demonstrate the synergistic effects of three kinds of disturbances on a tropical forest. Our results show that the effects of windstorms are exacerbated by prior degradation by fire and fragmentation. We highlight that understorey fires can produce long-lasting effects on tropical forests not only by directly killing trees but also by increasing tree vulnerability to wind damage due to fire scars and a more open canopy.

The ovule bet-hedging hypothesis proposes compensation for stochastic pollination via ovule oversupply in flowers allowing the benefits of windfall pollination events to be reaped. Under this hypothesis, ovule number is expected to increase from tree line upward on high mountains characterized by steep declines in flower visitation rates and increasingly more variable pollination. Ovule/floret number was investigated for a total of 174 simple-flowered and pseudanthial species in the central Chilean Andes (2,100-3,650 m.a.s.l.). Phylogenetic reconstruction was undertaken using ITS sequences and a constrained ordinal-level backbone reflecting the APG-IV topology. Ovule/floret number was modelled with ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and phylogenetic generalized least squares regression (PGLS) with elevation, floral biomass, life history, pollinator efficiency, pollination generalization, and seasonal flowering period as explanatory variables. The best performing OLS and PGLS models for simple-flowered species consistently included vegetation belt and floral biomass, and with PGLS, pollination efficiency and flowering period. For pseudanthial species, explanatory variables were always floral biomass and its interaction with elevation. Effects of life history and generalized pollination was not found. Ovule/floret number showed high phylogenetic signal, increased with floral biomass and was generally higher in the upper alpine belt in both floral categories. Simple-flowered species with efficient pollination and flowering early, respectively, had larger ovule numbers. Synthesis. Ovule number increases with elevation in the central Chilean alpine in two separate floral groups independently of some effects of flowering period and pollinator efficiency. Greater disparity in pollen deposition on stigmas than with inefficient pollination under low visitation rates might explain the association between efficient pollination and higher ovule numbers. Our study provides the first empirical evidence for ovule bet-hedging in the alpine environment. Future studies on the ovule bet-hedging hypothesis should include a measure of flower size.

Vegetation type, spatial distance, and environmental variability represent the three main factors shaping the structure of Glomeromycotinan communities. We present here one of the most comprehensive reports on Glomeromycotinan community structure in forest ecosystems, covering five ecosystem types. We explored the extent to which the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity is confounded by the respective latitudinal gradient of host plants and how Glomeromycotinan communities diverge with spatial distance and environmental variability. We show that latitudinal differences in Glomeromycotinan alpha- and beta-diversity are largely shaped by the zonation patterns of ecosystem types and that differences among Glomeromycotinan communities occurring in different ecosystems are considerably larger than those occurring within the same ecosystem type. In contrast, we could observe little to no differences in phylogenetic community structure across samples, irrespective of their origin. In conclusion, several community assembly rules for Glomeromycotina in the woody systems, such as phylogenetic relationships, differed from those in grassland systems. Synthesis. We provide strong evidence that the latitudinal gradient in Glomeromycotinan diversity in woody systems is mainly driven by latitudinal differences in forest habitat types. Further exploring the causes of these differences across habitat types would probably reveal underexplored facets of the ecology of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Such inferences, however, have typically depended on assembly theories that assume competitive equilibrium and that are species based. In reality, all natural communities are dynamic, particularly during the course of succession, and the ecological interactions which drive phylogenetic community structure actually occur among neighbouring individuals rather than species. To bridge this gap between theory and reality, we examine how colonisation, competition, and consequent replacement of individuals translate into phylogenetic community structure by using an individual-based model. The model we use assumes a trade-off between competition and colonisation abilities and that the points where species fall on the trade-off curve are phylogenetically conserved. We find that the phylogenetic alpha diversity of a given community will be equal to or greater than the null expectation generated by randomly drawing individuals from communities at the same time step (i.e. phylogenetic overdispersion). This pattern results from the combination of interspecific differences in colonisation ability and neighbourhood competition that lead to individuals being regularly distributed in two-dimensional space. We also show that phylogenetic beta diversity increases with increasing temporal differences between two communities. However, when this positive relationship is analysed only among the communities at close time steps, it becomes insignificant as they approach competitive equilibrium. We find similar patterns for functional alpha and beta diversity when phylogeny is replaced with functional traits. Synthesis. Though questions concerning community assembly have often been spatially framed, our model shows that the span of the time frame can also affect, or even reverse, inferences about assembly processes. Our model also implies that a shift in the frame of reference from species to individuals brings a new perspective to community assembly. Careful consideration of non-equilibrium and individual-level aspects provides better insights into the consequences of the evolutionary and functional similarities of individuals on community assembly.

Theory predicts that abiotic conditions and the competitive make-up of resident communities jointly shape invader fitness, limiting the phenotypic identity of successful invaders. We use an invasion experiment to ask how competitive traits of 20 introduced plant species alter their absolute fitness in fragments that differ in size, abiotic conditions, and traits of the resident community. We show that abiotic conditions interact with both invader traits and resident functional diversity to determine invader survival. Optimal invader traits depended on the soil characteristics, while greater resident trait diversity lowered invader fitness and had especially strong effects in low-resource environments. Unlike other abiotic conditions, fragment size had consistent effects irrespective of invader identity, decreasing survival in larger fragments. Synthesis. Our results illustrate how the abiotic environment mediates the effects of resident and invader traits on establishment, creating fitness landscapes that structure local diversity and the functional identities of successful species.

However, direct constraints of low temperature on tissue formation may superimpose effects of low nutrient availability. We examined growth responses of two tree (Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata) and two dwarf shrub species (Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium gaultherioides) to 12 years of moderate fertilizer addition (NPK applied at a rate of 15 and 30 kg nitrogen ha(-1) a(-1)) along an elevation gradient within the treeline ecotone in the Swiss Alps (2,083 to 2,225 m a.s.l.). We measured annual top- and side-shoot increments as well as stem ring width in trees and shoot increments in dwarf shrubs. Fertilizer addition increased soil nutrient availability, indicated by enhanced soil extractable N, higher concentrations of N, P and K in leaves and higher foliar delta N-15. Fertilizer addition stimulated annual growth of all four species: by 11%-20% for L. decidua and 15%-36% for P. uncinata (depending on trait) and by 8%-16% for the two dwarf shrub species. Growth stimulation by the higher fertilizer dose was not significantly stronger than by the lower dose (except for V. gaultherioides), suggesting an overall low nutrient demand for growth and saturation at a rather low nutrient input. Synthesis. Even slightly enhanced nutrient availability can stimulate growth of trees and dwarf shrubs in an alpine treeline ecosystem. Ongoing atmospheric nutrient deposition, in conjunction with global warming, may accelerate plant growth at the treeline.

While Darwin's naturalization hypothesis predicts a positive relationship, the preadaptation hypothesis predicts a negative relationship. Rigorous tests of this now so-called Darwin's naturalization conundrum require not only information on establishment successes but also of failures, which is frequently not available. Such essential information, however, can be provided by experimental introductions. Here, we analysed three datasets from two field experiments in Germany and Switzerland. In the Swiss experiment, alien and native grassland species were introduced as seeds only with and without disturbance (tilling). In the German experiment, alien and native grassland species were introduced both as seeds and as seedlings with and without disturbance (tilling) and with and without fungicide application. For the seedling-introduction experiment, there was an additional herbivore-exclusion treatment. Phylogenetic distance affected establishment in the three datasets differently, with success peaking at intermediate distances for the seed datasets, but decreasing with increasing distances in the seedling dataset. Disturbance favoured seedling survival, most likely by weakening the resident community. Synthesis. By analysing experimental introductions, we show that the relationship between phylogenetic distance and establishment, at least for seedling emergence, may actually be nonlinear with an optimum at intermediate distances. Therefore, Darwin's naturalization hypothesis and the preadaptation hypothesis need not be in conflict. Rather, the mechanisms underlying them can operate simultaneously or alternately depending on the life stage and on the environmental conditions of the resident community.

Because the two hypotheses are inherently linked, the mechanisms underlying them may interact in driving the invasion success. Even so, these links and interactions have not been explicitly disentangled in one experimental study before. To disentangle the links between the two hypotheses, we used 36 native grassland herbs to create greenhouse mesocosms with 90 grassland communities of different diversities, and introduced each of five herbaceous alien species as seeds and seedlings. We used phylogeny and four functional traits (plant height, specific leaf area, leaf size, and seed mass) to calculate different measures of phylogenetic and functional distance and diversity. Specifically, we tested how the alien-native distance (phylogenetic or functional) and the native diversity (phylogenetic or functional) affected each other in their effects on germination, seedling survival, growth, and reproduction of the aliens. Overall, our results supported both hypotheses. Multivariate functional distance based on four traits jointly had stronger positive effects than phylogenetic distance and the univariate ones based on each trait separately. Moreover, the aliens were more successful if they were more competitive by being taller and having larger leaves with a lower SLA than the native residents. Univariate functional diversity based on each trait separately had stronger negative effects than phylogenetic and multivariate functional diversity. Most importantly, we found that the effects of alien-native phylogenetic and multivariate functional distance became stronger as diversity increased. Our analyses with single traits also showed that the strength of the effects of both alien-native hierarchical functional distances (indicative of competitive inequalities) and absolute functional distances (indicative of niche differences) increased at higher diversities, where competition is more severe. Synthesis. Our study explicitly demonstrates for the first time how the mechanisms underlying the two classical invasion hypotheses interact in driving invasion success in grassland communities. This may help to explain some of the puzzling results of studies testing either of the two hypotheses.

However, the lack of a long-term (millennial) perspective on tree line shifts in the Pyrenees prevents understanding the underlying ecosystem dynamics and processes. We combine multiproxy palaeoecological analyses (fossil pollen, spores, conifer stomata, plant macrofossils, and ordination) from an outstanding ice cave deposit located in the alpine belt c. 200 m above current tree line (Armena-A294 Ice Cave, 2,238 m a.s.l.), to assess for the first time in the Pyrenees, tree line dynamics, and ecosystem resilience to climate changes 5,700-2,200 (cal.) years ago. The tree line ecotone was located at the cave altitude from 5,700 to 4,650 cal year bp, when vegetation consisted of open Pinus uncinata Ramond ex DC and Betula spp. Woodlands and timberline were very close to the site. Subsequently, tree line slightly raised and timberline reached the ice cave altitude, exceeding its today's uppermost limit by c. 300-400 m during more than four centuries (4,650 and 4,200 cal year bp) at the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum. After 4,200 cal year bp, alpine tundra communities dominated by Dryas octopetala L. expanded while tree line descended, most likely as a consequence of the Neoglacial cooling. Prehistoric livestock raising likely reinforced climate cooling impacts at 3,450-3,250 cal year bp. Finally, a tree line ecotone developed around the cave that was on its turn replaced by alpine communities during the past 2,000 years. Synthesis. The long-term Pyrenean tree line ecotone sensitivity suggests that rising temperatures will trigger future P. uncinata and Betula expansions to higher elevations, replacing arctic-alpine plant species. Climate change is causing the rapid melting of the cave ice; rescue investigations would be urgently needed to exploit its unique ecological information.

Whether trait correlations can be aggregated to "spectra" or "leading dimensions," whether these dimensions are consistent across plant organs, spatial scale, and growth forms are still open questions. To illustrate the current state of knowledge, we constructed a network of published trait correlations associated with the "leaf economics spectrum," "biomass allocation dimension," "seed dimension," and carbon and nitrogen concentrations. This literature-based network was compared to a network based on a dataset of 23 traits from 2,530 individuals of 126 plant species from 381 plots in Northwest Europe. The observed network comprised more significant correlations than the literature-based network. Network centrality measures showed that size traits such as the mass of leaf, stem, below-ground, and reproductive tissues and plant height were the most central traits in the network, confirming the importance of allometric relationships in herbaceous plants. Stem mass and stem-specific length were "hub" traits correlated with most traits. Environmental selection of hub traits may affect the whole phenotype. In contrast to the literature-based network, SLA and leaf N were of minor importance. Based on cluster analysis and subsequent PCAs of the resulting trait clusters, we found a "size" module, a "seed" module, two modules representing C and N concentrations in plant organs, and a "partitioning" module representing organ mass fractions. A module representing the plant economics spectrum did not emerge. Synthesis. Although we found support for several trait dimensions, the observed trait network deviated significantly from current knowledge, suggesting that previous studies have overlooked trait coordination at the whole-plant level. Furthermore, network analysis suggests that stem traits have a stronger regulatory role in herbaceous plants than leaf traits.

Thus, we do not know whether the same forces also shape the phenotypic variability of bryophytes. Here, we assess how environmental gradients and trade-offs shape functional traits and subsequently ecosystem processes for peat mosses (Sphagnum), a globally important plant genus for carbon accumulation. We used piecewise Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to understand how environmental gradients influence vital processes across levels of biological organization. We gathered data on functional traits for 15 globally important Sphagnum species covering a wide range of ecological preferences. Phenotypes lie along well-established axes of the plant economic spectrum characterizing trade-offs between vital physiological functions. Using SEM, we clarified the mechanisms of trait covariation and scaling to ecosystem processes. We tested whether peat mosses, like vascular plants, constrain trait variability between a fast turnover strategy based on resource acquisition via fast traits and processes, and a strategy of resource conservation, via slow traits and processes. We parameterized a process-based model estimating ecosystem processes linking environmental drivers with architectural and functional traits. In our SEM approach the amount of variance explained varied substantially (0.29 <= R-2 <= 0.82) among traits and processes in Sphagnum, and the model could predict some of them with high to intermediate accuracy for an independent dataset. R-2 variability was mainly explained by traits and species identity, and poorly by environmental filtering. Some Sphagnum species avoid the stress caused by periodic desiccation in hollows via resource acquisition based on fast photosynthesis and growth, while other species are adapted to grow high above the water-table on hummocks by slow physiological traits and processes to conserve resources. Synthesis.We contribute to a unified theory generating individual fitness, canopy dynamics and ecosystem processes from trait variation. As for vascular plants, the functional traits in the Sphagnum economic spectrum are linked into an integrated phenotypic network partly filtered by the environment and shaped by trade-offs in resource acquisition and conservation.

However, it is unclear how species distributions are shaped by demographic responses to soil water availability. Specifically, it remains unknown how growth affects species distributions along water availability gradients relative to mortality. We quantified spatial variation in dry season soil water potential (SWP) in the moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to evaluate relationships between demographic responses of naturally regenerating seedlings to SWP (RGRs and first-year mortality) and species distributions along the SWP gradient for 62 species. We also tested whether species that were more abundant at the wet or dry end of the gradient performed better (a) at their "home end" of the gradient ("best at home" hypothesis) and (b) "at home" compared to co-occurring species ("home advantage" hypothesis). Four and five species responded significantly to SWP in terms of growth or mortality respectively. Growth (but not mortality) responses were positively related to species distributions along the SWP gradient; species with a more positive (negative) growth response to SWP were more abundant at higher (lower) SWP, that is, at wetter (drier) sites. In addition, wet distributed species grew faster on the wet end of the SWP gradient than on the dry end ("best at home") and grew faster on the wet end than dry distributed species ("home advantage"). Mortality rates declined with seedling size for all species. Thus, seedling growth responses to SWP indirectly shaped local species distributions by influencing seedling size and thereby mortality risk. Synthesis. By demonstrating how growth responses to spatial variation in soil water availability affect species distributions, we identified a demographic process underlying niche differentiation on hydrological gradients in tropical forests. Recognizing the role of these growth responses in shaping species distributions should improve the understanding of tropical forest composition and diversity along rainfall gradients and with climate change.

Reproductive traits as predictors of assembly chronosequence patterns in epiphyllous bryophyte metacommunities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						beta diversity; determinants of plant community structure; dispersal; functional traits; liverworts; phyllosphere; rainforest	RAIN-FOREST; METAPOPULATION DYNAMICS; DISPERSAL; COMMUNITIES; SUCCESSION; LIVERWORTS; ABUNDANCE; RARITY; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY	Understanding the mechanisms underlying species assembly is a central focus of plant ecology and is crucial to revealing how plant communities are structured. However, the temporal limitations of most terrestrial plant communities preclude collection of species assembly data in a tractable time-frame. The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of dispersal potential, as estimated by interspecific variation in sexual and asexual expression, as a predictor of patch chronosequence assembly for epiphyllous (leaf-inhabiting) bryophytes. Secondarily, we investigate whether spatiotemporal patterns in patch turnover and compositional variation infer evidence of local (within-patch) population processes. The frequency and distribution of 55 epiphyllous bryophytes across five leaf age classes were studied on an understorey shrub Piper grande (Piperaceae) in premontane Panamanian tropical forest. Logistical models were used to test whether interspecific variation in dispersal-related life-history traits predicts assembly order. Beta diversity and ordination analyses were employed to examine nestedness vs. turnover, and probe for repeatable patterns in patch chronosequence assembly, respectively. Our results emphasize the importance of dispersal potential on species assembly patterns as earlier arrivals exhibit greater probabilities of sexual and specialized asexual expression. High turnover coupled with temporal convergence in species composition also points to evidence of within-patch biotic filtering. Synthesis. Epiphylls are locally diverse in humid tropical forests worldwide; however, the mechanisms which maintain their high local diversity are unknown. This study suggests that interspecific variation in dispersal capacity in combination with diffuse indirect effects is the principal contributor to the high alpha-diversity of these ephemeral metacommunities.

However, plant quality may also be crucial in mediating herbivore interspecific interactions. This is especially true when competition occurs between distantly related herbivore species, given that small terrestrial herbivores (e.g., insect herbivores) appear to be more sensitive to alterations of plant quality than plant quantity. In this study, we first tested in the field whether large vertebrate herbivores (cattle Bos taurus) exerted a negative effect on smaller insect herbivores (grasshopper Euchorthippus unicolor) through their overlapping foraging preferences for a dominant grass Leymus chinensis. We measured changes in grass quantity, grass quality, and microclimatic conditions in response to vertebrate grazing and conducted additional manipulative studies in the field and the laboratory to identify potential mechanisms underlying the interaction. Our results showed that grazing by large herbivores caused a significant decline in grasshopper population density and individual performance (survival, size, and weight of both female and male E. unicolor), despite a 38% increase in grass nitrogen (N) content in grazed plots. Experiments manipulating N levels of L. chinensis in the field and the laboratory confirmed that enriching plant N had a negative effect on grasshopper individual performance and population size. Therefore, enhanced quality (N content) of plant resources appears to be an important driver in mediating the negative effect of vertebrate grazing on grasshoppers. Synthesis. We document that phylogenetic relatedness and trait similarity can be poor predictors of interaction strength in some cases, since distantly related herbivores of disparate size can interact indirectly via changes in plant quality. Counter-intuitively, the observed negative effect of cattle on grasshoppers was mediated, at least in part, by an increase in plant quality in cattle grazed areas. The implication is that light to moderate grazing, a common management strategy, may contribute to suppression of grasshoppers in the Eurasian steppe grassland system by altering plant nutrient supplies.

Climate and leaf traits, not latitude, explain variation in plant-herbivore interactions across a species' range	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						biogeography; functional traits; Garry oak; herbivory; plant-herbivore interactions; plant-insect interactions; species ranges	DEFENSE; GRADIENTS; PRESSURE; PATTERNS; IMPACTS; HABITAT; MODELS; ISLAND	Spatial variation in abiotic and biotic factors creates local contexts that influence the intensity of plant-herbivore interactions. Some previous studies have accounted for the complexity of these interactions with latitudinal clines, while the absence of such clines in many other systems suggests other, often unknown, local community factors may instead explain the variation in herbivory across populations. We investigated plant-herbivore interactions across the entire range of a long-lived tree (Quercus garryana), evaluating the relative importance of climate, latitude, population size, and insect feeding guilds in determining leaf phenotype and the extent and variation in insect herbivory. In this ecosystem, rain shadows create a nonlinear relationship between climate and latitude, allowing us to disentangle the effects of environmental factors. By performing similar analyses on trees grown in a common garden, we were able to assess the relative importance of environmental factors to leaf defence traits and herbivory. Total herbivory varied significantly among populations, and was best explained by variation in spring precipitation, leaf traits, and tree population size, but not latitude. The relative importance of each of these factors changed over the growing season and with insect feeding guild. Conversely, damage in the common garden did not vary among trees from different origins when grown in a constant environment, leading us to believe variation in damage in natural populations is more likely the result of the local environments. Leaf traits (trichome density and specific leaf area) varied significantly among populations, but neither showed an effect of latitude. Variation in both traits was best explained by tree size, and seasonal temperatures or precipitation. We found no variation in insect diversity among field populations, but abundance varied with mean summer precipitation and population size. Synthesis. Seasonal precipitation consistently explained the geographical variation in the extent of herbivory to Q. garryana, while latitude and winter temperatures, factors that are commonly associated with latitudinal gradients in the intensity of species interactions, did not. Our findings highlight the importance of local climates and functional traits in shaping biotic interactions and intraspecific variation in plant-insect interactions across large spatial scales.

Here, we investigated whether the magnitude of plant inbreeding depression increases under herbivory as a result of diminished leaf metabolic responses to herbivory in inbreds, which entails increased herbivore growth and feeding damage. We additionally explored whether genetic differentiation among native and invasive plant populations impacts the magnitude and direction of these inbreeding x herbivory interactions. Inbred and outbred plants from eight European (native) and eight North American (invasive) populations of Silene latifolia were exposed to two consecutive control or herbivory treatments (infestation with larvae of Mamestra brassicae). After the first treatment, leaf metabolic responses to herbivory were assessed with untargeted metabolic fingerprinting using UHPLC-ESI+-QTOF-MS/MS. After the second herbivory treatment, herbivore growth and plant feeding damage were assessed. Moreover, plant performance traits were recorded 4 weeks after the second herbivory treatment. Metabolic fingerprinting revealed that changes in the pool sizes of various metabolic features in response to herbivory were less intense in inbred than outbred plants from native and invasive populations. While herbivore growth and feeding damage were largely unaffected by plant breeding status in invasive populations, herbivores consumed more biomass from, but showed reduced growth on, inbred than outbred native plants. The magnitude of inbreeding depression in plant performance traits was not affected by herbivory. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that inbreeding compromises herbivory-induced metabolic defences in S. latifolia, and simultaneously reduces the nutritional quality of plants. The magnitude and direction of these inbreeding effects were shaped by genetic differentiation among native and invasive plants. These range-specific responses provide novel insights into the role of inbreeding x herbivory interactions in invasion success.

While drought-induced reductions in grassland primary productivity are well documented, the drivers behind drought resistance (the capacity to withstand change) and recovery (the capacity for recovery of function) of above- and below-ground biomass remain poorly understood. Across eight grasslands differing in plant community productivity (CP), we investigated the effects of summer drought on plant and soil microbial variables, plant nutrient content, and soil nitrogen (N) availability. We examined the linkages between CP, soil N, drought responses of plant and microbial communities, and relative drought responses of plant and microbial biomass. Plant and microbial variables were recorded at the end of a 3-month rainfall exclusion period. Plant variables were also assessed during a 10-month drought recovery period. Experimental drought decreased plant biomass and increased plant C:N ratios, but had no effect on total microbial biomass across sites. Instead, drought caused shifts in plant and microbial community structures as well as an increase in arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi biomass. Overall, plant biomass drought resistance was unrelated to CP or microbial community structure but was positively related to drought resistance of forbs. In the month after rewetting, soil N availability increased in droughted plots across sites. Two months post-rewetting, droughted plots had higher plant N concentration, but lower plant N use efficiency. The short-term drought recovery of plant biomass was unrelated to CP or soil N availability, but positively related to the response of grass biomass, reflecting incomplete recovery at high CP. Ten months after rewetting, drought effects on plant biomass and plant N content were no longer apparent. Synthesis. Our results suggest that drought resistance and recovery are more sensitive to plant community composition than to community productivity. Short-term recovery of plant biomass may also benefit from increased soil N availability after drought and from a high abundance of soil fungi in low productivity sites.

Below-ground plant traits influence tundra plant acquisition of newly thawed permafrost nitrogen	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Alaska; isotope N-15; moist acidic tundra; mycorrhizae; roots; shrub expansion	ARCTIC TUNDRA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SPECIES COMPOSITION; ALASKAN TUNDRA; CARBON BALANCE; SOIL; GROWTH; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL	The release of permafrost-derived nitrogen (N) has the potential to fertilize tundra vegetation, which in turn may stimulate productivity and thus offset carbon (C) losses from thawing permafrost. Below-ground plant traits may mediate ecosystem response to permafrost thaw and associated feedbacks to the atmosphere by differentially conferring access to deep, newly thawed permafrost N. Yet, identifying roots and quantifying root N uptake from deep, cold soils in complex plant communities has proved challenging to date. We investigated plant acquisition of experimentally added N-15 isotope tracer applied at the permafrost boundary in graminoid- and shrub-dominated tundra at Eight Mile Lake, Alaska, when the thaw front was close to its maximum depth, simulating the release of newly thawed permafrost N. We used molecular tools to verify species and estimate biomass, nitrogen, and isotope pools. Root biomass depth distributions follow an asymptotic relationship with depth, typical of other ecosystems. Few species had roots occurring close to the thaw front. Rubus chamaemorus, a short-statured non-mycorrhizal forb, and Carex bigelowii, a sedge, consistently had the deepest roots. Twenty-four hours after isotope addition, we observed that deep-rooted, non-mycorrhizal species had the highest N-15 enrichment values in their fine root tissue indicating that they access deep N late in the growing season when the thaw front is deepest. Deep-rooted plants are therefore able to immediately take up newly thawed permafrost-derived N. During the following growing season, herbaceous, non-mycorrhizal plants allocated tracer above-ground before woody, mycorrhizal plants. Ectomycorrhizal deciduous and ericoid mycorrhizal evergreen shrubs, by contrast, did not have immediate access to the deep N tracer and assimilated it into new foliar tissue gradually over the following growing season. Synthesis. Graminoids and forbs that have immediate access to deep N represent a modest C sink compared to C emissions from thawing permafrost. However, the effects of deep N fertilization on shrubs over longer time-scales may stimulate productivity and account for a more considerable N and C sink, thus constraining the permafrost C-climate feedback.

Nitrogen recycling in coupled green and brown food webs: Weak effects of herbivory and detritivory when nitrogen passes through soil	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Above-ground-below-ground interactions; detritivory; ecosystem model; herbivory; litter decomposition; nitrogen cycling; old field; plant-soil (below-ground) interactions; soil organic matter	TROPHIC CASCADES; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PLANTS; CARBON; STOICHIOMETRY; POPULATION; INVERTEBRATES; ACCELERATION; CONVERGENCE	The study of coupled green and brown food webs has improved our ability to understand how nutrient cycling and plant communities respond to perturbations. Yet, it is still difficult to predict how rapidly and consistently changes in one food web propagate to the other. An area of particular uncertainty is the response of plants to the changes in leaf litter nitrogen release caused by herbivores and detritivores. We combined a field experiment and theoretical analysis to assess how herbivory, fertilization, and detritivory changed leaf litter nitrogen release and plant growth. We produced leaf litter in greenhouse cages with a factorial combination of grasshopper herbivory and additional nitrogen fertilizer. Our experiment used the resulting N-15-labelled leaf litter to measure isopod litter consumption, litter nitrogen release, and plant nitrogen uptake in the field. We then used a dynamical systems model to distinguish whether plant growth relied (a) directly on litter nitrogen release or (b) on other nitrogen pathways so that changes in litter nitrogen release have little immediate impact. Our empirical results show that the effect of nitrogen fertilization on isopod processing of leaf litter was stronger than the effect of herbivory. Regardless, the available soil nitrogen and plant growth were independent of litter nitrogen release. Our dynamical model attributes the independence to other nitrogen sources and sinks, which buffer the plant-available nitrogen pool. Isopods and litter with a history of herbivory reduced above-ground plant growth when we accounted for initial field mesocosm conditions, especially the abundance of the competitively dominant goldenrods. Consequently, the impact of isopods and litter traits do propagate to influence plant growth, but do not have a large enough effect to overcome initial differences in plant biomass and community composition in one year. Synthesis. Our results indicate animals in green and brown food webs can alter plant litter nitrogen release without any significant nutrient recycling effect on plant growth. Considering the availability of external and soil-based nitrogen sources, as well as the current plant community and microbial biomass, may be critical to determining when plant growth will respond to animal-mediated changes in litter decomposition.

Foraging guppies can compensate for low-light conditions, but not via a sensory switch	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensory plasticity; Environmental change; Foraging behaviour; Compensatory plasticity; Learning	THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS; SENSITIVE PERIODS; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; FATHEAD MINNOWS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; GREAT TITS; TURBIDITY; PLASTICITY; CONSEQUENCES; HABITUATION	Animals can adapt to changes in their environment through behavioural or developmental plasticity, but studies of these responses tend to focus on either short-term exposure of adults to the changed conditions, or long-term exposure of juveniles. Juvenile guppies Poecilia reticulata reared in low-light environments have previously been shown to make a sensory switch to using olfactory, rather than visual, cues in foraging. It is not clear whether this compensatory sensory plasticity is limited to juveniles, or whether longer term exposure allows adults to similarly adapt. We investigated how adult guppies that were exposed to light or dark environments for 2 and 4weeks responded to visual, olfactory and a combination of both food cues, in both dark- and light-test environments. We found that after 2weeks of exposure, adult guppies were better able to locate a food cue in light test environments regardless of their exposure environment. After 4weeks, however, guppies were more successful at locating the food cue in the environment they had been exposed to, suggesting that dark-exposed guppies adapted their behaviour in response to their environment. We found that foraging was most successful when both visual and olfactory cues were available and least successful in the presence of olfactory cues, suggesting that the mechanism behind the change in success for dark-exposed guppies was not due to increased reliance on, or sensory switch to olfactory cues.

Habitat use and hybridisation between the Rocky Mountain sculpin (Cottus sp.) and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						aquatic conservation; hybrid zone; mixed-effects models; species-at-risk; symmetric mating	FRESH-WATER FISHES; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; CUTTHROAT TROUT; LIFE-HISTORY; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; BIODIVERSITY; INFERENCE; MODELS	Anthropogenic factors such as land-use change, pollution, and climate change can cause fragmentation and reduce the amount of habitat by altering preferred conditions. This process can also bring about novel species interactions and, in some cases, create or alter levels of hybridisation between closely related species. We assessed the threat of hybridisation to the persistence of the Rocky Mountain sculpin (Cottus sp.) and the slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) in the Flathead River, British Columbia, Canada. Individuals collected from 95 sites provided 731 genetic samples that were genotyped at 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci and mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase sequences, to assess: (a) if there are differences in the distribution of Rocky Mountain sculpin between contemporary and historical (35 years ago) records, (b) if hybridisation is symmetrical in terms of sex-specific parental contributions, and (c) if habitat preferences contribute to the distribution of pure parental and hybrid populations. We identified three hybrid locations and that Rocky Mountain sculpin have an altitudinal distribution (1,200-1,902 m) that exceeds the range limit reported 35 years ago (1,200-1,372 m). Additionally, hybrid mating appears to involve similar proportions of parents of both sexes from each species. Lastly, elevation, turbidity, and sediment type are significant factors predicting the presence of parental species. Further, elevation and water conductivity are significant factors to predicting hybrid presence. The contrasting associations of parental species with different habitat types appear to influence the extent and distribution of hybridisation. Our results suggest that Rocky Mountain sculpin (a species of conservation concern) do not appear to be at risk due to hybridisation, but that this is a system in flux. Given the importance of environmental conditions to hybridisation, there is a need to quantify how environmental changes may disrupt current hybridisation and potential population viability.

Watershed-level brook trout genetic structuring: Evaluation and application of riverscape genetics models	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						barriers; connectivity; fragmentation; landscape genetics; Salvelinus fontinalis; stream	ISOLATION-BY-DISTANCE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; LANDSCAPE GENETICS; BULL TROUT; ATLANTIC SALMON; LAND-USE; STREAM; DIVERSITY; FRAGMENTATION; CONSERVATION	Stream connectivity promotes resilience and population viability of aquatic organisms. Landscape genetic approaches, traditionally applied to terrestrial systems, may reveal important watershed-level dynamics that influence connectivity. Additional validation would improve understanding of how the models perform when gene flow is constrained to dendritic networks. The objectives of this study were to use simulations to assess the utility of landscape genetics analyses in dendritic stream networks and investigate riverscape variables influencing gene flow among brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis populations in headwater streams. We used an individual-based simulation program to simulate different dispersal scenarios and used combinations of landscape genetic models, model selection methods, and genetic metrics to determine the best combination for riverscape systems. We also sampled brook trout from 76 headwater streams in two watersheds (c. 1,000 km(2)) in Connecticut, U.S.A. to assess connectivity and riverscape influences on genetic structuring. Gravity models with Bayesian information criterion (BIC) selection were the most accurate (>85%) landscape genetic models that consistently identified the correct simulated gene flow barrier. However, all models performed poorly when unidirectional barriers were simulated without a distance-based dispersal limitation. Excluding this scenario, model accuracy for the gravity models using BIC selection was >90% across multiple genetic metrics, validating the application of landscape genetic models to riverscape systems. We found highly variable levels of brook trout genetic connectivity (F-ST range 0.01-0.19) at the watershed level (5-15 river km). Gravity models identified increases in upstream impervious surfaces and decreases in riparian tree canopy cover as riverscape variables associated with increases in genetic differentiation in one watershed, while the other watershed was consistent with an isolation by distance pattern. In this study we used demogenetic (i.e. combined demographic and genetic) simulations to demonstrate the utility of landscape genetics techniques in dendritic river networks. Our empirical genetic study documented gene flow among headwater populations of brook trout at the watershed level and also suggested connectivity can be limited by watershed development. Incorporating the heterogeneity of riverscapes into connectivity-focused conservation planning is essential to the development of effective restoration actions, and landscape genetics approaches can be useful tools to identify watershed-level connectivity in stream systems.

The effects of multiyear drought are often exacerbated by human water use for consumption, energy production, and agriculture, which, in lentic ecosystems, manifest in reduced lake elevation and altered habitat for aquatic species. Here, we demonstrate that decreasing lake levels, associated with drought and water management, reduce the availability of littoral cobble habitat to fishes by creating an elevation-explicit littoral habitat map. We combined long-term fish catch data and a lake elevation time series with our elevation-explicit littoral habitat map to test whether fish species population demographics are related to drought-driven changes in littoral habitat. We surveyed the littoral zone of Bear Lake, Utah and Idaho, U.S.A., from full pool to a depth of >12 m, totalling 94.86 km(2) surveyed. As lake elevation decreased >6 m from full pool to the lowest historical elevation, the area of littoral cobble decreased by >97%. Bear Lake sculpin (Cottus extensus, Cottidae), a cold-water fish species which relies on cobble for reproduction, catch per unit effort decreased by >75% with littoral cobble, and year class strength declined by as much as 86%, but varied across age. We predicted the response of age-0 to age-4 sculpin under high and low cobble availability. Our simulations predict a 60%-85% decline in juvenile sculpin CPUE (age-2 and younger) when cobble availability decreases from the 95th to 5th percentile. Our study provided a unique opportunity to identify quantitative linkages between climate-driven littoral habitat loss and an ecologically important profundal fish species, expanding our understanding of potential future pathways through which climate change may affect lentic ecosystems and fishes.

In this study, we analysed stream fish beta-diversity based on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic facets in an intensively cultivated tropical region. We sampled 43 stream reaches in the northwest of Sao Paulo State, south-eastern Brazil. Each sampling site was characterised according to catchment-scale features, landscape dynamic indicators, local-scale features, and distance between stream reaches as network distance (a proxy for dispersal processes). As response variables, we considered taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic beta-diversities coupled with a null-model approach. For each beta-diversity metric, we calculated the mean overall value and tested whether the mean value was different from that expected by chance. To examine variation in beta-diversity for the three facets and determine the relative contributions of predictor variables, we used a distance-based approach. Taxonomic and functional beta-diversities were higher from the expected value under a null model, suggesting that community assembly of these facets was dominated by deterministic processes. In contrast, phylogenetic beta-diversity was not different from that expected by chance, suggesting that the lineage composition of these assemblages was random. Furthermore, for all three facets, there was a positive environment-beta-diversity relationship that was determined primarily by local-scale features, whereas catchment features and landscape dynamic indicators were not important. In addition, none of the beta-diversity facets was correlated with stream network distance, indicating that dispersal processes were not strongly structuring fish assemblages. Our study suggested that although multiple facets of stream fish beta-diversity are ruled mainly by deterministic processes (e.g. species sorting), stochasticity is also important in community assembly. An interesting finding was the mismatch between phylogenetic versus taxonomic and functional beta-diversity. It is likely that the lack of non-random structure in phylogenetic beta-diversity is due to the variation of phylogenetic signal in some functional traits. Given that landscape dynamic indicators were not correlated with measures of beta-diversity, we suggest that the recent sugarcane expansion in our study area probably has not critically affected stream fish beta-diversity. Also, it is possible that catchment variables presented little variability and did not overwhelm the effect of local environmental variables on beta-diversity. In conclusion, our study suggests that even highly disturbed tropical agroecosystems with a pool of species that is probably decimated, can still display a relatively high beta-diversity determined mainly by species sorting. These findings suggest key environmental features that must be considered in restoration or conservation of beta-diversity in agroecosystems. Specifically, since variation in beta-diversity was explained mainly by local-scale environmental gradients, conservation schemes would ideally protect enough sites to capture this entire gradient. Overall, the knowledge of multiple facets can foment more effective conservation and restoration actions by providing a more comprehensive view of the structuring factors of assemblages.

Multi-faceted impacts of native and invasive alien decapod species on freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						Austropotamobius pallipes; crayfish; Eriocheir sinensis; mesocosm; Pacifastacus leniusculus	CRAYFISH PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS; INTRODUCED SIGNAL CRAYFISH; CHINESE MITTEN CRAB; NOBLE CRAYFISH; MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; STREAM; METABOLISM; PREDATORS	Changes to species composition, such as biological invasions and extinctions, have the potential to alter ecosystems. Invaders often replace taxonomically similar species, resulting in potentially redundant impacts. For example, freshwater decapod crustaceans are pervasive invasive alien species but they often extirpate native decapods. This study addresses whether or not these compositional shifts lead to impacts on the structure of the macroinvertebrate community, key ecosystem functions such as decomposition rates and primary productivity, and freshwater properties such as turbidity. In a controlled outdoor mesocosm experiment that ran for 33 days, impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and properties were compared between a native, endangered crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) and two invasive alien decapods: the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus and crab Eriocheir sinensis. Equal densities of these decapod species were compared between mesocosms, with a replicated array of decapod free controls. Measurements included macroinvertebrate densities, decomposition of leaf litter, production of biofilms, plankton, macrophytes, gross primary productivity, turbidity, and dissolved nutrients. While taxonomic richness of non-decapod macroinvertebrates was marginally higher in the invasive alien treatments, differences in Shannon diversity were negligible, and beta-diversity was higher for the invasive alien crab. Gastropod density was reduced in the benthos of invasive alien treatments. This was associated with increased primary productivity of periphyton, particularly in the presence of P. leniusculus. Increased turbidity was, however, inversely correlated with periphyton primary productivity in the E. sinensis treatment. Nitrate concentration was significantly lower in invasive compared to native crayfish mesocosms, but similar to decapod free controls. This reflects the potential for the invasive crayfish to act as a nitrogen sink, mediated through both enhanced periphyton and reduced nitrogen recycling. Other processes, such as decomposition rates, sediment respiration, community respiration, and gross primary productivity, did not differ between treatments. This study demonstrates impacts of both native and invasive alien decapod species on certain aspects of benthic biodiversity and ecosystem processes, but with many of these parameters unaffected. This assumes equal densities of each species in its environment. The enhanced gastropod predation and associated trophic cascade by invasive decapods are likely explained through higher consumption rates, metabolism and activity. These per-capita impacts are likely to be exacerbated further in-situ due to typically higher densities of invasive compared to native crayfish.

Can environmental flows moderate riparian invasions? The influence of seedling morphology and density on scour losses in experimental floods	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						biogeomorphic feedback; invasive species; plant uprooting; riparian seedlings; river point bar	FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; RIVER; VEGETATION; WATER; ESTABLISHMENT; SALTCEDAR; RESPONSES; TAMARIX; COTTONWOODS; DEPENDENCY	Environmental flow releases are an effective tool to meet multiple management objectives, including maintaining river conveyance, restoring naturally functioning riparian plant communities, and controlling invasive species. In this context, predicting plant mortality during floods remains a key area of uncertainty for both river managers and ecologists, particularly with respect to how flood hydraulics and sediment dynamics interact with the plants' own traits to influence their vulnerability to scour and burial. To understand these processes better, we conducted flume experiments to quantify different plant species' vulnerability to flooding across a range of plant sizes, patch densities, and sediment condition (equilibrium transport versus sediment deficit), using sand-bed rivers in the U.S. southwest as our reference system. We ran 10 experimental floods in a 0.6 m wide flume using live seedlings of cottonwood and tamarisk, which have contrasting morphologies. Sediment supply, plant morphology, and patch composition all had significant impacts on plant vulnerability during floods. Floods under sediment deficit conditions, which typically occur downstream of dams, resulted in bed degradation and a 35% greater risk of plant loss compared to equilibrium sediment conditions. Plants in sparse patches dislodged five times more frequently than in dense patches. Tamarisk plants and patches had greater frontal area, larger basal diameter, longer roots, and lower crown position compared to cottonwood across all seedling heights. These traits were associated with a 75% reduction in tamarisk seedlings' vulnerability to scour compared to cottonwood. Synthesis and applications. Tamarisk's greater survivability helps to explain its vigorous establishment and persistence on regulated rivers where flood magnitudes have been reduced. Furthermore, its documented influence on hydraulics, sediment deposition, and scour patterns in flumes is amplified at larger scales in strongly altered river channels where it has broadly invaded. Efforts to remove riparian vegetation using flow releases to maintain open floodways and/or control the spread of non-native species will need to consider the target plants' size, density, and species-specific traits, in addition to the balance of sediment transport capacity and supply in the river system.

Stream invertebrate diversity reduces with invasion of river banks by non-native plants	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						diversity; Fallopia japonica; Impatiens glandulifera; invasive species; macroinvertebrates	FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS; MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; NATIVE PLANT; IMPACTS; COMMUNITIES; TRAITS; SEDIMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY	Invasion of riparian zones by non-native plants is a global issue and commonly perceived as a challenge for river and fishery managers, but the type and extent of ecological changes induced by such invasions remain poorly understood. Established effects on sediment delivery, allochthonous inputs, and channel shading could potentially alter aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, with implications for in-stream ecological quality. We assessed responses in the diversity, quality, and heterogeneity of stream macroinvertebrate communities to riparian invasion by non-native plants. Macroinvertebrates were collected from 24 sites on low order streams in central and southern Scotland during spring and autumn. The effect of invasive non-native plants (INNP) on macroinvertebrates was assessed relative to that of local physical and chemical factors. Invasive non-native plants cover was associated with stronger effects than other factors on local diversity of macroinvertebrates (33% reduction at the highest INNP cover) but also increased macroinvertebrate abundance across sites. Invaded sites were also associated with lower macroinvertebrate biomonitoring scores. Community composition differed between invaded and uninvaded sites in autumn, but not in spring. However, INNP influence on macroinvertebrate composition was generally secondary to that of physicochemical variables (e.g. channel shade, substrate diversity). We demonstrate that the influence of INNP extends beyond well-known impacts on plant communities to reductions mainly in stream macroinvertebrate diversity. Combined with the negative impact on pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa this raises concerns over the ecological health of streams with heavily invaded riparian zones. Our findings suggest that efforts to improve low order streams by actively managing severe riparian invasions are merited, but the size and uncertainty of the likely ecological gains must also be evaluated against the effort involved.

For obligate aquatic dispersers, river network constraints can be reflected in diversity patterns. Here, we aimed to determine the effects of environmental heterogeneity and spatial connectivity on beta-diversity components. We sampled fish assemblages in 21 sites across a longitudinal gradient. Beta-diversity for taxonomic and functional composition among sites was decomposed into its turnover and nestedness components. We investigated whether environment was more important to functional beta-diversity and spatial factors had a higher contribution to dissimilarity in species composition. Further, we tested whether environmentally homogeneous sites with higher spatial connectivity showed lower compositional changes. We found that spatial factors were more important for taxonomic beta-diversity, whereas environment explained functional dissimilarity among habitats. Although environment and spatial factors contribute to total beta-diversity, they explained different components: while environment explained a higher portion of turnover, spatial factors were related to nestedness. The effects of mere spatial isolation and directional connectivity differed for species and functional beta-diversity and for the components of beta-diversity. Including directionality in spatial connectivity enabled the explanation of a higher proportion of variation of total species beta-diversity and its turnover. Our results suggest that niche and spatial processes may influence differently taxonomic and functional beta-diversity components. Thus, habitat filtering was the primary mechanism affecting functional diversity and species turnover, whereas spatial connectivity drove species nestedness.

Humans have drastically modified freshwater habitats, notably for navigation purposes. Such modifications may reduce food availability for young of the year (YOY) fish and, consequently, influence their ability to reach the adult age. In the Meuse River, decrease of fish abundance is thought to be linked to a drastic reduction of phytoplankton biomass. In this context of decreasing phytoplankton biomass, we studied trophic niches of three cyprinid species (common bleak Alburnus alburnus, chub Squalius cephalus, and roach Rutilus rutilus) and one percid species (European perch Perca fluviatilis) at various stages of development, using stable isotope analysis in order to compare intra- and interspecific competition between sites differing in degree of channelisation. Two reaches of the Meuse River differing by their degree of regulation were investigated. We hypothesised that habitat homogenisation would (1) decrease food resource availability and diversity and (2) increase trophic competition, particularly among earlier ontogenic stages, and promote individual specialisation. Our study provides evidence that in the context of low planktonic biomass, most YOY relied on benthic food sources. Furthermore, the Meuse River flow and depth regulation significantly impacted the abundance and species richness of YOY. In the heavily channelised reach, between-stages competition and low resource diversity lead to an increase in diet partitioning between cyprinid larvae, as well as consumption of non-optimal energetic food sources such as aquatic vegetation by some individuals. By contrast, in the less channelised reach, larvae displayed a generalist feeding habit focusing on high energy content prey such as different taxa of macroinvertebrates, suggesting that the diversity of habitat reduces the food competition within and between stages. Intraspecific resource repartition is a key point for YOY fish having to cope with plankton-depleted conditions. Younger cyprinid stages seem more affected by intra- and inter-specific competition in the more channelised reach. YOY fish communities were also less diversified and abundant in the more altered site, which highlight the importance of limiting channelisation to better conserve fish communities.

The joint investigation of several descriptors of native populations susceptible to invaders, under different invasion contexts, may help in predicting the outcome of their co-occurrence with invasive species. Moreover, empirical studies seldom document the relative importance of the effects of invasive species on native species compared with other factors. Using survey data, we evaluated whether reproduction (larval density) and distribution of breeding sites of three amphibian species (Rana dalmatina, Lissotriton helveticus, and Triturus marmoratus) were related to the presence of invasive red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, compared to other native predators, habitat, and landscape features, in two pond networks that differed in invasion intensity. The red swamp crayfish was only negatively associated with the larval density of one amphibian species studied. Its effect size was similar to that of some native predators, and much smaller than that of the canopy cover of ponds. Amphibians were widespread in the two pond networks. The occupancy of only one species in each network was negatively related to crayfish presence, while the occupancy of all species was negatively related to fish presence. The distribution of amphibian breeding sites was positively associated with aquatic vegetation cover. Negative associations between amphibians and red swamp crayfish were detected only in a few cases, even in the most invaded area, and thus results were less alarming than in previous studies. Differences in ecological traits of native amphibians and interactions with other environmental factors may explain the variable effects of red swamp crayfish on native amphibian populations.

Habitat-specific invertebrate responses to hydrological variability, anthropogenic flow alterations, and hydraulic conditions	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						environmental flows; flow velocity; flow-ecology relationships; Froude number; groundwater abstraction	MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY RESPONSE; GROUNDWATER ABSTRACTION; ECOLOGY RELATIONSHIPS; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; RIVER RESTORATION; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; WATER; STREAM; MANAGEMENT	Quantifying ecological responses to river flow regimes is a key scientific approach underpinning many environmental flow (e-flow) strategies. Incorporating habitat-scale influences (e.g. substrate composition and organic matter cover) within e-flow frameworks has the potential to provide a broader understanding of the causal mechanisms shaping instream communities, which may be used to guide river management strategies. In this study, we examined invertebrate communities inhabiting three distinct habitat groups (HGs-defined by coarse substrates, fine sediments, and the fine-leaved macrophyte Ranunculus sp.) across four rivers (each comprising two study sites) within a single catchment. We tested the structural and functional responses of communities inhabiting different HGs to three sets of flow-related characteristics: (1) antecedent hydrological (discharge-m(3)/s) variability; (2) antecedent anthropogenic flow alterations (percentage of discharge added to or removed from the river by human activity); and (3) proximal hydraulic conditions (characterised by the Froude number). The former two were derived from groundwater model daily time series in the year prior to the collection of each invertebrate sample, while the latter was collected at the point of sampling. While significant effects of hydrological and anthropogenic flow alteration indices were detected, Froude number exerted the greatest statistical influence on invertebrate communities. This highlights that habitat-scale hydraulic conditions to which biota are exposed at the time of sampling are a key influence on the structure and function of invertebrate communities. Mixed-effect models testing invertebrate community responses to flow-related characteristics, most notably Froude number, improved when a HG interaction term was incorporated. This highlights that different mineralogical and organic habitat patches mediate ecological responses to hydraulic conditions. This can be attributed to HGs supporting distinct taxonomic and functional compositions and/or providing unique ecological functions (e.g. flow refuges), which alter how instream communities respond to hydraulic conditions. While the individual importance of both flow and small-scale habitat effects on instream biota has been widely reported, this study provides rare evidence on how their interactive effects have a significant influence on riverine ecosystems. These findings suggest that river management strategies and e-flow frameworks should not only aim to create a mosaic of riverine habitats that support ecosystem functioning, but also consider the management of local hydraulic conditions within habitat patches to support specific taxonomic and functional compositions.

High abundance of an invasive species gives it an outsized ecological role	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						Corbicula; density; ecosystem function; filtration; non-indigenous species	CLAM CORBICULA-FLUMINEA; FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS; ZEBRA MUSSELS; ASIATIC CLAM; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; MASSIVE MORTALITY; POTOMAC RIVER; BIVALVES; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS	Many communities are shifting composition, with losses of native species and increases of non-indigenous species (NIS). At its extreme, such alteration of ecological guilds can result in simplification with a single NIS performing an ecological role once carried out by a suite of natives. This alteration has occurred in many rivers of the south-eastern U.S.A., where the invasive filter-feeding freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea has proliferated following the nearly complete extirpation of native mussels. We investigated the factors controlling the distribution and abundance of Corbicula, as well as estimated the ecological service it provides via water filtration. With a nested design, we surveyed multiple transects within four to six sites within each of four rivers that spanned three large catchments in the Georgia piedmont, collecting data on Corbicula density and physical habitat characteristics associated with its presence. We found Corbicula present in over half of the 1,536 sampled 0.044 m(2) sampled plots, 90 of the 93 transects that spanned the width of the river, and all 1-2 km sample sites, underscoring the clam's ubiquity in the study region. At the river scale, Corbicula densities ranged from 50-212 Corbicula m(-2), although individual sites ranged from 7-483 Corbicula m(-2). Corbicula was more abundant in areas with higher proportions of gravel, and less abundant with higher proportions of bedrock. A hierarchical model with river, site, and these two substrate variables explained 32% of the variation in Corbicula density. Using observed densities and published per capita feeding rates, we calculated system-wide collective filtration rates provided by Corbicula. In the four rivers surveyed and based on estimated residence times for median flows for the summer of 2012, Corbicula is estimated to filter water as many as seven times during median flows and 18 times during minimum flows before water flows out of a 10-km reach. Due to high abundances and per biomass filtration rates, Corbicula plays an important role in these rivers. Invasive species, biotic homogenisation, and the loss of functional redundancy may mean that many more rivers are similar to our studied rivers, with a single, often invasive, species dominating ecosystem function. Understanding the influence of biotic homogenisation on ecosystem function is of foremost importance to evaluate the resilience of natural systems.

Importance of scale, land-use, and stream network properties for riparian plant communities along an urban gradient	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						land-use/land cover; non-native species; riparian vegetation; river network; urban stream syndrome	SPECIES RICHNESS; ECOLOGY; URBANIZATION; LANDSCAPE; PATTERNS; FOREST; FLOW; ASSEMBLAGES; VEGETATION; RESPONSES	Riparian forests along urban streams are affected by flashy hydrological regimes and adjacent upland land-use, and their downstream dynamics are altered by forest fragmentation and by frequent river network truncation. This can lead to lower riparian habitat quality, decreased dispersal along the river network and increased recruitment of novel plant communities including non-native species. Compared to forested landscapes, our understanding of riparian plant community diversity and composition along urban river networks is poor. We investigated riparian plant communities and riparian habitat variables along seven river networks situated along an urban gradient in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Six land-use metrics classifying the intensity of urbanisation on three spatial scales (sub-catchment, upstream riparian buffer, site buffer) were tested to explain the variation in riparian plant communities along the river networks and to describe the differences in riparian habitat. Riparian plant diversity peaked at sites which had between 40% and 70% of built-up land cover within sub-catchments; however, these communities contained a large number of non-native species compared to the forested streams. While total species richness and native species richness were more related to river network factors (catchment area), non-native richness was also affected by land-use within a site. Community composition was more related to local land-use than catchment area. Geographical distance between sites (both overland and hydrological) was increasingly more important for community heterogeneity along the urbanisation gradient. Riparian habitat worsened along the urbanisation gradient, with higher disturbance and soil pH and lower soil organic content and bryophyte cover in the more urban catchments. Riparian habitat variables were also related to the position along the river networks. Our results provide important insights into how riparian plant communities and riparian habitat differ along a gradient of urbanisation. Compared to previous studies we investigated the patterns in riparian vegetation in the context of river networks, including a variety of land-use metrics, and analysed data across different spatial scales. This revealed important trends in plant diversity, demonstrated that urban land-use increases the occurrence of non-native species, and showed that the land-use at the local scale is a stronger determinant of plant assemblages compared to land-use at broader scales. These novel findings can be applied to land management in order to mitigate the effects of urbanisation on riparian ecosystems and the functions they provide for adjacent streams and rivers.

Combined effects of salinity and infectious disease on Daphnia dentifera at multiple scales	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						host-parasite interactions; Metschnikowia bicuspidata; non-additive effects; pathogen; road salt	FRESH-WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATION-DENSITY; RAPID EVOLUTION; ROAD SALT; HOST; SALINIZATION; STRESSORS; IMPACTS; INCREASES	Temperate freshwater ecosystems are currently being salinised through anthropogenic activities. These increases in freshwater salinity can impact individuals, populations, and species interactions. We studied the effects of salinity on freshwater host-parasite interactions at multiple scales using the zooplankton host, Daphnia dentifera, and a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). We conducted one experiment at the individual-level to quantify the effects of salinity on infection prevalence and another to understand the combined population-level effects of salinity and parasitism. In our first experiment, we found that the effects of salinity on infection prevalence varied by host genotype; increased salinity reduced infection prevalence in one genotype but had no effect on infection prevalence in another. In our second experiment, infection prevalence was lower when NaCl was added to the microcosms compared to the control (no added salt) treatments. We also found a significant parasite x salinity interaction on D. dentifera density in our second experiment, where the parasite only reduced host densities in our control treatment, probably due to the reduced infection prevalence as salinity increased. This study demonstrates that salinity can influence infection prevalence in freshwater hosts and that host population density may respond to the combined effects of salinisation and parasitism in a non-additive manner.

Functional shifts in lake zooplankton communities with hypereutrophication	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article							PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; FRESH-WATER; ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; NUTRIENT STOICHIOMETRY; PLANKTON COMMUNITY; FOOD QUALITY; GROWTH-RATE; BODY-SIZE; CP RATIO; LAND-USE	Functional variation among consumer communities can alter ecosystem nutrient cycling. These impacts on ecosystem function can be specifically driven by interspecific variation in stoichiometric traits; thus, functional trait-based approaches can be used to explain the processes controlling ecosystem stoichiometry. However, eutrophication may reduce the functional importance of consumers in ecosystems by eliminating heterogeneity in nutrient recycling among taxa. To test whether zooplankton functional diversity, i.e. aspects of the stoichiometric trait space occupied by zooplankton communities, varies over gradients in trophic state and nutrient stoichiometry, we examined functional and taxonomic variation in the zooplankton communities of 130 lakes in the agriculturally dominated state of Iowa (U.S.A.) over 7 years. Stoichiometric functional dispersion decreased with trophic state index, supporting the trait abundance shift hypothesis that hypereutrophic lakes are characterised by different combinations of functional traits than their less eutrophic counterparts. Zooplankton communities became increasingly N-rich relative to P as TSI increased. Specifically, P-poor Bosmina, Chydorus, and cyclopoid copepods increased in abundance with eutrophication. Stoichiometric trait distributions of zooplankton shift with eutrophication, which implies that the unique functioning of hypereutrophic lakes could be due in part to the consumers inhabiting them. As zooplankton N:P increased with trophic state while lake total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio decreased with trophic state, P-poor zooplankton taxa may exacerbate excess P availability in these hypereutrophic systems by differentially recycling P at higher rates.

Numerous factors are involved in these declines, one of them being the use of fertilizers in agriculture. This is especially true for tadpoles which can live in the fertilizer-polluted farmland water bodies until metamorphosis. The present study aimed to assess the effects of urea (CH4N2O), as one of the most economical and effective fertilizers, on the anti-predator behavior and intraspecific functional trait variability of Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) tadpoles. Based on published literatures and the field observation of urea concentrations in China, glass beakers with a gradient of urea concentrations (0, 200, 400, 600, and 1200mg/L) were prepared, with 10 tadpoles placed in each glass beaker. Each treatment was replicated three times. Mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) cues were used as the predator disturbance, and three main functional traits (body mass, trunk bending shape, and eye position) were selected. Our results revealed that tadpoles activity levels decreased when exposed to urea as well as to mosquito fish cues. However, urea exposure did not alter the anti-predator behaviors of tadpoles. Additionally, we found that increasing urea concentrations might modify some functional traits of tadpoles. Importantly, urea disturbance decreased tadpoles intraspecific functional trait variability. (Functional similarity increased between developmental stages.) Given that functional similarity between developmental stages could potentially increase intraspecific competition, urea could indirectly reduce tadpoles survival by decreasing intraspecific traits variability.

The methods applied in this study were multiple linear regression, Cubist, support vector regression, random forest regression, universal kriging and regression kriging. Fish abundance and environmental data were collected from September, 2013 to August, 2016 in 48 sampling stations distributed along the estuarine gradient. Ranking procedure of various regression methods showed that the Cubist model was the best performing model based on prediction accuracy in thedevelopment phase and prediction consistency in the validation phase. Latitude, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen had positive influence on fish abundance, while longitude and transparency showed negative impacts. This study offers scope for refining the employed currently models to predict spatial densities of fish populations using a wide range of available biotic and abiotic variables, which will enable to develop an efficient management framework for tropical monsoonal estuaries.

Here, we study the impact of combined stressor exposure on gastropods at 9-year interval, through a monthly 1-year (2013) monitoring, also providing data on the occurrence of other macroinvertebrate taxa. Previous study in 2004 showed the occurrence of cyanobacterial proliferations, drought, trematode parasites and invasive non-native pulmonate Physa acuta. During the year 2013, we always detected cyanobacterial microcystins (MCs) in gastropods, from 59 to 4149ngg(-1) fresh mass (vs. 0-246ngg(-1) in 2004), suggesting a continuous and increased MC intoxication. Environmental intracellular MC concentrations were high (8-41 mu gL(-1)) from August to October 2013, whereas they were detected only in August 2004 (17 mu gL(-1)). In 2013, we recorded no trematodes among the 2490 sampled gastropods, and P. acuta represented 94% of gastropods (vs. 58% in 2004). After August 2013, nearly all gastropods disappeared as most other macroinvertebrates (except Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera). The whole decline of gastropods and other macroinvertebrates, and the absence of trematodes strongly suggest adverse conditions in the study site. Despite acute stressful conditions suggested above, gastropod abundance was 13-fold higher in June 2013 (vs. 2004), reflecting successful recolonization and efficient breeding. Most gastropods exposed to drought and toxic bloom were young vulnerable stages. Thus, we supposed alternation of local gastropod extinctions versus recolonization that could induce, on a long term, a loss of diversity to the detriment of the most sensitive species.

This study was conducted in two estuaries located in the Paraiba state, northeastern Brazil: Mamanguape, an environmental protection area, and Paraiba do Norte, a river with riverside communities along its length. The objective of the study was to determine whether host and abiotic characteristics predict the richness of fish gill parasites and/or the abundance of the most abundant and prevalent parasite species, the copepod Acusicola brasiliensis, testing the species as a possible bioindicator. The fish host species were Anchoa januaria, Atherinella brasiliensis, Mugil curema, and Rhinosardinia bahiensis. Generalized linear models were constructed to test the influence of predictor variables on parasite richness and A. brasiliensis abundance. The predictor variables used in the models were the host relative condition factor (Kn), host length, collection season (rainy or dry), estuary, host species, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a. Both parasite species richness and A. brasiliensis mean abundance showed a significant relation to water quality parameters, suggesting their possible use as environmental quality indicators.

Traditionally, the robustness of ecological networks has been evaluated based on simulation studies where primary extinctions occur at random or as a function of species specialization, ignoring other important biological factors. Here, we estimate the robustness of a seed dispersal network from a grassland-forest mosaic in southern Brazil, simulating distinct scenarios of woody plant species extinction, including scenarios where species are eliminated based on their evolutionary and functional distinctiveness. Our results suggest that the network is more robust when species are eliminated based on their evolutionary uniqueness, followed by random extinctions, the extinction of the most specialist species, functional distinctiveness and, at last, when the most generalist species are sequentially eliminated. Our results provide important information for grassland-forest mosaic management, as they indicate that loss of generalist species and functional diversity makes the system more likely to collapse.

Biodiversity in dry rangelands is decreasing due to intensification of livestock production, but its effects on the genetic diversity of the consumed biota have seldom been assessed. We examined livestock effects on the genetic diversity of two dominant creosote species of the Patagonian Monte Desert, Larrea divaricata and Larrea cuneifolia. We deployed competing hierarchical regression models to assess the relationship between genetic variation within natural populations as a function of increasing stocking rates on ten arid rangelands. These species exhibit similar levels and patterns of genetic structure, with high levels of both inbreeding and divergence among locations. We found that increased stocking reduces genetic variation and increases genetic subdivision between populations. Our results indicate that grazing pressures are impoverishing the gene pool of these dominant native species of the Monte Desert, decreasing the evolutionary potential of the primary plant producers and increasing the desertification risk for a vulnerable habitat. We highlight the importance of considering livestock as a major driver of genetic losses in dry rangelands under overgrazing pressure, especially given current forecasts of climate change.

These relationships can be used to describe diversity patterns while accounting for the well-known scale-dependence of species richness. Despite their value, their functional form and parameters, as well as their determinants, have barely been investigated in drylands. Location 171 drylands from all continents except Antarctica. Time period 2006-2013. Major taxa studied Perennial plants. Methods We characterized species-area relationships of plant communities by building accumulation curves describing the expected number of species as a function of the number of sampling units, and later compared the fit of three functions (power law, logarithmic and Michaelis-Menten). We tested the prediction that the effects of aridity, soil pH on the species-area relationship (SAR) are mediated by vegetation attributes such as evenness, cover and spatial aggregation. Results We found that the logarithmic relationship was the most common functional form (c. 50%), followed by Michaelis-Menten (c. 33%) and power law (c. 17%). Functional form was mainly determined by evenness. Power-law relationships were found mostly under low evenness, logarithmic relationships peaked under intermediate evenness and the Michaelis-Menten function increased in frequency with increasing evenness. The SAR parameters approximated by the logarithmic model ["small-scale richness" (b(0)) and "accumulation coefficient" (b(1))] were determined by vegetation attributes. Increasing spatial aggregation had a negative effect on the small-scale richness and a positive effect on the accumulation coefficient, while evenness had an opposite effect. In addition, the accumulation coefficient was positively affected by cover. Interestingly, increasing aridity decreased small-scale richness but did not affect the accumulation coefficient. Main conclusions Our findings highlight the role of evenness, spatial aggregation and cover as the main drivers of SARs in drylands, the Earth's largest biome.

Due to intrinsic low densities, wide distribution ranges and limited presence at the sea surface, these species are rarely sighted. Pooling data from multiple visual surveys sharing a common line-transect methodology can increase sightings but requires accounting for heterogeneity in protocols and platforms. Location North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Time period 1998 to 2015. Major taxa Ziphiidae; Physeteriidae; Kogiidae. Methods About 1,240,000 km of pooled effort provided 630 sightings of ziphiids, 836 of physeteriids and 106 of kogiids. For each taxon, we built a hierarchical model to estimate the effective strip width depending on observation conditions and survey types. We then modelled relative densities in a generalized additive modelling framework. Geographical predictions were limited to interpolations identified with a gap analysis of environmental space coverage. Results Deeper areas of the North Atlantic gyre were mostly environmental extrapolation in the predictions, thereby highlighting gaps in sampling across the different surveys. For the three species groups, the highest relative densities were predicted along continental slopes, particularly in the western North Atlantic Ocean where the Gulf Stream creates dynamic frontal zones and eddies. Main conclusions Pooling a large number of surveys provided the first basin-wide models of distribution for deep-diving cetaceans, including several data-deficient taxa, across the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. These models can help the conservation of elusive and poorly known marine megafauna.

Relating beta diversity of birds and butterflies in the Great Basin to spatial resolution, environmental variables and trait-based groups	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; community ecology; guilds; nestedness; species composition; turnover	TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLIES; LIFE-HISTORY; NESTEDNESS; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; SCALE; ASSEMBLAGES; TURNOVER; ASSOCIATION; COMPONENTS	Aim We sought to characterize spatial and temporal beta diversity of birds and butterflies in the Great Basin (western U.S.A.) and to determine whether the magnitude of beta diversity was associated with spatial resolution, trait-based groups or local environmental variables. Location Central and western Great Basin, western U.S.A. Time period 1995-2014. Major taxa studied Birds and butterflies. Methods We calculated temporal and spatial beta diversity of birds and butterflies at two spatial resolutions, points (birds) or transects (butterflies) and canyons (birds and butterflies). Points and transects corresponded to the spatial resolution of sampling, whereas canyons might be a more ecologically meaningful resolution. We partitioned beta diversity into turnover and nestedness components, and we calculated these components for entire assemblages and for trait-based groups within assemblages. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to relate turnover and nestedness to spatial resolution, trait-based groups and environmental variables. Results Variation in the composition of bird and butterfly assemblages was primarily associated with turnover. Species composition was more consistent at the resolution of canyons than at finer spatial resolutions. The species composition of birds changed more through space than through time, and spatial turnover of bird species tended to be higher than that of butterfly species. There were few strong associations of turnover and nestedness with environmental variables, and none with trait-based groups. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the identities of bird and butterfly species vary at locations within canyons among years but are less variable among canyons. Decreases in temporal turnover as spatial resolution increases suggest that, at fine spatial resolutions and among years, bird and butterfly species in the Great Basin might acquire resources somewhat opportunistically rather than via strong interspecific competition (birds and butterflies) or site tenacity to breeding territories (birds).

Plants with selfing ability should have an advantage when establishing on islands where mates and pollinators are limited (Baker's law). However, high percentages of dioecious and self-incompatible species have been reported for some islands, possibly resulting from post-colonization evolution. Given that such evolution is less likely to apply to alien species recently introduced to islands by humans, tests of Baker's law on islands need to consider both native and naturalized alien species. Location Global. Time period Undefined. Major taxa studied Angiosperms. Methods To test whether the colonization of islands is associated with selfing ability (self-compatibility and autofertility), we combined three comprehensive global databases: one on breeding systems of species, one on island and mainland distributions of native species and one on global naturalization of alien plants. We assigned each of a total of 1,752 species, from 161 angiosperm families, as mainland species, island colonists and/or island endemics (i.e., species that are restricted to islands). To assess potential relationships between island occurrence and selfing ability of species, we used multinomial logistic regressions. Results We found that species with high selfing ability were slightly more likely to be island colonist than mainland species. However, selfing ability did not increase the likelihood of being an island endemic in contrast to mainland species. Among island colonists, selfing ability did not differ between species on oceanic and on continental islands or between species native to islands and naturalized on islands. Main conclusions We performed a comprehensive test of Baker's law by considering many angiosperm families, using continuous metrics of self-compatibility and autofertility and including both native and naturalized species. We provide global evidence that high selfing ability may foster island colonization of angiosperms.

We compare two taxa with different ecological and dispersal requirements (terrestrial molluscs and leaf beetles) in the same geographical setting. Location Iberian Peninsula. Time period 2010-2015. Major taxa Terrestrial molluscs and leaf beetles. Methods The cox1-5 ' fragment was sequenced for 1,592 mollusc specimens in 20 localities. Leaf beetle assemblages had been sequenced previously in 15 of these localities. Species richness, distance decay of similarity, endemism and range size were measured at two levels: molecular variants (i.e., haplotypes) and putative species (i.e., operational taxonomic units). Using a multi-hierarchical macroecology approach, distance-decay patterns were measured at multiple intermediate genealogical levels (nested clades) to assess whether the geometry of the ranges of lineages followed a fractal pattern. Results Richness and distance-decay patterns at both molecular variant and species levels were different in leaf beetles and terrestrial molluscs, although both taxa showed a fractal pattern in the distance decay of similarity across genealogical levels. The self-similarity of the distance-decay pattern across phylogenetic scales suggests a predominance of neutral, but limited, dispersal driving macroecological patterns in both taxa. Endemism was similar in both taxa at the level of molecular variants but higher at the species level in terrestrial molluscs, and range size was smaller at both levels in terrestrial molluscs. Taken altogether, our results suggest that dispersal limitation is stronger in terrestrial molluscs. Main conclusion The assessment of how diversity patterns change at different phylogenetic scales below the species level allowed us to identify unifying characteristics in otherwise seemingly heterogeneous biological systems. Congruence was observed in diversity patterns of leaf beetles and terrestrial molluscs, suggesting that dispersal is a relevant process in both taxa but acts at a different strength.

How plant pH varies and is regulated at large scales remain unclear. Here we explore the biogeography of foliar pH and the potential drivers. Location East-west transect of northern China with increasing aridity westward. Time period 2016-2017. Major taxa Spermatophytes. Methods We analysed foliar pH of plants from 22 sites across northern China, and investigated its spatial pattern and relationships with climate, soil, and plant functional type (PFT). Results Foliar pH was generally acidic (5.33 +/- .04) in northern China, showing distinct geographical variability: foliar pH decreased significantly westward at an average rate of 0.25 units per 10 degrees longitude. Climate, soil and PFT explained 11, 17 and 59% of the variance in foliar pH, respectively. Foliar pH decreased (about 0.16) with mean annual precipitation (per 100 mm), soil stress coefficient (per 10%) and aridity index (per 0.14), but increased with mean annual temperature (per 2 degrees C). Across PFTs, herbs exhibited higher foliar pH than woody plants (6.0 vs. 4.9); gymnosperms relative to angiosperms had lower foliar pH (3.7 vs. 5.6); and monocotyledons showed higher foliar pH compared with dicotyledons (6.0 vs. 5.5). Main conclusions This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the evident pattern of foliar pH over a large spatial scale. Foliar pH is higher in warm-arid northwestern relative to cold-humid northeastern China and in later- than earlier-evolved plants. Similar to leaf mineral elements, foliar-pH biogeography is shaped by the joint effects of climate, soil and PFT; PFT and moisture are the most influential factors. Our findings provide a new impetus for understanding functional biogeography, and lay the groundwork for research on the linkage of foliar pH to ecological functions and macroevolutionary implications.

However, given that plant community responses can vary considerably among individual studies, there is a clear need to synthesize and generalize findings with meta-analytical approaches. Our goal was to quantify changes in species richness and abundance in plant communities in response to N addition across different environmental contexts, while controlling for different experimental designs. Location Global. Time period Data range: 1985-2016; Publication years: 1990-2018. Major taxa studied Plants. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of 115 experiments reported in 85 studies assessing the effects of N addition on terrestrial natural and semi-natural plant communities. We quantified local-scale changes in plant biodiversity in relationship to N addition using four metrics: species richness (SR), individual species abundance (IA), mean species abundance (MSA) and geometric mean abundance (GMA). Results For all metrics, greater amounts of annual N addition resulted in larger declines in plant diversity. Additionally, MSA decreased more steeply with N that was applied in reduced (NH4+) rather than oxidized (NO3-) form. Loss of SR with increasing amounts of N was found to be larger in warmer sites. Furthermore, greater losses of SR were found in sites with longer experimental durations, smaller plot sizes and lower soil cation exchange capacity. Finally, reductions in the abundance of individual species were larger for N-sensitive plant life-form types (legumes and non-vascular plants). Main conclusions N enrichment decreases both SR and abundance of plants in N-addition experiments, but the magnitude of the response differs among biodiversity metrics and with the environmental and experimental context. This underlines the importance of integrating multiple dimensions of biodiversity and relevant modifying factors into assessments of biodiversity responses to global environmental change.

Abundance and species diversity hotspots of tracked marine predators across the North American Arctic	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						animal movement; biologging; climate change; conservation; fishes; marine mammals; protected areas; seabirds	CHANGING SEA-ICE; HABITAT SELECTION; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RINGED SEALS; BEAUFORT SEA; POLAR BEARS; BIRDS; MOVEMENTS; MAMMALS	Aim Climate change is altering marine ecosystems worldwide and is most pronounced in the Arctic. Economic development is increasing leading to more disturbances and pressures on Arctic wildlife. Identifying areas that support higher levels of predator abundance and biodiversity is important for the implementation of targeted conservation measures across the Arctic. Location Primarily Canadian Arctic marine waters but also parts of the United States, Greenland and Russia. Methods We compiled the largest data set of existing telemetry data for marine predators in the North American Arctic consisting of 1,283 individuals from 21 species. Data were arranged into four species groups: (a) cetaceans and pinnipeds, (b) polar bears Ursus maritimus (c) seabirds, and (d) fishes to address the following objectives: (a) to identify abundance hotspots for each species group in the summer-autumn and winter-spring; (b) to identify species diversity hotspots across all species groups and extent of overlap with exclusive economic zones; and (c) to perform a gap analysis that assesses amount of overlap between species diversity hotspots with existing protected areas. Results Abundance and species diversity hotpots during summer-autumn and winter-spring were identified in Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Amundsen Gulf, and the Beaufort, Chukchi and Bering seas both within and across species groups. Abundance and species diversity hotpots occurred within the continental slope in summer-autumn and offshore in areas of moving pack ice in winter-spring. Gap analysis revealed that the current level of conservation protection that overlaps species diversity hotspots is low covering only 5% (77,498 km(2)) in summer-autumn and 7% (83,202 km(2)) in winter-spring. Main conclusions We identified several areas of potential importance for Arctic marine predators that could provide policymakers with a starting point for conservation measures given the multitude of threats facing the Arctic. These results are relevant to multilevel and multinational governance to protect this vulnerable ecosystem in our rapidly changing world.

Remaining populations of an upland stream fish persist in refugia defined by habitat features at multiple scales	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Candy Darter; distributional dynamics; ecological resistance; Etheostoma osburni; fine sediment; land use; multiple stressors; stream temperature	AMERICAN FRESH-WATER; LAND-USE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; RIVER-BASIN; SEDIMENT; ECOLOGY; TROUT; CONSERVATION	Aim Conserving stream biota could require strategies that preserve habitats conveying resistance to ecological impacts of changing land use and climate. Retrospective analyses of species' responses to anthropogenic disturbances can inform such strategies. We developed a hierarchical framework to contrast environmental conditions underlying persistence versus extirpation of an imperilled stream fish, Candy Darter (Etheostoma osburni), over decades of changing land use. The decline of E. osburni may broadly represent the challenge of conserving sensitive freshwater species in intensively used upland environments. Location New River drainage, Appalachian Mountains, USA. Methods We surveyed fish and habitat in historically occupied sites to identify population refugia, and used multivariate and spatial analyses to address three questions: (a) what are the environmental correlates of refugia? (b) are the pathways by which land use impacts instream habitat constrained by catchment- and/or segment-scale features? and (c) are E. osburni distributional dynamics spatially structured and explained by fine sediment and warm stream temperatures? Results We confirmed a recently localized distribution similar to other upland species, marked by at least seven extirpations from streams throughout E. osburni's southern range. Catchment-scale features primarily constrained land use and finer-scale habitat, leading to either extirpations or population-supporting refugia defined by features at multiple scales. Refugium habitats contained cooler temperatures and less fine sediment. Rare mismatches between persistence and habitat suitability were explained by network location, suggesting unmeasured environmental gradients and/or dispersal contributed to distributional dynamics. Main conclusions We provided insight at multiple spatial scales into how aquatic species' distributions become fragmented and localized. Our results demonstrate that natural landscape heterogeneity imparts spatially variable resistance of sensitive species to intensive land uses. By recognizing the scale-specific features that buffer populations from extirpation, conservation strategies could be tailored to protect naturally occurring refugium habitats and focus restoration in systems where such habitats are broadly lacking.

Here, we evaluated the degree to which errors in species data (false presences-absences) affect model predictions and how this is reflected in commonly used evaluation metrics. Location Western Swiss Alps. Methods Using 100 virtual species and different sampling methods, we created observation datasets of different sizes (100-400-1,600) and added increasing levels of errors (creating false positives or negatives; from 0% to 50%). These degraded datasets were used to fit models using generalized linear model, random forest and boosted regression trees. Model fit (ability to reproduce calibration data) and predictive success (ability to predict the true distribution) were measured on probabilistic/binary outcomes using Kappa, TSS, MaxKappa, MaxTSS and Somers'D (rescaled AUC). Results The interpretation of models' performance depended on the data and metrics used to evaluate them, with conclusions differing whether model fit, or predictive success were measured. Added errors reduced model performance, with effects expectedly decreasing as sample size increased. Model performance was more affected by false positives than by false negatives. Models with different techniques were differently affected by errors: models with high fit presenting lower predictive success (RFs), and vice versa (GLMs). High evaluation metrics could still be obtained with 30% error added, indicating that some metrics (Somers'D) might not be sensitive enough to detect data degradation. Main conclusions Our findings highlight the need to reconsider the interpretation scale of some commonly used evaluation metrics: Kappa seems more realistic than Somers'D/AUC or TSS. High fits were obtained with high levels of error added, showing that RF overfits the data. When collecting occurrence databases, it is advisory to reduce the rate of false positives (or increase sample sizes) rather than false negatives.

Location Japanese archipelago, Ryukyu archipelago and Izu-Bonin oceanic islands. Methods We modelled the distributions of 6,325 species (amphibians, birds, freshwater fish, mammals, plants and reptiles) using 4,389,489 occurrence data points. We then applied the Zonation software for spatial conservation prioritization. First, we identified environmental drivers underpinning taxon-specific biodiversity patterns. Second, we analysed each taxon individually to understand baseline priority patterns. Third, we combined all taxa into an inclusive analysis to identify the most important PAN expansions. Results Biodiversity patterns were well explained by geographical factors (climate, habitat stability, isolation and area), but their explanatory power differed between the taxa. There was remarkably little overlap between priority areas for the individual higher taxa. The inclusive prioritization analysis across all taxa identified priority regions, in particular in southern subtropical and mountainous areas. Expanding the PAN up to 17% would cover most of the ranges for rare and/or restricted-range species. On average, approximately 30% of the ranges of all species could be covered by the 17% expansion identified here. Main conclusions Our analyses identified top candidates for the expansion of Japan's protected area network. Taxon-specific prioritization was informative for understanding the conservation priority patterns of different taxa associated with unique biogeographical processes. For the basis of PAN expansion, we recommend multi-taxon prioritization as an area-efficient compromise that reflects taxon-specific priority patterns. Spatial prioritization across multiple taxa provides a promising start for the development of conservation plans with the aim of long-term persistence of biodiversity on the East Asian islands.

Nowadays, some of these forests are being restored by enrichment with dead wood, but mostly only at stand scales. Here, we investigated effects of a seminal dead-wood enrichment strategy on saproxylic organisms at the landscape scale. Location Temperate European beech forest in southern Germany. Methods In a before-after control-impact design, we compared assemblages and gamma diversities of saproxylic organisms in strictly protected old-growth forest areas (reserves) and historically moderately and intensively managed forest areas before and a decade after starting a landscape-wide strategy of dead-wood enrichment. Results Before enrichment with dead wood, the gamma diversity of saproxylic organisms in historically intensively managed forest stands was significantly lower than in reserves and historically moderately managed forest stands; this difference disappeared after 10 years of dead-wood enrichment. The species composition of beetles in forest stands of the three historical management intensities differed before the enrichment strategy, but a decade thereafter, the species compositions of previously intensively logged and forest reserve plots were similar. However, the differences in fungal species composition between historical management categories before and after 10 years of enrichment persisted. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate that intentional enrichment of dead wood at the landscape scale is a powerful tool for rapidly restoring saproxylic beetle communities and for restoring wood-inhabiting fungal communities, which need longer than a decade for complete restoration. We propose that a strategy of area-wide active restoration combined with some permanent strict refuges is a promising means of promoting the biodiversity of age-long intensively managed Central European beech forests.

We aimed to develop a repeatable approach to defining a community, both intact and degraded, based on its fauna. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to guide conservation-for example, determining whether a multispecies community of animals is threatened. Location Temperate and subtropical woodlands of Australia. Methods We used expert opinion to develop a definition of the Australian Temperate and Subtropical Woodland Bird Community and metrics of its condition. Using continental-scale vegetation change mapping, and national bird atlas data, we assessed this community against criteria for listing as a threatened ecological community under national biodiversity conservation law. Results We defined and described a recognizable and consistent Australian Temperate and Subtropical Woodland Bird Community. Although taxonomically and functionally very similar, we identified six community variants that show species- or genus-level substitutions. The community was evaluated to be Endangered or Critically Endangered across its extent based on criteria from Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. We used a novel metric of condition using historical changes in woodland extent and bird species, to demonstrate the community has declined substantially in geographical extent and integrity and is subject to severe and ongoing threats. Conclusions The consequences of global change affect entire communities, not just single species; however, defining ecological communities based predominantly on plant species composition can fail to illuminate the complex associations of animals that are both sustained by, and sustain, the vegetation. In this study, we present a process for defining and evaluating the status of a fauna community against threat criteria. The explicit recognition and protection of fauna communities can be an important complement to the protection of plant-based ecological communities.

Characteristics such as dependence on distinct habitats and the presence of multiple threats along their migratory routes make these species vulnerable, and gaps in knowledge about their ecology and migration processes make them difficult to conserve. Urania boisduvalii is a diurnal moth endemic to Cuba that feeds on plants of Omphalea spp. during its larval phases. These plants produce secondary metabolites as a defence against the moth's larvae, which then are forced to migrate. Although some ecological aspects of Urania boisduvalii are known, its migration routes remain largely unknown. This research proposes potential migratory routes of Urania boisduvalii among populations of its host plant. Location Cuba. Methods We developed ecological niche models of the moth and its hosts based on environmental, anthropic, biotic and biogeographic factors to obtain potential distributional areas that include zones where positive interactions are found but exclude those where negative factors are present. These areas were overlapped to hypothesize potential breeding areas for the moths. Potential migratory corridors were proposed based on environmental connectivity. Results The moth and its hosts have broad potential distributions; however, limiting factors have substantially reduced these areas, especially for plants. The potential migratory routes of Urania boisduvalii are complex and mostly involve the western and eastern regions of Cuba. Most records outside potential breeding areas were close to these migratory corridors. Main conclusions We offer initial hypotheses of the migratory routes of U. boisduvalii, which may be useful to guiding monitoring projects that can provide more definitive views of the seasonal distribution of this species across the Cuban archipelago.

Plasma concentrations of organohalogenated contaminants in white-tailed eagle nestlings - The role of age and diet	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article							PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; HALIAEETUS-ALBICILLA NESTLINGS; BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; PREDATORY BIRD NESTLINGS; TEMPORAL TRENDS; ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS; POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; PERFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS; STABLE-ISOTOPES	Concentrations of organohalogenated contaminants (OHCs) can show significant temporal and spatial variation in the environment and wildlife. Most of the variation is due to changes in use and production, but environmental and biological factors may also contribute to the variation. Nestlings of top predators are exposed to maternally transferred OHCs in the egg and through their dietary intake after hatching. The present study investigated spatial and temporal variation of OHCs and the role of age and diet on these variations in plasma of Norwegian white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) nestlings. The nestlings were sampled at two locations, Smola and Steigen, in 2015 and 2016. The age of the nestlings was recorded (range: 44 87 days old) and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and (delta N-15) were applied as dietary proxies for carbon source and trophic position, respectively. In total, 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, range: 0.82 - 59.05 ng/mL), 7 organochlorinated pesticides (0CPs, range: 0.89 - 52.19 ng/mL), 5 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs, range: 0.03 - 2.64 ng/mL) and 8 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs, range: 4.58 - 52.94 ng/mL) were quantified in plasma samples from each location and year. The OHC concentrations, age and dietary proxies displayed temporal and spatial variations. The age of the nestlings was indicated as the most important predictor for OHC variation as the models displayed significantly decreasing plasma concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs with increasing age, while concentrations of PFASs were significantly increasing with age. Together with age, the variations in PCB, OCP and PBDE concentrations were also explained by delta C-13 and indicated decreasing concentrations with a more marine diet. Our findings emphasise age and diet as important factors to consider when investigating variations in plasma OHC concentrations in nestlings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We therefore investigated the relationships bewteen blubber concentrations of lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POPS) and plasma concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and markers of endocrine and immune functions in adult male Atlantic walruses (n = 38) from Svalbard, Norway. To do so, we assessed plasma concentrations of five forms of thyroid hormones and transcript levels of genes related to the endocrine and immune systems as endpoints; transcript levels of seven genes in blubber and 23 genes in blood cells were studied. Results indicated that plasma total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations and ratio of TT4 and reverse triiodothyronine decreased with increasing blubber concentrations of lipophilic POPs. Blood cell transcript levels of genes involved in the function of T and B cells (FC like receptors 2 and 5, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 and protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22) were increased with plasma PFAS concentrations. These results suggest that changes in thyroid and immune systems in adult male walruses are linked to current levels of contaminant exposure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to assess the association between prolonged smoke PM2.5 exposure from a brown coal mine fire that burned over a seven week period in 2014 and medications dispensed across five localities in South-eastern Victoria, Australia. Spatially resolved PM2.5 concentrations were retrospectively estimated using a dispersion model coupled with a chemical transport model. Data on medications dispensed were collected from the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule database for 2013-2016. Poisson distributed lag time series analysis was used to examine associations between daily mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations and daily counts of medications dispensed for respiratory, cardiovascular or psychiatric conditions. Factors controlled for included: seasonality, long-term trend, day of the week, maximum ambient temperature and public holidays. Positive associations were found between mine fire-related PM2.5 and increased risks of medications dispensed for respiratory, cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions, over a lag range of 3-7 days. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in coal mine fire-related PM2.5 was associated with a 25% (95%CI 19-32%) increase in respiratory medications, a 10% (95%CI 7-13%) increase in cardiovascular medications and a 12% (95%CI 8-16%) increase in psychiatric medications dispensed. These findings have the potential to better prepare for and develop more appropriate public health responses in the event of future coal mine fires. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data of 10 measurement stations located in Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Saxony were used for winter 2016/17 and revealed trans boundary PM10 increments of 0-30 mu g m(-3) on average, depending on meteorological conditions. On average over all days with positive increments, trans-boundary transport contributed 13 mu g m(-3) or 44% to the total PM10 concentration in the regional background. During pollution periods with elevated PM10 concentrations of > 30 mu g m(-3) at rural background sites, this contribution lied between 44 and 62%, while it decreased to about 20% for moderate PM10 concentrations between 20 and 30 mu g m(-3) and was negligible for PM10 concentrations < 20 mu g m(-3). Based on its chemical composition, PM10 was apportioned to 6-7 different sources by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) receptor modelling. It was found that typically > 80% of the trans boundary PM10 fraction imported from eastern neighbouring countries can be explained by combustion emissions and formation of secondary particle mass, i.e. ammonium sulfate and organic matter, with the latter typically exceeding the contributions from combustion. Source contributions of these two PMF factors within the increment East were correlated, indicating combustion-related emissions of SO2 and volatile organic compounds leading to the observed secondary trans-boundary PM10 mass. Higher increment East values for cold than for warm days imply emissions from domestic heating in eastern European countries, presumably from the combustion of solid fuels such as wood and coal, as the dominant source for trans-boundary PM10 in eastern Germany. A case study for a traffic-impacted pollution hotspot in the city of Berlin showed an average contribution of about 30% from trans-boundary transport, while regional background, urban background and local traffic emissions explained about 40, 10, and 20% of PM10 mass concentrations during days with eastern air mass inflow where the increment East approach could be applied together with the incremental Lenschow approach. The results of this study reinforce the need of PM10 mitigation measures at different spatial scales, ranging from municipal to international levels.

This provokes greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation and storage while disconnecting nutrient cycles, as urban organic waste is not recycled into the agricultural system. Urban food production based on composted local biomass could reduce these problems, but currently used hybrid crops rely strongly on inorganic fertilizers. On the contrary, open-pollinated varieties were bred for productivity under organic fertilization, such as compost. Hypothesising that open-pollinated varieties retain high nutritional value under low nutrient conditions, a commercial hybrid and a local open-pollinated variety of maize were cultivated in non-fertilized soil and under two compost applications: Municipal compost as high nutrient input or locally produced green waste compost and municipal compost mix, as medium nutrient input. Unfertilized plots exhibited low grain production (1.9 t/ha), but yields under green waste compost/municipal compost (6.1 t/ha) and municipal compost (7.8 t/ha) treatments were comparable to observations from maize under inorganic fertilization. Contrary to the commercial variety, the open-pollinated variety exhibited higher grain micronutrient concentrations, e.g. 220% higher zinc concentrations and lower accumulation of heavy metals, e.g. 74% lower nickel concentrations. This variety-related effect was found in all treatments and was independent of soil micronutrient concentrations. In conclusion, both compost mixes were effective in increasing grain yield in both maize varieties. However, the open-pollinated variety produced grain with higher nutritional values in soil and all treatments, indicating it is potentially better suited for compost-based sustainable urban agriculture.

Capture fisheries have significant economic, cultural, and environmental importance, yet relatively limited attention has been given to understanding their consumption-linked pressures. Where products of marine and inland fisheries are accounted for, they are typically done so within the context of 'material' footprints or within life cycle assessment-based studies which draw more attention to resource efficiency or pollution-related aspects of fisheries than the species or ecosystem-linked consequences of the extraction process itself. However, the sustainability of fisheries products is highly dependent on the catch method, location, and species targeted. To date, these have been missing from consumption-based accounts. Here, a collation of species-specific information comprising vulnerability and environmental pressure associated with capture is provided, which is then linked to a global multi-regional input-output model to - for the first time - create a dedicated consumption-based time-series for fisheries. Whilst the aggregate footprint of global capture fisheries has remained stable in recent decades, our results demonstrate that at national or regional scales different trends in consumption exist. Importantly, there have been significant shifts in the composition of catch within these consumption accounts, which have potential implications for the sustainability of underpinning supply chains. This paper draws attention to the fact that material efficiency perspectives are insufficient in the assessment of pressures on the marine environment driven by consumption of fisheries products, and - whilst challenges remain-there is a growing abundance of information and development of methods that could potentially be utilised to overcome gaps in the future.

However, understanding the objective knowledge of mining activities of the important stakeholder groups in mining is an issue that has been neglected. On the basis of an on-line survey focused on various target groups of stakeholders in Australia, we have examined a hypothesized model of factors that constitute knowledge of mining. The results show that knowledge of mining activities varies according to socio-demographic characteristics, experience of mining activities, and information sources about mining. Our findings highlight the key role of direct experience with mines and rehabilitation sites and the role of information in increasing knowledge of mining. In an effort to identify factors that frame acceptance of mining, the present study shows a new perspective by addressing objective knowledge of mining as an important asset that needs to be maintained and more widely spread.

Here, we used high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis to quantify historical changes in phytoplankton using fossils from cores on either side of a 57-year-old bridge that reduced fetch by 76% and created a discrete enclosed inner embayment. We hypothesized that phytoplankton abundance should be greater in the inner bay after bridge construction due to reduced hydrological flow and increased nutrient influx associated with terrestrial development and more profound anoxia in the enclosed basin. As expected, primary producer abundance, especially cryptophytes, increased in the inner bay during the 1950-1960s, although the effect was transient despite continuous fourfold elevation in sediment organic matter content (%C, %N) after ca. 1960 in response to wastewater influx. The pulse in cryptophytes appeared to correspond to influx of humic-rich waters derived from locally exploited peatlands, whereas the phytoplankton community of the outer basin largely reflected historical variations in climate, with warmer April months associated with increased abundance of diatoms and cryptophytes. Overall, sediment stable isotope values in the inner basin varied in response to a complex combination of changes in wastewater treatment (N-15), release of untreated fish plant effluents (N-15), and connectivity with the open ocean (C-13). Taken together, these findings suggest that the effects of bridge construction on coastal phytoplankton production and community composition operated through multiple pathways, rather than just via modifications of basin hydrology.

Spatial and Temporal Associations Between Native Crabs and the Invading Green Porcelain Crab, Petrolisthes armatus, Throughout Its Northernmost Invaded Range	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Range expansion; Oyster reef ecology; Eurypanopeus; Panopeus	CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; OYSTER REEFS; EURYPANOPEUS-DEPRESSUS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; PANOPEUS-HERBSTII; HOST; CRUSTACEA; PREDATOR; IMPACTS	Increasing ocean temperatures have led to poleward range expansions of many marine organisms. The green porcelain crab, Petrolisthes armatus, was first reported on intertidal oyster reefs near Charleston, South Carolina in the mid-1990s, an expansion from its tropical to sub-tropical native range. In order to investigate the relative abundances of this introduced crab and a portion of the native crab community, resident crab assemblages were sampled on intertidal oyster reefs across four seasons from 2015 to 2016. Sampling occurred at five locations extending from Savannah, Georgia where P. armatus is now well-established, to Wilmington, North Carolina, where its inter-annual presence is intermittent. Petrolisthes armatus was the numerically dominant crab species at all locations except Wilmington, where the species was not collected in the winter. Differences between northern and southern sample locations in the taxonomic composition of crab assemblages were most pronounced in the summer (June-September) and fall (October-January), with dissimilarities largely attributed to high abundances of P. armatus at southern locations. Crab abundances of all species peaked in the summer and were lowest in the winter (February-March). Petrolisthes armatus was less abundant toward the northern range edge, whereas native crabs did not differ in abundance throughout the sampling range. Throughout the study area, adult P. armatus sex ratios shifted from unbiased or female-biased in the summer to male-biased in the fall. Adults were collected in the spring (April-June), indicating they had overwintered. While native crab densities (Panopeus herbstii, Eurypanopeus depressus) stayed relatively constant across locations, P. armatus densities varied greatly, suggesting that resources, such as shelter and food, are not limiting factors for the coexistence of these native and invading crabs.

Seasonal Movement Patterns of Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) in Their Nonnative Range	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Striped bass; California; Movement; Migration; Seasonality; Tagging	SAN-FRANCISCO ESTUARY; CHINOOK SALMON; ANIMAL MOVEMENT; RIVER; SACRAMENTO; MIGRATION; HABITAT; BAY; CALIFORNIA; PREDATORS	Movement dynamics of nonnative species can change in new environments and differ from native populations. It has been more than 100years since striped bass (Morone saxatilis) were introduced to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system in California from the US east coast. Acoustic telemetry from 2011 to 2015 was used to examine striped bass seasonal residence patterns in their nonnative range across three regionsbay, delta and rivers, and the effect of fish length and release river (Sacramento River [SR] vs. Feather River [FR]) on movement. In spring, SR striped bass (n=52) increased travel speed by 39% and river residence by 63% relative to other seasons, which is consistent with spawning migrations. In summer, SR striped bass spent the most time in the bay (mean=28.2 +/- 30.9days) relative to other seasons and across regions. In winter, 87% of striped bass weredetected in the delta over 42% in the bay and 25% in the river. Release river also affected movement behaviorsFR striped bass (n=11) spent more time in the river in all seasons compared to SR bass. Striped bass with sufficient tag life (n=17) traveled farther distances in 365days (mean=1248 +/- 405km, range: 641-2212km) with increasing fish length. Seasonal patterns observed appeared to follow seasonal prey sources throughout the San Francisco Estuary. Individual behaviors, however, were highly variable, and this flexibility may be an important trait that has allowed striped bass to persist in their nonnative range.

Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter of the microclimate conditions and can be freely and globally accessed through satellite images. This study explores the relationship between daytime and nighttime Aqua/MODIS LST and the urban morphology defined by local climate zones (LCZ) in accordance with the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) methodology. The vegetation cover from each LCZ was analyzed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Additionally, the geometric and surface properties of LCZs defined by the literature were tested against measured LSTs to explorer if expected correlations between surface properties and surface temperature could be found. The results show a strong negative correlation between LST and both NDVI and EVI. Generally, the LCZ classes with lower vegetation cover presented higher daytime and nighttime LST. Building surface fraction and impervious surfaces presented a positive correlation with nighttime LST and the pervious surface fraction presented a negative correlation with nighttime LST.

In addition to microphytobenthos (MPB) and macroalgae (e.g. Fucus vesiculosus Linnaeus, 1753), the invasive C-4 grass Spartina anglica C.E. Hubbard has become an abundant primary producer in the Wadden Sea. To elucidate the role of different primary producers for the nutrition of typical Wadden Sea consumers, we conducted a mesocosm experiment with four food treatments (S. anglica, F. vesiculosus, MPB and all three resources together) under a simulated tidal cycle. We used consumers of different feeding types-the omnivorous polychaete Hediste diversicolor (O.F. Muller, 1776), the interface-feeding bivalve Limecola balthica (Linnaeus, 1758) and the surface deposit-feeding snail Peringia ulvae (Pennant, 1777)-and analyzed their biomass, delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope values and fatty acid (FA) profiles. After 4 weeks, the biomass of H. diversicolor increased in treatments that contained F. vesiculosus, but decreased in the treatment with MPB. delta C-13 values of H. diversicolor reflected those of the food sources provided and FA profiles varied strongly between the treatments, indicating feeding on copepods and bacteria as well as macrophytes. The biomass of P. ulvae significantly increased in treatments with S. anglica and all three resources. However, delta C-13 values of P. ulvae differed significantly between the treatments and were unrelated to the food sources except for MPB. FA profiles confirmed the assimilation of MPB in this species. delta C-13 values and FA composition of L. balthica were similar in each of the treatments and did not resemble the resources provided. Instead, the high proportion of respective marker FAs indicated feeding on plankton. delta N-15 values of the consumer species declined significantly in the order H. diversicolor > L. balthica > P. ulvae in each of the treatments. These results indicate different strategies in food source use of the three consumer species with the performance of the generalist feeders H. diversicolor and P. ulvae exceeding that of the selective feeder L. balthica.

Effect of temperature on the larval biology of ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) and insights on their northern range limit	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						Growth; Mortality; Settlement; Larvae; Thermal biology; Growing degree days	MYTILUS-EDULIS L.; GROWING DEGREE-DAY; BLUE MUSSEL; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; IN-SITU; GROWTH; POPULATION; SETTLEMENT; PATTERNS; GAMETOGENESIS	Ribbed mussels (Geukensia demissa) are important contributors to salt marsh productivity along the Atlantic coast of North America and are at their northern range limit in Maritime Canada. This range limit may be determined by temperature during their planktonic larval phase. We examined the effect of temperature on survival and growth of larval ribbed mussels reared in the laboratory over 28 days at 15, 19, 23, and 28 degrees C. In daily samples, we enumerated live and dead larvae and measured shell length and width of live individuals. Larval survival was high and similar at temperatures >= 19 degrees C (e.g., proportion alive +/- SE; 0.88 +/- 0.02 after 3 wk), but was lower and more variable at 15 degrees C (e.g., 0.56 +/- 0.16 after 3 wk). Instantaneous mortality rates per d were > 2 times lower at >= 19 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Larval growth rate increased with temperature, and Growing Degree Days (GDD) explained 85-95% of the variation in mean shell length. When larvae began settling, we measured the proportion of settlers in cohorts at 19, 23, and 28 degrees C; there was no settlement at 15 degrees C. Larval settlement occurred earlier at 28 degrees C (16 d) than 23 degrees C (18 d) and 19 degrees C (19 d). GDD significantly affected mean proportion of larvae settled, but only accounted for 29% of the variation. Our study demonstrates that GDD is a good predictor of larval growth for ribbed mussels and provides insights on larval developmental stages (e.g., potential timing of changes in resource allocation). Our study also provides support for the hypothesis that cold ocean temperatures ( <= 15 degrees C) may be a major limiting factor for successful development of larvae in the field and so for the dynamics of northern populations of ribbed mussels.

This study assessed water quality at the dam and investigated the impacts of this water on some soil characteristics of irrigated lands. The physicochemical parameters of the water were measured monthly at eight sites and related to soil characteristics sampled from six irrigated areas, which were compared to non-irrigated soils. The chemical facies of the water were chloride sulfate and calcium magnesium. The water had low levels of cadmium (8.9 mu g/L) and lead (4.55 mu g/L), excessive contents of chloride and bicarbonate, while pH ranged between 6.5 and 8.4. High levels of electrical conductivity were measured in 39% of samples that exceeded standard for irrigation use. Richard diagram identified four classes of water: (i) C3S1 with 61.5% of samples having moderate or poor quality, (ii) C4S1 (30.2%) having poor or bad quality, (iii) C4S2 (5.2%) having very bad quality, and (iv) C5S3 (3.1%) determined unsuitable for irrigation. A Wilcox diagram revealed that 58% of samples had good quality while 42% were inappropriate for irrigation. Soil pH, EC and OM increased in irrigated soils, particularly in the surface horizon, compared to the control sites; whereas total CaCO3 decreased at all soil depths measured. High levels of bioavailable lead (35.82 mu g/g) and cadmium (0.22 mu g/g) were recorded in the surface soil. The study suggests that adequate protection measures with appropriate guidelines for various water and soil parameters are needed to minimize the detrimental effects of irrigation water on agricultural lands.

The reclamation of Cu polluted soils can be achieved with phytoextraction even if, in general, plants are Cu-excluders and uncommon are Cu-accumulators. The research objectives were to establish the Cu removal capacity by arable and vegetable crops and to investigate the distribution of Cu in their roots, stems and leaves, and fruits. Pot trials were conducted for two subsequent years in Tuscany (Italy). Cu was added into soil in four levels (0, 200, 400, 600 mg kg(-1) of Cu). At harvesting, the crops roots, stems and leaves, and fruits or seeds were separately collected, oven dried, weighted, milled and separately analyzed. The results show that the GDUs value to reach the physiological maturity for barley, common bean, Indian mustard, and ricinus was significantly positively correlated with Cu concentration in soil in contrast with observed in sorghum, spinach, and tomato. Leaves and stems of spinach and ricinus have a good storage capacity in contrast with common bean, tomato, Indian mustard sorghum and barley. Tomato storage Cu mainly in fruits and roots which show a remarkable concentration of Cu that increases progressively with the increase of Cu concentration in the soil. In addition, the roots of common bean and ricinus showed a very high concentration of Cu. All species can be considered Cu-excluders because of their low capacity to uptake high quantity of Cu. Indian mustard can be considered a plant able to translocate the metal from root to epigeal tissue. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These changes may lead to important limitation of crucial ecosystems services such as seed dispersal. Here, we compared the spatial structure and species composition of bat-fruit interaction networks in continuous and fragmented forests based on the compilation of 14 datasets from the highly diverse and threatened Atlantic Forest sites in Brazil. As predicted, the number of bat-dispersed species was reduced in fragmented forests. Surprisingly, in both continuous and fragmented forests, bat-fruit networks were nested and modular and presented high complementary specialization. Bat species from genera Artibeus, Carollia, and Sturnira, as well as five plant genera (Cecropia, Ficus, Piper, Solanum, and Vismia) played a central role in both continuous and fragmented forests, revealing small effects of habitat loss on the phylogenetic identity of core species. These bats are considerably tolerant to habitat loss and may support seed dispersal of they preferred plants also in fragmented forests, which explains the similarities of the networks between continuous and fragmented forests. In addition, these key plants provide food resources continuously throughout the year, which facilitates the persistence of seed disperser bats year-round in the community. Although our results indicate that habitat loss had little influence on the structure of the bat-fruit interactions, we evidenced that fragmentation reduces the number of resources consumed and dispersed by bats, which may have negative impacts on forest dynamics and ecosystem functioning.

This paper examines the distribution of three raptors (Circaetus gallicus, Hieraaetus pennatus and Milvus migrans) at the southwestern boundary of their breeding range. We modelled species distribution to obtain habitat suitability indexes that were validated with extensive fieldwork in Morocco and Spain. Our results support a strong effect of habitat suitability and a bottleneck effect of the Strait of Gibraltar on raptor distribution. However, after controlling for these effects, the three species were scarcer in Morocco than in Spain. We did not find differences between the two countries in the number of power lines that are dangerous to raptors or in general impacts of agricultural intensification on bird populations (we assessed more farmland birds in Morocco). However, many more people (i.e., shepherds) were detected in Morocco, whose negative effect on raptors could explain the depletion of their populations. These transboundary differences are used to discuss the fate of these peripheral populations in a context of climate change and rural abandonment. They also highlight the need for strengthening raptor conservation around the Strait of Gibraltar, where a permanent flow of raptors converges throughout the year.

For this purpose, a dataset of Nymphalidae species distributed across 15 urban, semiurban, and rural fragments was analyzed. Urbanization was defined by a set of environmental variables. Furthermore, the total area of each fragment was also considered in the analyses but did not influence the results, in which disturbance level and patch connectivity drove the environmental variation across the urban matrix. Species diversity increased towards the more connected fragments, while phylogenetic and functional diversity did not vary in relation to urbanization. A high forewing:hindwing ratio and the frequency of tiger-like wings were positively related to the urban fragments, while a low forewing:hindwing ratio and iridescent wings were related to the semiurban and rural fragments. The suitability of highly interconnected rural habitats for the maintenance of butterfly diversity was corroborated as expected. Nonetheless, our results also showed that semiurban fragments preserved the ecologically relevant traits of butterflies related to forested habitats, expressed in butterfly groups possibly linked with dispersal capability to avoid predation. Careful management of semiurban fragments and urban landscaping, including highly structured and native vegetation outside urban parks, may increase the functional and taxonomic diversities or at least maintain the current levels of functionality in the urban matrix. Thus, it is possible to preserve the biological diversity of native fauna and flora and recover relevant ecosystem services, ensuring the conservation of Neotropical urban centers.

In mountainous regions, we typically observe an uphill shift of species' altitudinal ranges caused by increasing temperatures, but it is difficult to predict how this process interacts with land-use change. Here, we replicated an inventory of bumblebees that took place in the 1960s in Norway. Focusing on subalpine areas, we reported changes in species richness and community temperature index (CTI), a measure of the relative proportion of warm- and cold-adapted species, at low and high altitude. Using aerial photographs and meteorological data, we tested the relationship between climate and land-cover changes and changes in species richness and CTI. We observed an overall increase in CTI consistent with a gradual species turnover driven by climate change. There was on average an increase in species richness at high altitudes, while low-altitudes communities tendedto become less species-rich. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between species richness and temperature and precipitation trends, suggesting a detrimental effect of climate change. Thanks to the replication of an historical inventory, we were able to show evidence for an effect of climate, and possibly land-cover, change on subalpine bumblebee assemblages. These results can contribute to a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity changes in subalpine areas in a context of global climate and landscape changes.

The importance of temporal forest continuity (i.e. the duration of an uninterrupted forest state) for conservation of the forest fauna has been demonstrated for several taxa, but its influence on functional diversity and conservation importance of communities remains unclear. We studied how temporal continuity can shape taxonomic and functional composition and structure of forest-ground spider communities at a regional scale. According to broad-scale ecological site characteristics, species composition andto a lesser extenttrait distribution substantially diverged between ancient and recent forest sites. Yet, we found hardly any significant differences in functional -diversity, community structure, or conservation importance between the two forest categories. The only difference was for functional originality, which quantifies the average functional uniqueness of species within an assemblage: spiders' communities of the ancient forests was more functionally original than those of the recent woodlands. Thus, in a conservation perspective, our study provides evidence that each forest harbours original species combinations, suggesting that each of them is irreplaceable, especially for ancient forests, which are functionally more original; however, recent woodlands have a high potential to spontaneously recover typical forest fauna communities with very similar structural and functional profiles to those of ancient forests.

Often, the drivers themselves can be partitioned to alpha, beta and gamma diversities. Thus, one can hypothesize that the scale-components of species diversity and drivers' diversity match, i.e., that species alpha diversity is mainly explained by drivers' alpha diversity, beta by beta and gamma by gamma. Here, we explore this scale-matching' hypothesis for spiders in two fragmented agricultural landscapes. In each landscape, we sampled spiders and their potential prey in 12 patches. Then, we sub-sampled pseudo-landscapes in which we calculated spider alpha, beta and gamma diversities using multiplicative diversity-partitioning. Next, we used variance partitioning analysis to explore the relative contribution of eleven explanatory variables from five thematic groups (sampling intensity, area, connectivity, habitat diversity and prey diversity), while further partitioning the habitat and prey diversities to their corresponding alpha, beta and gamma diversities. We found considerable evidence for scale-matching, with spiders' alpha and beta diversities explained mostly by the corresponding alpha and beta diversities (respectively) of prey and/or habitat. We further found a strong effect of connectivity on spider beta diversity, but not on alpha and gamma diversities. For spiders gamma diversity, a cross-scale effect was observed. Our results suggest that multiple drivers from multiple scales interact in structuring patterns of spider alpha, beta and gamma diversities in agro-ecosystems, yet the strongest effects are of those drivers that match in scale.

Foraging efficiency and size matching in a plant-pollinator community: the importance of sugar content and tongue length	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Asteraceae; foraging efficiency; handling time; interaction probability; nectar tube depth; optimal foraging; pollination; proboscis length; size matching	ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; BUMBLE-BEES; ASYMMETRIC SPECIALIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONSTRAINTS; FLOWER VISITATION; NECTAR; MORPHOLOGY; LONG; PROBOSCIS; EVOLUTION	A long-standing question in ecology is how species interactions are structured within communities. Although evolutionary theory predicts close size matching between floral nectar tube depth and pollinator proboscis length of interacting species, such size matching has seldom been shown and explained in multispecies assemblages. Here, we investigated the degree of size matching among Asteraceae and their pollinators and its relationship with foraging efficiency. The majority of pollinators, especially Hymenoptera, choose plant species on which they had high foraging efficiencies. When proboscides were shorter than nectar tubes, foraging efficiency rapidly decreased because of increased handling time. When proboscides were longer than nectar tubes, a decreased nectar reward rather than an increased handling time made shallow flowers more inefficient to visit. Altogether, this led to close size matching. Overall, our results show the importance of nectar reward and handling time as drivers of plant-pollinator network structure.	[Klumpers, Saskia G.

Low siring success of females with an acquired male function illustrates the legacy of sexual dimorphism in constraining the breakdown of dioecy	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Dioecy; functional hermaphroditism; gain curves; inflorescence architecture; Mercurialis annua; monoecy; sex allocation; sexual dimorphism	ANDRODIOECIOUS MERCURIALIS-ANNUA; WIND-POLLINATED HERB; POLLEN LIMITATION; REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; SELF-FERTILIZATION; BREEDING SYSTEMS; EVOLUTION; MAINTENANCE	Dioecy has often broken down in flowering plants, yielding functional hermaphroditism. We reasoned that evolutionary transitions from dioecy to functional hermaphroditism must overcome an inertia of sexual dimorphism, because modified males or females will express the opposite sexual function for which their phenotypes have been optimised. We tested this prediction by assessing the siring success of monoecious individuals of the plant Mercurialis annua with an acquired male function but that are phenotypically still female-like. We found that pollen dispersed by female-like monoecious individuals was similar to 1/3 poorer at siring outcrossed offspring than pollen from monoecious individuals with an alternative male-like inflorescence. We conclude that whereas dioecy might evolve from functional hermaphroditism by conferring upon individuals certain benefits of sexual specialisation, reversion from a strategy of separate sexes to one of combined sexes must overcome constraints imposed by the advantages of sexual dimorphism. The breakdown of dioecy must therefore often be limited to situations in which outcrossing cannot be maintained and where selection favours a capacity for inbreeding by functional hermaphrodites.

Prediction of forest aboveground net primary production from high-resolution vertical leaf-area profiles	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Canopy structure; forest production; leaf area index; lidar; tropical forest	TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; WAVE-FORM LIDAR; LA-SELVA; CANOPY STRUCTURE; INCREASING CO2; BIOMASS; DYNAMICS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHOSPHORUS; GROWTH	Temperature and precipitation explain about half the variation in aboveground net primary production (ANPP) among tropical forest sites, but determinants of remaining variation are poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that the amount of leaf area, and its vertical arrangement, predicts ANPP when other variables are held constant. Using measurements from airborne lidar in a lowland Neotropical rain forest, we quantify vertical leaf-area profiles and develop models of ANPP driven by leaf area and other measurements of forest structure. Vertical leaf-area profiles predict 38% of the variation among plots. This number is 4.5 times greater than models using total leaf area (disregarding vertical arrangement) and 2.1 times greater than models using canopy height alone. Furthermore, ANPP predictions from vertical leaf-area profiles were less biased than alternate metrics. Variation in ANPP not attributable to temperature or precipitation can be predicted by the vertical distribution of leaf area in this system.	[Cushman, K.

Climate variation influences host specificity in avian malaria parasites	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						avian malaria; climate change; disease ecology; disease emergence; host shifting; host specificity; infectious disease; niche specialisation; parasite specialisation; vector borne disease	WEST-NILE-VIRUS; OF-ALL-TRADES; HAEMOSPORIDIAN PARASITES; COMMUNITY SIMILARITY; GLOBAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; DIVERSIFICATION; SEASONALITY; PLASMODIUM; PHYLOGENY	Parasites with low host specificity (e.g. infecting a large diversity of host species) are of special interest in disease ecology, as they are likely more capable of circumventing ecological or evolutionary barriers to infect new hosts than are specialist parasites. Yet for many parasites, host specificity is not fixed and can vary in response to environmental conditions. Using data on host associations for avian malaria parasites (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida), we develop a hierarchical model that quantifies this environmental dependency by partitioning host specificity variation into region- and parasite-level effects. Parasites were generally phylogenetic host specialists, infecting phylogenetically clustered subsets of available avian hosts. However, the magnitude of this specialisation varied biogeographically, with parasites exhibiting higher host specificity in regions with more pronounced rainfall seasonality and wetter dry seasons. Recognising the environmental dependency of parasite specialisation can provide useful leverage for improving predictions of infection risk in response to global climate change.

Micro-topographic roughness analysis (MTRA) highlights minimally eroded terrain in a landscape severely impacted by historic agriculture	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Microtopography; Lidar; Erosion; Surface roughness; Critical zone; Old-field succession; Land cover; Gullying; Land use history	FOREST CANOPY; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; SOUTH-CAROLINA; SOIL; SUCCESSION; ECOSYSTEM; DEEP	The 190 km(2) Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory in the Piedmont region of South Carolina, USA lies in an ancient, highly weathered landscape transformed by historic agricultural erosion. Following the conversion of largely hardwood forests to cultivated fields and pastures for similar to 200 years, excess runoff from fields led to extreme sheet, rill, and gully erosion across the landscape. Roads, terraces, and a variety of other human disturbances have increased the landscapes surface roughness. By the 1950s, cultivation-based agriculture was largely abandoned across most of the Southern Piedmont due to soil erosion, declining agricultural productivity, and shifting agricultural markets. Secondary forests, dominated by loblolly and shortleaf pines, have since regrown on much of the landscape, including the 1500 km(2) Sumter National Forest, which was purchased from farmers and private land owners in the 1930s. Although this landscape was intensively farmed for approximately 150 years, there are a few hardwood forest stands and even entire small watersheds that have never been plowed and degraded by farming. Such relatively old hardwood stands and watersheds comprise relic landforms whose soils, regoliths, and vegetation are of interest to hydrologists, environmental historians, biogeochemists, geomorphologists, geologists, pedologists, and others interested in understanding the legacy of land-use history in this severely altered environment. In this work we champion the need for high-resolution terrain mapping and demonstrate how Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation model (DEM) data and microtopographic terrain roughness analyses (MTRA) can be used to infer land use history and management. This is accomplished by analyzing fine scale variation in terrain slope across the 1190 km(2) CCZO using data derived from three independent and overlapping LiDAR datasets at varying spatial resolutions. Terrain slope variability MTRA is further compared to three other methods of capturing and quantifying fine-scale surface roughness. We lastly demonstrate how these analyses can be employed in concert with historic aerial photography from the 1930's, contemporary Landsat remote sensing data, and ecological field data to identify reference relic landforms: hardwood stands, hillslopes, and small watersheds that have experienced minimal anthropogenic erosion for study and conservation.

Associations between endocrine disrupting chemicals and equine metabolic syndrome phenotypes	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Equine; Metabolic syndrome; Environment	PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; SERUM CONCENTRATIONS; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; NATIONAL-HEALTH; CALUX BIOASSAY; BODY CONDITION; DIOXIN; EXPOSURE; POPULATION; OBESITY	Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS) is characterized by abnormalities in insulin regulation, increased adiposity and laminitis, and has several similarities to human metabolic syndrome. A large amount of environmental variability in the EMS phenotype is not explained by commonly measured factors (diet, exercise, and season), suggesting that other environmental factors play a role in EMS development. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are associated with metabolic syndrome and other endocrine abnormalities in humans. This led us to hypothesize that EDCs are detectable in horse plasma and play a role in the pathophysiology of EMS. EDCs acting through the aryl hydrocarbon and estrogen receptors, were measured in plasma of 301 horses from 32 farms. The median (range) TEQ (2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent) and EEQ (17 beta-estradiol equivalent) were 19.29 pg/g (0.59-536.36) and 10.50 pg/ml (4.35 -15000.00), respectively. TEQ was negatively associated with plasma fat extracted and batch analyzed. EEQ was positively associated with pregnancy and batch analyzed, and negatively associated with being male and superfund score <= 100 miles of the farm. Of particular interest, serum glucose and insulin, glucose and insulin post oral sugar challenge, and leptin concentrations were associated with EEQ and serum triglyceride concentration was associated with TEQ Overall, we demonstrated that EDCs are present in the plasma of horses and may explain some of the environmental variability in measured EMS phenotypes. This is the first example of EDCs being associated with clinical disease phenotype components in domestic animals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Durward-Akhurst, S. A.; Schultz, N.

Accounting for artificial light impact on bat activity for a biodiversity-friendly urban planning	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Land management; Light pollution; Urbanization; Outdoor lighting; Landscape ecology; Pipistrellus pipistrellus	FORAGING HABITATS; DARK SIDE; POLLUTION; URBANIZATION; SCIENCE	Light pollution constitutes a major threat to biodiversity by decreasing habitat quality and landscape connectivity for nocturnal species. While there is an increasing consideration of biodiversity in urban management policies, the impact of artificial light is poorly accounted for. This is in a large part due to the lack of quantitative information and relevant guidelines to limit its negative effects. Here we compared the potential of two sources of information on light pollution, remote sensing (nocturnal picture taken from the International Space Station ISS) and ground-based (location of streetlights) data, to measure its impact on bats. Our aims were to (i) evaluate how light pollution affected Pipistrellus pipistrellus activity at the city scale, (ii) determine which source of information was the most relevant to measure light pollution's effect and (iii) define a reproducible methodology applicable in land management to account for biodiversity in lighting planning. We used citizen science data to model the activity of P. pipistrellus, a species considered light tolerant, within three cities of France while accounting for artificial light through a variable based on either source of information. We showed that at the city scale, P. pipistrellus activity is negatively impacted by light pollution irrespective of the light variable used. This detrimental effect was better described by variables based on ISS pictures than on streetlights location. Our methodology can be easily reproduced and used in urban planning to help take the impact of light pollution into consideration and promote a biodiversity-friendly management of artificial light.

As pollinating insects such as butterflies are particularly susceptible to urbanization, it is important to pinpoint the factors that could enhance their diversity in the urban areas in order to design adequate management and conservation actions. Our study aims to investigate the influence of land cover and local habitat characteristics on the butterfly diversity patterns and community structure in a densely built city in the eastern Mediterranean region. We carried out butterfly surveys (line transects) in 45 randomly selected sites, distributed along an urbanization gradient. In each site, we assessed the surrounding landscape by measuring the land cover in a 200-m buffer zone, and the local habitat by estimating the available plant resources along each transect. Overall, 1805 individuals belonging to 41 butterfly species were recorded. Land cover was found to have the strongest influence on butterfly species richness, abundance and community structure. Although plant resources were sufficiently available within the whole study area, the butterfly community was significantly poorer in the more urbanized areas, indicating the potential role of habitat fragmentation and patch isolation. In contrast, butterfly diversity was significantly higher in the peri-urban area, underlying its conservation value for butterflies in the urban landscape. We attribute these findings to the degradation of the more urbanized areas due to long-term inadequate planning and the disorganized expansion of the city.

However, information on growth and ecosystem services of urban trees under changed climate conditions are rare for most species. This study investigated the intra-annual growth patterns of two common but physiologically contrasting urban tree species: small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Although meteorological variables at the study site in the outer city center of Munich, Germany for the year 2016 were similar to the long-term average climate (1961-1990) different growth patterns were found. This was mainly influenced by species characteristics (water use efficiency, wood anatomy) leading to different transpiration rates and reaction patterns to drought stress. Moreover, species' drought reactions compared to past years were analyzed in detail with a retrospective dendrochronological approach. Distinct species patterns were identified, highlighting the greater drought tolerance and recovery of R. pseudoacacia compared to T. cordata. These results show that under a drier and warmer climate T. cordata can provide more canopy air cooling for short periods of time due to high transpiration, albeit this is at the expense of great water demands and following growth declines under water shortage. Contrary, R. pseudoacacia proved to be a more suitable and adapted species at sites with less water availability due to better water use efficiency, even at the cost of low canopy transpiration though higher soil moisture and latent heat exchange from the soil.

The role of fire on wolf distribution and breeding-site selection: Insights from a generalist carnivore occurring in a fire-prone landscape	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Fire-history; Habitat disturbance; Wolf breeding; Wolf persistence; Habitat selection; Iberian wolf	CANIS-LUPUS; GRAY WOLF; RENDEZVOUS SITES; HABITAT USE; PORTUGAL; WOLVES; FOREST; NORTH; DEN; ABUNDANCE	Wildfires are a main driver of habitat disturbance, influencing landscape structure and resource availability. Large carnivores are expected to experience strong effects as recently burned areas influence prey availability and suitable conditions for refuge and breeding. However, there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding the interplay between fire and landscape attributes affecting large carnivore occurrence. In this work, we aim to assess the effects of fire in relation to human density, elevation, and land cover in determining wolf (Canis lupus) occurrence at two spatial scales. A regional scale considering temporal shifts in wolf distribution at country level (Portugal) and a local scale considering breeding-site selection and reuse from 11 packs. We hypothesized that fire disturbance in a human-dominated landscape is a significant factor influencing wolf occurrence. Our results showed that wolves persisted in areas with higher altitudes, lower forest cover and intensive fire regimes. Breeding-sites were located at higher altitudes, in land covers less prone to human activity and disturbance, but subjected to a higher burnt extent, although with no significant association between breeding-site displacement and fire occurrence. The multiple-scale approach demonstrated wolves' remarkable resilience to fire, persisting and breeding in a human-dominated landscape under intensive fire regimes. However, burnt landscapes may induce higher exposure to human disturbance and persecution due to limited refuge conditions. This study provides valuable insights on the role of fire in the persistence and habitat selection of a large carnivore, an issue with relevant management implications in fire-prone landscapes, predicted to become a common scenario worldwide.

Whether a long-term exposure to ambient O-3 is associated with any skin aging traits, has remained unclear. We addressed this question in two elderly German cohorts: the SALIA study (806 women aged 66-79 years), and the BASE-II study (1207 men and women aged 60-84 years). Five-year mean residential exposure to O-3 was modeled as the number of days with maximum daily 8-h mean O-3 concentrations >= 120 mu g/m(3) per year in the wider neighborhood (5-digit postcode) of a participant's residence. Extrinsic (environmentally induced) skin aging traits-coarse wrinkles and pigment spots (lentigines) on the face -were assessed by means of SCINEXA (TM), a validated visual score previously shown to be well suited to measure extrinsic facial skin aging in cohort studies. We observed positive associations of O-3 exceedances with coarse wrinkles in the face, but not with pigment spots. These associations were present in each cohort as well as in the combined sample of both cohorts. They were independent of chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure as the most obvious confounder, and also of co-pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Thus, long-term exposure to elevated concentrations of tropospheric O-3 appears to contribute to skin aging.

Information on human fetal exposure to PFASs is currently limited to one report on first trimester samples. There is no data available on PFAS concentrations in fetal organs throughout all three trimesters of pregnancy. Methods: We measured the concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) in human embryos and fetuses with corresponding placentas and maternal serum samples derived from elective pregnancy terminations and cases of intrauterine fetal death. A total of 78 embryos and fetuses aged 7-42 gestational weeks were included and a total of 225 fetal organs covering liver, lung, heart, central nervous system (CNS), and adipose tissue were analyzed, together with 71 placentas and 63 maternal serum samples. PFAS concentrations were assayed by liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Results: All evaluated PFASs were detected and quantified in maternal sera, placentas and embryos/fetuses. In maternal serum samples, PFOS was detected in highest concentrations, followed by PFOA> PFNA> PFDA= PFUnA= PFHxS. Similarly, PFOS was detected in highest concentrations in embryo/fetal tissues, followed by PFOA> PFNA= PFDA= PFUnA. PFHxS was detected in very few fetuses. In general, PFAS concentrations in embryo/fetal tissue (ng/g) were lower than maternal serum (ng/ml) but similar to placenta concentrations. The total PFAS burden (i.e. the sum of all PFASs) was highest in lung tissue in first trimester samples and in liver in second and third trimester samples. The burden was lowest in CNS samples irrespective of fetal age. The placenta: maternal serum ratios of PFOS, PFOA and PFNA increased across gestation suggesting bioaccumulation in the placenta. Further, we observed that the ratios were higher in pregnancies with male fetuses compared to female fetuses. Conclusions: Human fetuses were intrinsically exposed to a mixture of PFASs throughout gestation. The compounds were detected in all analyzed tissues, suggesting that PFASs reach and may affect many types of organs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PFASs pass the placenta and deposit to embryo and fetal tissues, calling for risk assessment of gestational exposures.

Study of the effects in these populations may illustrate human impacts that are difficult to assess in other locations with lower exposure to these compounds and more diverse pollutant influences. Objective: We aimed to identify the main maternal characteristics influencing on the accumulation of these compounds and the effects on the newborns in a highly exposed Arctic population (Chukotka, Russia). Methods: Organochlorine and organobromine compounds were analysed in maternal venous serum (n= 250). The study included data on residence, educational level, age, parity and body mass index (BMI) from selfreported questionnaires and measured anthropometric characteristics of newborns. Results: Concentrations of beta-hexachlorocyclohexanes, hexachlorobenzene, 4,4'-DDT and polychlorobiphenyls were high when compared with those generally found in adult populations later than year 2000. The polybromodiphenyl ethers were negligible. These POP concentrations were higher than in Alaska and Arctic Norway and similar to those in Canada. The Chukotka mothers living in inland areas showed significant lower concentrations than those living in the coast (p < 0.001) except for 4,4'-DDT. The population from the Chukotsky District, a specific coastal area, showed the highest concentrations. Residence was therefore a main concentration determinant (p < 0.001) followed by maternal age, and in some cases parity and BMI (p < 0.05). 4,4'-DDT showed an association with the anthropometric characteristics of the newborns (p < 0.05). Mothers with higher 4,4'-DDT concentrations had longer gestational ages and gave birth to infants with higher weight and length. Conclusions: The maternal accumulation patterns of POPs were mainly related with residence. Most of these compounds were found in higher concentration in women living at coastal areas except 4,4'-DDE and 4,4'-DDT which were of inland origin. This last pesticide was the pollutant showing positive associations with gestational age and newborn's weight and length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting statistically significant associations between maternal 4,4'-DDT exposure and anthropometric characteristics of the newborns.
